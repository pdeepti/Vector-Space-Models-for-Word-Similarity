even if you only have a blow-up mattress on offer , there 's a website out there waiting to market it . millions of people love to travel , but few of us really want to be a tourist – it has almost become something of a bad word , synonymous for not really getting a genuine impression of a new place .
and the most fundamental thing that will set you apart from the locals is your accommodation – unless of course you have the chance stay in someone ’ s private home established in london one year ago , ' onefinestay ' is a five-star service that sees private homestays as an antidote to dull and soulless hotel rooms .
the company currently has more than 20 london properties on its website .
" people are getting increasingly bored of or frustrated by the generic experience of being a tourist , " said ceo and co-founder greg marsh .
the answer , according to marsh , is the ' unhotel ' : a way to stay in someone 's home while they are out of town for a couple of days and live like a local while you are doing it .
easy money marsh says the tens of thousands of london apartments that stand empty for weeks and sometimes even months each year represent a great business opportunity .
" it sounds glib , but it 's free money , " marsh said , adding that his company offers homeowners a range of services in addition to simply marketing properties over the internet .

tina steiner recently put her two-bedroom property in north london up for rent with onefinestay .
as someone who travels often , but at short notice , she says the company 's business model suits her lifestyle well .
" i would have never considered renting out my flat , but this really fulfilled my need of doing it in a five star way , " steiner said .
no space too small sharing out your home need not be a five star affair , however .
in fact you do n't even have to vacate the property to host guests .
web-based company crashpadder was founded by stephen rapoport in 2008 and allows users to rent out anything from a spare room to a few square meters of living room floor . "
" we were described recently as ' couch surfing for grown-ups , " ' rapoport said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crashpadder offers everything from vacant apartments to inflatable mattresses on a floor " it 's people who used to backpack - they do n't mind shared rooms or accommodation , they still want to travel , and they still want to get a genuine local experience when they visit a new place .

rapoport says most guests stay with a local families and enjoy a comfort level to that offered by a decent hotel , but at a much lower cost .
crashpadder hosts are at liberty to decide how much they 'd like to charge per night .
prices can range from 3 pounds per night for a sofa-bed in south cornwall to 200 pounds for a whole apartment in central london .
the average rate for a double room in london is about 35 pounds .
international appeal the crashpadder website has about 15,000 users , with hosts in 75 cities including brisbane , new york and cape town .
both hosts and ' crashers ' must create profiles in order to use the site and provide information about themselves and their interests .
hosts reserve the right to refuse anyone they do n't want , while crashers are invited to leave feedback after their stay .
rapoport says he would like to see a crashpadder presence in tens of thousands of locations around the world , although he remains pragmatic about its appeal .
" crashpadder is not for everyone and it 's not for everyone all of the time ; it 's probably not for the vast majority of people , " he said .
" but what i 'd like to see is it being used by that small pocket of travelers ; those business travelers that value human interaction , the travelers who want to experience everything that a city has to offer . "
business and pleasure both onefinestay and crashpadder have charted a 50 percent spread between tourists and business travelers .
while lone travelers might favor the more social aspects of crashpadder , families have shown the most interest in one fine stay .

change marsh believes that services like onefinestay are indicative of a wider shift in attitudes towards travel and property .
" i do think there is something in the air about being perhaps more liberal with what we own and more open-minded about sharing things " , he said .
in the current financial climate , services like these appear to be a welcome additional source of income for property owners .
" i think the people who use crashpadder – they do want the extra income , but they also want the social interaction , it 's just so enjoyable , " rapoport said .

in order to secure its national interests , moscow must manage a tricky balancing act between the west and the east . flush with cash from booming oil and gas exports , moscow unilaterally pursued russian national interests during vladimir putin 's tenure as president .
in the process , russia 's relationship with the west deteriorated to a historic low point . but then the economic crisis hit .
energy prices collapsed and russia 's rapid growth ground to a halt . after dmitry medvedev assumed the presidency in 2008 , moscow sought to jumpstart the slumping russian economy through so-called " modernization alliances " with the us and the eu .
yet at the same time , the oil-rich country began consolidating its " strategic partnership " with an oil-hungry china .
russia wanted to pursue its national interests in economic modernization and growth and knew that it needed both the west and china in these endeavors . love-hate relationship moscow 's relationship with the west has a long history of ambivalence .
culturally tied to europe , yet also influenced by asia , russia sits awkwardly between two worlds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's relationship with the west deteriorated as nato expanded eastward " the russians do see themselves more as a part of western civilization , " andrew kuchins , director of the russia and eurasia program at the center for strategic and international studies , told deutsche welle .
" they are eurasian , a power bordering europe as well as the pacific ocean .
but the bulk of the population is in european russia . " with the collapse of the soviet union , moscow seemed to have taken a step toward definitively joining the west .
president boris yeltsin implemented a series of radical reforms designed to put russia 's political and economic system in synch with its former cold war enemies . but as the european union and nato rapidly expanded into the former eastern bloc , moscow felt marginalized in its own " near abroad . "
then vladimir putin came to power .
buoyed by surging oil and gas exports , putin sought to stabilize russia domestically and reassert its influence in the former soviet states . the developments put the west and russia on a collision course .
in the summer of 2008 , they finally collided in the south caucasus .
russia fought a lightening-quick war against georgia , a former soviet republic that has increasingly looked westward .
in response to the conflict , nato severed cooperation with moscow .
but according to dmitri trenin , director of the carnegie moscow center , the west also played a key role in the dispute . " it takes everyone who 's involved to organize a better framework for relations , " trenin told deutsche welle .
" the western policy that included some countries into western institutions and left others such as russia , but also georgia and ukraine beyond the perimeter was very risky .
that policy is responsible for the russian-georgian war . " pushing the reset button power changed hands in moscow and washington in quick succession , bringing new leaders and a new outlook on russia 's relationship with the west .
us president barack obama and medvedev saw an opportunity to focus on cooperation instead of confrontation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and russia are now cooperating on common interests " president medvedev knows that the modernization of the economy and russian society can not be executed without cooperation with the west , " alexander rahr , director of the russia and eurasia program at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle . he said us president obama did n't want to pursue a policy of containment against russia . " he needs russia in the fight against international terrorism in afghanistan and iraq , and he needs russian support to stop iran 's nuclear weapons program , " rahr said . as russian and western interests align , both sides have hinted at moving beyond a quid-pro-quo relationship and bringing moscow into a deeper security partnership .
in the lead up to the nato summit later this month in lisbon , secretary general anders fogh rasmussen has pushed the idea of including russia in a missile defense shield that would stretch from vancouver to vladivostok . " what russia and other countries in europe and north america need to work toward is a euro-atlantic security community , " trenin said .
" we 're not talking about alliances .
we 're not talking about russia joining nato .
we 're not talking about simply more of the same upgrades of russia 's relations with nato .
what we should be working toward is a state of play in the euro-atlantic area where war would not be an instrument of policy . " eastern horizon but a euro-atlantic security community is not the only game in town .
russia is hedging its bets and forging a strategic partnership with china , as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's economic growth is both an opportunity and a concern for russia " china is second only to the us in terms of countries that weigh in on the russian strategic mind , " trenin said .
" it is immensely important . " china 's meteoric growth has made it the world 's largest energy consumer .
russia in turn is one of the world 's largest energy producers and is therefore well-positioned to fuel china 's economy . the first pipeline connecting russian oil fields and chinese refineries was completed last september .
it delivers oil from eastern siberia to northeastern china .
moscow and beijing are also working together within the shanghai cooperation organization , a loose security partnership designed to combat threats such as separatism , terrorism and extremism . on the international stage , russia and china share a similar worldview .
they both prioritize national sovereignty and the pursuit of national interests over liberal values , such as democracy and human rights .
yet like russia 's relationship with the west , its growing ties with china face challenges . " there has always been this certain degree of unease despite all the happy talk and positive rhetoric of russia and china , " kuchins said .
china 's rapid growth made the russians nervous , he said . " the impact of the -lrb- economic -rrb- crisis was sort of an acceleration of that trend , " kuchins said .
" it leads them to question just how much the growth of chinese power is good for russian interests . " independence or isolation ? as russia simultaneously pursues partnerships with the west and china , it also wants to maintain its status as an independent power .
moscow has constructed a network of institutions to keep the former soviet states within its sphere of influence .
the commonwealth of independent states , the collective security treaty organization and the eurasian economic community could act as pillars of eurasian integration . " the default russian position is that they would like to be this great superpower , " kuchins said .
" there would be the west , russia and china .
but the reality suggests that 's not looking to be the case .
that forces them to possibly make some harder decisions about just how far they want to push this so-called independent foreign policy . " russia needs the west for economic modernization , and china presents a lucrative energy market .
yet moving too far too fast in either direction , or striking out on an independent path , could lead to moscow 's isolation . as a eurasian power , russia has little choice but to strike a balance in its relations with the east and the west . " we have to prepare ourselves for the reality that russia would like to integrate one leg in europe and the other in asia , " rahr said .
" if not integration , then it would like to at least work closely with the states of europe and asia . " author : spencer kimball editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in order to secure its national interests , moscow must manage a tricky balancing act between the west and the east . flush with cash from booming oil and gas exports , moscow unilaterally pursued russian national interests during vladimir putin 's tenure as president .
in the process , russia 's relationship with the west deteriorated to a historic low point . but then the economic crisis hit .
energy prices collapsed and russia 's rapid growth ground to a halt . after dmitry medvedev assumed the presidency in 2008 , moscow sought to jumpstart the slumping russian economy through so-called " modernization alliances " with the us and the eu .
yet at the same time , the oil-rich country began consolidating its " strategic partnership " with an oil-hungry china .
russia wanted to pursue its national interests in economic modernization and growth and knew that it needed both the west and china in these endeavors . love-hate relationship moscow 's relationship with the west has a long history of ambivalence .
culturally tied to europe , yet also influenced by asia , russia sits awkwardly between two worlds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's relationship with the west deteriorated as nato expanded eastward " the russians do see themselves more as a part of western civilization , " andrew kuchins , director of the russia and eurasia program at the center for strategic and international studies , told deutsche welle .
" they are eurasian , a power bordering europe as well as the pacific ocean .
but the bulk of the population is in european russia . " with the collapse of the soviet union , moscow seemed to have taken a step toward definitively joining the west .
president boris yeltsin implemented a series of radical reforms designed to put russia 's political and economic system in synch with its former cold war enemies . but as the european union and nato rapidly expanded into the former eastern bloc , moscow felt marginalized in its own " near abroad . "
then vladimir putin came to power .
buoyed by surging oil and gas exports , putin sought to stabilize russia domestically and reassert its influence in the former soviet states . the developments put the west and russia on a collision course .
in the summer of 2008 , they finally collided in the south caucasus .
russia fought a lightening-quick war against georgia , a former soviet republic that has increasingly looked westward .
in response to the conflict , nato severed cooperation with moscow .
but according to dmitri trenin , director of the carnegie moscow center , the west also played a key role in the dispute . " it takes everyone who 's involved to organize a better framework for relations , " trenin told deutsche welle .
" the western policy that included some countries into western institutions and left others such as russia , but also georgia and ukraine beyond the perimeter was very risky .
that policy is responsible for the russian-georgian war . " pushing the reset button power changed hands in moscow and washington in quick succession , bringing new leaders and a new outlook on russia 's relationship with the west .
us president barack obama and medvedev saw an opportunity to focus on cooperation instead of confrontation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and russia are now cooperating on common interests " president medvedev knows that the modernization of the economy and russian society can not be executed without cooperation with the west , " alexander rahr , director of the russia and eurasia program at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle . he said us president obama did n't want to pursue a policy of containment against russia . " he needs russia in the fight against international terrorism in afghanistan and iraq , and he needs russian support to stop iran 's nuclear weapons program , " rahr said . as russian and western interests align , both sides have hinted at moving beyond a quid-pro-quo relationship and bringing moscow into a deeper security partnership .
in the lead up to the nato summit later this month in lisbon , secretary general anders fogh rasmussen has pushed the idea of including russia in a missile defense shield that would stretch from vancouver to vladivostok . " what russia and other countries in europe and north america need to work toward is a euro-atlantic security community , " trenin said .
" we 're not talking about alliances .
we 're not talking about russia joining nato .
we 're not talking about simply more of the same upgrades of russia 's relations with nato .

in order to secure its national interests , moscow must manage a tricky balancing act between the west and the east . flush with cash from booming oil and gas exports , moscow unilaterally pursued russian national interests during vladimir putin 's tenure as president .
in the process , russia 's relationship with the west deteriorated to a historic low point . but then the economic crisis hit .
energy prices collapsed and russia 's rapid growth ground to a halt . after dmitry medvedev assumed the presidency in 2008 , moscow sought to jumpstart the slumping russian economy through so-called " modernization alliances " with the us and the eu .
yet at the same time , the oil-rich country began consolidating its " strategic partnership " with an oil-hungry china .

" they are eurasian , a power bordering europe as well as the pacific ocean .
but the bulk of the population is in european russia . " with the collapse of the soviet union , moscow seemed to have taken a step toward definitively joining the west .
president boris yeltsin implemented a series of radical reforms designed to put russia 's political and economic system in synch with its former cold war enemies . but as the european union and nato rapidly expanded into the former eastern bloc , moscow felt marginalized in its own " near abroad . "
then vladimir putin came to power .
buoyed by surging oil and gas exports , putin sought to stabilize russia domestically and reassert its influence in the former soviet states . the developments put the west and russia on a collision course .
in the summer of 2008 , they finally collided in the south caucasus .
russia fought a lightening-quick war against georgia , a former soviet republic that has increasingly looked westward .
in response to the conflict , nato severed cooperation with moscow .

" the western policy that included some countries into western institutions and left others such as russia , but also georgia and ukraine beyond the perimeter was very risky .
that policy is responsible for the russian-georgian war . " pushing the reset button power changed hands in moscow and washington in quick succession , bringing new leaders and a new outlook on russia 's relationship with the west .

" he needs russia in the fight against international terrorism in afghanistan and iraq , and he needs russian support to stop iran 's nuclear weapons program , " rahr said . as russian and western interests align , both sides have hinted at moving beyond a quid-pro-quo relationship and bringing moscow into a deeper security partnership .
in the lead up to the nato summit later this month in lisbon , secretary general anders fogh rasmussen has pushed the idea of including russia in a missile defense shield that would stretch from vancouver to vladivostok . " what russia and other countries in europe and north america need to work toward is a euro-atlantic security community , " trenin said .
" we 're not talking about alliances .
we 're not talking about russia joining nato .
we 're not talking about simply more of the same upgrades of russia 's relations with nato .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de tourism -pipe- 15.11.2010 british start-ups set their sights on the growing homestay market großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the market for homestay accommodation is growing more and more people are making money out of their homes by offering them to tourists for the night .
even if you only have a blow-up mattress on offer , there 's a website out there waiting to market it . millions of people love to travel , but few of us really want to be a tourist – it has almost become something of a bad word , synonymous for not really getting a genuine impression of a new place .
and the most fundamental thing that will set you apart from the locals is your accommodation – unless of course you have the chance stay in someone ’ s private home established in london one year ago , ' onefinestay ' is a five-star service that sees private homestays as an antidote to dull and soulless hotel rooms .
the company currently has more than 20 london properties on its website .
" people are getting increasingly bored of or frustrated by the generic experience of being a tourist , " said ceo and co-founder greg marsh .
the answer , according to marsh , is the ' unhotel ' : a way to stay in someone 's home while they are out of town for a couple of days and live like a local while you are doing it .
easy money marsh says the tens of thousands of london apartments that stand empty for weeks and sometimes even months each year represent a great business opportunity .
" it sounds glib , but it 's free money , " marsh said , adding that his company offers homeowners a range of services in addition to simply marketing properties over the internet .
" someone else takes care of all the hassle and the complexity of making your home available to guests over short periods ; all you have to do is tell us when you are out , " he said .
" with something like -lrb- independent -rrb- short letting you are obliged to spend a minimum of three months away from home and you are obliged to move your things into storage and you have to take care of the insurance risk yourself . "
bildunterschrift : onefinestay specializes in high-end apartment rentals hint of luxury the cost of staying at a onefinestay property is calculated according to its long let rental value , which is the amount hosts can expect to receive .
guests pay extra for the services the company provides , including the provision of an iphone loaded with local tips for restaurants and sightseeing , as well as luxury linen and bath towels .
tina steiner recently put her two-bedroom property in north london up for rent with onefinestay .
as someone who travels often , but at short notice , she says the company 's business model suits her lifestyle well .
" i would have never considered renting out my flat , but this really fulfilled my need of doing it in a five star way , " steiner said .
no space too small sharing out your home need not be a five star affair , however .
in fact you do n't even have to vacate the property to host guests .
web-based company crashpadder was founded by stephen rapoport in 2008 and allows users to rent out anything from a spare room to a few square meters of living room floor . "
" we were described recently as ' couch surfing for grown-ups , " ' rapoport said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crashpadder offers everything from vacant apartments to inflatable mattresses on a floor " it 's people who used to backpack - they do n't mind shared rooms or accommodation , they still want to travel , and they still want to get a genuine local experience when they visit a new place .
but they do n't want the discomfort of a hostel . "
rapoport says most guests stay with a local families and enjoy a comfort level to that offered by a decent hotel , but at a much lower cost .
crashpadder hosts are at liberty to decide how much they 'd like to charge per night .
prices can range from 3 pounds per night for a sofa-bed in south cornwall to 200 pounds for a whole apartment in central london .
the average rate for a double room in london is about 35 pounds .
international appeal the crashpadder website has about 15,000 users , with hosts in 75 cities including brisbane , new york and cape town .
both hosts and ' crashers ' must create profiles in order to use the site and provide information about themselves and their interests .
hosts reserve the right to refuse anyone they do n't want , while crashers are invited to leave feedback after their stay .
rapoport says he would like to see a crashpadder presence in tens of thousands of locations around the world , although he remains pragmatic about its appeal .
" crashpadder is not for everyone and it 's not for everyone all of the time ; it 's probably not for the vast majority of people , " he said .
" but what i 'd like to see is it being used by that small pocket of travelers ; those business travelers that value human interaction , the travelers who want to experience everything that a city has to offer . "
business and pleasure both onefinestay and crashpadder have charted a 50 percent spread between tourists and business travelers .
while lone travelers might favor the more social aspects of crashpadder , families have shown the most interest in one fine stay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homestays attract travelers who want to avoid mainstream hotels " getting three hotel rooms is very expensive and pretty grim , " marsh said .
" with a house , you get the kitchen living area and lots of bedrooms so the response we have had from families has been overwhelming . "
change marsh believes that services like onefinestay are indicative of a wider shift in attitudes towards travel and property .
" i do think there is something in the air about being perhaps more liberal with what we own and more open-minded about sharing things " , he said .
in the current financial climate , services like these appear to be a welcome additional source of income for property owners .
" i think the people who use crashpadder – they do want the extra income , but they also want the social interaction , it 's just so enjoyable , " rapoport said .
" it 's the most fun one can have making money i think ! "

in order to secure its national interests , moscow must manage a tricky balancing act between the west and the east . flush with cash from booming oil and gas exports , moscow unilaterally pursued russian national interests during vladimir putin 's tenure as president .
in the process , russia 's relationship with the west deteriorated to a historic low point . but then the economic crisis hit .
energy prices collapsed and russia 's rapid growth ground to a halt . after dmitry medvedev assumed the presidency in 2008 , moscow sought to jumpstart the slumping russian economy through so-called " modernization alliances " with the us and the eu .
yet at the same time , the oil-rich country began consolidating its " strategic partnership " with an oil-hungry china .
russia wanted to pursue its national interests in economic modernization and growth and knew that it needed both the west and china in these endeavors . love-hate relationship moscow 's relationship with the west has a long history of ambivalence .
culturally tied to europe , yet also influenced by asia , russia sits awkwardly between two worlds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's relationship with the west deteriorated as nato expanded eastward " the russians do see themselves more as a part of western civilization , " andrew kuchins , director of the russia and eurasia program at the center for strategic and international studies , told deutsche welle .
" they are eurasian , a power bordering europe as well as the pacific ocean .
but the bulk of the population is in european russia . " with the collapse of the soviet union , moscow seemed to have taken a step toward definitively joining the west .
president boris yeltsin implemented a series of radical reforms designed to put russia 's political and economic system in synch with its former cold war enemies . but as the european union and nato rapidly expanded into the former eastern bloc , moscow felt marginalized in its own " near abroad . "
then vladimir putin came to power .
buoyed by surging oil and gas exports , putin sought to stabilize russia domestically and reassert its influence in the former soviet states . the developments put the west and russia on a collision course .
in the summer of 2008 , they finally collided in the south caucasus .
russia fought a lightening-quick war against georgia , a former soviet republic that has increasingly looked westward .
in response to the conflict , nato severed cooperation with moscow .
but according to dmitri trenin , director of the carnegie moscow center , the west also played a key role in the dispute . " it takes everyone who 's involved to organize a better framework for relations , " trenin told deutsche welle .
" the western policy that included some countries into western institutions and left others such as russia , but also georgia and ukraine beyond the perimeter was very risky .
that policy is responsible for the russian-georgian war . " pushing the reset button power changed hands in moscow and washington in quick succession , bringing new leaders and a new outlook on russia 's relationship with the west .
us president barack obama and medvedev saw an opportunity to focus on cooperation instead of confrontation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and russia are now cooperating on common interests " president medvedev knows that the modernization of the economy and russian society can not be executed without cooperation with the west , " alexander rahr , director of the russia and eurasia program at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle . he said us president obama did n't want to pursue a policy of containment against russia . " he needs russia in the fight against international terrorism in afghanistan and iraq , and he needs russian support to stop iran 's nuclear weapons program , " rahr said . as russian and western interests align , both sides have hinted at moving beyond a quid-pro-quo relationship and bringing moscow into a deeper security partnership .
in the lead up to the nato summit later this month in lisbon , secretary general anders fogh rasmussen has pushed the idea of including russia in a missile defense shield that would stretch from vancouver to vladivostok . " what russia and other countries in europe and north america need to work toward is a euro-atlantic security community , " trenin said .
" we 're not talking about alliances .
we 're not talking about russia joining nato .
we 're not talking about simply more of the same upgrades of russia 's relations with nato .
what we should be working toward is a state of play in the euro-atlantic area where war would not be an instrument of policy . " eastern horizon but a euro-atlantic security community is not the only game in town .
russia is hedging its bets and forging a strategic partnership with china , as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's economic growth is both an opportunity and a concern for russia " china is second only to the us in terms of countries that weigh in on the russian strategic mind , " trenin said .
" it is immensely important . " china 's meteoric growth has made it the world 's largest energy consumer .
russia in turn is one of the world 's largest energy producers and is therefore well-positioned to fuel china 's economy . the first pipeline connecting russian oil fields and chinese refineries was completed last september .
it delivers oil from eastern siberia to northeastern china .
moscow and beijing are also working together within the shanghai cooperation organization , a loose security partnership designed to combat threats such as separatism , terrorism and extremism . on the international stage , russia and china share a similar worldview .
they both prioritize national sovereignty and the pursuit of national interests over liberal values , such as democracy and human rights .
yet like russia 's relationship with the west , its growing ties with china face challenges . " there has always been this certain degree of unease despite all the happy talk and positive rhetoric of russia and china , " kuchins said .
china 's rapid growth made the russians nervous , he said . " the impact of the -lrb- economic -rrb- crisis was sort of an acceleration of that trend , " kuchins said .
" it leads them to question just how much the growth of chinese power is good for russian interests . " independence or isolation ? as russia simultaneously pursues partnerships with the west and china , it also wants to maintain its status as an independent power .
moscow has constructed a network of institutions to keep the former soviet states within its sphere of influence .
the commonwealth of independent states , the collective security treaty organization and the eurasian economic community could act as pillars of eurasian integration . " the default russian position is that they would like to be this great superpower , " kuchins said .
" there would be the west , russia and china .
but the reality suggests that 's not looking to be the case .
that forces them to possibly make some harder decisions about just how far they want to push this so-called independent foreign policy . " russia needs the west for economic modernization , and china presents a lucrative energy market .
yet moving too far too fast in either direction , or striking out on an independent path , could lead to moscow 's isolation . as a eurasian power , russia has little choice but to strike a balance in its relations with the east and the west . " we have to prepare ourselves for the reality that russia would like to integrate one leg in europe and the other in asia , " rahr said .
" if not integration , then it would like to at least work closely with the states of europe and asia . " author : spencer kimball editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

international appeal the crashpadder website has about 15,000 users , with hosts in 75 cities including brisbane , new york and cape town .
both hosts and ' crashers ' must create profiles in order to use the site and provide information about themselves and their interests .
hosts reserve the right to refuse anyone they do n't want , while crashers are invited to leave feedback after their stay .
rapoport says he would like to see a crashpadder presence in tens of thousands of locations around the world , although he remains pragmatic about its appeal .
" crashpadder is not for everyone and it 's not for everyone all of the time ; it 's probably not for the vast majority of people , " he said .
" but what i 'd like to see is it being used by that small pocket of travelers ; those business travelers that value human interaction , the travelers who want to experience everything that a city has to offer . "
business and pleasure both onefinestay and crashpadder have charted a 50 percent spread between tourists and business travelers .
while lone travelers might favor the more social aspects of crashpadder , families have shown the most interest in one fine stay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homestays attract travelers who want to avoid mainstream hotels " getting three hotel rooms is very expensive and pretty grim , " marsh said .
" with a house , you get the kitchen living area and lots of bedrooms so the response we have had from families has been overwhelming . "
change marsh believes that services like onefinestay are indicative of a wider shift in attitudes towards travel and property .
" i do think there is something in the air about being perhaps more liberal with what we own and more open-minded about sharing things " , he said .
in the current financial climate , services like these appear to be a welcome additional source of income for property owners .
" i think the people who use crashpadder – they do want the extra income , but they also want the social interaction , it 's just so enjoyable , " rapoport said .
" it 's the most fun one can have making money i think ! "

in order to secure its national interests , moscow must manage a tricky balancing act between the west and the east . flush with cash from booming oil and gas exports , moscow unilaterally pursued russian national interests during vladimir putin 's tenure as president .
in the process , russia 's relationship with the west deteriorated to a historic low point . but then the economic crisis hit .
energy prices collapsed and russia 's rapid growth ground to a halt . after dmitry medvedev assumed the presidency in 2008 , moscow sought to jumpstart the slumping russian economy through so-called " modernization alliances " with the us and the eu .
yet at the same time , the oil-rich country began consolidating its " strategic partnership " with an oil-hungry china .
russia wanted to pursue its national interests in economic modernization and growth and knew that it needed both the west and china in these endeavors . love-hate relationship moscow 's relationship with the west has a long history of ambivalence .
culturally tied to europe , yet also influenced by asia , russia sits awkwardly between two worlds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's relationship with the west deteriorated as nato expanded eastward " the russians do see themselves more as a part of western civilization , " andrew kuchins , director of the russia and eurasia program at the center for strategic and international studies , told deutsche welle .
" they are eurasian , a power bordering europe as well as the pacific ocean .
but the bulk of the population is in european russia . " with the collapse of the soviet union , moscow seemed to have taken a step toward definitively joining the west .
president boris yeltsin implemented a series of radical reforms designed to put russia 's political and economic system in synch with its former cold war enemies . but as the european union and nato rapidly expanded into the former eastern bloc , moscow felt marginalized in its own " near abroad . "
then vladimir putin came to power .
buoyed by surging oil and gas exports , putin sought to stabilize russia domestically and reassert its influence in the former soviet states . the developments put the west and russia on a collision course .
in the summer of 2008 , they finally collided in the south caucasus .
russia fought a lightening-quick war against georgia , a former soviet republic that has increasingly looked westward .
in response to the conflict , nato severed cooperation with moscow .
but according to dmitri trenin , director of the carnegie moscow center , the west also played a key role in the dispute . " it takes everyone who 's involved to organize a better framework for relations , " trenin told deutsche welle .
" the western policy that included some countries into western institutions and left others such as russia , but also georgia and ukraine beyond the perimeter was very risky .
that policy is responsible for the russian-georgian war . " pushing the reset button power changed hands in moscow and washington in quick succession , bringing new leaders and a new outlook on russia 's relationship with the west .
us president barack obama and medvedev saw an opportunity to focus on cooperation instead of confrontation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and russia are now cooperating on common interests " president medvedev knows that the modernization of the economy and russian society can not be executed without cooperation with the west , " alexander rahr , director of the russia and eurasia program at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle . he said us president obama did n't want to pursue a policy of containment against russia . " he needs russia in the fight against international terrorism in afghanistan and iraq , and he needs russian support to stop iran 's nuclear weapons program , " rahr said . as russian and western interests align , both sides have hinted at moving beyond a quid-pro-quo relationship and bringing moscow into a deeper security partnership .
in the lead up to the nato summit later this month in lisbon , secretary general anders fogh rasmussen has pushed the idea of including russia in a missile defense shield that would stretch from vancouver to vladivostok . " what russia and other countries in europe and north america need to work toward is a euro-atlantic security community , " trenin said .
" we 're not talking about alliances .
we 're not talking about russia joining nato .
we 're not talking about simply more of the same upgrades of russia 's relations with nato .
what we should be working toward is a state of play in the euro-atlantic area where war would not be an instrument of policy . " eastern horizon but a euro-atlantic security community is not the only game in town .
russia is hedging its bets and forging a strategic partnership with china , as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's economic growth is both an opportunity and a concern for russia " china is second only to the us in terms of countries that weigh in on the russian strategic mind , " trenin said .
" it is immensely important . " china 's meteoric growth has made it the world 's largest energy consumer .
russia in turn is one of the world 's largest energy producers and is therefore well-positioned to fuel china 's economy . the first pipeline connecting russian oil fields and chinese refineries was completed last september .
it delivers oil from eastern siberia to northeastern china .
moscow and beijing are also working together within the shanghai cooperation organization , a loose security partnership designed to combat threats such as separatism , terrorism and extremism . on the international stage , russia and china share a similar worldview .
they both prioritize national sovereignty and the pursuit of national interests over liberal values , such as democracy and human rights .
yet like russia 's relationship with the west , its growing ties with china face challenges . " there has always been this certain degree of unease despite all the happy talk and positive rhetoric of russia and china , " kuchins said .
china 's rapid growth made the russians nervous , he said . " the impact of the -lrb- economic -rrb- crisis was sort of an acceleration of that trend , " kuchins said .
" it leads them to question just how much the growth of chinese power is good for russian interests . " independence or isolation ? as russia simultaneously pursues partnerships with the west and china , it also wants to maintain its status as an independent power .
moscow has constructed a network of institutions to keep the former soviet states within its sphere of influence .
the commonwealth of independent states , the collective security treaty organization and the eurasian economic community could act as pillars of eurasian integration . " the default russian position is that they would like to be this great superpower , " kuchins said .
" there would be the west , russia and china .
but the reality suggests that 's not looking to be the case .
that forces them to possibly make some harder decisions about just how far they want to push this so-called independent foreign policy . " russia needs the west for economic modernization , and china presents a lucrative energy market .
yet moving too far too fast in either direction , or striking out on an independent path , could lead to moscow 's isolation . as a eurasian power , russia has little choice but to strike a balance in its relations with the east and the west . " we have to prepare ourselves for the reality that russia would like to integrate one leg in europe and the other in asia , " rahr said .
" if not integration , then it would like to at least work closely with the states of europe and asia . " author : spencer kimball editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" they are eurasian , a power bordering europe as well as the pacific ocean .
but the bulk of the population is in european russia . " with the collapse of the soviet union , moscow seemed to have taken a step toward definitively joining the west .
president boris yeltsin implemented a series of radical reforms designed to put russia 's political and economic system in synch with its former cold war enemies . but as the european union and nato rapidly expanded into the former eastern bloc , moscow felt marginalized in its own " near abroad . "
then vladimir putin came to power .
buoyed by surging oil and gas exports , putin sought to stabilize russia domestically and reassert its influence in the former soviet states . the developments put the west and russia on a collision course .
in the summer of 2008 , they finally collided in the south caucasus .
russia fought a lightening-quick war against georgia , a former soviet republic that has increasingly looked westward .
in response to the conflict , nato severed cooperation with moscow .
but according to dmitri trenin , director of the carnegie moscow center , the west also played a key role in the dispute . " it takes everyone who 's involved to organize a better framework for relations , " trenin told deutsche welle .
" the western policy that included some countries into western institutions and left others such as russia , but also georgia and ukraine beyond the perimeter was very risky .
that policy is responsible for the russian-georgian war . " pushing the reset button power changed hands in moscow and washington in quick succession , bringing new leaders and a new outlook on russia 's relationship with the west .
us president barack obama and medvedev saw an opportunity to focus on cooperation instead of confrontation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and russia are now cooperating on common interests " president medvedev knows that the modernization of the economy and russian society can not be executed without cooperation with the west , " alexander rahr , director of the russia and eurasia program at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle . he said us president obama did n't want to pursue a policy of containment against russia . " he needs russia in the fight against international terrorism in afghanistan and iraq , and he needs russian support to stop iran 's nuclear weapons program , " rahr said . as russian and western interests align , both sides have hinted at moving beyond a quid-pro-quo relationship and bringing moscow into a deeper security partnership .
in the lead up to the nato summit later this month in lisbon , secretary general anders fogh rasmussen has pushed the idea of including russia in a missile defense shield that would stretch from vancouver to vladivostok . " what russia and other countries in europe and north america need to work toward is a euro-atlantic security community , " trenin said .
" we 're not talking about alliances .
we 're not talking about russia joining nato .
we 're not talking about simply more of the same upgrades of russia 's relations with nato .
what we should be working toward is a state of play in the euro-atlantic area where war would not be an instrument of policy . " eastern horizon but a euro-atlantic security community is not the only game in town .
russia is hedging its bets and forging a strategic partnership with china , as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's economic growth is both an opportunity and a concern for russia " china is second only to the us in terms of countries that weigh in on the russian strategic mind , " trenin said .
" it is immensely important . " china 's meteoric growth has made it the world 's largest energy consumer .
russia in turn is one of the world 's largest energy producers and is therefore well-positioned to fuel china 's economy . the first pipeline connecting russian oil fields and chinese refineries was completed last september .
it delivers oil from eastern siberia to northeastern china .
moscow and beijing are also working together within the shanghai cooperation organization , a loose security partnership designed to combat threats such as separatism , terrorism and extremism . on the international stage , russia and china share a similar worldview .
they both prioritize national sovereignty and the pursuit of national interests over liberal values , such as democracy and human rights .
yet like russia 's relationship with the west , its growing ties with china face challenges . " there has always been this certain degree of unease despite all the happy talk and positive rhetoric of russia and china , " kuchins said .
china 's rapid growth made the russians nervous , he said . " the impact of the -lrb- economic -rrb- crisis was sort of an acceleration of that trend , " kuchins said .
" it leads them to question just how much the growth of chinese power is good for russian interests . " independence or isolation ? as russia simultaneously pursues partnerships with the west and china , it also wants to maintain its status as an independent power .
moscow has constructed a network of institutions to keep the former soviet states within its sphere of influence .
the commonwealth of independent states , the collective security treaty organization and the eurasian economic community could act as pillars of eurasian integration . " the default russian position is that they would like to be this great superpower , " kuchins said .
" there would be the west , russia and china .
but the reality suggests that 's not looking to be the case .
that forces them to possibly make some harder decisions about just how far they want to push this so-called independent foreign policy . " russia needs the west for economic modernization , and china presents a lucrative energy market .
yet moving too far too fast in either direction , or striking out on an independent path , could lead to moscow 's isolation . as a eurasian power , russia has little choice but to strike a balance in its relations with the east and the west . " we have to prepare ourselves for the reality that russia would like to integrate one leg in europe and the other in asia , " rahr said .
" if not integration , then it would like to at least work closely with the states of europe and asia . " author : spencer kimball editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the company currently has more than 20 london properties on its website .
" people are getting increasingly bored of or frustrated by the generic experience of being a tourist , " said ceo and co-founder greg marsh .
the answer , according to marsh , is the ' unhotel ' : a way to stay in someone 's home while they are out of town for a couple of days and live like a local while you are doing it .
easy money marsh says the tens of thousands of london apartments that stand empty for weeks and sometimes even months each year represent a great business opportunity .

web-based company crashpadder was founded by stephen rapoport in 2008 and allows users to rent out anything from a spare room to a few square meters of living room floor . "

crashpadder hosts are at liberty to decide how much they 'd like to charge per night .
prices can range from 3 pounds per night for a sofa-bed in south cornwall to 200 pounds for a whole apartment in central london .

rapoport says he would like to see a crashpadder presence in tens of thousands of locations around the world , although he remains pragmatic about its appeal .
" crashpadder is not for everyone and it 's not for everyone all of the time ; it 's probably not for the vast majority of people , " he said .

in order to secure its national interests , moscow must manage a tricky balancing act between the west and the east . flush with cash from booming oil and gas exports , moscow unilaterally pursued russian national interests during vladimir putin 's tenure as president .
in the process , russia 's relationship with the west deteriorated to a historic low point . but then the economic crisis hit .
energy prices collapsed and russia 's rapid growth ground to a halt . after dmitry medvedev assumed the presidency in 2008 , moscow sought to jumpstart the slumping russian economy through so-called " modernization alliances " with the us and the eu .
yet at the same time , the oil-rich country began consolidating its " strategic partnership " with an oil-hungry china .
russia wanted to pursue its national interests in economic modernization and growth and knew that it needed both the west and china in these endeavors . love-hate relationship moscow 's relationship with the west has a long history of ambivalence .
culturally tied to europe , yet also influenced by asia , russia sits awkwardly between two worlds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's relationship with the west deteriorated as nato expanded eastward " the russians do see themselves more as a part of western civilization , " andrew kuchins , director of the russia and eurasia program at the center for strategic and international studies , told deutsche welle .
" they are eurasian , a power bordering europe as well as the pacific ocean .
but the bulk of the population is in european russia . " with the collapse of the soviet union , moscow seemed to have taken a step toward definitively joining the west .
president boris yeltsin implemented a series of radical reforms designed to put russia 's political and economic system in synch with its former cold war enemies . but as the european union and nato rapidly expanded into the former eastern bloc , moscow felt marginalized in its own " near abroad . "
then vladimir putin came to power .
buoyed by surging oil and gas exports , putin sought to stabilize russia domestically and reassert its influence in the former soviet states . the developments put the west and russia on a collision course .
in the summer of 2008 , they finally collided in the south caucasus .
russia fought a lightening-quick war against georgia , a former soviet republic that has increasingly looked westward .
in response to the conflict , nato severed cooperation with moscow .
but according to dmitri trenin , director of the carnegie moscow center , the west also played a key role in the dispute . " it takes everyone who 's involved to organize a better framework for relations , " trenin told deutsche welle .
" the western policy that included some countries into western institutions and left others such as russia , but also georgia and ukraine beyond the perimeter was very risky .
that policy is responsible for the russian-georgian war . " pushing the reset button power changed hands in moscow and washington in quick succession , bringing new leaders and a new outlook on russia 's relationship with the west .
us president barack obama and medvedev saw an opportunity to focus on cooperation instead of confrontation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and russia are now cooperating on common interests " president medvedev knows that the modernization of the economy and russian society can not be executed without cooperation with the west , " alexander rahr , director of the russia and eurasia program at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle . he said us president obama did n't want to pursue a policy of containment against russia . " he needs russia in the fight against international terrorism in afghanistan and iraq , and he needs russian support to stop iran 's nuclear weapons program , " rahr said . as russian and western interests align , both sides have hinted at moving beyond a quid-pro-quo relationship and bringing moscow into a deeper security partnership .
in the lead up to the nato summit later this month in lisbon , secretary general anders fogh rasmussen has pushed the idea of including russia in a missile defense shield that would stretch from vancouver to vladivostok . " what russia and other countries in europe and north america need to work toward is a euro-atlantic security community , " trenin said .
" we 're not talking about alliances .
we 're not talking about russia joining nato .
we 're not talking about simply more of the same upgrades of russia 's relations with nato .
what we should be working toward is a state of play in the euro-atlantic area where war would not be an instrument of policy . " eastern horizon but a euro-atlantic security community is not the only game in town .
russia is hedging its bets and forging a strategic partnership with china , as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's economic growth is both an opportunity and a concern for russia " china is second only to the us in terms of countries that weigh in on the russian strategic mind , " trenin said .
" it is immensely important . " china 's meteoric growth has made it the world 's largest energy consumer .
russia in turn is one of the world 's largest energy producers and is therefore well-positioned to fuel china 's economy . the first pipeline connecting russian oil fields and chinese refineries was completed last september .
it delivers oil from eastern siberia to northeastern china .
moscow and beijing are also working together within the shanghai cooperation organization , a loose security partnership designed to combat threats such as separatism , terrorism and extremism . on the international stage , russia and china share a similar worldview .
they both prioritize national sovereignty and the pursuit of national interests over liberal values , such as democracy and human rights .
yet like russia 's relationship with the west , its growing ties with china face challenges . " there has always been this certain degree of unease despite all the happy talk and positive rhetoric of russia and china , " kuchins said .
china 's rapid growth made the russians nervous , he said . " the impact of the -lrb- economic -rrb- crisis was sort of an acceleration of that trend , " kuchins said .
" it leads them to question just how much the growth of chinese power is good for russian interests . " independence or isolation ? as russia simultaneously pursues partnerships with the west and china , it also wants to maintain its status as an independent power .
moscow has constructed a network of institutions to keep the former soviet states within its sphere of influence .
the commonwealth of independent states , the collective security treaty organization and the eurasian economic community could act as pillars of eurasian integration . " the default russian position is that they would like to be this great superpower , " kuchins said .
" there would be the west , russia and china .
but the reality suggests that 's not looking to be the case .
that forces them to possibly make some harder decisions about just how far they want to push this so-called independent foreign policy . " russia needs the west for economic modernization , and china presents a lucrative energy market .
yet moving too far too fast in either direction , or striking out on an independent path , could lead to moscow 's isolation . as a eurasian power , russia has little choice but to strike a balance in its relations with the east and the west . " we have to prepare ourselves for the reality that russia would like to integrate one leg in europe and the other in asia , " rahr said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 15.11.2010 ' romeo and juliet in yiddish ' explores jew-on-jew hostility , says director großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " romeo and juliet in yiddish " premieres in the uk on november 16 shakespeare has been translated into some 80 languages and was likely translated into yiddish in the late 19th century .
the film , ' romeo and juliet in yiddish , ' gives the world 's most famous romance a new twist . move over montagues and capulets : here come the chabads and the satmars .
the two rival sects of ultra-orthodox jews face off in a witty and bittersweet film titled " romeo and juliet in yiddish . "
a chance encounter between director eve annenberg and some members of new york 's hasidic community developed into a friendship and collaboration on the film .
it explores the rough-and-tumble existence of young jews who have left the ultra-orthodox world behind .
annenberg was fascinated by a younger generation speaking a language she thought was more or less consigned to the archives . " my grandmother who spoke yiddish and my mother who spoke yiddish are now both dead , and i wo n't hear it again .
and yet , the lure of speaking yiddish and being around people with this verbal vitality is so strong , " annenberg said .
bildunterschrift : the film deals with tension between orthodox and secular jews an introduction to the bard the director also has a role in the film .
she plays an emergency room nurse who 's trying to finish her master 's degree in germanic languages .
after she accepts her advisor 's suggestion to translate " romeo and juliet " into yiddish , she recruits some young native speakers to help her out .
" i think this is the first ' romeo and juliet ' where they wake up in the morning , and romeo reaches for his glasses .
that was an important detail to me .
i wanted it to be , well , jewish .
and yes , we read a lot ! "
annenberg said with a laugh .
but shakespeare has n't been on the reading list for many in the ultra-orthodox community , which has remained closed to much of the outside world .
the young translators in the film have never heard of the bard .
they also do n't have much sense of romantic love .
life meets art in the film , annenberg 's character makes her preference for the secular clear and even declares that she hates the orthodox .
" i 'm expressing that jew-on-jew hostility that i 'd certainly like to see less of , and i see the movie as a rapprochement between the two camps , " annenberg said .
" if ever a bunch of people did n't understand each other that well , it 's the ultra-secular and the ultra-orthodox . "
in the film , the young translators ' personal stories begin to overlap with the plot of " romeo and juliet , " once they wrap their heads around it .
the back story is that these first-time actors , like their characters , are forging new lives outside of the ultra-orthodox community where they grew up .
melissa weisz plays juliet and traveled to berlin for the jewish film festival where the movie premiered this summer .
" we came to berlin and spoke to non-jews , and it gives you a whole different perception of the world , " weisz said .
" we were told that every gentile would hurt us .
the way we were raised is very insular and a little bit brainwashed . "
bildunterschrift : melissa weisz plays juliet more premieres ahead the actors ' experience in the german capital was fruitful .
not only were they on hand to receive the audience favorite award at berlin 's jewish film festival , they also received invitations to come back and guest lecture at yiddish courses .
lazer weisz plays the romeo character and enjoyed the feedback on the film from people in the audience . " they like the whole idea that yiddish is coming back to germany .
it 's very nice .
it makes the whole thing worth it in a way , " he said .
the film 's next stop is london on november 16 , and it will debut in new york in january .
the screenings offer a departure from the usual shakespearean experience .
since 65 percent of the movie is in yiddish , the scenes from romeo and juliet appear with the bard 's original lines subtitled in english .
if the film continues to charm audiences as it did in germany , perhaps another yiddish language production will follow .

the film , ' romeo and juliet in yiddish , ' gives the world 's most famous romance a new twist . move over montagues and capulets : here come the chabads and the satmars .
the two rival sects of ultra-orthodox jews face off in a witty and bittersweet film titled " romeo and juliet in yiddish . "
a chance encounter between director eve annenberg and some members of new york 's hasidic community developed into a friendship and collaboration on the film .
it explores the rough-and-tumble existence of young jews who have left the ultra-orthodox world behind .
annenberg was fascinated by a younger generation speaking a language she thought was more or less consigned to the archives . " my grandmother who spoke yiddish and my mother who spoke yiddish are now both dead , and i wo n't hear it again .
and yet , the lure of speaking yiddish and being around people with this verbal vitality is so strong , " annenberg said .
bildunterschrift : the film deals with tension between orthodox and secular jews an introduction to the bard the director also has a role in the film .
she plays an emergency room nurse who 's trying to finish her master 's degree in germanic languages .
after she accepts her advisor 's suggestion to translate " romeo and juliet " into yiddish , she recruits some young native speakers to help her out .
" i think this is the first ' romeo and juliet ' where they wake up in the morning , and romeo reaches for his glasses .
that was an important detail to me .
i wanted it to be , well , jewish .

the library is situated in the international transfers area , where a whole boulevard promoting dutch culture has been built .

" the idea was very simple : let 's lend books to passengers who go on holiday and they can bring the books back when they return , " said van tol , of probiblio , the institution that came up with the idea of an airport library .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 15.11.2010 orthodox and secular jewish worlds collide in yiddish romeo and juliet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " romeo and juliet in yiddish " premieres in the uk on november 16 shakespeare has been translated into some 80 languages and was likely translated into yiddish in the late 19th century .
the film , ' romeo and juliet in yiddish , ' gives the world 's most famous romance a new twist . move over montagues and capulets : here come the chabads and the satmars .
the two rival sects of ultra-orthodox jews face off in a witty and bittersweet film titled " romeo and juliet in yiddish . "
a chance encounter between director eve annenberg and some members of new york 's hasidic community developed into a friendship and collaboration on the film .
it explores the rough-and-tumble existence of young jews who have left the ultra-orthodox world behind .
annenberg was fascinated by a younger generation speaking a language she thought was more or less consigned to the archives . " my grandmother who spoke yiddish and my mother who spoke yiddish are now both dead , and i wo n't hear it again .
and yet , the lure of speaking yiddish and being around people with this verbal vitality is so strong , " annenberg said .
bildunterschrift : the film deals with tension between orthodox and secular jews an introduction to the bard the director also has a role in the film .
she plays an emergency room nurse who 's trying to finish her master 's degree in germanic languages .
after she accepts her advisor 's suggestion to translate " romeo and juliet " into yiddish , she recruits some young native speakers to help her out .
" i think this is the first ' romeo and juliet ' where they wake up in the morning , and romeo reaches for his glasses .
that was an important detail to me .
i wanted it to be , well , jewish .
and yes , we read a lot ! "
annenberg said with a laugh .
but shakespeare has n't been on the reading list for many in the ultra-orthodox community , which has remained closed to much of the outside world .
the young translators in the film have never heard of the bard .
they also do n't have much sense of romantic love .
life meets art in the film , annenberg 's character makes her preference for the secular clear and even declares that she hates the orthodox .
" i 'm expressing that jew-on-jew hostility that i 'd certainly like to see less of , and i see the movie as a rapprochement between the two camps , " annenberg said .
" if ever a bunch of people did n't understand each other that well , it 's the ultra-secular and the ultra-orthodox . "
in the film , the young translators ' personal stories begin to overlap with the plot of " romeo and juliet , " once they wrap their heads around it .
the back story is that these first-time actors , like their characters , are forging new lives outside of the ultra-orthodox community where they grew up .
melissa weisz plays juliet and traveled to berlin for the jewish film festival where the movie premiered this summer .
" we came to berlin and spoke to non-jews , and it gives you a whole different perception of the world , " weisz said .
" we were told that every gentile would hurt us .
the way we were raised is very insular and a little bit brainwashed . "
bildunterschrift : melissa weisz plays juliet more premieres ahead the actors ' experience in the german capital was fruitful .
not only were they on hand to receive the audience favorite award at berlin 's jewish film festival , they also received invitations to come back and guest lecture at yiddish courses .
lazer weisz plays the romeo character and enjoyed the feedback on the film from people in the audience . " they like the whole idea that yiddish is coming back to germany .
it 's very nice .
it makes the whole thing worth it in a way , " he said .
the film 's next stop is london on november 16 , and it will debut in new york in january .
the screenings offer a departure from the usual shakespearean experience .
since 65 percent of the movie is in yiddish , the scenes from romeo and juliet appear with the bard 's original lines subtitled in english .
if the film continues to charm audiences as it did in germany , perhaps another yiddish language production will follow .

this season , the globe theatre pays homage to this special relationship .

the film , ' romeo and juliet in yiddish , ' gives the world 's most famous romance a new twist . move over montagues and capulets : here come the chabads and the satmars .
the two rival sects of ultra-orthodox jews face off in a witty and bittersweet film titled " romeo and juliet in yiddish . "
a chance encounter between director eve annenberg and some members of new york 's hasidic community developed into a friendship and collaboration on the film .
it explores the rough-and-tumble existence of young jews who have left the ultra-orthodox world behind .
annenberg was fascinated by a younger generation speaking a language she thought was more or less consigned to the archives . " my grandmother who spoke yiddish and my mother who spoke yiddish are now both dead , and i wo n't hear it again .
and yet , the lure of speaking yiddish and being around people with this verbal vitality is so strong , " annenberg said .
bildunterschrift : the film deals with tension between orthodox and secular jews an introduction to the bard the director also has a role in the film .
she plays an emergency room nurse who 's trying to finish her master 's degree in germanic languages .
after she accepts her advisor 's suggestion to translate " romeo and juliet " into yiddish , she recruits some young native speakers to help her out .
" i think this is the first ' romeo and juliet ' where they wake up in the morning , and romeo reaches for his glasses .
that was an important detail to me .
i wanted it to be , well , jewish .
and yes , we read a lot ! "
annenberg said with a laugh .
but shakespeare has n't been on the reading list for many in the ultra-orthodox community , which has remained closed to much of the outside world .
the young translators in the film have never heard of the bard .
they also do n't have much sense of romantic love .
life meets art in the film , annenberg 's character makes her preference for the secular clear and even declares that she hates the orthodox .
" i 'm expressing that jew-on-jew hostility that i 'd certainly like to see less of , and i see the movie as a rapprochement between the two camps , " annenberg said .
" if ever a bunch of people did n't understand each other that well , it 's the ultra-secular and the ultra-orthodox . "
in the film , the young translators ' personal stories begin to overlap with the plot of " romeo and juliet , " once they wrap their heads around it .
the back story is that these first-time actors , like their characters , are forging new lives outside of the ultra-orthodox community where they grew up .
melissa weisz plays juliet and traveled to berlin for the jewish film festival where the movie premiered this summer .
" we came to berlin and spoke to non-jews , and it gives you a whole different perception of the world , " weisz said .
" we were told that every gentile would hurt us .
the way we were raised is very insular and a little bit brainwashed . "
bildunterschrift : melissa weisz plays juliet more premieres ahead the actors ' experience in the german capital was fruitful .
not only were they on hand to receive the audience favorite award at berlin 's jewish film festival , they also received invitations to come back and guest lecture at yiddish courses .
lazer weisz plays the romeo character and enjoyed the feedback on the film from people in the audience . " they like the whole idea that yiddish is coming back to germany .
it 's very nice .
it makes the whole thing worth it in a way , " he said .
the film 's next stop is london on november 16 , and it will debut in new york in january .
the screenings offer a departure from the usual shakespearean experience .
since 65 percent of the movie is in yiddish , the scenes from romeo and juliet appear with the bard 's original lines subtitled in english .
if the film continues to charm audiences as it did in germany , perhaps another yiddish language production will follow .

in order to secure its national interests , moscow must manage a tricky balancing act between the west and the east . flush with cash from booming oil and gas exports , moscow unilaterally pursued russian national interests during vladimir putin 's tenure as president .
in the process , russia 's relationship with the west deteriorated to a historic low point . but then the economic crisis hit .
energy prices collapsed and russia 's rapid growth ground to a halt . after dmitry medvedev assumed the presidency in 2008 , moscow sought to jumpstart the slumping russian economy through so-called " modernization alliances " with the us and the eu .
yet at the same time , the oil-rich country began consolidating its " strategic partnership " with an oil-hungry china .
russia wanted to pursue its national interests in economic modernization and growth and knew that it needed both the west and china in these endeavors . love-hate relationship moscow 's relationship with the west has a long history of ambivalence .
culturally tied to europe , yet also influenced by asia , russia sits awkwardly between two worlds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's relationship with the west deteriorated as nato expanded eastward " the russians do see themselves more as a part of western civilization , " andrew kuchins , director of the russia and eurasia program at the center for strategic and international studies , told deutsche welle .
" they are eurasian , a power bordering europe as well as the pacific ocean .
but the bulk of the population is in european russia . " with the collapse of the soviet union , moscow seemed to have taken a step toward definitively joining the west .
president boris yeltsin implemented a series of radical reforms designed to put russia 's political and economic system in synch with its former cold war enemies . but as the european union and nato rapidly expanded into the former eastern bloc , moscow felt marginalized in its own " near abroad . "
then vladimir putin came to power .
buoyed by surging oil and gas exports , putin sought to stabilize russia domestically and reassert its influence in the former soviet states . the developments put the west and russia on a collision course .
in the summer of 2008 , they finally collided in the south caucasus .
russia fought a lightening-quick war against georgia , a former soviet republic that has increasingly looked westward .
in response to the conflict , nato severed cooperation with moscow .
but according to dmitri trenin , director of the carnegie moscow center , the west also played a key role in the dispute . " it takes everyone who 's involved to organize a better framework for relations , " trenin told deutsche welle .
" the western policy that included some countries into western institutions and left others such as russia , but also georgia and ukraine beyond the perimeter was very risky .
that policy is responsible for the russian-georgian war . " pushing the reset button power changed hands in moscow and washington in quick succession , bringing new leaders and a new outlook on russia 's relationship with the west .
us president barack obama and medvedev saw an opportunity to focus on cooperation instead of confrontation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and russia are now cooperating on common interests " president medvedev knows that the modernization of the economy and russian society can not be executed without cooperation with the west , " alexander rahr , director of the russia and eurasia program at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle . he said us president obama did n't want to pursue a policy of containment against russia . " he needs russia in the fight against international terrorism in afghanistan and iraq , and he needs russian support to stop iran 's nuclear weapons program , " rahr said . as russian and western interests align , both sides have hinted at moving beyond a quid-pro-quo relationship and bringing moscow into a deeper security partnership .
in the lead up to the nato summit later this month in lisbon , secretary general anders fogh rasmussen has pushed the idea of including russia in a missile defense shield that would stretch from vancouver to vladivostok . " what russia and other countries in europe and north america need to work toward is a euro-atlantic security community , " trenin said .
" we 're not talking about alliances .
we 're not talking about russia joining nato .
we 're not talking about simply more of the same upgrades of russia 's relations with nato .
what we should be working toward is a state of play in the euro-atlantic area where war would not be an instrument of policy . " eastern horizon but a euro-atlantic security community is not the only game in town .
russia is hedging its bets and forging a strategic partnership with china , as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's economic growth is both an opportunity and a concern for russia " china is second only to the us in terms of countries that weigh in on the russian strategic mind , " trenin said .
" it is immensely important . " china 's meteoric growth has made it the world 's largest energy consumer .
russia in turn is one of the world 's largest energy producers and is therefore well-positioned to fuel china 's economy . the first pipeline connecting russian oil fields and chinese refineries was completed last september .
it delivers oil from eastern siberia to northeastern china .
moscow and beijing are also working together within the shanghai cooperation organization , a loose security partnership designed to combat threats such as separatism , terrorism and extremism . on the international stage , russia and china share a similar worldview .
they both prioritize national sovereignty and the pursuit of national interests over liberal values , such as democracy and human rights .
yet like russia 's relationship with the west , its growing ties with china face challenges . " there has always been this certain degree of unease despite all the happy talk and positive rhetoric of russia and china , " kuchins said .
china 's rapid growth made the russians nervous , he said . " the impact of the -lrb- economic -rrb- crisis was sort of an acceleration of that trend , " kuchins said .
" it leads them to question just how much the growth of chinese power is good for russian interests . " independence or isolation ? as russia simultaneously pursues partnerships with the west and china , it also wants to maintain its status as an independent power .
moscow has constructed a network of institutions to keep the former soviet states within its sphere of influence .
the commonwealth of independent states , the collective security treaty organization and the eurasian economic community could act as pillars of eurasian integration . " the default russian position is that they would like to be this great superpower , " kuchins said .
" there would be the west , russia and china .
but the reality suggests that 's not looking to be the case .
that forces them to possibly make some harder decisions about just how far they want to push this so-called independent foreign policy . " russia needs the west for economic modernization , and china presents a lucrative energy market .
yet moving too far too fast in either direction , or striking out on an independent path , could lead to moscow 's isolation . as a eurasian power , russia has little choice but to strike a balance in its relations with the east and the west . " we have to prepare ourselves for the reality that russia would like to integrate one leg in europe and the other in asia , " rahr said .
" if not integration , then it would like to at least work closely with the states of europe and asia . " author : spencer kimball editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in order to secure its national interests , moscow must manage a tricky balancing act between the west and the east . flush with cash from booming oil and gas exports , moscow unilaterally pursued russian national interests during vladimir putin 's tenure as president .
in the process , russia 's relationship with the west deteriorated to a historic low point . but then the economic crisis hit .
energy prices collapsed and russia 's rapid growth ground to a halt . after dmitry medvedev assumed the presidency in 2008 , moscow sought to jumpstart the slumping russian economy through so-called " modernization alliances " with the us and the eu .
yet at the same time , the oil-rich country began consolidating its " strategic partnership " with an oil-hungry china .
russia wanted to pursue its national interests in economic modernization and growth and knew that it needed both the west and china in these endeavors . love-hate relationship moscow 's relationship with the west has a long history of ambivalence .
culturally tied to europe , yet also influenced by asia , russia sits awkwardly between two worlds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's relationship with the west deteriorated as nato expanded eastward " the russians do see themselves more as a part of western civilization , " andrew kuchins , director of the russia and eurasia program at the center for strategic and international studies , told deutsche welle .
" they are eurasian , a power bordering europe as well as the pacific ocean .
but the bulk of the population is in european russia . " with the collapse of the soviet union , moscow seemed to have taken a step toward definitively joining the west .
president boris yeltsin implemented a series of radical reforms designed to put russia 's political and economic system in synch with its former cold war enemies . but as the european union and nato rapidly expanded into the former eastern bloc , moscow felt marginalized in its own " near abroad . "
then vladimir putin came to power .
buoyed by surging oil and gas exports , putin sought to stabilize russia domestically and reassert its influence in the former soviet states . the developments put the west and russia on a collision course .
in the summer of 2008 , they finally collided in the south caucasus .
russia fought a lightening-quick war against georgia , a former soviet republic that has increasingly looked westward .
in response to the conflict , nato severed cooperation with moscow .
but according to dmitri trenin , director of the carnegie moscow center , the west also played a key role in the dispute . " it takes everyone who 's involved to organize a better framework for relations , " trenin told deutsche welle .
" the western policy that included some countries into western institutions and left others such as russia , but also georgia and ukraine beyond the perimeter was very risky .
that policy is responsible for the russian-georgian war . " pushing the reset button power changed hands in moscow and washington in quick succession , bringing new leaders and a new outlook on russia 's relationship with the west .
us president barack obama and medvedev saw an opportunity to focus on cooperation instead of confrontation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and russia are now cooperating on common interests " president medvedev knows that the modernization of the economy and russian society can not be executed without cooperation with the west , " alexander rahr , director of the russia and eurasia program at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle . he said us president obama did n't want to pursue a policy of containment against russia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de tourism -pipe- 15.11.2010 british start-ups set their sights on the growing homestay market großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the market for homestay accommodation is growing more and more people are making money out of their homes by offering them to tourists for the night .
even if you only have a blow-up mattress on offer , there 's a website out there waiting to market it . millions of people love to travel , but few of us really want to be a tourist – it has almost become something of a bad word , synonymous for not really getting a genuine impression of a new place .
and the most fundamental thing that will set you apart from the locals is your accommodation – unless of course you have the chance stay in someone ’ s private home established in london one year ago , ' onefinestay ' is a five-star service that sees private homestays as an antidote to dull and soulless hotel rooms .
the company currently has more than 20 london properties on its website .
" people are getting increasingly bored of or frustrated by the generic experience of being a tourist , " said ceo and co-founder greg marsh .
the answer , according to marsh , is the ' unhotel ' : a way to stay in someone 's home while they are out of town for a couple of days and live like a local while you are doing it .
easy money marsh says the tens of thousands of london apartments that stand empty for weeks and sometimes even months each year represent a great business opportunity .
" it sounds glib , but it 's free money , " marsh said , adding that his company offers homeowners a range of services in addition to simply marketing properties over the internet .
" someone else takes care of all the hassle and the complexity of making your home available to guests over short periods ; all you have to do is tell us when you are out , " he said .
" with something like -lrb- independent -rrb- short letting you are obliged to spend a minimum of three months away from home and you are obliged to move your things into storage and you have to take care of the insurance risk yourself . "
bildunterschrift : onefinestay specializes in high-end apartment rentals hint of luxury the cost of staying at a onefinestay property is calculated according to its long let rental value , which is the amount hosts can expect to receive .
guests pay extra for the services the company provides , including the provision of an iphone loaded with local tips for restaurants and sightseeing , as well as luxury linen and bath towels .
tina steiner recently put her two-bedroom property in north london up for rent with onefinestay .
as someone who travels often , but at short notice , she says the company 's business model suits her lifestyle well .
" i would have never considered renting out my flat , but this really fulfilled my need of doing it in a five star way , " steiner said .
no space too small sharing out your home need not be a five star affair , however .
in fact you do n't even have to vacate the property to host guests .
web-based company crashpadder was founded by stephen rapoport in 2008 and allows users to rent out anything from a spare room to a few square meters of living room floor . "
" we were described recently as ' couch surfing for grown-ups , " ' rapoport said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crashpadder offers everything from vacant apartments to inflatable mattresses on a floor " it 's people who used to backpack - they do n't mind shared rooms or accommodation , they still want to travel , and they still want to get a genuine local experience when they visit a new place .
but they do n't want the discomfort of a hostel . "
rapoport says most guests stay with a local families and enjoy a comfort level to that offered by a decent hotel , but at a much lower cost .
crashpadder hosts are at liberty to decide how much they 'd like to charge per night .
prices can range from 3 pounds per night for a sofa-bed in south cornwall to 200 pounds for a whole apartment in central london .
the average rate for a double room in london is about 35 pounds .
international appeal the crashpadder website has about 15,000 users , with hosts in 75 cities including brisbane , new york and cape town .
both hosts and ' crashers ' must create profiles in order to use the site and provide information about themselves and their interests .
hosts reserve the right to refuse anyone they do n't want , while crashers are invited to leave feedback after their stay .
rapoport says he would like to see a crashpadder presence in tens of thousands of locations around the world , although he remains pragmatic about its appeal .
" crashpadder is not for everyone and it 's not for everyone all of the time ; it 's probably not for the vast majority of people , " he said .
" but what i 'd like to see is it being used by that small pocket of travelers ; those business travelers that value human interaction , the travelers who want to experience everything that a city has to offer . "
business and pleasure both onefinestay and crashpadder have charted a 50 percent spread between tourists and business travelers .
while lone travelers might favor the more social aspects of crashpadder , families have shown the most interest in one fine stay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homestays attract travelers who want to avoid mainstream hotels " getting three hotel rooms is very expensive and pretty grim , " marsh said .
" with a house , you get the kitchen living area and lots of bedrooms so the response we have had from families has been overwhelming . "
change marsh believes that services like onefinestay are indicative of a wider shift in attitudes towards travel and property .
" i do think there is something in the air about being perhaps more liberal with what we own and more open-minded about sharing things " , he said .
in the current financial climate , services like these appear to be a welcome additional source of income for property owners .
" i think the people who use crashpadder – they do want the extra income , but they also want the social interaction , it 's just so enjoyable , " rapoport said .
" it 's the most fun one can have making money i think ! "

in order to secure its national interests , moscow must manage a tricky balancing act between the west and the east . flush with cash from booming oil and gas exports , moscow unilaterally pursued russian national interests during vladimir putin 's tenure as president .
in the process , russia 's relationship with the west deteriorated to a historic low point . but then the economic crisis hit .
energy prices collapsed and russia 's rapid growth ground to a halt . after dmitry medvedev assumed the presidency in 2008 , moscow sought to jumpstart the slumping russian economy through so-called " modernization alliances " with the us and the eu .
yet at the same time , the oil-rich country began consolidating its " strategic partnership " with an oil-hungry china .
russia wanted to pursue its national interests in economic modernization and growth and knew that it needed both the west and china in these endeavors . love-hate relationship moscow 's relationship with the west has a long history of ambivalence .
culturally tied to europe , yet also influenced by asia , russia sits awkwardly between two worlds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's relationship with the west deteriorated as nato expanded eastward " the russians do see themselves more as a part of western civilization , " andrew kuchins , director of the russia and eurasia program at the center for strategic and international studies , told deutsche welle .
" they are eurasian , a power bordering europe as well as the pacific ocean .
but the bulk of the population is in european russia . " with the collapse of the soviet union , moscow seemed to have taken a step toward definitively joining the west .
president boris yeltsin implemented a series of radical reforms designed to put russia 's political and economic system in synch with its former cold war enemies . but as the european union and nato rapidly expanded into the former eastern bloc , moscow felt marginalized in its own " near abroad . "
then vladimir putin came to power .
buoyed by surging oil and gas exports , putin sought to stabilize russia domestically and reassert its influence in the former soviet states . the developments put the west and russia on a collision course .
in the summer of 2008 , they finally collided in the south caucasus .
russia fought a lightening-quick war against georgia , a former soviet republic that has increasingly looked westward .
in response to the conflict , nato severed cooperation with moscow .
but according to dmitri trenin , director of the carnegie moscow center , the west also played a key role in the dispute . " it takes everyone who 's involved to organize a better framework for relations , " trenin told deutsche welle .
" the western policy that included some countries into western institutions and left others such as russia , but also georgia and ukraine beyond the perimeter was very risky .
that policy is responsible for the russian-georgian war . " pushing the reset button power changed hands in moscow and washington in quick succession , bringing new leaders and a new outlook on russia 's relationship with the west .
us president barack obama and medvedev saw an opportunity to focus on cooperation instead of confrontation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and russia are now cooperating on common interests " president medvedev knows that the modernization of the economy and russian society can not be executed without cooperation with the west , " alexander rahr , director of the russia and eurasia program at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle . he said us president obama did n't want to pursue a policy of containment against russia . " he needs russia in the fight against international terrorism in afghanistan and iraq , and he needs russian support to stop iran 's nuclear weapons program , " rahr said . as russian and western interests align , both sides have hinted at moving beyond a quid-pro-quo relationship and bringing moscow into a deeper security partnership .
in the lead up to the nato summit later this month in lisbon , secretary general anders fogh rasmussen has pushed the idea of including russia in a missile defense shield that would stretch from vancouver to vladivostok . " what russia and other countries in europe and north america need to work toward is a euro-atlantic security community , " trenin said .
" we 're not talking about alliances .
we 're not talking about russia joining nato .
we 're not talking about simply more of the same upgrades of russia 's relations with nato .
what we should be working toward is a state of play in the euro-atlantic area where war would not be an instrument of policy . " eastern horizon but a euro-atlantic security community is not the only game in town .
russia is hedging its bets and forging a strategic partnership with china , as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's economic growth is both an opportunity and a concern for russia " china is second only to the us in terms of countries that weigh in on the russian strategic mind , " trenin said .
" it is immensely important . " china 's meteoric growth has made it the world 's largest energy consumer .
russia in turn is one of the world 's largest energy producers and is therefore well-positioned to fuel china 's economy . the first pipeline connecting russian oil fields and chinese refineries was completed last september .
it delivers oil from eastern siberia to northeastern china .
moscow and beijing are also working together within the shanghai cooperation organization , a loose security partnership designed to combat threats such as separatism , terrorism and extremism . on the international stage , russia and china share a similar worldview .
they both prioritize national sovereignty and the pursuit of national interests over liberal values , such as democracy and human rights .
yet like russia 's relationship with the west , its growing ties with china face challenges . " there has always been this certain degree of unease despite all the happy talk and positive rhetoric of russia and china , " kuchins said .
china 's rapid growth made the russians nervous , he said . " the impact of the -lrb- economic -rrb- crisis was sort of an acceleration of that trend , " kuchins said .
" it leads them to question just how much the growth of chinese power is good for russian interests . " independence or isolation ? as russia simultaneously pursues partnerships with the west and china , it also wants to maintain its status as an independent power .
moscow has constructed a network of institutions to keep the former soviet states within its sphere of influence .
the commonwealth of independent states , the collective security treaty organization and the eurasian economic community could act as pillars of eurasian integration . " the default russian position is that they would like to be this great superpower , " kuchins said .
" there would be the west , russia and china .
but the reality suggests that 's not looking to be the case .
that forces them to possibly make some harder decisions about just how far they want to push this so-called independent foreign policy . " russia needs the west for economic modernization , and china presents a lucrative energy market .
yet moving too far too fast in either direction , or striking out on an independent path , could lead to moscow 's isolation . as a eurasian power , russia has little choice but to strike a balance in its relations with the east and the west . " we have to prepare ourselves for the reality that russia would like to integrate one leg in europe and the other in asia , " rahr said .
" if not integration , then it would like to at least work closely with the states of europe and asia . " author : spencer kimball editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

even if you only have a blow-up mattress on offer , there 's a website out there waiting to market it . millions of people love to travel , but few of us really want to be a tourist – it has almost become something of a bad word , synonymous for not really getting a genuine impression of a new place .

the company currently has more than 20 london properties on its website .
" people are getting increasingly bored of or frustrated by the generic experience of being a tourist , " said ceo and co-founder greg marsh .
the answer , according to marsh , is the ' unhotel ' : a way to stay in someone 's home while they are out of town for a couple of days and live like a local while you are doing it .
easy money marsh says the tens of thousands of london apartments that stand empty for weeks and sometimes even months each year represent a great business opportunity .
" it sounds glib , but it 's free money , " marsh said , adding that his company offers homeowners a range of services in addition to simply marketing properties over the internet .

crashpadder hosts are at liberty to decide how much they 'd like to charge per night .

in order to secure its national interests , moscow must manage a tricky balancing act between the west and the east . flush with cash from booming oil and gas exports , moscow unilaterally pursued russian national interests during vladimir putin 's tenure as president .
in the process , russia 's relationship with the west deteriorated to a historic low point . but then the economic crisis hit .
energy prices collapsed and russia 's rapid growth ground to a halt . after dmitry medvedev assumed the presidency in 2008 , moscow sought to jumpstart the slumping russian economy through so-called " modernization alliances " with the us and the eu .
yet at the same time , the oil-rich country began consolidating its " strategic partnership " with an oil-hungry china .
russia wanted to pursue its national interests in economic modernization and growth and knew that it needed both the west and china in these endeavors . love-hate relationship moscow 's relationship with the west has a long history of ambivalence .
culturally tied to europe , yet also influenced by asia , russia sits awkwardly between two worlds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's relationship with the west deteriorated as nato expanded eastward " the russians do see themselves more as a part of western civilization , " andrew kuchins , director of the russia and eurasia program at the center for strategic and international studies , told deutsche welle .
" they are eurasian , a power bordering europe as well as the pacific ocean .
but the bulk of the population is in european russia . " with the collapse of the soviet union , moscow seemed to have taken a step toward definitively joining the west .
president boris yeltsin implemented a series of radical reforms designed to put russia 's political and economic system in synch with its former cold war enemies . but as the european union and nato rapidly expanded into the former eastern bloc , moscow felt marginalized in its own " near abroad . "
then vladimir putin came to power .
buoyed by surging oil and gas exports , putin sought to stabilize russia domestically and reassert its influence in the former soviet states . the developments put the west and russia on a collision course .
in the summer of 2008 , they finally collided in the south caucasus .
russia fought a lightening-quick war against georgia , a former soviet republic that has increasingly looked westward .
in response to the conflict , nato severed cooperation with moscow .
but according to dmitri trenin , director of the carnegie moscow center , the west also played a key role in the dispute . " it takes everyone who 's involved to organize a better framework for relations , " trenin told deutsche welle .
" the western policy that included some countries into western institutions and left others such as russia , but also georgia and ukraine beyond the perimeter was very risky .
that policy is responsible for the russian-georgian war . " pushing the reset button power changed hands in moscow and washington in quick succession , bringing new leaders and a new outlook on russia 's relationship with the west .
us president barack obama and medvedev saw an opportunity to focus on cooperation instead of confrontation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and russia are now cooperating on common interests " president medvedev knows that the modernization of the economy and russian society can not be executed without cooperation with the west , " alexander rahr , director of the russia and eurasia program at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle . he said us president obama did n't want to pursue a policy of containment against russia . " he needs russia in the fight against international terrorism in afghanistan and iraq , and he needs russian support to stop iran 's nuclear weapons program , " rahr said . as russian and western interests align , both sides have hinted at moving beyond a quid-pro-quo relationship and bringing moscow into a deeper security partnership .
in the lead up to the nato summit later this month in lisbon , secretary general anders fogh rasmussen has pushed the idea of including russia in a missile defense shield that would stretch from vancouver to vladivostok . " what russia and other countries in europe and north america need to work toward is a euro-atlantic security community , " trenin said .
" we 're not talking about alliances .
we 're not talking about russia joining nato .
we 're not talking about simply more of the same upgrades of russia 's relations with nato .
what we should be working toward is a state of play in the euro-atlantic area where war would not be an instrument of policy . " eastern horizon but a euro-atlantic security community is not the only game in town .
russia is hedging its bets and forging a strategic partnership with china , as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's economic growth is both an opportunity and a concern for russia " china is second only to the us in terms of countries that weigh in on the russian strategic mind , " trenin said .
" it is immensely important . " china 's meteoric growth has made it the world 's largest energy consumer .
russia in turn is one of the world 's largest energy producers and is therefore well-positioned to fuel china 's economy . the first pipeline connecting russian oil fields and chinese refineries was completed last september .
it delivers oil from eastern siberia to northeastern china .
moscow and beijing are also working together within the shanghai cooperation organization , a loose security partnership designed to combat threats such as separatism , terrorism and extremism . on the international stage , russia and china share a similar worldview .
they both prioritize national sovereignty and the pursuit of national interests over liberal values , such as democracy and human rights .
yet like russia 's relationship with the west , its growing ties with china face challenges . " there has always been this certain degree of unease despite all the happy talk and positive rhetoric of russia and china , " kuchins said .
china 's rapid growth made the russians nervous , he said . " the impact of the -lrb- economic -rrb- crisis was sort of an acceleration of that trend , " kuchins said .
" it leads them to question just how much the growth of chinese power is good for russian interests . " independence or isolation ? as russia simultaneously pursues partnerships with the west and china , it also wants to maintain its status as an independent power .
moscow has constructed a network of institutions to keep the former soviet states within its sphere of influence .
the commonwealth of independent states , the collective security treaty organization and the eurasian economic community could act as pillars of eurasian integration . " the default russian position is that they would like to be this great superpower , " kuchins said .
" there would be the west , russia and china .
but the reality suggests that 's not looking to be the case .
that forces them to possibly make some harder decisions about just how far they want to push this so-called independent foreign policy . " russia needs the west for economic modernization , and china presents a lucrative energy market .
yet moving too far too fast in either direction , or striking out on an independent path , could lead to moscow 's isolation . as a eurasian power , russia has little choice but to strike a balance in its relations with the east and the west . " we have to prepare ourselves for the reality that russia would like to integrate one leg in europe and the other in asia , " rahr said .
" if not integration , then it would like to at least work closely with the states of europe and asia . " author : spencer kimball editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in order to secure its national interests , moscow must manage a tricky balancing act between the west and the east . flush with cash from booming oil and gas exports , moscow unilaterally pursued russian national interests during vladimir putin 's tenure as president .
in the process , russia 's relationship with the west deteriorated to a historic low point . but then the economic crisis hit .
energy prices collapsed and russia 's rapid growth ground to a halt . after dmitry medvedev assumed the presidency in 2008 , moscow sought to jumpstart the slumping russian economy through so-called " modernization alliances " with the us and the eu .
yet at the same time , the oil-rich country began consolidating its " strategic partnership " with an oil-hungry china .
russia wanted to pursue its national interests in economic modernization and growth and knew that it needed both the west and china in these endeavors . love-hate relationship moscow 's relationship with the west has a long history of ambivalence .
culturally tied to europe , yet also influenced by asia , russia sits awkwardly between two worlds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's relationship with the west deteriorated as nato expanded eastward " the russians do see themselves more as a part of western civilization , " andrew kuchins , director of the russia and eurasia program at the center for strategic and international studies , told deutsche welle .
" they are eurasian , a power bordering europe as well as the pacific ocean .
but the bulk of the population is in european russia . " with the collapse of the soviet union , moscow seemed to have taken a step toward definitively joining the west .
president boris yeltsin implemented a series of radical reforms designed to put russia 's political and economic system in synch with its former cold war enemies . but as the european union and nato rapidly expanded into the former eastern bloc , moscow felt marginalized in its own " near abroad . "
then vladimir putin came to power .
buoyed by surging oil and gas exports , putin sought to stabilize russia domestically and reassert its influence in the former soviet states . the developments put the west and russia on a collision course .
in the summer of 2008 , they finally collided in the south caucasus .
russia fought a lightening-quick war against georgia , a former soviet republic that has increasingly looked westward .
in response to the conflict , nato severed cooperation with moscow .
but according to dmitri trenin , director of the carnegie moscow center , the west also played a key role in the dispute . " it takes everyone who 's involved to organize a better framework for relations , " trenin told deutsche welle .
" the western policy that included some countries into western institutions and left others such as russia , but also georgia and ukraine beyond the perimeter was very risky .
that policy is responsible for the russian-georgian war . " pushing the reset button power changed hands in moscow and washington in quick succession , bringing new leaders and a new outlook on russia 's relationship with the west .
us president barack obama and medvedev saw an opportunity to focus on cooperation instead of confrontation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and russia are now cooperating on common interests " president medvedev knows that the modernization of the economy and russian society can not be executed without cooperation with the west , " alexander rahr , director of the russia and eurasia program at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle . he said us president obama did n't want to pursue a policy of containment against russia . " he needs russia in the fight against international terrorism in afghanistan and iraq , and he needs russian support to stop iran 's nuclear weapons program , " rahr said . as russian and western interests align , both sides have hinted at moving beyond a quid-pro-quo relationship and bringing moscow into a deeper security partnership .
in the lead up to the nato summit later this month in lisbon , secretary general anders fogh rasmussen has pushed the idea of including russia in a missile defense shield that would stretch from vancouver to vladivostok . " what russia and other countries in europe and north america need to work toward is a euro-atlantic security community , " trenin said .
" we 're not talking about alliances .
we 're not talking about russia joining nato .
we 're not talking about simply more of the same upgrades of russia 's relations with nato .
what we should be working toward is a state of play in the euro-atlantic area where war would not be an instrument of policy . " eastern horizon but a euro-atlantic security community is not the only game in town .
russia is hedging its bets and forging a strategic partnership with china , as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's economic growth is both an opportunity and a concern for russia " china is second only to the us in terms of countries that weigh in on the russian strategic mind , " trenin said .
" it is immensely important . " china 's meteoric growth has made it the world 's largest energy consumer .
russia in turn is one of the world 's largest energy producers and is therefore well-positioned to fuel china 's economy . the first pipeline connecting russian oil fields and chinese refineries was completed last september .
it delivers oil from eastern siberia to northeastern china .
moscow and beijing are also working together within the shanghai cooperation organization , a loose security partnership designed to combat threats such as separatism , terrorism and extremism . on the international stage , russia and china share a similar worldview .
they both prioritize national sovereignty and the pursuit of national interests over liberal values , such as democracy and human rights .
yet like russia 's relationship with the west , its growing ties with china face challenges . " there has always been this certain degree of unease despite all the happy talk and positive rhetoric of russia and china , " kuchins said .
china 's rapid growth made the russians nervous , he said . " the impact of the -lrb- economic -rrb- crisis was sort of an acceleration of that trend , " kuchins said .
" it leads them to question just how much the growth of chinese power is good for russian interests . " independence or isolation ? as russia simultaneously pursues partnerships with the west and china , it also wants to maintain its status as an independent power .
moscow has constructed a network of institutions to keep the former soviet states within its sphere of influence .
the commonwealth of independent states , the collective security treaty organization and the eurasian economic community could act as pillars of eurasian integration . " the default russian position is that they would like to be this great superpower , " kuchins said .
" there would be the west , russia and china .
but the reality suggests that 's not looking to be the case .
that forces them to possibly make some harder decisions about just how far they want to push this so-called independent foreign policy . " russia needs the west for economic modernization , and china presents a lucrative energy market .
yet moving too far too fast in either direction , or striking out on an independent path , could lead to moscow 's isolation . as a eurasian power , russia has little choice but to strike a balance in its relations with the east and the west . " we have to prepare ourselves for the reality that russia would like to integrate one leg in europe and the other in asia , " rahr said .

even if you only have a blow-up mattress on offer , there 's a website out there waiting to market it . millions of people love to travel , but few of us really want to be a tourist – it has almost become something of a bad word , synonymous for not really getting a genuine impression of a new place .
and the most fundamental thing that will set you apart from the locals is your accommodation – unless of course you have the chance stay in someone ’ s private home established in london one year ago , ' onefinestay ' is a five-star service that sees private homestays as an antidote to dull and soulless hotel rooms .
the company currently has more than 20 london properties on its website .
" people are getting increasingly bored of or frustrated by the generic experience of being a tourist , " said ceo and co-founder greg marsh .
the answer , according to marsh , is the ' unhotel ' : a way to stay in someone 's home while they are out of town for a couple of days and live like a local while you are doing it .
easy money marsh says the tens of thousands of london apartments that stand empty for weeks and sometimes even months each year represent a great business opportunity .
" it sounds glib , but it 's free money , " marsh said , adding that his company offers homeowners a range of services in addition to simply marketing properties over the internet .
" someone else takes care of all the hassle and the complexity of making your home available to guests over short periods ; all you have to do is tell us when you are out , " he said .
" with something like -lrb- independent -rrb- short letting you are obliged to spend a minimum of three months away from home and you are obliged to move your things into storage and you have to take care of the insurance risk yourself . "
bildunterschrift : onefinestay specializes in high-end apartment rentals hint of luxury the cost of staying at a onefinestay property is calculated according to its long let rental value , which is the amount hosts can expect to receive .
guests pay extra for the services the company provides , including the provision of an iphone loaded with local tips for restaurants and sightseeing , as well as luxury linen and bath towels .
tina steiner recently put her two-bedroom property in north london up for rent with onefinestay .
as someone who travels often , but at short notice , she says the company 's business model suits her lifestyle well .
" i would have never considered renting out my flat , but this really fulfilled my need of doing it in a five star way , " steiner said .
no space too small sharing out your home need not be a five star affair , however .
in fact you do n't even have to vacate the property to host guests .
web-based company crashpadder was founded by stephen rapoport in 2008 and allows users to rent out anything from a spare room to a few square meters of living room floor . "
" we were described recently as ' couch surfing for grown-ups , " ' rapoport said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crashpadder offers everything from vacant apartments to inflatable mattresses on a floor " it 's people who used to backpack - they do n't mind shared rooms or accommodation , they still want to travel , and they still want to get a genuine local experience when they visit a new place .
but they do n't want the discomfort of a hostel . "
rapoport says most guests stay with a local families and enjoy a comfort level to that offered by a decent hotel , but at a much lower cost .
crashpadder hosts are at liberty to decide how much they 'd like to charge per night .
prices can range from 3 pounds per night for a sofa-bed in south cornwall to 200 pounds for a whole apartment in central london .
the average rate for a double room in london is about 35 pounds .
international appeal the crashpadder website has about 15,000 users , with hosts in 75 cities including brisbane , new york and cape town .
both hosts and ' crashers ' must create profiles in order to use the site and provide information about themselves and their interests .
hosts reserve the right to refuse anyone they do n't want , while crashers are invited to leave feedback after their stay .
rapoport says he would like to see a crashpadder presence in tens of thousands of locations around the world , although he remains pragmatic about its appeal .
" crashpadder is not for everyone and it 's not for everyone all of the time ; it 's probably not for the vast majority of people , " he said .
" but what i 'd like to see is it being used by that small pocket of travelers ; those business travelers that value human interaction , the travelers who want to experience everything that a city has to offer . "
business and pleasure both onefinestay and crashpadder have charted a 50 percent spread between tourists and business travelers .
while lone travelers might favor the more social aspects of crashpadder , families have shown the most interest in one fine stay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homestays attract travelers who want to avoid mainstream hotels " getting three hotel rooms is very expensive and pretty grim , " marsh said .
" with a house , you get the kitchen living area and lots of bedrooms so the response we have had from families has been overwhelming . "
change marsh believes that services like onefinestay are indicative of a wider shift in attitudes towards travel and property .
" i do think there is something in the air about being perhaps more liberal with what we own and more open-minded about sharing things " , he said .
in the current financial climate , services like these appear to be a welcome additional source of income for property owners .
" i think the people who use crashpadder – they do want the extra income , but they also want the social interaction , it 's just so enjoyable , " rapoport said .
" it 's the most fun one can have making money i think ! "

" i would have never considered renting out my flat , but this really fulfilled my need of doing it in a five star way , " steiner said .
no space too small sharing out your home need not be a five star affair , however .
in fact you do n't even have to vacate the property to host guests .
web-based company crashpadder was founded by stephen rapoport in 2008 and allows users to rent out anything from a spare room to a few square meters of living room floor . "
" we were described recently as ' couch surfing for grown-ups , " ' rapoport said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crashpadder offers everything from vacant apartments to inflatable mattresses on a floor " it 's people who used to backpack - they do n't mind shared rooms or accommodation , they still want to travel , and they still want to get a genuine local experience when they visit a new place .
but they do n't want the discomfort of a hostel . "
rapoport says most guests stay with a local families and enjoy a comfort level to that offered by a decent hotel , but at a much lower cost .
crashpadder hosts are at liberty to decide how much they 'd like to charge per night .
prices can range from 3 pounds per night for a sofa-bed in south cornwall to 200 pounds for a whole apartment in central london .
the average rate for a double room in london is about 35 pounds .
international appeal the crashpadder website has about 15,000 users , with hosts in 75 cities including brisbane , new york and cape town .
both hosts and ' crashers ' must create profiles in order to use the site and provide information about themselves and their interests .
hosts reserve the right to refuse anyone they do n't want , while crashers are invited to leave feedback after their stay .
rapoport says he would like to see a crashpadder presence in tens of thousands of locations around the world , although he remains pragmatic about its appeal .
" crashpadder is not for everyone and it 's not for everyone all of the time ; it 's probably not for the vast majority of people , " he said .
" but what i 'd like to see is it being used by that small pocket of travelers ; those business travelers that value human interaction , the travelers who want to experience everything that a city has to offer . "
business and pleasure both onefinestay and crashpadder have charted a 50 percent spread between tourists and business travelers .
while lone travelers might favor the more social aspects of crashpadder , families have shown the most interest in one fine stay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homestays attract travelers who want to avoid mainstream hotels " getting three hotel rooms is very expensive and pretty grim , " marsh said .
" with a house , you get the kitchen living area and lots of bedrooms so the response we have had from families has been overwhelming . "
change marsh believes that services like onefinestay are indicative of a wider shift in attitudes towards travel and property .
" i do think there is something in the air about being perhaps more liberal with what we own and more open-minded about sharing things " , he said .
in the current financial climate , services like these appear to be a welcome additional source of income for property owners .
" i think the people who use crashpadder – they do want the extra income , but they also want the social interaction , it 's just so enjoyable , " rapoport said .
" it 's the most fun one can have making money i think ! "

the country is still refusing but so did greece before it bowed to pressure . speculation is rife about ireland 's course of action , as the country 's borrowing costs last week shot to record highs on concerns of a deficit set to hit 32 percent of gross domestic product this year .
monday kicked off with a report in the irish independent newspaper claiming that at a meeting of eurozone finance ministers this week , ireland plans to ask for money from the european union 's emergency fund to rescue its banks .
prompt denial an irish minister promptly fired off a denial about the country being in direct discussions about a bailout package from the european union .
while acknowledging that ireland is in " continuous talks " with the eu about its growing debt , dick roche , junior minister for european affairs , told newstalk radio that it is " frankly wrong and grossly irresponsible that this story is being said and that a frenzy is being created out there . "
the opposition claimed europe had already started moves to rescue the country , but the irish government denied it would need a bailout .
" ireland has made no application for external support , " a finance ministry spokesman said .
" ongoing contacts continue at official level with international colleagues in light of current market conditions . "
the rumor mill is almost certain to continue with every new day of uncertainty confronting irish banks .
at the end of last month , they owed 130 billion euros -lrb- $ 177 billion -rrb- of outstanding european central bank loans , up from 119 billion euros a month earlier .
numbers being floated around as part of a bailout deal range between 50 and 77 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment in ireland has soared to 13.2 percent the eu is reported to be keen for ireland to accept aid to avert a greek-style scenario in which budget problems in one country plunge the entire eurozone into crisis .
on monday , european central bank council member miguel angel fernandez ordonez prodded ireland to make a " final decision " on its fiscal crisis in a move to calm markets .
" the situation in the markets in recent weeks has been very negative due in some way to the lack of a final decision by ireland , " he told reporters in madrid .
" it 's not me who should take a decision about ireland ; it 's ireland that should take the right decision at the right moment . "
but the clock is ticking .
" i think ireland can hold out another three to four months maximum , and it should , hoping that some positive surprise on growth might calm the markets , " unicredit group chief economist marco annunziata told deutsche welle .
" but investors will remain nervous until the question is settled of whether or not eurozone sovereign debts might be restructured . "
stability program on track another european expert , who asked not to be identified , said the european finance ministers could reach a decision as early as this week to funnel funds to irish banks .
" these funds , which would help stabilize the banks , would be seen as a limited intervention , " the expert said .
there is no question about ireland 's sovereign debt , the expert added : the irish government has no immediate need for cash , being fully funded until mid-2011 , and its stability program is on track bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish banks owe billions to the european central bank germany has also pressed for ireland to accept aid , insiders say .
allaying investor concerns about irish finances would help advance chancellor angela merkel 's plan to require investors to help pay for future rescues .
european leaders , however , remain divided on merkel 's proposal , as they do on whether the ecb should keep buying bonds of debt-laden countries .
ireland 's debt problems stem largely from the country 's popped real estate bubble , when its local banks lent money too freely for construction projects .
on top of that was the irish government 's decision to provide a blanket guarantee to all bank creditors .
as a result , the country has experienced the worst recession of any major economy .
it has amassed debt of more than 100 billion euros and is struggling with an unemployment rate of 13.2 percent .
tough fiscal conditions a rescue plan would be deeply unpopular with irish voters , who value national independence and the low-tax regime that lured in foreign investment from u.s. and other non-european companies , fueling high growth rates over the past 20 years .
indeed , an eu bailout , with tough fiscal conditions attached , would be humiliating for a country once celebrated for its rags-to-riches transformation .
not unsurprisingly , critics of ireland 's action plan – or lack thereof – are wary of the country 's every move .
karel lannoo , chief executive officer of the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- in brussels , says the country should have acted long ago to steer clear of the financial challenges it now faces .
" ireland should never have given blanket coverage to banks in the first place , " lannoo told deutsche welle .
" and it should have let some of the banks fail . "
lannoo now questions the repercussions for europe .
" how many more of these financial disasters can we have ? " he asked .

the country is still refusing but so did greece before it bowed to pressure . speculation is rife about ireland 's course of action , as the country 's borrowing costs last week shot to record highs on concerns of a deficit set to hit 32 percent of gross domestic product this year .
monday kicked off with a report in the irish independent newspaper claiming that at a meeting of eurozone finance ministers this week , ireland plans to ask for money from the european union 's emergency fund to rescue its banks .
prompt denial an irish minister promptly fired off a denial about the country being in direct discussions about a bailout package from the european union .
while acknowledging that ireland is in " continuous talks " with the eu about its growing debt , dick roche , junior minister for european affairs , told newstalk radio that it is " frankly wrong and grossly irresponsible that this story is being said and that a frenzy is being created out there . "
the opposition claimed europe had already started moves to rescue the country , but the irish government denied it would need a bailout .
" ireland has made no application for external support , " a finance ministry spokesman said .
" ongoing contacts continue at official level with international colleagues in light of current market conditions . "
the rumor mill is almost certain to continue with every new day of uncertainty confronting irish banks .
at the end of last month , they owed 130 billion euros -lrb- $ 177 billion -rrb- of outstanding european central bank loans , up from 119 billion euros a month earlier .
numbers being floated around as part of a bailout deal range between 50 and 77 billion euros .

on monday , european central bank council member miguel angel fernandez ordonez prodded ireland to make a " final decision " on its fiscal crisis in a move to calm markets .
" the situation in the markets in recent weeks has been very negative due in some way to the lack of a final decision by ireland , " he told reporters in madrid .
" it 's not me who should take a decision about ireland ; it 's ireland that should take the right decision at the right moment . "
but the clock is ticking .
" i think ireland can hold out another three to four months maximum , and it should , hoping that some positive surprise on growth might calm the markets , " unicredit group chief economist marco annunziata told deutsche welle .
" but investors will remain nervous until the question is settled of whether or not eurozone sovereign debts might be restructured . "
stability program on track another european expert , who asked not to be identified , said the european finance ministers could reach a decision as early as this week to funnel funds to irish banks .
" these funds , which would help stabilize the banks , would be seen as a limited intervention , " the expert said .

allaying investor concerns about irish finances would help advance chancellor angela merkel 's plan to require investors to help pay for future rescues .
european leaders , however , remain divided on merkel 's proposal , as they do on whether the ecb should keep buying bonds of debt-laden countries .
ireland 's debt problems stem largely from the country 's popped real estate bubble , when its local banks lent money too freely for construction projects .
on top of that was the irish government 's decision to provide a blanket guarantee to all bank creditors .
as a result , the country has experienced the worst recession of any major economy .
it has amassed debt of more than 100 billion euros and is struggling with an unemployment rate of 13.2 percent .
tough fiscal conditions a rescue plan would be deeply unpopular with irish voters , who value national independence and the low-tax regime that lured in foreign investment from u.s. and other non-european companies , fueling high growth rates over the past 20 years .
indeed , an eu bailout , with tough fiscal conditions attached , would be humiliating for a country once celebrated for its rags-to-riches transformation .
not unsurprisingly , critics of ireland 's action plan – or lack thereof – are wary of the country 's every move .
karel lannoo , chief executive officer of the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- in brussels , says the country should have acted long ago to steer clear of the financial challenges it now faces .
" ireland should never have given blanket coverage to banks in the first place , " lannoo told deutsche welle .
" and it should have let some of the banks fail . "
lannoo now questions the repercussions for europe .

after an eventful journey , dw reporter ali almakhlafi has reached mecca , and started answering dw users ' questions .
but first - a sudden change of clothes . on sunday , nov .
14 , the moment had come : two million pilgrims from all around the world , and i was right there in the middle of them .
i visited the holy al-haram mosque , and saw the kaaba at its center .
i 've got to admit it : i was completely mesmerized .
there is really such a big difference between seeing it in pictures or reading about it in articles , and actually standing in front of it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 100,000 security forces are there to protect some 2 million pilgrims i 've been to cologne cathedral , the vatican , and the hagia sophia in istanbul before .
but the kaaba is special to me .
childhood memories of religion class in yemen come up - and somehow things seem to have come full circle .
originally , i arrived with a group of pilgrims , but i lost them in the crowd .
never mind , i say to myself ; it 's good to be alone , for i first need to digest this experience by myself .
despite the kaaba 's deep impact on me , i 'm still here as a journalist .
well , as a journalist that looks like a pilgrim .
and just how did that come about ?
let me tell you .
after facing some unexpected problems , i decided to change my polo shirt and jeans for the pilgrim 's robes .
i decided i do n't want to be recognized as a visitor anymore .
i 've had enough trouble with that already .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt airport : pilgrims , saudis , and foreigners heading to jeddah in saudi arabia you really feel misplaced among the masses of muslim pilgrims if you are smooth-shaven and casually-dressed .
in fact , i 've felt like this since i left frankfurt airport : the other passengers gave me startled looks .
and at the check-in counter of saudi airlines , none of the employees expected me to have the special hajj-visa in my passport .
pilgrims need to get special luggage stickers , so that their cases arrive on the separate hajj terminal at jeddah airport .
well , i got the stickers and my luggage arrived at the right terminal as well .
but i did n't .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american movies with arabic subtitles are shown on the airplane after my flight , i found myself at the terminal for non-pilgrims .
the employees at jeddah airport had sent me there because of my " civilian " getup .
there i was – surrounded by international tourists and business people .
after more than an hour of confusion , i finally got the last shuttle bus to the proper terminal at around midnight .
i was the only passenger … or , the only one who was late .
an american in mecca that could n't have happened to jack -lrb- name changed -rrb- .
jack is american .
he converted to islam a few years ago .
we first meet at frankfurt airport .
i ask him about his white hajj-clothes .
i want to know how he feels in this outfit .
after all , most people from the west would only wear clothes like that to a costume party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stewardess with a modern interpretation of a traditional headscarf " this probably looks funny to some of the people here , i guess , " says jack .
" i can tell by their looks . "
but jack does n't care .
" the hajj-outfit is meant to be simple and modest .
it reveals that religious beliefs do n't distinguish between rich and poor , black and white , etc . "
jack makes his comments as a muslim , but the way he says them , with his typical american accent , it almost sounds more like an american ideal .
flying , shopping , watching cnn aboard my plane to jeddah , i make some more interesting observations .
for example : most pilgrims watch cnn .
some of them even watch american movies .
however , the movies ' love scenes are carefully retouched , even though they are rather harmless from a western point of view .
the stewardesses wear headscarves and speak english – even with the arab passengers .
and many of the bearded men , who first appeared to be rather strict , conservative , and humorless , turn out to be very friendly family men .
they play happily with their kids and advise their loosely veiled wives on what makeup to buy from the choice of duty free products .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hajj terminal at jeddah airport : 2 million people arrive here - with their luggage before i finally put on my new pilgrim 's outfit , i first want to thank all the dw users for commenting on my first diary entries on the english , german , and arabic dw facebook pages - and for wishing me a safe trip .
i would like to reply to a question posted by hans youssef ernst from germany on the arabic page : " i 'm a christian and i would like to accompany my muslim friends to religious feasts in mecca some day .
do you think that this will be possible in the future ? "
dear hans youssef , i do n't dare to try and make a forecast .
as far as i know , the koran does n't explicitly state that non-muslims are n't allowed to visit mecca - but , as always , this is a matter of interpretation .
from a saudi perspective , non-muslims are definitely not allowed to visit the holy sites of mecca .
as an islamic scholar told me here in mecca : " that should be accepted , just like western constitutions need to be accepted by muslims living in europe .
by no means , however , you should mistake this as a sign of a lack respect or even contempt for non-muslims . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw reporter ali almakhlafi can move on after a short delay among islamic scholars , you can find different opinions about this topic .
there 's even a prominent politician who strongly criticizes the current prohibition : libya 's muammar al-gaddafi – who 's clearly not known to be a good friend of the western world .
five years ago , gaddafi asked for christians and jews to be allowed to visit mecca .
however , so far nothing changed … this monday , november 15 , i want to experience the pilgrim 's prayers at mount arafat and i will then attend the feast of sacrifice at mina .
i 've already collected quite a number of voices from other pilgrims .
i 'll tell you more about them in my next diary entry .

flying , shopping , watching cnn aboard my plane to jeddah , i make some more interesting observations .

some of them even watch american movies .
however , the movies ' love scenes are carefully retouched , even though they are rather harmless from a western point of view .
the stewardesses wear headscarves and speak english – even with the arab passengers .

do you think that this will be possible in the future ? "
dear hans youssef , i do n't dare to try and make a forecast .
as far as i know , the koran does n't explicitly state that non-muslims are n't allowed to visit mecca - but , as always , this is a matter of interpretation .
from a saudi perspective , non-muslims are definitely not allowed to visit the holy sites of mecca .
as an islamic scholar told me here in mecca : " that should be accepted , just like western constitutions need to be accepted by muslims living in europe .
by no means , however , you should mistake this as a sign of a lack respect or even contempt for non-muslims . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw reporter ali almakhlafi can move on after a short delay among islamic scholars , you can find different opinions about this topic .
there 's even a prominent politician who strongly criticizes the current prohibition : libya 's muammar al-gaddafi – who 's clearly not known to be a good friend of the western world .
five years ago , gaddafi asked for christians and jews to be allowed to visit mecca .
however , so far nothing changed … this monday , november 15 , i want to experience the pilgrim 's prayers at mount arafat and i will then attend the feast of sacrifice at mina .

after an eventful journey , dw reporter ali almakhlafi has reached mecca , and started answering dw users ' questions .
but first - a sudden change of clothes . on sunday , nov .
14 , the moment had come : two million pilgrims from all around the world , and i was right there in the middle of them .
i visited the holy al-haram mosque , and saw the kaaba at its center .
i 've got to admit it : i was completely mesmerized .
there is really such a big difference between seeing it in pictures or reading about it in articles , and actually standing in front of it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 100,000 security forces are there to protect some 2 million pilgrims i 've been to cologne cathedral , the vatican , and the hagia sophia in istanbul before .
but the kaaba is special to me .
childhood memories of religion class in yemen come up - and somehow things seem to have come full circle .
originally , i arrived with a group of pilgrims , but i lost them in the crowd .
never mind , i say to myself ; it 's good to be alone , for i first need to digest this experience by myself .
despite the kaaba 's deep impact on me , i 'm still here as a journalist .
well , as a journalist that looks like a pilgrim .
and just how did that come about ?
let me tell you .
after facing some unexpected problems , i decided to change my polo shirt and jeans for the pilgrim 's robes .
i decided i do n't want to be recognized as a visitor anymore .
i 've had enough trouble with that already .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt airport : pilgrims , saudis , and foreigners heading to jeddah in saudi arabia you really feel misplaced among the masses of muslim pilgrims if you are smooth-shaven and casually-dressed .
in fact , i 've felt like this since i left frankfurt airport : the other passengers gave me startled looks .
and at the check-in counter of saudi airlines , none of the employees expected me to have the special hajj-visa in my passport .
pilgrims need to get special luggage stickers , so that their cases arrive on the separate hajj terminal at jeddah airport .
well , i got the stickers and my luggage arrived at the right terminal as well .
but i did n't .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american movies with arabic subtitles are shown on the airplane after my flight , i found myself at the terminal for non-pilgrims .
the employees at jeddah airport had sent me there because of my " civilian " getup .
there i was – surrounded by international tourists and business people .
after more than an hour of confusion , i finally got the last shuttle bus to the proper terminal at around midnight .
i was the only passenger … or , the only one who was late .
an american in mecca that could n't have happened to jack -lrb- name changed -rrb- .
jack is american .
he converted to islam a few years ago .
we first meet at frankfurt airport .
i ask him about his white hajj-clothes .
i want to know how he feels in this outfit .
after all , most people from the west would only wear clothes like that to a costume party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stewardess with a modern interpretation of a traditional headscarf " this probably looks funny to some of the people here , i guess , " says jack .

the ministers are supporters of parliamentary speaker gianfranco fini , a berlusconi rival . political problems in italy continue to escalate as four ministers - europe minister andrea ronchi , deputy economic development minister adolfo urso and two junior ministers - resigned from their posts in the government on monday .
" we all agree today that we need to move to a new phase in the italian centre-right , " said urso on news channel skytg24 monday .

fini and his supports in the future and freedom movement hope to see berlusconi resign .
the demand follows the latest in a long-running series of sex-scandal allegations involving berlusconi .
earlier in the month , fini had threatened to start pulling ministers out of the government if berlusconi did n't step down .

the political turmoil could play out in a number of different ways in italy .
should berlusconi lose a vote of confidence , it would be up to president giorgio napolitano to decide if the existing parliament could form a new government .
napolitano could also appoint an interim government until new elections can take place .
if no agreement can be reached on a new government , parliament would be dissolved and snap elections would take place within 70 days .

the ministers are supporters of parliamentary speaker gianfranco fini , a berlusconi rival . political problems in italy continue to escalate as four ministers - europe minister andrea ronchi , deputy economic development minister adolfo urso and two junior ministers - resigned from their posts in the government on monday .
" we all agree today that we need to move to a new phase in the italian centre-right , " said urso on news channel skytg24 monday .
the resignations indicate waning support for prime minister silvio berlusconi .
the four ministers who resigned are all supporters of former berlusconi ally-turned-rival gianfranco fini , who is speaker of the parliament .
fini and his supports in the future and freedom movement hope to see berlusconi resign .
the demand follows the latest in a long-running series of sex-scandal allegations involving berlusconi .
earlier in the month , fini had threatened to start pulling ministers out of the government if berlusconi did n't step down .
monday 's resignations show fini made good on his promise .
budget comes first however , berlusconi has called for a vote of confidence in parliament and would be willing to face political rivals at the polls if snap elections are deemed necessary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fini would like to see berlusconi resign but such a vote is not likely to come before the italian government passes its 2011 budget in the coming weeks , a decision which is itself a thorny issue due to italy 's massive debt problem .
the political turmoil could play out in a number of different ways in italy .
should berlusconi lose a vote of confidence , it would be up to president giorgio napolitano to decide if the existing parliament could form a new government .
napolitano could also appoint an interim government until new elections can take place .
if no agreement can be reached on a new government , parliament would be dissolved and snap elections would take place within 70 days .

but experts say a ban would cause unnecessary stress for couples . thanks to a recent ruling by the federal court of justice , german women having a ' test-tube baby ' have the option of letting the doctor check if the embryo which will be implanted in her womb is likely to suffer from any serious diseases .
if the chances are high , she can decide not to have it implanted and try again .
such pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- used to be illegal in germany , but the decision in july found that such a test was legal if it was intended to exclude a serious handicap .
this caused consternation among germany 's christians , not least those belonging to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
many argued that an embryo enjoys complete human rights from the moment a sperm fertilizes an egg , and after some deliberation , merkel came down on their side last month .
disunity among mainstream christians in her opening speech at this week 's party conference , the chancellor gave a brief but unambiguous reiteration of her position : " i 'm in favor of a ban , because we ca n't properly define the boundaries . "
she did however acknowledge that many party colleagues have a different opinion , and welcomed a frank debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the boundaries of pid were too difficult to define prominent cdu members – notably cabinet ministers ursula von der leyen and kristina schroeder - as well as merkel 's coalition partners the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , see it differently , and have proposed a controlled use of pgd .
the issue divides other parties too , and when the issue comes before german parliament , it has been decided that the question will be decided by a free ‘ conscience ' vote , independent of party lines .
the main argument in favor of pgd simply points out that german law allows women to have an abortion even in the ninth month , if a test of the fetus shows a serious health condition .
if more diagnoses could be carried out before implantation , many such traumatic abortions could be avoided .
" it 's quite a contradiction that we do n't allow the cells to be checked , " argued cdu parliamentary state secretary peter hintze .
" but we do allow the fetus to be checked in the womb .
we should get rid of this contradiction . "
defining the boundaries the particular ' boundary ' that merkel feels is so difficult to define is between screening out genes that might lead to illness , handicaps or birth defects and producing what is known as ' designer babies . '
from a scientific point of view , it 's important to point out that ' diagnosis ' is a slightly misleading description , since the process does not involve identifying an illness in an embryo .
instead , pgd is a test for certain genetic conditions that could lead to disease .
pgd was first developed in britain in the late 1980s , and was first used for sex determination on embryos with diseases linked to certain chromosomes .
not long after the first successful births , it was banned in germany under the 1990 embryo protection act .
its main application is for determining the presence of recessive genetic disorders like cystic fibrosis , beta-thalassemia , sickle cell disease and spinal muscular atrophy type 1 .
the most common dominant diseases that can be screened by pgd are myotonic dystrophy , huntington 's disease and charcot-marie-tooth disease .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an outright ban would likely send many germans abroad for treatment it is also used to test for chromosomal abnormalities , which if excluded can increase the chances of ivf treatment being successful , by reducing the rate of miscarriages .
broad consensus in europe pgd is allowed in britain , but only for determining the presence of serious hereditary diseases or chromosome disorders .
in france , the procedure is only allowed if an inherited disease has been identified in one of the parents , and only if both parents have been living together for two years .
a similarly limited application of pgd is also in place in belgium , the netherlands , belgium , italy , and greece .
meanwhile an outright ban is in place in austria , ireland and switzerland .
but there is a fairly ambiguous legal position on pgd in many countries , where it is not expressly banned , but is implicitly prohibited through regulations on embryo research – this is the case in many us states .
sascha rudat , spokesman for the berlin chamber of physicians , told deutsche welle , " the problem is that couples where hereditary diseases are present , could say , ' we 're going abroad to have it done there . '
and of course that is n't desirable .
that 's a lot of stress , so i think we should re-consider whether a total ban is a good idea . "
rudat says the risks and stress of travel to a foreign country only make a complex and emotionally-charged treatment even more difficult .
" some couples are already in a stressful situation , " he said .
" as i said , they are often couples who already have certain hereditary illnesses , who may already have had a handicapped child , and who only want to do everything right .
if they travel it just adds extra burdens . "
for this reason , rudat believes that a regulated application is the only fair solution .
" we do n't consider a total ban desirable , " says rudat .
" we think that pgd should be possible under very strict conditions .
they are of course important . "

but experts say a ban would cause unnecessary stress for couples . thanks to a recent ruling by the federal court of justice , german women having a ' test-tube baby ' have the option of letting the doctor check if the embryo which will be implanted in her womb is likely to suffer from any serious diseases .
if the chances are high , she can decide not to have it implanted and try again .
such pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- used to be illegal in germany , but the decision in july found that such a test was legal if it was intended to exclude a serious handicap .
this caused consternation among germany 's christians , not least those belonging to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
many argued that an embryo enjoys complete human rights from the moment a sperm fertilizes an egg , and after some deliberation , merkel came down on their side last month .
disunity among mainstream christians in her opening speech at this week 's party conference , the chancellor gave a brief but unambiguous reiteration of her position : " i 'm in favor of a ban , because we ca n't properly define the boundaries . "
she did however acknowledge that many party colleagues have a different opinion , and welcomed a frank debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the boundaries of pid were too difficult to define prominent cdu members – notably cabinet ministers ursula von der leyen and kristina schroeder - as well as merkel 's coalition partners the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , see it differently , and have proposed a controlled use of pgd .
the issue divides other parties too , and when the issue comes before german parliament , it has been decided that the question will be decided by a free ‘ conscience ' vote , independent of party lines .
the main argument in favor of pgd simply points out that german law allows women to have an abortion even in the ninth month , if a test of the fetus shows a serious health condition .
if more diagnoses could be carried out before implantation , many such traumatic abortions could be avoided .
" it 's quite a contradiction that we do n't allow the cells to be checked , " argued cdu parliamentary state secretary peter hintze .
" but we do allow the fetus to be checked in the womb .
we should get rid of this contradiction . "
defining the boundaries the particular ' boundary ' that merkel feels is so difficult to define is between screening out genes that might lead to illness , handicaps or birth defects and producing what is known as ' designer babies . '
from a scientific point of view , it 's important to point out that ' diagnosis ' is a slightly misleading description , since the process does not involve identifying an illness in an embryo .
instead , pgd is a test for certain genetic conditions that could lead to disease .
pgd was first developed in britain in the late 1980s , and was first used for sex determination on embryos with diseases linked to certain chromosomes .
not long after the first successful births , it was banned in germany under the 1990 embryo protection act .
its main application is for determining the presence of recessive genetic disorders like cystic fibrosis , beta-thalassemia , sickle cell disease and spinal muscular atrophy type 1 .
the most common dominant diseases that can be screened by pgd are myotonic dystrophy , huntington 's disease and charcot-marie-tooth disease .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an outright ban would likely send many germans abroad for treatment it is also used to test for chromosomal abnormalities , which if excluded can increase the chances of ivf treatment being successful , by reducing the rate of miscarriages .
broad consensus in europe pgd is allowed in britain , but only for determining the presence of serious hereditary diseases or chromosome disorders .
in france , the procedure is only allowed if an inherited disease has been identified in one of the parents , and only if both parents have been living together for two years .
a similarly limited application of pgd is also in place in belgium , the netherlands , belgium , italy , and greece .
meanwhile an outright ban is in place in austria , ireland and switzerland .
but there is a fairly ambiguous legal position on pgd in many countries , where it is not expressly banned , but is implicitly prohibited through regulations on embryo research – this is the case in many us states .
sascha rudat , spokesman for the berlin chamber of physicians , told deutsche welle , " the problem is that couples where hereditary diseases are present , could say , ' we 're going abroad to have it done there . '
and of course that is n't desirable .
that 's a lot of stress , so i think we should re-consider whether a total ban is a good idea . "
rudat says the risks and stress of travel to a foreign country only make a complex and emotionally-charged treatment even more difficult .
" some couples are already in a stressful situation , " he said .
" as i said , they are often couples who already have certain hereditary illnesses , who may already have had a handicapped child , and who only want to do everything right .
if they travel it just adds extra burdens . "
for this reason , rudat believes that a regulated application is the only fair solution .
" we do n't consider a total ban desirable , " says rudat .
" we think that pgd should be possible under very strict conditions .
they are of course important . "

" everything is at stake - if the euro fails , europe will fail , " she told delegates at the christian democrats ' party convention , where she was reelected as head of her party .
" we need a new culture of stability in europe , " she added .
she even went so far as to criticize her predecessor , social democrat gerhard schroeder , for giving his consent for greece to join the eurozone , calling it " irresponsible " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's push for a crisis prevention mechanism are controversial harsh words on both sides the comments came as eu figures showed that greece 's deficit in 2009 rose to 15.4 percent of gdp , a big jump from the initial estimate of 13.6 percent .
greek prime minister george papandreou promptly hit back , insisting that measures proposed by germany to avoid future crises were pushing up interest rates paid by highly indebted countries like greece for their bonds .
" this could create a self-fulfilling prophecy , " papandreou said during a visit in paris .
" this could break backs .
this could force some economies into bankruptcy , " he added .
he was referring to plans by germany , supported by france , to make bondholders pay at least some of the costs in case of a default .
germany is also reluctant to extend the eurozone 's bailout package beyond 2013 .
politicians may balk at merkel 's frank words , but some analysts believe tough talk is long-overdue .
" involving investors in the costs of defaults is a good idea , " eugen keller , head of financial markets research at metzler bank told deutsche welle .
" fighting fire with fire , i.e. bailing out mortgage companies like fannie mae or freddie mac or companies like gm , as happened in the us , and in europe as well , is not a long-term solution , " he said .
keller points out that the credit bubble has built up over the years , with the discrepancies between loans issued and actual economic growth widening over several decades , especially in the us , but also in europe .
bildunterschrift : exports are the driving force behind germany 's economic motor swings and roundabouts while germany benefits enormously from the single currency , as 40 percent of its exports go to other eurozone members , and having one currency eliminates fluctuations in exchange rates , the risks of having the euro were indeed underestimated , according to keller .
" germany can afford to pay for other countries as part of the bailout package for greece for example , but at the end of the day , the differences between say germany and greece or italy in efficiency , for example when it comes to managing wage costs , are extreme , " keller told deutsche welle .
" our own stress tests as well as those of ratings agencies in 2008 , for example , have shown that the former greek currency , the drachme , would have had to be valued at 30 to 40 percent less in 2008 than at the time greece joined the eurozone . "

deutsche welle 's sports writer arnulf boettcher provides his take on germany 's new sports hero . germany has a new sports hero : sebastian vettel , the youngest world champion in formula one history .
born in the south-western german town of heppenheim , vettel wears the formula one crown at just 23 years old - and surely not for the last time .
germany 's other formula one world-champion , michael schumacher , was 25 when he won his first of a record seven titles .
like schumacher , vettel is known for his meticulousness and obsession over detail .
but unlike his role model schumacher , vettel does n't come across as so serious .
instead , vettel is seen as quick-witted , youthfully mischievous , and almost always smiling .
that 's what makes him so likeable on the formula one scene .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arnulf boettcher vettel almost become world champion last year .
he was held back by technical problems with his red bull car , but hasty mistakes were part of the problem , too .
he narrowly escaped meeting the same fate again this year .
but the setbacks only appear to have made him stronger .
in the decisive race , he took first place and made no mistakes in a dominating race where he was the best driver among his competitors .
ten pole positions and five victories make vettel a worthy and well-deserving champion .
fernando alonso is left pondering what might have been as his ferrari team implemented the wrong strategy in the final race in abu dhabi .
as for his title chances , alonso benefitted from an illegal team order : his ferrari teammate felipe massa was leading at the hockenheim race , but was ordered to let alonso through , securing an extra seven points for the spaniard .
red bull , on the other hand , did not issue team orders in the 2010 season and earned great respect from all sides .
vettel benefitted from the new points system that made formula one decidedly more exciting .
five drivers were in contention for the title heading into the second-to-last race , and for the final event four were still in the running .
in the end , vettel triumphed , after coming into the race in third place 15 points behind and without having even occupied top spot .
now germany can relish a world-title fairy tale and a youthful world champion .
but any expectations that vettel could someday overtake michael schumacher as the record world champion are misguided .
formula one has become much too fast-paced , and five different champions in the last five years speak for themselves .

deutsche welle 's sports writer arnulf boettcher provides his take on germany 's new sports hero . germany has a new sports hero : sebastian vettel , the youngest world champion in formula one history .
born in the south-western german town of heppenheim , vettel wears the formula one crown at just 23 years old - and surely not for the last time .
germany 's other formula one world-champion , michael schumacher , was 25 when he won his first of a record seven titles .
like schumacher , vettel is known for his meticulousness and obsession over detail .
but unlike his role model schumacher , vettel does n't come across as so serious .
instead , vettel is seen as quick-witted , youthfully mischievous , and almost always smiling .
that 's what makes him so likeable on the formula one scene .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arnulf boettcher vettel almost become world champion last year .
he was held back by technical problems with his red bull car , but hasty mistakes were part of the problem , too .
he narrowly escaped meeting the same fate again this year .
but the setbacks only appear to have made him stronger .
in the decisive race , he took first place and made no mistakes in a dominating race where he was the best driver among his competitors .
ten pole positions and five victories make vettel a worthy and well-deserving champion .
fernando alonso is left pondering what might have been as his ferrari team implemented the wrong strategy in the final race in abu dhabi .
as for his title chances , alonso benefitted from an illegal team order : his ferrari teammate felipe massa was leading at the hockenheim race , but was ordered to let alonso through , securing an extra seven points for the spaniard .
red bull , on the other hand , did not issue team orders in the 2010 season and earned great respect from all sides .
vettel benefitted from the new points system that made formula one decidedly more exciting .
five drivers were in contention for the title heading into the second-to-last race , and for the final event four were still in the running .
in the end , vettel triumphed , after coming into the race in third place 15 points behind and without having even occupied top spot .
now germany can relish a world-title fairy tale and a youthful world champion .
but any expectations that vettel could someday overtake michael schumacher as the record world champion are misguided .
formula one has become much too fast-paced , and five different champions in the last five years speak for themselves .

dw-world.de forget ' baby schumi , ' now sebastian vettel is world champion sebastian vettel has become the youngest world champion in the history of formula one .
if vettel appeared calm before the final race in abu dhabi , the 23-year-old german was overcome with emotion afterwards .
-lrb- 15.11.2010 -rrb- sebastian vettel races to formula one world championship german formula one driver sebastian vettel has become the sport 's youngest champion after winning the abu dhabi grand prix .
the perfectly executed race caps a successful season for vettel and his red bull team .
-lrb- 14.11.2010 -rrb- vettel remains dark horse in season that should have been his sebastian vettel is one of four drivers with a shot at the formula one drivers ' championship in abu dhabi .
but not even victory on sunday would guarantee success , in a season the young german might have dominated .

environmental campaigners are outraged , saying the crops are still potentially dangerous . according to environmental group friends of the earth europe -lrb- foee -rrb- , the european commission is planning to allow traces of non-approved gm crops in imports coming into europe -lrb- with a threshold of 0.1 percent -rrb- .
" europe would effectively open its borders for gm crops which are not authorized or assessed for their safety in any country of the world , " an foee statement said .
a number of european union governments on monday urged the bloc 's executive to allow tiny traces of gm material in food imports for human consumption as well as in animal feed , an eu source said .
however , it is not yet clear whether enough eu governments support the change to force the european commission to amend its proposal , and a final decision is unlikely before january at the earliest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers say the imports are necessary to keep prices down " the european commission is bowing to the scaremongering tactics of the biotech industry , and as a result , opening europe 's markets to unauthorized gm food and feed . "
mute schimpf , an foee food campaigner said .
" europe 's laws on genetically modified foods are there for a reason – to protect the public and the environment . "
biotech pressure environmentalists believe that the eu 's hand is being forced by the bio-technology industry , which is arguing that the eu 's total ban on gm crops could bring about a crisis in the feed sector , and farmers may be forced to slaughter animals rather than let them starve .
" this is based upon the false argument that international trade is severely disrupted when shipments of feed containing unauthorised gm feed are rejected , " the foee said .
the campaigners claimed that no shipment from any feed importing country -lrb- us , argentina or brazil -rrb- was rejected at a european port in 2010 .
" the right of the public to say no to gm foods and feeds must be respected , " schimpf demanded .
" member states should reject this proposal and maintain europe 's position on zero tolerance . "
farmers ' interests but european farmer organizations have shown little concern over the proposal .
amanda cheesley , spokeswoman for copa cogeca , the umbrella group of european farming organizations , told deutsche welle , " we are not averse to imports of gm feed coming in .
if it 's been approved under the commission 's authorization procedures , then we do n't have a problem with it . "
cheesley believes that the eu 's current zero tolerance policy is unsustainable .
" we want a solution to be found to that because in practise you ca n't have zero tolerance , " she said .
" it stops imports coming in , which means that feed prices go too high for livestock . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has criticized the eu 's gm assessment procedures cheesley says that europe 's farmers have other worries .
" we have concerns about the commission 's proposals to let member states have different policies on gm products , " she said .
the commission made legal proposals in july to allow national governments make their own decisions on the controversial crops , in a bid to break the longstanding eu deadlock on new gm product approvals .
but a new opinion from the eu council of ministers ' legal service could deal a fatal blow to the plans , after several eu governments already expressed fears that the draft law risks breaching world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- rules .
new guidelines the european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- has also set out new guidelines for biotech companies submitting gm crops for eu approval on friday , including on possible long-term effects of gm crops and their impacts on insects and other plants .
the new guidelines follow a request from eu governments in 2008 to strengthen efsa 's gm crop assessment procedures , and criticism from countries including france that efsa had failed to take full account of environmental concerns when approving new crops .
france has refused to discuss european commission proposals to let member states decide whether to grow or ban gm crops , until the eu 's assessment procedures have been strengthened .
in december , the commission is due to publish a report on the socio-economic risks and benefits of gm crops , and new rules on monitoring gm crops are due next year , as part of the wider overhaul of the bloc 's approval and assessment procedures .

the commission made legal proposals in july to allow national governments make their own decisions on the controversial crops , in a bid to break the longstanding eu deadlock on new gm product approvals .
but a new opinion from the eu council of ministers ' legal service could deal a fatal blow to the plans , after several eu governments already expressed fears that the draft law risks breaching world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- rules .
new guidelines the european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- has also set out new guidelines for biotech companies submitting gm crops for eu approval on friday , including on possible long-term effects of gm crops and their impacts on insects and other plants .
the new guidelines follow a request from eu governments in 2008 to strengthen efsa 's gm crop assessment procedures , and criticism from countries including france that efsa had failed to take full account of environmental concerns when approving new crops .
france has refused to discuss european commission proposals to let member states decide whether to grow or ban gm crops , until the eu 's assessment procedures have been strengthened .
in december , the commission is due to publish a report on the socio-economic risks and benefits of gm crops , and new rules on monitoring gm crops are due next year , as part of the wider overhaul of the bloc 's approval and assessment procedures .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 15.11.2010 library in amsterdam airport perks up weary travelers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reading as a way to pass the time during a long lay-over travelers stuck in amsterdam 's schiphol airport - one of europe 's busiest - now have a better way to shorten layover time .
they can stop off at the library and browse through a wide selection of books . it 's a daily task that dick van tol does with pride : tidying up all the books spread across tables and colorful seats .
but his workplace is n't your average library ; it 's located in the middle of one of europe 's busiest airports - schiphol in amsterdam .
the library is situated in the international transfers area , where a whole boulevard promoting dutch culture has been built .
it stands right next to schiphol 's branch of the netherlands ' main museum - the rijksmuseum .
" the idea was very simple : let 's lend books to passengers who go on holiday and they can bring the books back when they return , " said van tol , of probiblio , the institution that came up with the idea of an airport library .
" but then we realized that , logistically , it gets very complicated . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amsterdam 's airport is a major hub in central europe cozy retreat from traveling what the organizers decided to do was to arrange the space with a handful of tall shelves containing 1,200 books in 29 languages , most of them in english and german .
passengers can choose from a variety of themes - from photography and architecture to history and fiction - and browse through them , returning them to the shelves before their next flight .
they can also nestle down and relax in the enormous orange and purple chairs while flipping through the books that have caught their fancy .
" most of the 18 million people who only change planes here do n't see anything of holland , " van tol pointed out .
" and this is an opportunity to get acquainted with what holland looks like .
so , we also have - apart from the books - a photo exhibition about dutch landscapes . "
dutch culture to-go and that 's not all .
the library also boasts a multimedia offering , which includes ipads spread throughout the space so that passengers can watch videos and listen to dutch music .
occasionally , however , users try to hack the system in order to access the internet and this forces the computers to shut down for a large part of the day .
still , when they are in working order , users can hear tracks by world-famous dj tiesto or rock-chick anouk , or watch videos .
if they do n't have time to view everything that catches their eye , they can hook up to a touch screen located in the middle of the library and download videos about dutch paintings , fashion and design directly to their cell phones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the library helps travelers get to know holland - without leaving the airport something for everyone for some travelers , the paper part of schiphol 's lay-over library is just as interesting as the digital offerings .
" we 've found russian books for children here , " one male traveler said .
" it 's a good way to occupy the kids if you have time on your hands . "
another traveler said she would n't use the library because she always carries a book with her .
but the library is n't just for bookworms .
" i 've come here a second time now , " one man quipped .
" i like the ambience , so i come here immediately to relax and unwind .
i 'm just too tired to look at the books . "
project manager van tol , though , is n't deterred .
" the books are very well used here , " he said laughing - so not everyone just stops by for the comfortable chairs .
having opened in august , the library is still developing its collection .
users , for their part , have n't taken advantage of the honor system too much .
so far , only about a dozen books have been stolen , van tol said , and replacing them is cheaper than providing a 24-hour security service . author : cintia taylor -lrb- als -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they can stop off at the library and browse through a wide selection of books . it 's a daily task that dick van tol does with pride : tidying up all the books spread across tables and colorful seats .
but his workplace is n't your average library ; it 's located in the middle of one of europe 's busiest airports - schiphol in amsterdam .
the library is situated in the international transfers area , where a whole boulevard promoting dutch culture has been built .
it stands right next to schiphol 's branch of the netherlands ' main museum - the rijksmuseum .
" the idea was very simple : let 's lend books to passengers who go on holiday and they can bring the books back when they return , " said van tol , of probiblio , the institution that came up with the idea of an airport library .
" but then we realized that , logistically , it gets very complicated . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amsterdam 's airport is a major hub in central europe cozy retreat from traveling what the organizers decided to do was to arrange the space with a handful of tall shelves containing 1,200 books in 29 languages , most of them in english and german .
passengers can choose from a variety of themes - from photography and architecture to history and fiction - and browse through them , returning them to the shelves before their next flight .
they can also nestle down and relax in the enormous orange and purple chairs while flipping through the books that have caught their fancy .
" most of the 18 million people who only change planes here do n't see anything of holland , " van tol pointed out .
" and this is an opportunity to get acquainted with what holland looks like .
so , we also have - apart from the books - a photo exhibition about dutch landscapes . "
dutch culture to-go and that 's not all .
the library also boasts a multimedia offering , which includes ipads spread throughout the space so that passengers can watch videos and listen to dutch music .
occasionally , however , users try to hack the system in order to access the internet and this forces the computers to shut down for a large part of the day .
still , when they are in working order , users can hear tracks by world-famous dj tiesto or rock-chick anouk , or watch videos .
if they do n't have time to view everything that catches their eye , they can hook up to a touch screen located in the middle of the library and download videos about dutch paintings , fashion and design directly to their cell phones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the library helps travelers get to know holland - without leaving the airport something for everyone for some travelers , the paper part of schiphol 's lay-over library is just as interesting as the digital offerings .
" we 've found russian books for children here , " one male traveler said .
" it 's a good way to occupy the kids if you have time on your hands . "
another traveler said she would n't use the library because she always carries a book with her .
but the library is n't just for bookworms .
" i 've come here a second time now , " one man quipped .
" i like the ambience , so i come here immediately to relax and unwind .
i 'm just too tired to look at the books . "
project manager van tol , though , is n't deterred .
" the books are very well used here , " he said laughing - so not everyone just stops by for the comfortable chairs .
having opened in august , the library is still developing its collection .
users , for their part , have n't taken advantage of the honor system too much .
so far , only about a dozen books have been stolen , van tol said , and replacing them is cheaper than providing a 24-hour security service . author : cintia taylor -lrb- als -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the film , ' romeo and juliet in yiddish , ' gives the world 's most famous romance a new twist . move over montagues and capulets : here come the chabads and the satmars .
the two rival sects of ultra-orthodox jews face off in a witty and bittersweet film titled " romeo and juliet in yiddish . "
a chance encounter between director eve annenberg and some members of new york 's hasidic community developed into a friendship and collaboration on the film .
it explores the rough-and-tumble existence of young jews who have left the ultra-orthodox world behind .
annenberg was fascinated by a younger generation speaking a language she thought was more or less consigned to the archives . " my grandmother who spoke yiddish and my mother who spoke yiddish are now both dead , and i wo n't hear it again .
and yet , the lure of speaking yiddish and being around people with this verbal vitality is so strong , " annenberg said .
bildunterschrift : the film deals with tension between orthodox and secular jews an introduction to the bard the director also has a role in the film .
she plays an emergency room nurse who 's trying to finish her master 's degree in germanic languages .
after she accepts her advisor 's suggestion to translate " romeo and juliet " into yiddish , she recruits some young native speakers to help her out .
" i think this is the first ' romeo and juliet ' where they wake up in the morning , and romeo reaches for his glasses .
that was an important detail to me .
i wanted it to be , well , jewish .
and yes , we read a lot ! "
annenberg said with a laugh .
but shakespeare has n't been on the reading list for many in the ultra-orthodox community , which has remained closed to much of the outside world .
the young translators in the film have never heard of the bard .
they also do n't have much sense of romantic love .
life meets art in the film , annenberg 's character makes her preference for the secular clear and even declares that she hates the orthodox .
" i 'm expressing that jew-on-jew hostility that i 'd certainly like to see less of , and i see the movie as a rapprochement between the two camps , " annenberg said .
" if ever a bunch of people did n't understand each other that well , it 's the ultra-secular and the ultra-orthodox . "
in the film , the young translators ' personal stories begin to overlap with the plot of " romeo and juliet , " once they wrap their heads around it .
the back story is that these first-time actors , like their characters , are forging new lives outside of the ultra-orthodox community where they grew up .
melissa weisz plays juliet and traveled to berlin for the jewish film festival where the movie premiered this summer .
" we came to berlin and spoke to non-jews , and it gives you a whole different perception of the world , " weisz said .

it makes the whole thing worth it in a way , " he said .
the film 's next stop is london on november 16 , and it will debut in new york in january .
the screenings offer a departure from the usual shakespearean experience .

the socialists won mayoral races in the capital athens as well as in greece 's second-largest city , thessaloniki , for the first time in over two decades .
voter turnout in athens was 33 percent , with a national average of 50 percent .
the results were an encouraging sign for greek prime minister george papandreou , after drastic wage and pension cuts and consumer tax increases prompted widespread protest in recent months .
" today the nation has indicated to us that we should proceed with our course , " papandreou said .
the poll results come ahead of a monday visit by officials from the european union and the international monetary fund to assess greece 's implementation of a bailout worth 110 billion euros -lrb- $ 150 billion -rrb- .
the eu 's statistics agency , eurostat , said in statement that greece 's 2009 budget deficit reached 15.4 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , almost two percent higher than projected .
analysts say the increase makes it unlikely that greece will reach its target of lowering the deficit to 8.1 percent of gdp by the end of the year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de research -pipe- 15.11.2010 czech company produces air-cleansing paint großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photocatalysis has a wealth of potential practical uses czech scientists and companies are currently working on some exciting innovations in nanotechnology , including a new paint that uses photocatalytic oxydation to clean the air . a czech firm has recently started producing a powerful photocatalytic paint that cleans the air of cigarette smoke , viruses and bacteria in minutes , whilst the czech academy of sciences has just opened a new nanocenter to spearhead research into practical applications for nanoscience .
" this is an exciting time for science - something like a revolution , " said jiri rathousky , the project 's leader , as he demonstrated a contraption called a dip coater in the lab of the newly-opened center .
the center – aided by funding from the european union – is the pride and joy of the heyrovsky institute of physical chemistry , a rather drab concrete tower block in the northern suburbs of prague .
hidden away on the sixth floor , rathousky and his colleagues in white overalls are doing some truly remarkable things with very small materials .
the magic of photocatalysts " for example here we coat sheets of glass with a thin layer of a nanostructure called titanium dioxide , " rathousky explained .
" titanium dioxide is a very efficient photocatalyst , and in this way , we obtain a photocatalytically active surface .
this type of photocatalytically active surface can be used for example in air-conditioning , for cleaning the air , and for removal of pollutants by the action of light . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the paint cleared a cube of cigarette smoke in one hour photocatalysts , substances that speed up a chemical reaction when light hits them , have tremendous practical uses like sterilization and air cleansing .
in a small , rather dilapidated factory on the outskirts of prague , a company called advanced materials is putting titanium dioxide to use in something called photocatalytic paint , an incredibly clever , virtually translucent paint that actually cleans the air in your living room of everything from bacteria to cigarette smoke .
" even in a concentration of one cigarette per cubic metre , you see very high degradation rate , " said jan prochazka , advanced materials ' co-owner .
in one hour , he said , a cubic meter box used to test the paint is clean of cigarette smoke .
" we say -lsb- the paint will oxidize -rsb- ninety percent of all contaminants in 24 hours , but it 's much faster .
it 's just to stay on the safe side , " prochazka added .
molecular reaction the tiny titanium dioxide molecules in the paint react to uv rays in sunlight or special lamps , oxidizing everything from carcinogens to allergens to dust mites .
that means that titanium oxide molecules react with smoke or bacteria , essentially consuming it .
that leaves a by-product of water and carbon dioxide , which are harmless .
photocatalytic paint has been around for a while , but he says that their new technique has been refined to be hundreds of times more powerful and efficient , and could revolutionize the way air is cleaned in homes and offices .
however , this technique is still relatively new , and a 2008 study from the lawrence berkeley national laboratory in the us found that photocatalytic oxidization may increase the presence of formaldehyde , a potentially dangerous chemical , in a real-life , indoor setting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one industry analyst called nanotech " the oil industry of the future " undeterred , advanced materials is already shipping their product to spain , south africa and new zealand , and licences to make it in other countries are already being drawn up . the success of advanced materials and the creation of the nanocentre in prague have led some in the czech media to speak of the czech republic as having the potential to become a major force in nanotechnology in europe .
huge growth ahead but perhaps all of this trumpeting should be taken with a pinch of salt .
" nanotech is the new oil industry , " said dean freeman , a nanotech industry analyst with gartner research .
" there are many opportunities in the nanotech space for research .
the key is making a product that can get traction and be sold commercially .
from a research perspective i have not seen a great deal on nanotech from the czech republic .
-lsb- but that -rsb- could have more to do with how publicized any research is . "
however he added their success in accessing eu funds for nanotech projects – and the czech government 's commitment – certainly placed the czechs in a strong position to make a name for themselves on the global nanotech market .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 15.11.2010 leverkusen midfielder rolfes hopes injury nightmare is finally over großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolfes is a big physical player with a good passing eye a succession of knee injuries meant simon rolfes missed the 2010 world cup - a nearly worst-case scenario for any footballer .
he talked to deutsche welle about the ups and downs of trying to come back . before there was sami khedira , there was simon rolfes .
the 28-year-old midfielder was originally the one tipped to take over the stopper role from ageing veteran michael ballack .
but a meniscus injury in july 2009 ultimately stopped rolfes in his tracks just as he was reaching the peak of his career .
rolfes played through pain that fall .
after all , his club , bayer leverkusen , was topping the table , and he had established himself as a regular in the german national side .
but by october he had developed articular cartilage damage and had no option but to have an operation .
the problems did n't go away , and he was forced to go under the knife again in january and acknowledge that his dream of competing in south africa was over .
“ we were on a sensational run with leverkusen and topping the table at the winter break , ” rolfes told deutsche welle .
“ my plan was to come back in the second half of the season and be a full part of the team , since the games i had played that season had been the best of my career .
so , of course , the weeks following the january operation were really hard .
i realized i was n't going to play any role at all either in the bundesliga season or the world cup . ”
a slow but steady developer , rolfes had become an international caliber midfielder .
now he was forced to watch khedira take on a role in the german squad that he himself would have probably occupied , had he not been hurt .
khedira performed well in south africa and landed a deal with real madrid .
meanwhile , rolfes was just trying to regain his basic fitness .
daily drudgery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolfes had been getting regular starts for germany in one respect , rolfes has been lucky .
the injuries he suffered have ended many a footballer 's career .
but rehab work , to hear him describe it , is a total slog , and it is difficult for a top athlete to acknowledge that , through no fault of one 's own , one is not at the level one was just a few months before .
“ it takes time to accept and start looking forward again , ” rolfes said .
“ after the operation i was on crutches for eight weeks … and it hardly a lot of fun to lie around at home , exercising your leg or knee with a machine for six hours a day and watching your muscles virtually disappear . ”
rolfes also said that when he was able to work out with a football again , it was hard at first to commit to challenges .
overcoming fear , he said , came gradually as he got used to playing scrimmages in training sessions .
“ it 's such a long process , and in the beginning you ca n't imagine yourself being on the pitch again , ” rolfes remembered .
“ but step for step , they bring you along , and then at some point it 's over .
you get your confidence back in practice . ”
practice , in this case , does n't make perfect .
it gives a player the chance to regain what he 's lost .
positive outlook bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coming back from a knee injury takes lots of hard , boring work rolfes made his bundesliga comeback in late september , and so far , he 's been pretty good .
last month , he scored a pair of goals to help leverkusen beat wolfsburg , even though he only came on as a late substitute .
and perhaps more encouragingly , he 's played for a full 90 minutes in his last two games .
he also provided the assist for leverkusen 's lone goal in their win agaist st. pauli on the weekend , which took the team up to second in the bundesliga standings .
but will he ever be able to recapture the status he once had with germany head coach joachim loew ?
competition for spots in the midfield is fierce , with not even nominal team captain michael ballack being assured of making the squad .
rolfes draws hope from the very vagaries of football that put him out of commission for much of 2009 and 2010 .
“ a year ago , no one would have thought that bastian schweinsteiger and sami khedira would be the central midfielders at the world cup , ” rolfes said .
“ and likewise , no one knows what 's going to happen in two or three years ' time .
there 's always the possibility of injuries and other circumstances .
so you should n't concentrate on whether it 's difficult or not . ”
and rolfes does n't need to look far to find an example of hope .
his teammate at leverkusen , striker patrick helmes , was also knocked out of germany 's world cup squad by an injury , but has gotten a call-up to play in the nationalelf 's friendly against sweden this coming wednesday .
so even though rolfes has dropped off the radar screen of many casual germany fans , it would n't be all that surprising to find him on the plane when yogi and co. travel to euro 2012 in poland and ukraine , or even the 2014 world cup in brazil .
simon rolfes was interviewed by kamilla jarzina for dw-tv 's bundesliga kick off program .

if vettel appeared calm before the final race in abu dhabi , the 23-year-old german was overcome with emotion afterwards . sebastian vettel cried tears of joy after sunday 's race in abu dhabi , after his team radioed in to tell him he had clinched the world championship , seemingly against all the odds .
" unbelievable .
thank you lads .
i love you , " the 23-year-old german said with a quivering voice from the cockpit .
after that , all you could really make out on the transmission were loud cries of celebration from the man with the glittering helmet .
" baby schumi " was what the german tabloid press once called him , but it was michael schumacher himself who pointed out earlier this year that vettel had outgrown that nickname , and the youngster has now proved beyond any doubt that as world champion , he should stand in nobody 's shadow .
" i did n't know anything until i passed the checkered flag " this world championship is the high point of an already stellar career .
vettel was born in 1987 in the southwestern german town of heppenheim , and his father norbert ensured that sebastian was bitten by the motorsport bug very early .
aged four , vettel first thrashed a go-kart around his parents ' driveway , and his first successes - as with almost all modern racers - followed racing in go-karts in his youth .
eventually , the youngster was noticed , and promoted to the single-seater formula bmw racing series .
as a debutante , vettel was immediately runner-up , and the next year he came back and won an incredible 18 out of 20 races .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel 's tasted champagne as a winner five times in 2010 vettel moved on to formula 3 , where he never managed to claim the grand prize , but that was because his fame was already overtaking him and his rise up the ladder was accelerating .
in 2006 , he was given his first shot in a formula one car in a young driver test , immediately posting the fastest time .
the next year , in indianapolis , an injury to then bmw-sauber driver robert kubica gave vettel his chance on a race weekend .
still in his teens , he promptly became not only the youngest driver to compete in a grand prix -lrb- a record he has since lost -rrb- , but also the youngest-ever points-scorer in the sport 's history - bringing his bmw home in eighth on his debut .
the early-achiever continued tearing up f1 's age-related record book in the following season .
driving for the underfunded toro rosso team , vettel became the youngest ever pole-sitter and then winner in a single wet weekend in monza , doing the double for his minor team as the championship battle raged around him .
two years on , after being promoted to the red bull outfit , vettel has completed his cv , becoming the youngest world champion in the sport 's history , displacing 2008 winner lewis hamilton by less than a year .
" i am a bit speechless .
i do n't know what you are supposed to say at this moment , " a usually loquacious vettel admitted in the post-race press conference .
" to be honest i did n't know anything until i passed the checkered flag . "
vettel not only needed a win , championship leader fernando alonso had to finish fifth or lower for him to win the title , but the spanish ferrari driver had a poor race , and could only salvage seventh .
" i hate losing " bildunterschrift : the youngster 's love of winning is displayed by his trademark index-finger celebration vettel - never one to aim low - points to the three michaels as heroes of his childhood : michael schumacher , michael jordan and michael jackson .
vettel even dreamed of becoming a musician as a kid .
" it was funny when i finally realized that i did n't have the voice for it , " he admitted in later life .
nevertheless , vettel 's passion remained - he 's a huge beatles fan and record collector to this day .
vettel also tried out a number of sports in his youth before settling on motor racing .
" i never scored many goals , and did n't even get called on to play that often , " vettel lamented , recalling his time on the football pitch .
he also tried tennis , table tennis , and even beach volleyball , but never settled for long .
" i was just never the best , so i stopped playing .
i hate losing . "
finally , vettel started following in the first michael 's footsteps more seriously , turning his attention to racing – a sport whose ethos he seems to enjoy .
" it 's irrelevant whether you 're second or fifth .
the only important thing is being no. 1 . "
with 10 pole positions , five wins , and now a world championship in 2010 , vettel has achieved that goal .

if vettel appeared calm before the final race in abu dhabi , the 23-year-old german was overcome with emotion afterwards . sebastian vettel cried tears of joy after sunday 's race in abu dhabi , after his team radioed in to tell him he had clinched the world championship , seemingly against all the odds .
" unbelievable .
thank you lads .
i love you , " the 23-year-old german said with a quivering voice from the cockpit .
after that , all you could really make out on the transmission were loud cries of celebration from the man with the glittering helmet .
" baby schumi " was what the german tabloid press once called him , but it was michael schumacher himself who pointed out earlier this year that vettel had outgrown that nickname , and the youngster has now proved beyond any doubt that as world champion , he should stand in nobody 's shadow .
" i did n't know anything until i passed the checkered flag " this world championship is the high point of an already stellar career .
vettel was born in 1987 in the southwestern german town of heppenheim , and his father norbert ensured that sebastian was bitten by the motorsport bug very early .
aged four , vettel first thrashed a go-kart around his parents ' driveway , and his first successes - as with almost all modern racers - followed racing in go-karts in his youth .
eventually , the youngster was noticed , and promoted to the single-seater formula bmw racing series .
as a debutante , vettel was immediately runner-up , and the next year he came back and won an incredible 18 out of 20 races .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel 's tasted champagne as a winner five times in 2010 vettel moved on to formula 3 , where he never managed to claim the grand prize , but that was because his fame was already overtaking him and his rise up the ladder was accelerating .
in 2006 , he was given his first shot in a formula one car in a young driver test , immediately posting the fastest time .
the next year , in indianapolis , an injury to then bmw-sauber driver robert kubica gave vettel his chance on a race weekend .
still in his teens , he promptly became not only the youngest driver to compete in a grand prix -lrb- a record he has since lost -rrb- , but also the youngest-ever points-scorer in the sport 's history - bringing his bmw home in eighth on his debut .
the early-achiever continued tearing up f1 's age-related record book in the following season .
driving for the underfunded toro rosso team , vettel became the youngest ever pole-sitter and then winner in a single wet weekend in monza , doing the double for his minor team as the championship battle raged around him .
two years on , after being promoted to the red bull outfit , vettel has completed his cv , becoming the youngest world champion in the sport 's history , displacing 2008 winner lewis hamilton by less than a year .
" i am a bit speechless .
i do n't know what you are supposed to say at this moment , " a usually loquacious vettel admitted in the post-race press conference .
" to be honest i did n't know anything until i passed the checkered flag . "
vettel not only needed a win , championship leader fernando alonso had to finish fifth or lower for him to win the title , but the spanish ferrari driver had a poor race , and could only salvage seventh .
" i hate losing " bildunterschrift : the youngster 's love of winning is displayed by his trademark index-finger celebration vettel - never one to aim low - points to the three michaels as heroes of his childhood : michael schumacher , michael jordan and michael jackson .
vettel even dreamed of becoming a musician as a kid .
" it was funny when i finally realized that i did n't have the voice for it , " he admitted in later life .
nevertheless , vettel 's passion remained - he 's a huge beatles fan and record collector to this day .
vettel also tried out a number of sports in his youth before settling on motor racing .
" i never scored many goals , and did n't even get called on to play that often , " vettel lamented , recalling his time on the football pitch .
he also tried tennis , table tennis , and even beach volleyball , but never settled for long .
" i was just never the best , so i stopped playing .
i hate losing . "
finally , vettel started following in the first michael 's footsteps more seriously , turning his attention to racing – a sport whose ethos he seems to enjoy .
" it 's irrelevant whether you 're second or fifth .
the only important thing is being no. 1 . "
with 10 pole positions , five wins , and now a world championship in 2010 , vettel has achieved that goal .

meanwhile , others wondered how a problem of this magnitude could even happen . the death toll from haiti 's cholera epidemic has reached more than 900 and the disease is present in six of the 10 provinces of the earthquake-battered caribbean country , the health ministry said over the weekend .
more than 15,000 people have been infected since the epidemic 's outbreak in late october , the health ministry said sunday , and the epidemic showed no sign of abating .
there were 120 new deaths since friday 's toll .
according to the ministry on monday , 917 people have died of the disease so far .
worse expected to come according to un estimates , up to 200,000 people could fall ill with cholera .
the world body on friday applied for another $ 163 million -lrb- 120 million euros -rrb- in donor aid .
the disease broke out in the northern artibonite region , where it continues to be most concentrated .
it is contracted through contaminated water and causes severe diarrhea and vomiting .
bildunterschrift : the fear is growing that the epidemic will spread to refugee camps authorities and international aid agencies were struggling to contain the latest crisis afflicting the impoverished island nation .
efforts are centering on preventing the disease from spreading in crowded city slums and tent camps that house over 1.3 million homeless people who survived the cataclysmic earthquake , nearly a year ago .
but the facts of the epidemic raise the question of how such a preventable disease could break out in a country that has been flooded with hundreds of millions of euros in foreign assistance since the earthquake .
resource coordination is problem " huge sums in aid money have gone there , but the people in the north seem to have been left to their own devices , " sven stockrahm , a journalist with german newspaper die zeit who wrote about the earthquake , told deutsche welle .
stockrahm stressed that his critical remarks were not aimed at humanitarian aid workers , who by all accounts are doing vital work under very trying circumstances .
the key question is whether a better coordination of the resources in place could have prevented cholera from occurring in the first place .
bildunterschrift : aid workers are working ahrd to meet the needs of growing patient numbers but clear answers are difficult to come by where haiti is concerned .
the causes of cholera , lack of clean drinking water and poor sanitation are well-known , but at present , no one is sure exactly how the disease even broke out in artibonite .
poor sanitation , even pre-earthquake what is certain is that conditions in haiti even before the earthquake were far from adequate .
a study by the world health organization and unicef found that open defecation was prevalent among just under half of rural haitians and that 3.7 million of haiti 's total population of 9 million had no reliable source of clean drinking water .
moreover , from 1990 to 2008 , conditions deteriorated .
a similar study by the united nations in 2009 determined that 42 percent of haitians were not using an " improved water source . "
haiti ranks dead last among countries in south america and the caribbean in all major water and hygiene categories .
" cholera is a sickness of poverty that is common in refugee camps where there ’ s not enough drinking water , " ernst diekmann - a doctor with germany 's society for technical cooperation , or gtz - told deutsche welle .
" haiti was already an underprivileged country , and the situation was exacerbated by the natural catastrophe . "
problem exacerbated by refugees nonetheless , aid workers acknowledge that pre-existing deficiencies and the slow recovery process are two parts of the same overall problem that encouraged the cholera outbreak .
and the issue of earthquake refugees only exacerbates those problems .
bildunterschrift : as the disease spreads , burials are on the rise " the dramatic thing about haiti is that even before the earthquake the health infrastructure was fully inadequate , " said joost butenop , a medical adviser to the aid organization caritas .
" aid organizations have concentrated on the region specifically affected -lsb- by the earthquake -rsb- and have n't been following the refugees to any great extent . "
organizational challenges earlier this year , the humanitarian organization refugees international went even further , claiming that recovery efforts in haiti were not just sluggish , but " paralyzed . "
off the record , many people who work in the aid and assistance sector say that shortcomings in coordination often prevent help from getting where it 's needed - or problems from being effectively anticipated .
that task falls to the united nations and the haitian government , and representatives of the former have openly admitted that the situation in haiti tests their limits .
the will to help is there .
germany 's ministry for economic cooperation and development , for instance , says that most of the 51.4 million euros -lrb- $ 72 million -rrb- it was allocated for haiti has already been distributed or earmarked for future projects .
yet merely distinguishing between emergency needs and long-term developmental requirements , and figuring out which government ministry is responsible , can be a complicated process .
and coordinating the enormous number of private and public organizations trying to help in haiti represents an organizational task of the highest order .
at this point , no one can say definitively whether any particular authority should have foreseen the danger of cholera in haiti and taken precautionary steps to prevent it .
but the outbreak of the disease in a country that has been the focus of so much international assistance suggests that overall organization and coordination remain problems that hinder aid initiatives from having their maximum possible effect .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de research -pipe- 15.11.2010 czech company produces air-cleansing paint großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photocatalysis has a wealth of potential practical uses czech scientists and companies are currently working on some exciting innovations in nanotechnology , including a new paint that uses photocatalytic oxydation to clean the air . a czech firm has recently started producing a powerful photocatalytic paint that cleans the air of cigarette smoke , viruses and bacteria in minutes , whilst the czech academy of sciences has just opened a new nanocenter to spearhead research into practical applications for nanoscience .
" this is an exciting time for science - something like a revolution , " said jiri rathousky , the project 's leader , as he demonstrated a contraption called a dip coater in the lab of the newly-opened center .
the center – aided by funding from the european union – is the pride and joy of the heyrovsky institute of physical chemistry , a rather drab concrete tower block in the northern suburbs of prague .
hidden away on the sixth floor , rathousky and his colleagues in white overalls are doing some truly remarkable things with very small materials .
the magic of photocatalysts " for example here we coat sheets of glass with a thin layer of a nanostructure called titanium dioxide , " rathousky explained .
" titanium dioxide is a very efficient photocatalyst , and in this way , we obtain a photocatalytically active surface .
this type of photocatalytically active surface can be used for example in air-conditioning , for cleaning the air , and for removal of pollutants by the action of light . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the paint cleared a cube of cigarette smoke in one hour photocatalysts , substances that speed up a chemical reaction when light hits them , have tremendous practical uses like sterilization and air cleansing .
in a small , rather dilapidated factory on the outskirts of prague , a company called advanced materials is putting titanium dioxide to use in something called photocatalytic paint , an incredibly clever , virtually translucent paint that actually cleans the air in your living room of everything from bacteria to cigarette smoke .
" even in a concentration of one cigarette per cubic metre , you see very high degradation rate , " said jan prochazka , advanced materials ' co-owner .
in one hour , he said , a cubic meter box used to test the paint is clean of cigarette smoke .
" we say -lsb- the paint will oxidize -rsb- ninety percent of all contaminants in 24 hours , but it 's much faster .
it 's just to stay on the safe side , " prochazka added .
molecular reaction the tiny titanium dioxide molecules in the paint react to uv rays in sunlight or special lamps , oxidizing everything from carcinogens to allergens to dust mites .
that means that titanium oxide molecules react with smoke or bacteria , essentially consuming it .
that leaves a by-product of water and carbon dioxide , which are harmless .
photocatalytic paint has been around for a while , but he says that their new technique has been refined to be hundreds of times more powerful and efficient , and could revolutionize the way air is cleaned in homes and offices .
however , this technique is still relatively new , and a 2008 study from the lawrence berkeley national laboratory in the us found that photocatalytic oxidization may increase the presence of formaldehyde , a potentially dangerous chemical , in a real-life , indoor setting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one industry analyst called nanotech " the oil industry of the future " undeterred , advanced materials is already shipping their product to spain , south africa and new zealand , and licences to make it in other countries are already being drawn up . the success of advanced materials and the creation of the nanocentre in prague have led some in the czech media to speak of the czech republic as having the potential to become a major force in nanotechnology in europe .
huge growth ahead but perhaps all of this trumpeting should be taken with a pinch of salt .
" nanotech is the new oil industry , " said dean freeman , a nanotech industry analyst with gartner research .
" there are many opportunities in the nanotech space for research .
the key is making a product that can get traction and be sold commercially .
from a research perspective i have not seen a great deal on nanotech from the czech republic .
-lsb- but that -rsb- could have more to do with how publicized any research is . "
however he added their success in accessing eu funds for nanotech projects – and the czech government 's commitment – certainly placed the czechs in a strong position to make a name for themselves on the global nanotech market .

the filter , about the size and shape of a teabag , would be inexpensive , easy to distribute and simple to use . marelize botes is conducting a final set of tests on a new type of diminutive water filter before industrial production can begin .
the microbiologist pours water from a plastic bottle though a high-tech , teabag-sized filter before analyzing it in her in her laboratory at the university of stellenbosch in south africa . " the filter is much cheaper than bottled water as well as any other filter on the market , " she told deutsche welle . instead of being filled with black or green tea , the bag contains active carbon granules and is made from nanofibers treated with biocide , which kills bacteria rather than simply filtering them from the water . nanotech for pennies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting clean drinking water everywhere is not always possible " this project takes nanotechnology to the poorest of the poor people who live in this world , and it will make a difference in their lives , " said eugen cloete , who in addition to inventing the filter is dean of the faculty of science at stellenbosch university and chair of stellenbosch university 's water institute . with some 300 million people in africa - and over a billion worldwide - living without access to clean drinking water , the need for such a filter is huge .
when in mass production , the developers said they expect the teabag to cost just a few south african cents -lrb- under half a us cent and under a third of a euro cent -rrb- . in addition to being inexpensive , botes said , the filter is also easy to distribute to rural area and simple to use as it can be place in an adapter that fits on nearly any regular-sized plastic bottle .
each filter can clean one liter -lrb- one quart -rrb- of the most polluted water to the point where it is completely safe to drink .
once used , the filter can be disposed of and is biodegradable . african countries , led by somalia , mauritania and sudan , were ranked to have the most vulnerable water supplies , according to a june report by uk-based risk consultancy firm maplecroft . decentralized use bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the filter can be used anywhere , cloete said the filter 's small size and light weight make it ideal for rural areas where other means of filtration do not exist , cloete said . " it is simply impossible to build purification infrastructure at every polluted stream , " cloete said .
" so we have to take the solution to the people .
the water is cleaned right then and there when you drink from the bottle . " the filter is now undergoing testing by the south african bureau of standards , after which cloete and his team hope it can be rolled out to the united nations and non-governmental organizations that have expressed interest in it by the end of the year . the project grew out of research into larger filters , according to cloete . " we were busy developing filters for larger applications , but when you do the tests in the labatory you do the tests on a much smaller scale , " he said .
" the results we were getting on a smaller amount of water promoted me to think about a smaller application . " author : joerg poppendieck , sean sinico editor : anke rasper send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she gained widespread support at this week 's party conference , which comes ahead of several key state elections in 2011 . german chancellor angela merkel has been reelected as head of her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- party , a sign that the party stands behind merkel despite recent doubts of the effectiveness of merkel and the cdu in leading the government . merkel ran unopposed and garnered the support of just over 90 percent of her party colleagues .
two years ago she received 95 percent of the votes when she was elected party head .
observers believed a drastic drop in that number would have indicated discontent from within the cdu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stuttgart rail project has proven to be deeply divisive merkel 's cdu and its junior coalition partner , the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , have taken a beating in the opinion polls over the last year over an unpopular bailout for fellow eurozone member greece , the decision to extend the operating lives of nuclear power plants and an expensive rail infrastructure project in stuttgart that has inspired massive local protests . with elections to be held in six of germany 's 16 states , 2011 is set to be a key year for merkel 's government .
earlier this year , the center-right coalition already suffered a major blow when it lost power in the country 's most populous state north rhine-westphalia and control of the bundesrat , the country 's upper house of parliament , along with it . leadership renewal the cdu took another hit when president horst koehler stepped down in june after being criticized for suggesting the german military had a role in protecting the country 's economic interests .
several other big names have left the political stage and merkel is set to get a new team of leaders standing behind her . around 1,000 cdu delegates are gathered in karlsruhe , where the party also voted on merkel ’ s four deputy leaders .
education minister annette schavan was reelected to the post , while environment minister norbert roettgen , labor minister ursula von der leyen and hesse premier volker bouffier recieved their first nominations . schaeuble put to task ahead of the party conference , merkel reiterated her support for finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , whose suitability for the job has been questioned recently due to chronic health problems , which led the minister to a three-week hospitalization last month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble insists he 's fit enough to keep his post merkel maintained that schaeuble was a capable minister and that the party ’ s support for him was strong , telling zdf public television , " i enjoy being chancellor with schaeuble as my finance minister . " however , schaeuble ’ s health was not the only source of stress for the finance minister . merkel and schaeuble - who just returned from a g20 conference in seoul , where they defended germany ’ s trade surplus - have repelled demands for tax cuts , as politicians from both within and outside of the party have called for a strong reform to germany ’ s tax laws . cdu parliamentarian christian von stetten told the sunday newspaper bild am sonntag that an improvement to the current laws was needed : " if we don ’ t put through a tax simplification law that earns that name , then we aren ’ t taking our voters seriously , " he said . schaeuble , meanwhile , said that he was open to discussions on improving the tax law with government deputies in parliament . divisive issues also on monday , german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg is due to present delegates in karlsruhe with his plan for reforming germany ’ s military .
the delegates are expected to pass a resolution on ending military conscription in germany , despite the fact that the party has traditionally advocated maintaining compulsory military service for young men .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg advocates an ende to conscription another topic to be discussed is the question of preimplantation genetic diagnosis - the testing of artificially fertilized human eggs for congenital disorders prior to implantation . the issue has been hotly debated in recent weeks , with opponents of the practice claiming it to be a precursor to genetic engineering of human beings .
while the cdu remains divided over the matter , merkel has come out in favor of a ban , claiming it was impossible to differentiate between minor and major congenital disorders . merkel told zdf that she was , however , open to discussion on the topic .
" we will conduct this debate with great mutual respect , " she said .
she added that neither position in the debate was the " christian " one , as the issue divided even church authorities . author : david levitz , holly fox -lrb- afp , ap , dpa , -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stuttgart rail project has proven to be deeply divisive merkel 's cdu and its junior coalition partner , the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , have taken a beating in the opinion polls over the last year over an unpopular bailout for fellow eurozone member greece , the decision to extend the operating lives of nuclear power plants and an expensive rail infrastructure project in stuttgart that has inspired massive local protests . with elections to be held in six of germany 's 16 states , 2011 is set to be a key year for merkel 's government .
earlier this year , the center-right coalition already suffered a major blow when it lost power in the country 's most populous state north rhine-westphalia and control of the bundesrat , the country 's upper house of parliament , along with it . leadership renewal the cdu took another hit when president horst koehler stepped down in june after being criticized for suggesting the german military had a role in protecting the country 's economic interests .
several other big names have left the political stage and merkel is set to get a new team of leaders standing behind her . around 1,000 cdu delegates are gathered in karlsruhe , where the party also voted on merkel ’ s four deputy leaders .
education minister annette schavan was reelected to the post , while environment minister norbert roettgen , labor minister ursula von der leyen and hesse premier volker bouffier recieved their first nominations . schaeuble put to task ahead of the party conference , merkel reiterated her support for finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , whose suitability for the job has been questioned recently due to chronic health problems , which led the minister to a three-week hospitalization last month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble insists he 's fit enough to keep his post merkel maintained that schaeuble was a capable minister and that the party ’ s support for him was strong , telling zdf public television , " i enjoy being chancellor with schaeuble as my finance minister . " however , schaeuble ’ s health was not the only source of stress for the finance minister . merkel and schaeuble - who just returned from a g20 conference in seoul , where they defended germany ’ s trade surplus - have repelled demands for tax cuts , as politicians from both within and outside of the party have called for a strong reform to germany ’ s tax laws . cdu parliamentarian christian von stetten told the sunday newspaper bild am sonntag that an improvement to the current laws was needed : " if we don ’ t put through a tax simplification law that earns that name , then we aren ’ t taking our voters seriously , " he said . schaeuble , meanwhile , said that he was open to discussions on improving the tax law with government deputies in parliament . divisive issues also on monday , german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg is due to present delegates in karlsruhe with his plan for reforming germany ’ s military .
the delegates are expected to pass a resolution on ending military conscription in germany , despite the fact that the party has traditionally advocated maintaining compulsory military service for young men .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg advocates an ende to conscription another topic to be discussed is the question of preimplantation genetic diagnosis - the testing of artificially fertilized human eggs for congenital disorders prior to implantation . the issue has been hotly debated in recent weeks , with opponents of the practice claiming it to be a precursor to genetic engineering of human beings .
while the cdu remains divided over the matter , merkel has come out in favor of a ban , claiming it was impossible to differentiate between minor and major congenital disorders . merkel told zdf that she was , however , open to discussion on the topic .
" we will conduct this debate with great mutual respect , " she said .
she added that neither position in the debate was the " christian " one , as the issue divided even church authorities . author : david levitz , holly fox -lrb- afp , ap , dpa , -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the socialists won mayoral races in the capital athens as well as in greece 's second-largest city , thessaloniki , for the first time in over two decades .
voter turnout in athens was 33 percent , with a national average of 50 percent .
the results were an encouraging sign for greek prime minister george papandreou , after drastic wage and pension cuts and consumer tax increases prompted widespread protest in recent months .
" today the nation has indicated to us that we should proceed with our course , " papandreou said .
the poll results come ahead of a monday visit by officials from the european union and the international monetary fund to assess greece 's implementation of a bailout worth 110 billion euros -lrb- $ 150 billion -rrb- .
the eu 's statistics agency , eurostat , said in statement that greece 's 2009 budget deficit reached 15.4 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , almost two percent higher than projected .
analysts say the increase makes it unlikely that greece will reach its target of lowering the deficit to 8.1 percent of gdp by the end of the year .

the filter , about the size and shape of a teabag , would be inexpensive , easy to distribute and simple to use . marelize botes is conducting a final set of tests on a new type of diminutive water filter before industrial production can begin .
the microbiologist pours water from a plastic bottle though a high-tech , teabag-sized filter before analyzing it in her in her laboratory at the university of stellenbosch in south africa . " the filter is much cheaper than bottled water as well as any other filter on the market , " she told deutsche welle . instead of being filled with black or green tea , the bag contains active carbon granules and is made from nanofibers treated with biocide , which kills bacteria rather than simply filtering them from the water . nanotech for pennies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting clean drinking water everywhere is not always possible " this project takes nanotechnology to the poorest of the poor people who live in this world , and it will make a difference in their lives , " said eugen cloete , who in addition to inventing the filter is dean of the faculty of science at stellenbosch university and chair of stellenbosch university 's water institute . with some 300 million people in africa - and over a billion worldwide - living without access to clean drinking water , the need for such a filter is huge .
when in mass production , the developers said they expect the teabag to cost just a few south african cents -lrb- under half a us cent and under a third of a euro cent -rrb- . in addition to being inexpensive , botes said , the filter is also easy to distribute to rural area and simple to use as it can be place in an adapter that fits on nearly any regular-sized plastic bottle .
each filter can clean one liter -lrb- one quart -rrb- of the most polluted water to the point where it is completely safe to drink .
once used , the filter can be disposed of and is biodegradable . african countries , led by somalia , mauritania and sudan , were ranked to have the most vulnerable water supplies , according to a june report by uk-based risk consultancy firm maplecroft . decentralized use bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the filter can be used anywhere , cloete said the filter 's small size and light weight make it ideal for rural areas where other means of filtration do not exist , cloete said . " it is simply impossible to build purification infrastructure at every polluted stream , " cloete said .
" so we have to take the solution to the people .
the water is cleaned right then and there when you drink from the bottle . " the filter is now undergoing testing by the south african bureau of standards , after which cloete and his team hope it can be rolled out to the united nations and non-governmental organizations that have expressed interest in it by the end of the year . the project grew out of research into larger filters , according to cloete . " we were busy developing filters for larger applications , but when you do the tests in the labatory you do the tests on a much smaller scale , " he said .
" the results we were getting on a smaller amount of water promoted me to think about a smaller application . " author : joerg poppendieck , sean sinico editor : anke rasper send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 15.11.2010 leverkusen midfielder rolfes hopes injury nightmare is finally over großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolfes is a big physical player with a good passing eye a succession of knee injuries meant simon rolfes missed the 2010 world cup - a nearly worst-case scenario for any footballer .
he talked to deutsche welle about the ups and downs of trying to come back . before there was sami khedira , there was simon rolfes .
the 28-year-old midfielder was originally the one tipped to take over the stopper role from ageing veteran michael ballack .
but a meniscus injury in july 2009 ultimately stopped rolfes in his tracks just as he was reaching the peak of his career .
rolfes played through pain that fall .
after all , his club , bayer leverkusen , was topping the table , and he had established himself as a regular in the german national side .
but by october he had developed articular cartilage damage and had no option but to have an operation .
the problems did n't go away , and he was forced to go under the knife again in january and acknowledge that his dream of competing in south africa was over .
“ we were on a sensational run with leverkusen and topping the table at the winter break , ” rolfes told deutsche welle .
“ my plan was to come back in the second half of the season and be a full part of the team , since the games i had played that season had been the best of my career .
so , of course , the weeks following the january operation were really hard .
i realized i was n't going to play any role at all either in the bundesliga season or the world cup . ”
a slow but steady developer , rolfes had become an international caliber midfielder .
now he was forced to watch khedira take on a role in the german squad that he himself would have probably occupied , had he not been hurt .
khedira performed well in south africa and landed a deal with real madrid .
meanwhile , rolfes was just trying to regain his basic fitness .
daily drudgery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolfes had been getting regular starts for germany in one respect , rolfes has been lucky .
the injuries he suffered have ended many a footballer 's career .
but rehab work , to hear him describe it , is a total slog , and it is difficult for a top athlete to acknowledge that , through no fault of one 's own , one is not at the level one was just a few months before .
“ it takes time to accept and start looking forward again , ” rolfes said .
“ after the operation i was on crutches for eight weeks … and it hardly a lot of fun to lie around at home , exercising your leg or knee with a machine for six hours a day and watching your muscles virtually disappear . ”
rolfes also said that when he was able to work out with a football again , it was hard at first to commit to challenges .
overcoming fear , he said , came gradually as he got used to playing scrimmages in training sessions .
“ it 's such a long process , and in the beginning you ca n't imagine yourself being on the pitch again , ” rolfes remembered .
“ but step for step , they bring you along , and then at some point it 's over .
you get your confidence back in practice . ”
practice , in this case , does n't make perfect .
it gives a player the chance to regain what he 's lost .
positive outlook bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coming back from a knee injury takes lots of hard , boring work rolfes made his bundesliga comeback in late september , and so far , he 's been pretty good .
last month , he scored a pair of goals to help leverkusen beat wolfsburg , even though he only came on as a late substitute .
and perhaps more encouragingly , he 's played for a full 90 minutes in his last two games .
he also provided the assist for leverkusen 's lone goal in their win agaist st. pauli on the weekend , which took the team up to second in the bundesliga standings .
but will he ever be able to recapture the status he once had with germany head coach joachim loew ?
competition for spots in the midfield is fierce , with not even nominal team captain michael ballack being assured of making the squad .
rolfes draws hope from the very vagaries of football that put him out of commission for much of 2009 and 2010 .
“ a year ago , no one would have thought that bastian schweinsteiger and sami khedira would be the central midfielders at the world cup , ” rolfes said .
“ and likewise , no one knows what 's going to happen in two or three years ' time .
there 's always the possibility of injuries and other circumstances .
so you should n't concentrate on whether it 's difficult or not . ”
and rolfes does n't need to look far to find an example of hope .
his teammate at leverkusen , striker patrick helmes , was also knocked out of germany 's world cup squad by an injury , but has gotten a call-up to play in the nationalelf 's friendly against sweden this coming wednesday .
so even though rolfes has dropped off the radar screen of many casual germany fans , it would n't be all that surprising to find him on the plane when yogi and co. travel to euro 2012 in poland and ukraine , or even the 2014 world cup in brazil .
simon rolfes was interviewed by kamilla jarzina for dw-tv 's bundesliga kick off program .

they can stop off at the library and browse through a wide selection of books . it 's a daily task that dick van tol does with pride : tidying up all the books spread across tables and colorful seats .
but his workplace is n't your average library ; it 's located in the middle of one of europe 's busiest airports - schiphol in amsterdam .
the library is situated in the international transfers area , where a whole boulevard promoting dutch culture has been built .
it stands right next to schiphol 's branch of the netherlands ' main museum - the rijksmuseum .
" the idea was very simple : let 's lend books to passengers who go on holiday and they can bring the books back when they return , " said van tol , of probiblio , the institution that came up with the idea of an airport library .
" but then we realized that , logistically , it gets very complicated . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amsterdam 's airport is a major hub in central europe cozy retreat from traveling what the organizers decided to do was to arrange the space with a handful of tall shelves containing 1,200 books in 29 languages , most of them in english and german .
passengers can choose from a variety of themes - from photography and architecture to history and fiction - and browse through them , returning them to the shelves before their next flight .
they can also nestle down and relax in the enormous orange and purple chairs while flipping through the books that have caught their fancy .
" most of the 18 million people who only change planes here do n't see anything of holland , " van tol pointed out .
" and this is an opportunity to get acquainted with what holland looks like .
so , we also have - apart from the books - a photo exhibition about dutch landscapes . "
dutch culture to-go and that 's not all .
the library also boasts a multimedia offering , which includes ipads spread throughout the space so that passengers can watch videos and listen to dutch music .
occasionally , however , users try to hack the system in order to access the internet and this forces the computers to shut down for a large part of the day .
still , when they are in working order , users can hear tracks by world-famous dj tiesto or rock-chick anouk , or watch videos .
if they do n't have time to view everything that catches their eye , they can hook up to a touch screen located in the middle of the library and download videos about dutch paintings , fashion and design directly to their cell phones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the library helps travelers get to know holland - without leaving the airport something for everyone for some travelers , the paper part of schiphol 's lay-over library is just as interesting as the digital offerings .
" we 've found russian books for children here , " one male traveler said .
" it 's a good way to occupy the kids if you have time on your hands . "
another traveler said she would n't use the library because she always carries a book with her .
but the library is n't just for bookworms .
" i 've come here a second time now , " one man quipped .
" i like the ambience , so i come here immediately to relax and unwind .
i 'm just too tired to look at the books . "
project manager van tol , though , is n't deterred .
" the books are very well used here , " he said laughing - so not everyone just stops by for the comfortable chairs .
having opened in august , the library is still developing its collection .
users , for their part , have n't taken advantage of the honor system too much .
so far , only about a dozen books have been stolen , van tol said , and replacing them is cheaper than providing a 24-hour security service . author : cintia taylor -lrb- als -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they can stop off at the library and browse through a wide selection of books . it 's a daily task that dick van tol does with pride : tidying up all the books spread across tables and colorful seats .
but his workplace is n't your average library ; it 's located in the middle of one of europe 's busiest airports - schiphol in amsterdam .
the library is situated in the international transfers area , where a whole boulevard promoting dutch culture has been built .
it stands right next to schiphol 's branch of the netherlands ' main museum - the rijksmuseum .
" the idea was very simple : let 's lend books to passengers who go on holiday and they can bring the books back when they return , " said van tol , of probiblio , the institution that came up with the idea of an airport library .
" but then we realized that , logistically , it gets very complicated . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amsterdam 's airport is a major hub in central europe cozy retreat from traveling what the organizers decided to do was to arrange the space with a handful of tall shelves containing 1,200 books in 29 languages , most of them in english and german .
passengers can choose from a variety of themes - from photography and architecture to history and fiction - and browse through them , returning them to the shelves before their next flight .
they can also nestle down and relax in the enormous orange and purple chairs while flipping through the books that have caught their fancy .
" most of the 18 million people who only change planes here do n't see anything of holland , " van tol pointed out .
" and this is an opportunity to get acquainted with what holland looks like .
so , we also have - apart from the books - a photo exhibition about dutch landscapes . "
dutch culture to-go and that 's not all .
the library also boasts a multimedia offering , which includes ipads spread throughout the space so that passengers can watch videos and listen to dutch music .
occasionally , however , users try to hack the system in order to access the internet and this forces the computers to shut down for a large part of the day .
still , when they are in working order , users can hear tracks by world-famous dj tiesto or rock-chick anouk , or watch videos .
if they do n't have time to view everything that catches their eye , they can hook up to a touch screen located in the middle of the library and download videos about dutch paintings , fashion and design directly to their cell phones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the library helps travelers get to know holland - without leaving the airport something for everyone for some travelers , the paper part of schiphol 's lay-over library is just as interesting as the digital offerings .
" we 've found russian books for children here , " one male traveler said .
" it 's a good way to occupy the kids if you have time on your hands . "
another traveler said she would n't use the library because she always carries a book with her .
but the library is n't just for bookworms .
" i 've come here a second time now , " one man quipped .
" i like the ambience , so i come here immediately to relax and unwind .
i 'm just too tired to look at the books . "
project manager van tol , though , is n't deterred .
" the books are very well used here , " he said laughing - so not everyone just stops by for the comfortable chairs .
having opened in august , the library is still developing its collection .
users , for their part , have n't taken advantage of the honor system too much .

the filter , about the size and shape of a teabag , would be inexpensive , easy to distribute and simple to use . marelize botes is conducting a final set of tests on a new type of diminutive water filter before industrial production can begin .
the microbiologist pours water from a plastic bottle though a high-tech , teabag-sized filter before analyzing it in her in her laboratory at the university of stellenbosch in south africa . " the filter is much cheaper than bottled water as well as any other filter on the market , " she told deutsche welle . instead of being filled with black or green tea , the bag contains active carbon granules and is made from nanofibers treated with biocide , which kills bacteria rather than simply filtering them from the water . nanotech for pennies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting clean drinking water everywhere is not always possible " this project takes nanotechnology to the poorest of the poor people who live in this world , and it will make a difference in their lives , " said eugen cloete , who in addition to inventing the filter is dean of the faculty of science at stellenbosch university and chair of stellenbosch university 's water institute . with some 300 million people in africa - and over a billion worldwide - living without access to clean drinking water , the need for such a filter is huge .
when in mass production , the developers said they expect the teabag to cost just a few south african cents -lrb- under half a us cent and under a third of a euro cent -rrb- . in addition to being inexpensive , botes said , the filter is also easy to distribute to rural area and simple to use as it can be place in an adapter that fits on nearly any regular-sized plastic bottle .

he talked to deutsche welle about the ups and downs of trying to come back . before there was sami khedira , there was simon rolfes .
the 28-year-old midfielder was originally the one tipped to take over the stopper role from ageing veteran michael ballack .
but a meniscus injury in july 2009 ultimately stopped rolfes in his tracks just as he was reaching the peak of his career .
rolfes played through pain that fall .
after all , his club , bayer leverkusen , was topping the table , and he had established himself as a regular in the german national side .
but by october he had developed articular cartilage damage and had no option but to have an operation .
the problems did n't go away , and he was forced to go under the knife again in january and acknowledge that his dream of competing in south africa was over .
“ we were on a sensational run with leverkusen and topping the table at the winter break , ” rolfes told deutsche welle .
“ my plan was to come back in the second half of the season and be a full part of the team , since the games i had played that season had been the best of my career .
so , of course , the weeks following the january operation were really hard .
i realized i was n't going to play any role at all either in the bundesliga season or the world cup . ”
a slow but steady developer , rolfes had become an international caliber midfielder .
now he was forced to watch khedira take on a role in the german squad that he himself would have probably occupied , had he not been hurt .
khedira performed well in south africa and landed a deal with real madrid .
meanwhile , rolfes was just trying to regain his basic fitness .
daily drudgery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolfes had been getting regular starts for germany in one respect , rolfes has been lucky .
the injuries he suffered have ended many a footballer 's career .
but rehab work , to hear him describe it , is a total slog , and it is difficult for a top athlete to acknowledge that , through no fault of one 's own , one is not at the level one was just a few months before .
“ it takes time to accept and start looking forward again , ” rolfes said .
“ after the operation i was on crutches for eight weeks … and it hardly a lot of fun to lie around at home , exercising your leg or knee with a machine for six hours a day and watching your muscles virtually disappear . ”
rolfes also said that when he was able to work out with a football again , it was hard at first to commit to challenges .
overcoming fear , he said , came gradually as he got used to playing scrimmages in training sessions .
“ it 's such a long process , and in the beginning you ca n't imagine yourself being on the pitch again , ” rolfes remembered .
“ but step for step , they bring you along , and then at some point it 's over .
you get your confidence back in practice . ”
practice , in this case , does n't make perfect .
it gives a player the chance to regain what he 's lost .
positive outlook bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coming back from a knee injury takes lots of hard , boring work rolfes made his bundesliga comeback in late september , and so far , he 's been pretty good .
last month , he scored a pair of goals to help leverkusen beat wolfsburg , even though he only came on as a late substitute .
and perhaps more encouragingly , he 's played for a full 90 minutes in his last two games .
he also provided the assist for leverkusen 's lone goal in their win agaist st. pauli on the weekend , which took the team up to second in the bundesliga standings .
but will he ever be able to recapture the status he once had with germany head coach joachim loew ?
competition for spots in the midfield is fierce , with not even nominal team captain michael ballack being assured of making the squad .
rolfes draws hope from the very vagaries of football that put him out of commission for much of 2009 and 2010 .
“ a year ago , no one would have thought that bastian schweinsteiger and sami khedira would be the central midfielders at the world cup , ” rolfes said .
“ and likewise , no one knows what 's going to happen in two or three years ' time .
there 's always the possibility of injuries and other circumstances .
so you should n't concentrate on whether it 's difficult or not . ”
and rolfes does n't need to look far to find an example of hope .
his teammate at leverkusen , striker patrick helmes , was also knocked out of germany 's world cup squad by an injury , but has gotten a call-up to play in the nationalelf 's friendly against sweden this coming wednesday .
so even though rolfes has dropped off the radar screen of many casual germany fans , it would n't be all that surprising to find him on the plane when yogi and co. travel to euro 2012 in poland and ukraine , or even the 2014 world cup in brazil .
simon rolfes was interviewed by kamilla jarzina for dw-tv 's bundesliga kick off program .

positive outlook bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coming back from a knee injury takes lots of hard , boring work rolfes made his bundesliga comeback in late september , and so far , he 's been pretty good .
last month , he scored a pair of goals to help leverkusen beat wolfsburg , even though he only came on as a late substitute .
and perhaps more encouragingly , he 's played for a full 90 minutes in his last two games .
he also provided the assist for leverkusen 's lone goal in their win agaist st. pauli on the weekend , which took the team up to second in the bundesliga standings .
but will he ever be able to recapture the status he once had with germany head coach joachim loew ?
competition for spots in the midfield is fierce , with not even nominal team captain michael ballack being assured of making the squad .
rolfes draws hope from the very vagaries of football that put him out of commission for much of 2009 and 2010 .
“ a year ago , no one would have thought that bastian schweinsteiger and sami khedira would be the central midfielders at the world cup , ” rolfes said .
“ and likewise , no one knows what 's going to happen in two or three years ' time .
there 's always the possibility of injuries and other circumstances .
so you should n't concentrate on whether it 's difficult or not . ”
and rolfes does n't need to look far to find an example of hope .
his teammate at leverkusen , striker patrick helmes , was also knocked out of germany 's world cup squad by an injury , but has gotten a call-up to play in the nationalelf 's friendly against sweden this coming wednesday .
so even though rolfes has dropped off the radar screen of many casual germany fans , it would n't be all that surprising to find him on the plane when yogi and co. travel to euro 2012 in poland and ukraine , or even the 2014 world cup in brazil .
simon rolfes was interviewed by kamilla jarzina for dw-tv 's bundesliga kick off program .

life meets art in the film , annenberg 's character makes her preference for the secular clear and even declares that she hates the orthodox .
" i 'm expressing that jew-on-jew hostility that i 'd certainly like to see less of , and i see the movie as a rapprochement between the two camps , " annenberg said .
" if ever a bunch of people did n't understand each other that well , it 's the ultra-secular and the ultra-orthodox . "
in the film , the young translators ' personal stories begin to overlap with the plot of " romeo and juliet , " once they wrap their heads around it .
the back story is that these first-time actors , like their characters , are forging new lives outside of the ultra-orthodox community where they grew up .
melissa weisz plays juliet and traveled to berlin for the jewish film festival where the movie premiered this summer .
" we came to berlin and spoke to non-jews , and it gives you a whole different perception of the world , " weisz said .
" we were told that every gentile would hurt us .
the way we were raised is very insular and a little bit brainwashed . "
bildunterschrift : melissa weisz plays juliet more premieres ahead the actors ' experience in the german capital was fruitful .
not only were they on hand to receive the audience favorite award at berlin 's jewish film festival , they also received invitations to come back and guest lecture at yiddish courses .
lazer weisz plays the romeo character and enjoyed the feedback on the film from people in the audience . " they like the whole idea that yiddish is coming back to germany .
it 's very nice .
it makes the whole thing worth it in a way , " he said .
the film 's next stop is london on november 16 , and it will debut in new york in january .
the screenings offer a departure from the usual shakespearean experience .
since 65 percent of the movie is in yiddish , the scenes from romeo and juliet appear with the bard 's original lines subtitled in english .
if the film continues to charm audiences as it did in germany , perhaps another yiddish language production will follow .

" everything is at stake - if the euro fails , europe will fail , " she told delegates at the christian democrats ' party convention , where she was reelected as head of her party .
" we need a new culture of stability in europe , " she added .
she even went so far as to criticize her predecessor , social democrat gerhard schroeder , for giving his consent for greece to join the eurozone , calling it " irresponsible " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's push for a crisis prevention mechanism are controversial harsh words on both sides the comments came as eu figures showed that greece 's deficit in 2009 rose to 15.4 percent of gdp , a big jump from the initial estimate of 13.6 percent .
greek prime minister george papandreou promptly hit back , insisting that measures proposed by germany to avoid future crises were pushing up interest rates paid by highly indebted countries like greece for their bonds .
" this could create a self-fulfilling prophecy , " papandreou said during a visit in paris .
" this could break backs .
this could force some economies into bankruptcy , " he added .
he was referring to plans by germany , supported by france , to make bondholders pay at least some of the costs in case of a default .
germany is also reluctant to extend the eurozone 's bailout package beyond 2013 .
politicians may balk at merkel 's frank words , but some analysts believe tough talk is long-overdue .
" involving investors in the costs of defaults is a good idea , " eugen keller , head of financial markets research at metzler bank told deutsche welle .
" fighting fire with fire , i.e. bailing out mortgage companies like fannie mae or freddie mac or companies like gm , as happened in the us , and in europe as well , is not a long-term solution , " he said .
keller points out that the credit bubble has built up over the years , with the discrepancies between loans issued and actual economic growth widening over several decades , especially in the us , but also in europe .
bildunterschrift : exports are the driving force behind germany 's economic motor swings and roundabouts while germany benefits enormously from the single currency , as 40 percent of its exports go to other eurozone members , and having one currency eliminates fluctuations in exchange rates , the risks of having the euro were indeed underestimated , according to keller .
" germany can afford to pay for other countries as part of the bailout package for greece for example , but at the end of the day , the differences between say germany and greece or italy in efficiency , for example when it comes to managing wage costs , are extreme , " keller told deutsche welle .
" our own stress tests as well as those of ratings agencies in 2008 , for example , have shown that the former greek currency , the drachme , would have had to be valued at 30 to 40 percent less in 2008 than at the time greece joined the eurozone . "

but he was never convicted of a crime , and human rights activists are calling attention to that fact on the anniversary of his death . sergei magnitsky 's time in jail came to an end one year ago on november 16 .
but magnitsky 's sentence did n't come to an end - he died in prison from complications of an illness .
one year after his death , human rights activists are calling attention to magnitsky 's death because the 37-year-old russian lawyer was never convicted of a crime , and spent a year in prison waiting to face charges of tax evasion .
' held as hostage ' supporters say magnitsky had exposed one of the biggest tax fraud scandals in russian history that involved many top russian officials .
magnitsky defended hermitage capital management , a multibillion-dollar fund that accused russian interior ministry officials of stealing up to $ 230 million -lrb- 169 million euros -rrb- from the fund in a tax scam .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexeyeva suspects the interior ministry of foul play " a russian citizen was put in detention and held as a hostage by interior ministry officials , in conditions which according to russian and international norms are seen as torture , " said human rights campaigner lyudmila alexeyeva , who heads the moscow helsinki group , charged with implementing international human rights accords in moscow .
but the interior ministry said on monday that magnitsky himself was the one trying to steal the money by filing tax forms illegally .
the spokeswoman for interior ministry investigators , irina dudukina , said that evidence from two recently arrested businessmen had confirmed magnitsky 's involvement .
" the version of magnitsky 's involvement in the embezzlement of 5.4 billion rubles -lrb- $ 175 million -rrb- " is based on their evidence , she told a news conference .
posthumous award magnitsky 's time in prison and death caused an outrage in the human rights community .
they allege magnitsky was mistreated in prison and requests to have his illness treated were repeatedly ignored .
a day ahead of the anniversary of magnitsky 's death , transparency international posthumously awarded him one of its integrity awards , saying magnitsky 's " commitment to integrity ultimately cost him his life . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 15.11.2010 anger over jailed russian lawyer 's death remains one year on großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magnitsky was just 37 when he died in prison a year ago , russian lawyer sergei magnitsky died in prison from an untreated illness .
but he was never convicted of a crime , and human rights activists are calling attention to that fact on the anniversary of his death . sergei magnitsky 's time in jail came to an end one year ago on november 16 .
but magnitsky 's sentence did n't come to an end - he died in prison from complications of an illness .
one year after his death , human rights activists are calling attention to magnitsky 's death because the 37-year-old russian lawyer was never convicted of a crime , and spent a year in prison waiting to face charges of tax evasion .
' held as hostage ' supporters say magnitsky had exposed one of the biggest tax fraud scandals in russian history that involved many top russian officials .
magnitsky defended hermitage capital management , a multibillion-dollar fund that accused russian interior ministry officials of stealing up to $ 230 million -lrb- 169 million euros -rrb- from the fund in a tax scam .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexeyeva suspects the interior ministry of foul play " a russian citizen was put in detention and held as a hostage by interior ministry officials , in conditions which according to russian and international norms are seen as torture , " said human rights campaigner lyudmila alexeyeva , who heads the moscow helsinki group , charged with implementing international human rights accords in moscow .
but the interior ministry said on monday that magnitsky himself was the one trying to steal the money by filing tax forms illegally .
the spokeswoman for interior ministry investigators , irina dudukina , said that evidence from two recently arrested businessmen had confirmed magnitsky 's involvement .
" the version of magnitsky 's involvement in the embezzlement of 5.4 billion rubles -lrb- $ 175 million -rrb- " is based on their evidence , she told a news conference .
posthumous award magnitsky 's time in prison and death caused an outrage in the human rights community .
they allege magnitsky was mistreated in prison and requests to have his illness treated were repeatedly ignored .
a day ahead of the anniversary of magnitsky 's death , transparency international posthumously awarded him one of its integrity awards , saying magnitsky 's " commitment to integrity ultimately cost him his life . "

the ministers are supporters of parliamentary speaker gianfranco fini , a berlusconi rival . political problems in italy continue to escalate as four ministers - europe minister andrea ronchi , deputy economic development minister adolfo urso and two junior ministers - resigned from their posts in the government on monday .
" we all agree today that we need to move to a new phase in the italian centre-right , " said urso on news channel skytg24 monday .
the resignations indicate waning support for prime minister silvio berlusconi .
the four ministers who resigned are all supporters of former berlusconi ally-turned-rival gianfranco fini , who is speaker of the parliament .
fini and his supports in the future and freedom movement hope to see berlusconi resign .
the demand follows the latest in a long-running series of sex-scandal allegations involving berlusconi .
earlier in the month , fini had threatened to start pulling ministers out of the government if berlusconi did n't step down .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fini would like to see berlusconi resign but such a vote is not likely to come before the italian government passes its 2011 budget in the coming weeks , a decision which is itself a thorny issue due to italy 's massive debt problem .
the political turmoil could play out in a number of different ways in italy .
should berlusconi lose a vote of confidence , it would be up to president giorgio napolitano to decide if the existing parliament could form a new government .
napolitano could also appoint an interim government until new elections can take place .
if no agreement can be reached on a new government , parliament would be dissolved and snap elections would take place within 70 days .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de medicine -pipe- 15.11.2010 merkel repeats call for pgd pre-natal screening ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pgd is allowed in many countries , but some christians want a ban in her party conference , angela merkel reiterated her view that pre-implantation genetic-testing of test-tube embryos should be banned .
but experts say a ban would cause unnecessary stress for couples . thanks to a recent ruling by the federal court of justice , german women having a ' test-tube baby ' have the option of letting the doctor check if the embryo which will be implanted in her womb is likely to suffer from any serious diseases .
if the chances are high , she can decide not to have it implanted and try again .
such pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- used to be illegal in germany , but the decision in july found that such a test was legal if it was intended to exclude a serious handicap .
this caused consternation among germany 's christians , not least those belonging to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
many argued that an embryo enjoys complete human rights from the moment a sperm fertilizes an egg , and after some deliberation , merkel came down on their side last month .
disunity among mainstream christians in her opening speech at this week 's party conference , the chancellor gave a brief but unambiguous reiteration of her position : " i 'm in favor of a ban , because we ca n't properly define the boundaries . "
she did however acknowledge that many party colleagues have a different opinion , and welcomed a frank debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the boundaries of pid were too difficult to define prominent cdu members – notably cabinet ministers ursula von der leyen and kristina schroeder - as well as merkel 's coalition partners the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , see it differently , and have proposed a controlled use of pgd .
the issue divides other parties too , and when the issue comes before german parliament , it has been decided that the question will be decided by a free ‘ conscience ' vote , independent of party lines .
the main argument in favor of pgd simply points out that german law allows women to have an abortion even in the ninth month , if a test of the fetus shows a serious health condition .
if more diagnoses could be carried out before implantation , many such traumatic abortions could be avoided .
" it 's quite a contradiction that we do n't allow the cells to be checked , " argued cdu parliamentary state secretary peter hintze .
" but we do allow the fetus to be checked in the womb .
we should get rid of this contradiction . "
defining the boundaries the particular ' boundary ' that merkel feels is so difficult to define is between screening out genes that might lead to illness , handicaps or birth defects and producing what is known as ' designer babies . '
from a scientific point of view , it 's important to point out that ' diagnosis ' is a slightly misleading description , since the process does not involve identifying an illness in an embryo .
instead , pgd is a test for certain genetic conditions that could lead to disease .
pgd was first developed in britain in the late 1980s , and was first used for sex determination on embryos with diseases linked to certain chromosomes .
not long after the first successful births , it was banned in germany under the 1990 embryo protection act .
its main application is for determining the presence of recessive genetic disorders like cystic fibrosis , beta-thalassemia , sickle cell disease and spinal muscular atrophy type 1 .
the most common dominant diseases that can be screened by pgd are myotonic dystrophy , huntington 's disease and charcot-marie-tooth disease .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an outright ban would likely send many germans abroad for treatment it is also used to test for chromosomal abnormalities , which if excluded can increase the chances of ivf treatment being successful , by reducing the rate of miscarriages .
broad consensus in europe pgd is allowed in britain , but only for determining the presence of serious hereditary diseases or chromosome disorders .
in france , the procedure is only allowed if an inherited disease has been identified in one of the parents , and only if both parents have been living together for two years .
a similarly limited application of pgd is also in place in belgium , the netherlands , belgium , italy , and greece .
meanwhile an outright ban is in place in austria , ireland and switzerland .
but there is a fairly ambiguous legal position on pgd in many countries , where it is not expressly banned , but is implicitly prohibited through regulations on embryo research – this is the case in many us states .
sascha rudat , spokesman for the berlin chamber of physicians , told deutsche welle , " the problem is that couples where hereditary diseases are present , could say , ' we 're going abroad to have it done there . '
and of course that is n't desirable .
that 's a lot of stress , so i think we should re-consider whether a total ban is a good idea . "
rudat says the risks and stress of travel to a foreign country only make a complex and emotionally-charged treatment even more difficult .
" some couples are already in a stressful situation , " he said .
" as i said , they are often couples who already have certain hereditary illnesses , who may already have had a handicapped child , and who only want to do everything right .
if they travel it just adds extra burdens . "
for this reason , rudat believes that a regulated application is the only fair solution .
" we do n't consider a total ban desirable , " says rudat .
" we think that pgd should be possible under very strict conditions .
they are of course important . "

but experts say a ban would cause unnecessary stress for couples . thanks to a recent ruling by the federal court of justice , german women having a ' test-tube baby ' have the option of letting the doctor check if the embryo which will be implanted in her womb is likely to suffer from any serious diseases .
if the chances are high , she can decide not to have it implanted and try again .
such pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- used to be illegal in germany , but the decision in july found that such a test was legal if it was intended to exclude a serious handicap .
this caused consternation among germany 's christians , not least those belonging to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
many argued that an embryo enjoys complete human rights from the moment a sperm fertilizes an egg , and after some deliberation , merkel came down on their side last month .
disunity among mainstream christians in her opening speech at this week 's party conference , the chancellor gave a brief but unambiguous reiteration of her position : " i 'm in favor of a ban , because we ca n't properly define the boundaries . "
she did however acknowledge that many party colleagues have a different opinion , and welcomed a frank debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the boundaries of pid were too difficult to define prominent cdu members – notably cabinet ministers ursula von der leyen and kristina schroeder - as well as merkel 's coalition partners the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , see it differently , and have proposed a controlled use of pgd .
the issue divides other parties too , and when the issue comes before german parliament , it has been decided that the question will be decided by a free ‘ conscience ' vote , independent of party lines .
the main argument in favor of pgd simply points out that german law allows women to have an abortion even in the ninth month , if a test of the fetus shows a serious health condition .
if more diagnoses could be carried out before implantation , many such traumatic abortions could be avoided .
" it 's quite a contradiction that we do n't allow the cells to be checked , " argued cdu parliamentary state secretary peter hintze .
" but we do allow the fetus to be checked in the womb .
we should get rid of this contradiction . "
defining the boundaries the particular ' boundary ' that merkel feels is so difficult to define is between screening out genes that might lead to illness , handicaps or birth defects and producing what is known as ' designer babies . '
from a scientific point of view , it 's important to point out that ' diagnosis ' is a slightly misleading description , since the process does not involve identifying an illness in an embryo .
instead , pgd is a test for certain genetic conditions that could lead to disease .
pgd was first developed in britain in the late 1980s , and was first used for sex determination on embryos with diseases linked to certain chromosomes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de formula one -pipe- 15.11.2010 opinion : vettel a worthy and well-deserving champ großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with sebasitan vettel 's first formula one drivers title , germany can celebrate a new world champion .
deutsche welle 's sports writer arnulf boettcher provides his take on germany 's new sports hero . germany has a new sports hero : sebastian vettel , the youngest world champion in formula one history .
born in the south-western german town of heppenheim , vettel wears the formula one crown at just 23 years old - and surely not for the last time .
germany 's other formula one world-champion , michael schumacher , was 25 when he won his first of a record seven titles .
like schumacher , vettel is known for his meticulousness and obsession over detail .
but unlike his role model schumacher , vettel does n't come across as so serious .
instead , vettel is seen as quick-witted , youthfully mischievous , and almost always smiling .
that 's what makes him so likeable on the formula one scene .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arnulf boettcher vettel almost become world champion last year .
he was held back by technical problems with his red bull car , but hasty mistakes were part of the problem , too .
he narrowly escaped meeting the same fate again this year .
but the setbacks only appear to have made him stronger .
in the decisive race , he took first place and made no mistakes in a dominating race where he was the best driver among his competitors .
ten pole positions and five victories make vettel a worthy and well-deserving champion .
fernando alonso is left pondering what might have been as his ferrari team implemented the wrong strategy in the final race in abu dhabi .
as for his title chances , alonso benefitted from an illegal team order : his ferrari teammate felipe massa was leading at the hockenheim race , but was ordered to let alonso through , securing an extra seven points for the spaniard .
red bull , on the other hand , did not issue team orders in the 2010 season and earned great respect from all sides .
vettel benefitted from the new points system that made formula one decidedly more exciting .
five drivers were in contention for the title heading into the second-to-last race , and for the final event four were still in the running .
in the end , vettel triumphed , after coming into the race in third place 15 points behind and without having even occupied top spot .
now germany can relish a world-title fairy tale and a youthful world champion .
but any expectations that vettel could someday overtake michael schumacher as the record world champion are misguided .
formula one has become much too fast-paced , and five different champions in the last five years speak for themselves .

the country is still refusing but so did greece before it bowed to pressure . speculation is rife about ireland 's course of action , as the country 's borrowing costs last week shot to record highs on concerns of a deficit set to hit 32 percent of gross domestic product this year .
monday kicked off with a report in the irish independent newspaper claiming that at a meeting of eurozone finance ministers this week , ireland plans to ask for money from the european union 's emergency fund to rescue its banks .
prompt denial an irish minister promptly fired off a denial about the country being in direct discussions about a bailout package from the european union .
while acknowledging that ireland is in " continuous talks " with the eu about its growing debt , dick roche , junior minister for european affairs , told newstalk radio that it is " frankly wrong and grossly irresponsible that this story is being said and that a frenzy is being created out there . "
the opposition claimed europe had already started moves to rescue the country , but the irish government denied it would need a bailout .
" ireland has made no application for external support , " a finance ministry spokesman said .
" ongoing contacts continue at official level with international colleagues in light of current market conditions . "
the rumor mill is almost certain to continue with every new day of uncertainty confronting irish banks .
at the end of last month , they owed 130 billion euros -lrb- $ 177 billion -rrb- of outstanding european central bank loans , up from 119 billion euros a month earlier .
numbers being floated around as part of a bailout deal range between 50 and 77 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment in ireland has soared to 13.2 percent the eu is reported to be keen for ireland to accept aid to avert a greek-style scenario in which budget problems in one country plunge the entire eurozone into crisis .
on monday , european central bank council member miguel angel fernandez ordonez prodded ireland to make a " final decision " on its fiscal crisis in a move to calm markets .
" the situation in the markets in recent weeks has been very negative due in some way to the lack of a final decision by ireland , " he told reporters in madrid .
" it 's not me who should take a decision about ireland ; it 's ireland that should take the right decision at the right moment . "
but the clock is ticking .
" i think ireland can hold out another three to four months maximum , and it should , hoping that some positive surprise on growth might calm the markets , " unicredit group chief economist marco annunziata told deutsche welle .
" but investors will remain nervous until the question is settled of whether or not eurozone sovereign debts might be restructured . "
stability program on track another european expert , who asked not to be identified , said the european finance ministers could reach a decision as early as this week to funnel funds to irish banks .
" these funds , which would help stabilize the banks , would be seen as a limited intervention , " the expert said .
there is no question about ireland 's sovereign debt , the expert added : the irish government has no immediate need for cash , being fully funded until mid-2011 , and its stability program is on track bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish banks owe billions to the european central bank germany has also pressed for ireland to accept aid , insiders say .

the country is still refusing but so did greece before it bowed to pressure . speculation is rife about ireland 's course of action , as the country 's borrowing costs last week shot to record highs on concerns of a deficit set to hit 32 percent of gross domestic product this year .
monday kicked off with a report in the irish independent newspaper claiming that at a meeting of eurozone finance ministers this week , ireland plans to ask for money from the european union 's emergency fund to rescue its banks .
prompt denial an irish minister promptly fired off a denial about the country being in direct discussions about a bailout package from the european union .
while acknowledging that ireland is in " continuous talks " with the eu about its growing debt , dick roche , junior minister for european affairs , told newstalk radio that it is " frankly wrong and grossly irresponsible that this story is being said and that a frenzy is being created out there . "
the opposition claimed europe had already started moves to rescue the country , but the irish government denied it would need a bailout .
" ireland has made no application for external support , " a finance ministry spokesman said .
" ongoing contacts continue at official level with international colleagues in light of current market conditions . "
the rumor mill is almost certain to continue with every new day of uncertainty confronting irish banks .
at the end of last month , they owed 130 billion euros -lrb- $ 177 billion -rrb- of outstanding european central bank loans , up from 119 billion euros a month earlier .
numbers being floated around as part of a bailout deal range between 50 and 77 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment in ireland has soared to 13.2 percent the eu is reported to be keen for ireland to accept aid to avert a greek-style scenario in which budget problems in one country plunge the entire eurozone into crisis .
on monday , european central bank council member miguel angel fernandez ordonez prodded ireland to make a " final decision " on its fiscal crisis in a move to calm markets .
" the situation in the markets in recent weeks has been very negative due in some way to the lack of a final decision by ireland , " he told reporters in madrid .
" it 's not me who should take a decision about ireland ; it 's ireland that should take the right decision at the right moment . "
but the clock is ticking .
" i think ireland can hold out another three to four months maximum , and it should , hoping that some positive surprise on growth might calm the markets , " unicredit group chief economist marco annunziata told deutsche welle .
" but investors will remain nervous until the question is settled of whether or not eurozone sovereign debts might be restructured . "
stability program on track another european expert , who asked not to be identified , said the european finance ministers could reach a decision as early as this week to funnel funds to irish banks .
" these funds , which would help stabilize the banks , would be seen as a limited intervention , " the expert said .
there is no question about ireland 's sovereign debt , the expert added : the irish government has no immediate need for cash , being fully funded until mid-2011 , and its stability program is on track bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish banks owe billions to the european central bank germany has also pressed for ireland to accept aid , insiders say .

deutsche welle 's sports writer arnulf boettcher provides his take on germany 's new sports hero . germany has a new sports hero : sebastian vettel , the youngest world champion in formula one history .
born in the south-western german town of heppenheim , vettel wears the formula one crown at just 23 years old - and surely not for the last time .
germany 's other formula one world-champion , michael schumacher , was 25 when he won his first of a record seven titles .
like schumacher , vettel is known for his meticulousness and obsession over detail .
but unlike his role model schumacher , vettel does n't come across as so serious .
instead , vettel is seen as quick-witted , youthfully mischievous , and almost always smiling .
that 's what makes him so likeable on the formula one scene .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arnulf boettcher vettel almost become world champion last year .
he was held back by technical problems with his red bull car , but hasty mistakes were part of the problem , too .
he narrowly escaped meeting the same fate again this year .
but the setbacks only appear to have made him stronger .
in the decisive race , he took first place and made no mistakes in a dominating race where he was the best driver among his competitors .
ten pole positions and five victories make vettel a worthy and well-deserving champion .
fernando alonso is left pondering what might have been as his ferrari team implemented the wrong strategy in the final race in abu dhabi .
as for his title chances , alonso benefitted from an illegal team order : his ferrari teammate felipe massa was leading at the hockenheim race , but was ordered to let alonso through , securing an extra seven points for the spaniard .
red bull , on the other hand , did not issue team orders in the 2010 season and earned great respect from all sides .
vettel benefitted from the new points system that made formula one decidedly more exciting .
five drivers were in contention for the title heading into the second-to-last race , and for the final event four were still in the running .
in the end , vettel triumphed , after coming into the race in third place 15 points behind and without having even occupied top spot .
now germany can relish a world-title fairy tale and a youthful world champion .
but any expectations that vettel could someday overtake michael schumacher as the record world champion are misguided .
formula one has become much too fast-paced , and five different champions in the last five years speak for themselves .

dw-world.de forget ' baby schumi , ' now sebastian vettel is world champion sebastian vettel has become the youngest world champion in the history of formula one .
if vettel appeared calm before the final race in abu dhabi , the 23-year-old german was overcome with emotion afterwards .
-lrb- 15.11.2010 -rrb- sebastian vettel races to formula one world championship german formula one driver sebastian vettel has become the sport 's youngest champion after winning the abu dhabi grand prix .
the perfectly executed race caps a successful season for vettel and his red bull team .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 15.11.2010 eu plans to loosen zero tolerance policy on gm crops großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genetically modified animal feed could soon be imported into europe leaked documents suggest the european union is planning to loosen its zero tolerance ban on genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- plants .
environmental campaigners are outraged , saying the crops are still potentially dangerous . according to environmental group friends of the earth europe -lrb- foee -rrb- , the european commission is planning to allow traces of non-approved gm crops in imports coming into europe -lrb- with a threshold of 0.1 percent -rrb- .
" europe would effectively open its borders for gm crops which are not authorized or assessed for their safety in any country of the world , " an foee statement said .
a number of european union governments on monday urged the bloc 's executive to allow tiny traces of gm material in food imports for human consumption as well as in animal feed , an eu source said .
however , it is not yet clear whether enough eu governments support the change to force the european commission to amend its proposal , and a final decision is unlikely before january at the earliest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers say the imports are necessary to keep prices down " the european commission is bowing to the scaremongering tactics of the biotech industry , and as a result , opening europe 's markets to unauthorized gm food and feed . "
mute schimpf , an foee food campaigner said .
" europe 's laws on genetically modified foods are there for a reason – to protect the public and the environment . "
biotech pressure environmentalists believe that the eu 's hand is being forced by the bio-technology industry , which is arguing that the eu 's total ban on gm crops could bring about a crisis in the feed sector , and farmers may be forced to slaughter animals rather than let them starve .
" this is based upon the false argument that international trade is severely disrupted when shipments of feed containing unauthorised gm feed are rejected , " the foee said .
the campaigners claimed that no shipment from any feed importing country -lrb- us , argentina or brazil -rrb- was rejected at a european port in 2010 .
" the right of the public to say no to gm foods and feeds must be respected , " schimpf demanded .
" member states should reject this proposal and maintain europe 's position on zero tolerance . "
farmers ' interests but european farmer organizations have shown little concern over the proposal .
amanda cheesley , spokeswoman for copa cogeca , the umbrella group of european farming organizations , told deutsche welle , " we are not averse to imports of gm feed coming in .
if it 's been approved under the commission 's authorization procedures , then we do n't have a problem with it . "
cheesley believes that the eu 's current zero tolerance policy is unsustainable .
" we want a solution to be found to that because in practise you ca n't have zero tolerance , " she said .
" it stops imports coming in , which means that feed prices go too high for livestock . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has criticized the eu 's gm assessment procedures cheesley says that europe 's farmers have other worries .
" we have concerns about the commission 's proposals to let member states have different policies on gm products , " she said .
the commission made legal proposals in july to allow national governments make their own decisions on the controversial crops , in a bid to break the longstanding eu deadlock on new gm product approvals .
but a new opinion from the eu council of ministers ' legal service could deal a fatal blow to the plans , after several eu governments already expressed fears that the draft law risks breaching world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- rules .
new guidelines the european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- has also set out new guidelines for biotech companies submitting gm crops for eu approval on friday , including on possible long-term effects of gm crops and their impacts on insects and other plants .
the new guidelines follow a request from eu governments in 2008 to strengthen efsa 's gm crop assessment procedures , and criticism from countries including france that efsa had failed to take full account of environmental concerns when approving new crops .
france has refused to discuss european commission proposals to let member states decide whether to grow or ban gm crops , until the eu 's assessment procedures have been strengthened .
in december , the commission is due to publish a report on the socio-economic risks and benefits of gm crops , and new rules on monitoring gm crops are due next year , as part of the wider overhaul of the bloc 's approval and assessment procedures .

" we have concerns about the commission 's proposals to let member states have different policies on gm products , " she said .
the commission made legal proposals in july to allow national governments make their own decisions on the controversial crops , in a bid to break the longstanding eu deadlock on new gm product approvals .
but a new opinion from the eu council of ministers ' legal service could deal a fatal blow to the plans , after several eu governments already expressed fears that the draft law risks breaching world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- rules .
new guidelines the european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- has also set out new guidelines for biotech companies submitting gm crops for eu approval on friday , including on possible long-term effects of gm crops and their impacts on insects and other plants .
the new guidelines follow a request from eu governments in 2008 to strengthen efsa 's gm crop assessment procedures , and criticism from countries including france that efsa had failed to take full account of environmental concerns when approving new crops .
france has refused to discuss european commission proposals to let member states decide whether to grow or ban gm crops , until the eu 's assessment procedures have been strengthened .
in december , the commission is due to publish a report on the socio-economic risks and benefits of gm crops , and new rules on monitoring gm crops are due next year , as part of the wider overhaul of the bloc 's approval and assessment procedures .

after an eventful journey , dw reporter ali almakhlafi has reached mecca , and started answering dw users ' questions .
but first - a sudden change of clothes . on sunday , nov .
14 , the moment had come : two million pilgrims from all around the world , and i was right there in the middle of them .
i visited the holy al-haram mosque , and saw the kaaba at its center .
i 've got to admit it : i was completely mesmerized .
there is really such a big difference between seeing it in pictures or reading about it in articles , and actually standing in front of it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 100,000 security forces are there to protect some 2 million pilgrims i 've been to cologne cathedral , the vatican , and the hagia sophia in istanbul before .
but the kaaba is special to me .
childhood memories of religion class in yemen come up - and somehow things seem to have come full circle .
originally , i arrived with a group of pilgrims , but i lost them in the crowd .
never mind , i say to myself ; it 's good to be alone , for i first need to digest this experience by myself .
despite the kaaba 's deep impact on me , i 'm still here as a journalist .
well , as a journalist that looks like a pilgrim .
and just how did that come about ?
let me tell you .
after facing some unexpected problems , i decided to change my polo shirt and jeans for the pilgrim 's robes .
i decided i do n't want to be recognized as a visitor anymore .
i 've had enough trouble with that already .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt airport : pilgrims , saudis , and foreigners heading to jeddah in saudi arabia you really feel misplaced among the masses of muslim pilgrims if you are smooth-shaven and casually-dressed .

the employees at jeddah airport had sent me there because of my " civilian " getup .
there i was – surrounded by international tourists and business people .
after more than an hour of confusion , i finally got the last shuttle bus to the proper terminal at around midnight .
i was the only passenger … or , the only one who was late .
an american in mecca that could n't have happened to jack -lrb- name changed -rrb- .
jack is american .
he converted to islam a few years ago .
we first meet at frankfurt airport .
i ask him about his white hajj-clothes .
i want to know how he feels in this outfit .
after all , most people from the west would only wear clothes like that to a costume party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stewardess with a modern interpretation of a traditional headscarf " this probably looks funny to some of the people here , i guess , " says jack .
" i can tell by their looks . "
but jack does n't care .
" the hajj-outfit is meant to be simple and modest .
it reveals that religious beliefs do n't distinguish between rich and poor , black and white , etc . "
jack makes his comments as a muslim , but the way he says them , with his typical american accent , it almost sounds more like an american ideal .
flying , shopping , watching cnn aboard my plane to jeddah , i make some more interesting observations .
for example : most pilgrims watch cnn .
some of them even watch american movies .
however , the movies ' love scenes are carefully retouched , even though they are rather harmless from a western point of view .
the stewardesses wear headscarves and speak english – even with the arab passengers .
and many of the bearded men , who first appeared to be rather strict , conservative , and humorless , turn out to be very friendly family men .
they play happily with their kids and advise their loosely veiled wives on what makeup to buy from the choice of duty free products .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hajj terminal at jeddah airport : 2 million people arrive here - with their luggage before i finally put on my new pilgrim 's outfit , i first want to thank all the dw users for commenting on my first diary entries on the english , german , and arabic dw facebook pages - and for wishing me a safe trip .
i would like to reply to a question posted by hans youssef ernst from germany on the arabic page : " i 'm a christian and i would like to accompany my muslim friends to religious feasts in mecca some day .
do you think that this will be possible in the future ? "
dear hans youssef , i do n't dare to try and make a forecast .
as far as i know , the koran does n't explicitly state that non-muslims are n't allowed to visit mecca - but , as always , this is a matter of interpretation .
from a saudi perspective , non-muslims are definitely not allowed to visit the holy sites of mecca .
as an islamic scholar told me here in mecca : " that should be accepted , just like western constitutions need to be accepted by muslims living in europe .
by no means , however , you should mistake this as a sign of a lack respect or even contempt for non-muslims . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw reporter ali almakhlafi can move on after a short delay among islamic scholars , you can find different opinions about this topic .
there 's even a prominent politician who strongly criticizes the current prohibition : libya 's muammar al-gaddafi – who 's clearly not known to be a good friend of the western world .
five years ago , gaddafi asked for christians and jews to be allowed to visit mecca .
however , so far nothing changed … this monday , november 15 , i want to experience the pilgrim 's prayers at mount arafat and i will then attend the feast of sacrifice at mina .
i 've already collected quite a number of voices from other pilgrims .
i 'll tell you more about them in my next diary entry .

if vettel appeared calm before the final race in abu dhabi , the 23-year-old german was overcome with emotion afterwards . sebastian vettel cried tears of joy after sunday 's race in abu dhabi , after his team radioed in to tell him he had clinched the world championship , seemingly against all the odds .
" unbelievable .
thank you lads .
i love you , " the 23-year-old german said with a quivering voice from the cockpit .
after that , all you could really make out on the transmission were loud cries of celebration from the man with the glittering helmet .
" baby schumi " was what the german tabloid press once called him , but it was michael schumacher himself who pointed out earlier this year that vettel had outgrown that nickname , and the youngster has now proved beyond any doubt that as world champion , he should stand in nobody 's shadow .
" i did n't know anything until i passed the checkered flag " this world championship is the high point of an already stellar career .
vettel was born in 1987 in the southwestern german town of heppenheim , and his father norbert ensured that sebastian was bitten by the motorsport bug very early .
aged four , vettel first thrashed a go-kart around his parents ' driveway , and his first successes - as with almost all modern racers - followed racing in go-karts in his youth .
eventually , the youngster was noticed , and promoted to the single-seater formula bmw racing series .
as a debutante , vettel was immediately runner-up , and the next year he came back and won an incredible 18 out of 20 races .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel 's tasted champagne as a winner five times in 2010 vettel moved on to formula 3 , where he never managed to claim the grand prize , but that was because his fame was already overtaking him and his rise up the ladder was accelerating .
in 2006 , he was given his first shot in a formula one car in a young driver test , immediately posting the fastest time .
the next year , in indianapolis , an injury to then bmw-sauber driver robert kubica gave vettel his chance on a race weekend .
still in his teens , he promptly became not only the youngest driver to compete in a grand prix -lrb- a record he has since lost -rrb- , but also the youngest-ever points-scorer in the sport 's history - bringing his bmw home in eighth on his debut .
the early-achiever continued tearing up f1 's age-related record book in the following season .
driving for the underfunded toro rosso team , vettel became the youngest ever pole-sitter and then winner in a single wet weekend in monza , doing the double for his minor team as the championship battle raged around him .
two years on , after being promoted to the red bull outfit , vettel has completed his cv , becoming the youngest world champion in the sport 's history , displacing 2008 winner lewis hamilton by less than a year .
" i am a bit speechless .
i do n't know what you are supposed to say at this moment , " a usually loquacious vettel admitted in the post-race press conference .
" to be honest i did n't know anything until i passed the checkered flag . "
vettel not only needed a win , championship leader fernando alonso had to finish fifth or lower for him to win the title , but the spanish ferrari driver had a poor race , and could only salvage seventh .
" i hate losing " bildunterschrift : the youngster 's love of winning is displayed by his trademark index-finger celebration vettel - never one to aim low - points to the three michaels as heroes of his childhood : michael schumacher , michael jordan and michael jackson .
vettel even dreamed of becoming a musician as a kid .
" it was funny when i finally realized that i did n't have the voice for it , " he admitted in later life .
nevertheless , vettel 's passion remained - he 's a huge beatles fan and record collector to this day .
vettel also tried out a number of sports in his youth before settling on motor racing .
" i never scored many goals , and did n't even get called on to play that often , " vettel lamented , recalling his time on the football pitch .
he also tried tennis , table tennis , and even beach volleyball , but never settled for long .
" i was just never the best , so i stopped playing .
i hate losing . "
finally , vettel started following in the first michael 's footsteps more seriously , turning his attention to racing – a sport whose ethos he seems to enjoy .
" it 's irrelevant whether you 're second or fifth .
the only important thing is being no. 1 . "
with 10 pole positions , five wins , and now a world championship in 2010 , vettel has achieved that goal .

the disease broke out in the northern artibonite region , where it continues to be most concentrated .
it is contracted through contaminated water and causes severe diarrhea and vomiting .
bildunterschrift : the fear is growing that the epidemic will spread to refugee camps authorities and international aid agencies were struggling to contain the latest crisis afflicting the impoverished island nation .
efforts are centering on preventing the disease from spreading in crowded city slums and tent camps that house over 1.3 million homeless people who survived the cataclysmic earthquake , nearly a year ago .
but the facts of the epidemic raise the question of how such a preventable disease could break out in a country that has been flooded with hundreds of millions of euros in foreign assistance since the earthquake .
resource coordination is problem " huge sums in aid money have gone there , but the people in the north seem to have been left to their own devices , " sven stockrahm , a journalist with german newspaper die zeit who wrote about the earthquake , told deutsche welle .
stockrahm stressed that his critical remarks were not aimed at humanitarian aid workers , who by all accounts are doing vital work under very trying circumstances .
the key question is whether a better coordination of the resources in place could have prevented cholera from occurring in the first place .
bildunterschrift : aid workers are working ahrd to meet the needs of growing patient numbers but clear answers are difficult to come by where haiti is concerned .
the causes of cholera , lack of clean drinking water and poor sanitation are well-known , but at present , no one is sure exactly how the disease even broke out in artibonite .
poor sanitation , even pre-earthquake what is certain is that conditions in haiti even before the earthquake were far from adequate .
a study by the world health organization and unicef found that open defecation was prevalent among just under half of rural haitians and that 3.7 million of haiti 's total population of 9 million had no reliable source of clean drinking water .
moreover , from 1990 to 2008 , conditions deteriorated .
a similar study by the united nations in 2009 determined that 42 percent of haitians were not using an " improved water source . "
haiti ranks dead last among countries in south america and the caribbean in all major water and hygiene categories .
" cholera is a sickness of poverty that is common in refugee camps where there ’ s not enough drinking water , " ernst diekmann - a doctor with germany 's society for technical cooperation , or gtz - told deutsche welle .
" haiti was already an underprivileged country , and the situation was exacerbated by the natural catastrophe . "
problem exacerbated by refugees nonetheless , aid workers acknowledge that pre-existing deficiencies and the slow recovery process are two parts of the same overall problem that encouraged the cholera outbreak .
and the issue of earthquake refugees only exacerbates those problems .
bildunterschrift : as the disease spreads , burials are on the rise " the dramatic thing about haiti is that even before the earthquake the health infrastructure was fully inadequate , " said joost butenop , a medical adviser to the aid organization caritas .
" aid organizations have concentrated on the region specifically affected -lsb- by the earthquake -rsb- and have n't been following the refugees to any great extent . "
organizational challenges earlier this year , the humanitarian organization refugees international went even further , claiming that recovery efforts in haiti were not just sluggish , but " paralyzed . "
off the record , many people who work in the aid and assistance sector say that shortcomings in coordination often prevent help from getting where it 's needed - or problems from being effectively anticipated .
that task falls to the united nations and the haitian government , and representatives of the former have openly admitted that the situation in haiti tests their limits .
the will to help is there .
germany 's ministry for economic cooperation and development , for instance , says that most of the 51.4 million euros -lrb- $ 72 million -rrb- it was allocated for haiti has already been distributed or earmarked for future projects .
yet merely distinguishing between emergency needs and long-term developmental requirements , and figuring out which government ministry is responsible , can be a complicated process .
and coordinating the enormous number of private and public organizations trying to help in haiti represents an organizational task of the highest order .
at this point , no one can say definitively whether any particular authority should have foreseen the danger of cholera in haiti and taken precautionary steps to prevent it .
but the outbreak of the disease in a country that has been the focus of so much international assistance suggests that overall organization and coordination remain problems that hinder aid initiatives from having their maximum possible effect .

if vettel appeared calm before the final race in abu dhabi , the 23-year-old german was overcome with emotion afterwards . sebastian vettel cried tears of joy after sunday 's race in abu dhabi , after his team radioed in to tell him he had clinched the world championship , seemingly against all the odds .
" unbelievable .
thank you lads .
i love you , " the 23-year-old german said with a quivering voice from the cockpit .
after that , all you could really make out on the transmission were loud cries of celebration from the man with the glittering helmet .
" baby schumi " was what the german tabloid press once called him , but it was michael schumacher himself who pointed out earlier this year that vettel had outgrown that nickname , and the youngster has now proved beyond any doubt that as world champion , he should stand in nobody 's shadow .
" i did n't know anything until i passed the checkered flag " this world championship is the high point of an already stellar career .
vettel was born in 1987 in the southwestern german town of heppenheim , and his father norbert ensured that sebastian was bitten by the motorsport bug very early .
aged four , vettel first thrashed a go-kart around his parents ' driveway , and his first successes - as with almost all modern racers - followed racing in go-karts in his youth .
eventually , the youngster was noticed , and promoted to the single-seater formula bmw racing series .
as a debutante , vettel was immediately runner-up , and the next year he came back and won an incredible 18 out of 20 races .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel 's tasted champagne as a winner five times in 2010 vettel moved on to formula 3 , where he never managed to claim the grand prize , but that was because his fame was already overtaking him and his rise up the ladder was accelerating .
in 2006 , he was given his first shot in a formula one car in a young driver test , immediately posting the fastest time .
the next year , in indianapolis , an injury to then bmw-sauber driver robert kubica gave vettel his chance on a race weekend .
still in his teens , he promptly became not only the youngest driver to compete in a grand prix -lrb- a record he has since lost -rrb- , but also the youngest-ever points-scorer in the sport 's history - bringing his bmw home in eighth on his debut .
the early-achiever continued tearing up f1 's age-related record book in the following season .
driving for the underfunded toro rosso team , vettel became the youngest ever pole-sitter and then winner in a single wet weekend in monza , doing the double for his minor team as the championship battle raged around him .
two years on , after being promoted to the red bull outfit , vettel has completed his cv , becoming the youngest world champion in the sport 's history , displacing 2008 winner lewis hamilton by less than a year .
" i am a bit speechless .
i do n't know what you are supposed to say at this moment , " a usually loquacious vettel admitted in the post-race press conference .
" to be honest i did n't know anything until i passed the checkered flag . "
vettel not only needed a win , championship leader fernando alonso had to finish fifth or lower for him to win the title , but the spanish ferrari driver had a poor race , and could only salvage seventh .
" i hate losing " bildunterschrift : the youngster 's love of winning is displayed by his trademark index-finger celebration vettel - never one to aim low - points to the three michaels as heroes of his childhood : michael schumacher , michael jordan and michael jackson .
vettel even dreamed of becoming a musician as a kid .
" it was funny when i finally realized that i did n't have the voice for it , " he admitted in later life .
nevertheless , vettel 's passion remained - he 's a huge beatles fan and record collector to this day .
vettel also tried out a number of sports in his youth before settling on motor racing .
" i never scored many goals , and did n't even get called on to play that often , " vettel lamented , recalling his time on the football pitch .
he also tried tennis , table tennis , and even beach volleyball , but never settled for long .
" i was just never the best , so i stopped playing .
i hate losing . "
finally , vettel started following in the first michael 's footsteps more seriously , turning his attention to racing – a sport whose ethos he seems to enjoy .
" it 's irrelevant whether you 're second or fifth .
the only important thing is being no. 1 . "
with 10 pole positions , five wins , and now a world championship in 2010 , vettel has achieved that goal .

" this is an exciting time for science - something like a revolution , " said jiri rathousky , the project 's leader , as he demonstrated a contraption called a dip coater in the lab of the newly-opened center .
the center – aided by funding from the european union – is the pride and joy of the heyrovsky institute of physical chemistry , a rather drab concrete tower block in the northern suburbs of prague .
hidden away on the sixth floor , rathousky and his colleagues in white overalls are doing some truly remarkable things with very small materials .
the magic of photocatalysts " for example here we coat sheets of glass with a thin layer of a nanostructure called titanium dioxide , " rathousky explained .
" titanium dioxide is a very efficient photocatalyst , and in this way , we obtain a photocatalytically active surface .
this type of photocatalytically active surface can be used for example in air-conditioning , for cleaning the air , and for removal of pollutants by the action of light . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the paint cleared a cube of cigarette smoke in one hour photocatalysts , substances that speed up a chemical reaction when light hits them , have tremendous practical uses like sterilization and air cleansing .
in a small , rather dilapidated factory on the outskirts of prague , a company called advanced materials is putting titanium dioxide to use in something called photocatalytic paint , an incredibly clever , virtually translucent paint that actually cleans the air in your living room of everything from bacteria to cigarette smoke .
" even in a concentration of one cigarette per cubic metre , you see very high degradation rate , " said jan prochazka , advanced materials ' co-owner .
in one hour , he said , a cubic meter box used to test the paint is clean of cigarette smoke .
" we say -lsb- the paint will oxidize -rsb- ninety percent of all contaminants in 24 hours , but it 's much faster .
it 's just to stay on the safe side , " prochazka added .
molecular reaction the tiny titanium dioxide molecules in the paint react to uv rays in sunlight or special lamps , oxidizing everything from carcinogens to allergens to dust mites .
that means that titanium oxide molecules react with smoke or bacteria , essentially consuming it .
that leaves a by-product of water and carbon dioxide , which are harmless .
photocatalytic paint has been around for a while , but he says that their new technique has been refined to be hundreds of times more powerful and efficient , and could revolutionize the way air is cleaned in homes and offices .
however , this technique is still relatively new , and a 2008 study from the lawrence berkeley national laboratory in the us found that photocatalytic oxidization may increase the presence of formaldehyde , a potentially dangerous chemical , in a real-life , indoor setting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one industry analyst called nanotech " the oil industry of the future " undeterred , advanced materials is already shipping their product to spain , south africa and new zealand , and licences to make it in other countries are already being drawn up . the success of advanced materials and the creation of the nanocentre in prague have led some in the czech media to speak of the czech republic as having the potential to become a major force in nanotechnology in europe .
huge growth ahead but perhaps all of this trumpeting should be taken with a pinch of salt .
" nanotech is the new oil industry , " said dean freeman , a nanotech industry analyst with gartner research .
" there are many opportunities in the nanotech space for research .
the key is making a product that can get traction and be sold commercially .
from a research perspective i have not seen a great deal on nanotech from the czech republic .
-lsb- but that -rsb- could have more to do with how publicized any research is . "
however he added their success in accessing eu funds for nanotech projects – and the czech government 's commitment – certainly placed the czechs in a strong position to make a name for themselves on the global nanotech market .

they can stop off at the library and browse through a wide selection of books . it 's a daily task that dick van tol does with pride : tidying up all the books spread across tables and colorful seats .
but his workplace is n't your average library ; it 's located in the middle of one of europe 's busiest airports - schiphol in amsterdam .
the library is situated in the international transfers area , where a whole boulevard promoting dutch culture has been built .
it stands right next to schiphol 's branch of the netherlands ' main museum - the rijksmuseum .
" the idea was very simple : let 's lend books to passengers who go on holiday and they can bring the books back when they return , " said van tol , of probiblio , the institution that came up with the idea of an airport library .
" but then we realized that , logistically , it gets very complicated . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amsterdam 's airport is a major hub in central europe cozy retreat from traveling what the organizers decided to do was to arrange the space with a handful of tall shelves containing 1,200 books in 29 languages , most of them in english and german .
passengers can choose from a variety of themes - from photography and architecture to history and fiction - and browse through them , returning them to the shelves before their next flight .
they can also nestle down and relax in the enormous orange and purple chairs while flipping through the books that have caught their fancy .
" most of the 18 million people who only change planes here do n't see anything of holland , " van tol pointed out .
" and this is an opportunity to get acquainted with what holland looks like .
so , we also have - apart from the books - a photo exhibition about dutch landscapes . "
dutch culture to-go and that 's not all .
the library also boasts a multimedia offering , which includes ipads spread throughout the space so that passengers can watch videos and listen to dutch music .
occasionally , however , users try to hack the system in order to access the internet and this forces the computers to shut down for a large part of the day .
still , when they are in working order , users can hear tracks by world-famous dj tiesto or rock-chick anouk , or watch videos .
if they do n't have time to view everything that catches their eye , they can hook up to a touch screen located in the middle of the library and download videos about dutch paintings , fashion and design directly to their cell phones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the library helps travelers get to know holland - without leaving the airport something for everyone for some travelers , the paper part of schiphol 's lay-over library is just as interesting as the digital offerings .
" we 've found russian books for children here , " one male traveler said .
" it 's a good way to occupy the kids if you have time on your hands . "
another traveler said she would n't use the library because she always carries a book with her .
but the library is n't just for bookworms .
" i 've come here a second time now , " one man quipped .
" i like the ambience , so i come here immediately to relax and unwind .
i 'm just too tired to look at the books . "
project manager van tol , though , is n't deterred .
" the books are very well used here , " he said laughing - so not everyone just stops by for the comfortable chairs .
having opened in august , the library is still developing its collection .
users , for their part , have n't taken advantage of the honor system too much .
so far , only about a dozen books have been stolen , van tol said , and replacing them is cheaper than providing a 24-hour security service . author : cintia taylor -lrb- als -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 15.11.2010 leverkusen midfielder rolfes hopes injury nightmare is finally over großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolfes is a big physical player with a good passing eye a succession of knee injuries meant simon rolfes missed the 2010 world cup - a nearly worst-case scenario for any footballer .
he talked to deutsche welle about the ups and downs of trying to come back . before there was sami khedira , there was simon rolfes .
the 28-year-old midfielder was originally the one tipped to take over the stopper role from ageing veteran michael ballack .
but a meniscus injury in july 2009 ultimately stopped rolfes in his tracks just as he was reaching the peak of his career .
rolfes played through pain that fall .
after all , his club , bayer leverkusen , was topping the table , and he had established himself as a regular in the german national side .
but by october he had developed articular cartilage damage and had no option but to have an operation .
the problems did n't go away , and he was forced to go under the knife again in january and acknowledge that his dream of competing in south africa was over .
“ we were on a sensational run with leverkusen and topping the table at the winter break , ” rolfes told deutsche welle .
“ my plan was to come back in the second half of the season and be a full part of the team , since the games i had played that season had been the best of my career .
so , of course , the weeks following the january operation were really hard .
i realized i was n't going to play any role at all either in the bundesliga season or the world cup . ”
a slow but steady developer , rolfes had become an international caliber midfielder .
now he was forced to watch khedira take on a role in the german squad that he himself would have probably occupied , had he not been hurt .
khedira performed well in south africa and landed a deal with real madrid .
meanwhile , rolfes was just trying to regain his basic fitness .
daily drudgery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolfes had been getting regular starts for germany in one respect , rolfes has been lucky .
the injuries he suffered have ended many a footballer 's career .
but rehab work , to hear him describe it , is a total slog , and it is difficult for a top athlete to acknowledge that , through no fault of one 's own , one is not at the level one was just a few months before .
“ it takes time to accept and start looking forward again , ” rolfes said .
“ after the operation i was on crutches for eight weeks … and it hardly a lot of fun to lie around at home , exercising your leg or knee with a machine for six hours a day and watching your muscles virtually disappear . ”
rolfes also said that when he was able to work out with a football again , it was hard at first to commit to challenges .
overcoming fear , he said , came gradually as he got used to playing scrimmages in training sessions .
“ it 's such a long process , and in the beginning you ca n't imagine yourself being on the pitch again , ” rolfes remembered .
“ but step for step , they bring you along , and then at some point it 's over .
you get your confidence back in practice . ”
practice , in this case , does n't make perfect .
it gives a player the chance to regain what he 's lost .
positive outlook bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coming back from a knee injury takes lots of hard , boring work rolfes made his bundesliga comeback in late september , and so far , he 's been pretty good .
last month , he scored a pair of goals to help leverkusen beat wolfsburg , even though he only came on as a late substitute .
and perhaps more encouragingly , he 's played for a full 90 minutes in his last two games .
he also provided the assist for leverkusen 's lone goal in their win agaist st. pauli on the weekend , which took the team up to second in the bundesliga standings .
but will he ever be able to recapture the status he once had with germany head coach joachim loew ?
competition for spots in the midfield is fierce , with not even nominal team captain michael ballack being assured of making the squad .
rolfes draws hope from the very vagaries of football that put him out of commission for much of 2009 and 2010 .
“ a year ago , no one would have thought that bastian schweinsteiger and sami khedira would be the central midfielders at the world cup , ” rolfes said .
“ and likewise , no one knows what 's going to happen in two or three years ' time .
there 's always the possibility of injuries and other circumstances .
so you should n't concentrate on whether it 's difficult or not . ”
and rolfes does n't need to look far to find an example of hope .
his teammate at leverkusen , striker patrick helmes , was also knocked out of germany 's world cup squad by an injury , but has gotten a call-up to play in the nationalelf 's friendly against sweden this coming wednesday .
so even though rolfes has dropped off the radar screen of many casual germany fans , it would n't be all that surprising to find him on the plane when yogi and co. travel to euro 2012 in poland and ukraine , or even the 2014 world cup in brazil .
simon rolfes was interviewed by kamilla jarzina for dw-tv 's bundesliga kick off program .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 15.11.2010 leverkusen midfielder rolfes hopes injury nightmare is finally over großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolfes is a big physical player with a good passing eye a succession of knee injuries meant simon rolfes missed the 2010 world cup - a nearly worst-case scenario for any footballer .
he talked to deutsche welle about the ups and downs of trying to come back . before there was sami khedira , there was simon rolfes .
the 28-year-old midfielder was originally the one tipped to take over the stopper role from ageing veteran michael ballack .
but a meniscus injury in july 2009 ultimately stopped rolfes in his tracks just as he was reaching the peak of his career .
rolfes played through pain that fall .
after all , his club , bayer leverkusen , was topping the table , and he had established himself as a regular in the german national side .
but by october he had developed articular cartilage damage and had no option but to have an operation .
the problems did n't go away , and he was forced to go under the knife again in january and acknowledge that his dream of competing in south africa was over .
“ we were on a sensational run with leverkusen and topping the table at the winter break , ” rolfes told deutsche welle .
“ my plan was to come back in the second half of the season and be a full part of the team , since the games i had played that season had been the best of my career .
so , of course , the weeks following the january operation were really hard .
i realized i was n't going to play any role at all either in the bundesliga season or the world cup . ”
a slow but steady developer , rolfes had become an international caliber midfielder .
now he was forced to watch khedira take on a role in the german squad that he himself would have probably occupied , had he not been hurt .
khedira performed well in south africa and landed a deal with real madrid .
meanwhile , rolfes was just trying to regain his basic fitness .
daily drudgery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolfes had been getting regular starts for germany in one respect , rolfes has been lucky .
the injuries he suffered have ended many a footballer 's career .
but rehab work , to hear him describe it , is a total slog , and it is difficult for a top athlete to acknowledge that , through no fault of one 's own , one is not at the level one was just a few months before .
“ it takes time to accept and start looking forward again , ” rolfes said .
“ after the operation i was on crutches for eight weeks … and it hardly a lot of fun to lie around at home , exercising your leg or knee with a machine for six hours a day and watching your muscles virtually disappear . ”
rolfes also said that when he was able to work out with a football again , it was hard at first to commit to challenges .
overcoming fear , he said , came gradually as he got used to playing scrimmages in training sessions .
“ it 's such a long process , and in the beginning you ca n't imagine yourself being on the pitch again , ” rolfes remembered .
“ but step for step , they bring you along , and then at some point it 's over .
you get your confidence back in practice . ”
practice , in this case , does n't make perfect .
it gives a player the chance to regain what he 's lost .
positive outlook bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coming back from a knee injury takes lots of hard , boring work rolfes made his bundesliga comeback in late september , and so far , he 's been pretty good .
last month , he scored a pair of goals to help leverkusen beat wolfsburg , even though he only came on as a late substitute .
and perhaps more encouragingly , he 's played for a full 90 minutes in his last two games .
he also provided the assist for leverkusen 's lone goal in their win agaist st. pauli on the weekend , which took the team up to second in the bundesliga standings .
but will he ever be able to recapture the status he once had with germany head coach joachim loew ?
competition for spots in the midfield is fierce , with not even nominal team captain michael ballack being assured of making the squad .
rolfes draws hope from the very vagaries of football that put him out of commission for much of 2009 and 2010 .
“ a year ago , no one would have thought that bastian schweinsteiger and sami khedira would be the central midfielders at the world cup , ” rolfes said .
“ and likewise , no one knows what 's going to happen in two or three years ' time .
there 's always the possibility of injuries and other circumstances .
so you should n't concentrate on whether it 's difficult or not . ”
and rolfes does n't need to look far to find an example of hope .
his teammate at leverkusen , striker patrick helmes , was also knocked out of germany 's world cup squad by an injury , but has gotten a call-up to play in the nationalelf 's friendly against sweden this coming wednesday .
so even though rolfes has dropped off the radar screen of many casual germany fans , it would n't be all that surprising to find him on the plane when yogi and co. travel to euro 2012 in poland and ukraine , or even the 2014 world cup in brazil .
simon rolfes was interviewed by kamilla jarzina for dw-tv 's bundesliga kick off program .

but a meniscus injury in july 2009 ultimately stopped rolfes in his tracks just as he was reaching the peak of his career .
rolfes played through pain that fall .
after all , his club , bayer leverkusen , was topping the table , and he had established himself as a regular in the german national side .
but by october he had developed articular cartilage damage and had no option but to have an operation .
the problems did n't go away , and he was forced to go under the knife again in january and acknowledge that his dream of competing in south africa was over .
“ we were on a sensational run with leverkusen and topping the table at the winter break , ” rolfes told deutsche welle .
“ my plan was to come back in the second half of the season and be a full part of the team , since the games i had played that season had been the best of my career .
so , of course , the weeks following the january operation were really hard .
i realized i was n't going to play any role at all either in the bundesliga season or the world cup . ”
a slow but steady developer , rolfes had become an international caliber midfielder .
now he was forced to watch khedira take on a role in the german squad that he himself would have probably occupied , had he not been hurt .
khedira performed well in south africa and landed a deal with real madrid .
meanwhile , rolfes was just trying to regain his basic fitness .
daily drudgery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolfes had been getting regular starts for germany in one respect , rolfes has been lucky .
the injuries he suffered have ended many a footballer 's career .
but rehab work , to hear him describe it , is a total slog , and it is difficult for a top athlete to acknowledge that , through no fault of one 's own , one is not at the level one was just a few months before .
“ it takes time to accept and start looking forward again , ” rolfes said .
“ after the operation i was on crutches for eight weeks … and it hardly a lot of fun to lie around at home , exercising your leg or knee with a machine for six hours a day and watching your muscles virtually disappear . ”
rolfes also said that when he was able to work out with a football again , it was hard at first to commit to challenges .
overcoming fear , he said , came gradually as he got used to playing scrimmages in training sessions .
“ it 's such a long process , and in the beginning you ca n't imagine yourself being on the pitch again , ” rolfes remembered .
“ but step for step , they bring you along , and then at some point it 's over .
you get your confidence back in practice . ”
practice , in this case , does n't make perfect .
it gives a player the chance to regain what he 's lost .
positive outlook bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coming back from a knee injury takes lots of hard , boring work rolfes made his bundesliga comeback in late september , and so far , he 's been pretty good .
last month , he scored a pair of goals to help leverkusen beat wolfsburg , even though he only came on as a late substitute .
and perhaps more encouragingly , he 's played for a full 90 minutes in his last two games .
he also provided the assist for leverkusen 's lone goal in their win agaist st. pauli on the weekend , which took the team up to second in the bundesliga standings .
but will he ever be able to recapture the status he once had with germany head coach joachim loew ?
competition for spots in the midfield is fierce , with not even nominal team captain michael ballack being assured of making the squad .
rolfes draws hope from the very vagaries of football that put him out of commission for much of 2009 and 2010 .
“ a year ago , no one would have thought that bastian schweinsteiger and sami khedira would be the central midfielders at the world cup , ” rolfes said .
“ and likewise , no one knows what 's going to happen in two or three years ' time .
there 's always the possibility of injuries and other circumstances .
so you should n't concentrate on whether it 's difficult or not . ”
and rolfes does n't need to look far to find an example of hope .
his teammate at leverkusen , striker patrick helmes , was also knocked out of germany 's world cup squad by an injury , but has gotten a call-up to play in the nationalelf 's friendly against sweden this coming wednesday .
so even though rolfes has dropped off the radar screen of many casual germany fans , it would n't be all that surprising to find him on the plane when yogi and co. travel to euro 2012 in poland and ukraine , or even the 2014 world cup in brazil .
simon rolfes was interviewed by kamilla jarzina for dw-tv 's bundesliga kick off program .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de motor racing -pipe- 15.11.2010 forget ' baby schumi , ' now sebastian vettel is world champion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not just a champion , but the youngest in f1 history sebastian vettel has become the youngest world champion in the history of formula one .
if vettel appeared calm before the final race in abu dhabi , the 23-year-old german was overcome with emotion afterwards . sebastian vettel cried tears of joy after sunday 's race in abu dhabi , after his team radioed in to tell him he had clinched the world championship , seemingly against all the odds .
" unbelievable .
thank you lads .
i love you , " the 23-year-old german said with a quivering voice from the cockpit .
after that , all you could really make out on the transmission were loud cries of celebration from the man with the glittering helmet .
" baby schumi " was what the german tabloid press once called him , but it was michael schumacher himself who pointed out earlier this year that vettel had outgrown that nickname , and the youngster has now proved beyond any doubt that as world champion , he should stand in nobody 's shadow .
" i did n't know anything until i passed the checkered flag " this world championship is the high point of an already stellar career .
vettel was born in 1987 in the southwestern german town of heppenheim , and his father norbert ensured that sebastian was bitten by the motorsport bug very early .
aged four , vettel first thrashed a go-kart around his parents ' driveway , and his first successes - as with almost all modern racers - followed racing in go-karts in his youth .
eventually , the youngster was noticed , and promoted to the single-seater formula bmw racing series .
as a debutante , vettel was immediately runner-up , and the next year he came back and won an incredible 18 out of 20 races .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel 's tasted champagne as a winner five times in 2010 vettel moved on to formula 3 , where he never managed to claim the grand prize , but that was because his fame was already overtaking him and his rise up the ladder was accelerating .
in 2006 , he was given his first shot in a formula one car in a young driver test , immediately posting the fastest time .
the next year , in indianapolis , an injury to then bmw-sauber driver robert kubica gave vettel his chance on a race weekend .
still in his teens , he promptly became not only the youngest driver to compete in a grand prix -lrb- a record he has since lost -rrb- , but also the youngest-ever points-scorer in the sport 's history - bringing his bmw home in eighth on his debut .
the early-achiever continued tearing up f1 's age-related record book in the following season .
driving for the underfunded toro rosso team , vettel became the youngest ever pole-sitter and then winner in a single wet weekend in monza , doing the double for his minor team as the championship battle raged around him .
two years on , after being promoted to the red bull outfit , vettel has completed his cv , becoming the youngest world champion in the sport 's history , displacing 2008 winner lewis hamilton by less than a year .
" i am a bit speechless .
i do n't know what you are supposed to say at this moment , " a usually loquacious vettel admitted in the post-race press conference .
" to be honest i did n't know anything until i passed the checkered flag . "
vettel not only needed a win , championship leader fernando alonso had to finish fifth or lower for him to win the title , but the spanish ferrari driver had a poor race , and could only salvage seventh .
" i hate losing " bildunterschrift : the youngster 's love of winning is displayed by his trademark index-finger celebration vettel - never one to aim low - points to the three michaels as heroes of his childhood : michael schumacher , michael jordan and michael jackson .
vettel even dreamed of becoming a musician as a kid .
" it was funny when i finally realized that i did n't have the voice for it , " he admitted in later life .
nevertheless , vettel 's passion remained - he 's a huge beatles fan and record collector to this day .
vettel also tried out a number of sports in his youth before settling on motor racing .
" i never scored many goals , and did n't even get called on to play that often , " vettel lamented , recalling his time on the football pitch .
he also tried tennis , table tennis , and even beach volleyball , but never settled for long .
" i was just never the best , so i stopped playing .
i hate losing . "
finally , vettel started following in the first michael 's footsteps more seriously , turning his attention to racing – a sport whose ethos he seems to enjoy .
" it 's irrelevant whether you 're second or fifth .
the only important thing is being no. 1 . "
with 10 pole positions , five wins , and now a world championship in 2010 , vettel has achieved that goal .

meanwhile , others wondered how a problem of this magnitude could even happen . the death toll from haiti 's cholera epidemic has reached more than 900 and the disease is present in six of the 10 provinces of the earthquake-battered caribbean country , the health ministry said over the weekend .
more than 15,000 people have been infected since the epidemic 's outbreak in late october , the health ministry said sunday , and the epidemic showed no sign of abating .
there were 120 new deaths since friday 's toll .
according to the ministry on monday , 917 people have died of the disease so far .
worse expected to come according to un estimates , up to 200,000 people could fall ill with cholera .
the world body on friday applied for another $ 163 million -lrb- 120 million euros -rrb- in donor aid .
the disease broke out in the northern artibonite region , where it continues to be most concentrated .
it is contracted through contaminated water and causes severe diarrhea and vomiting .
bildunterschrift : the fear is growing that the epidemic will spread to refugee camps authorities and international aid agencies were struggling to contain the latest crisis afflicting the impoverished island nation .
efforts are centering on preventing the disease from spreading in crowded city slums and tent camps that house over 1.3 million homeless people who survived the cataclysmic earthquake , nearly a year ago .
but the facts of the epidemic raise the question of how such a preventable disease could break out in a country that has been flooded with hundreds of millions of euros in foreign assistance since the earthquake .
resource coordination is problem " huge sums in aid money have gone there , but the people in the north seem to have been left to their own devices , " sven stockrahm , a journalist with german newspaper die zeit who wrote about the earthquake , told deutsche welle .
stockrahm stressed that his critical remarks were not aimed at humanitarian aid workers , who by all accounts are doing vital work under very trying circumstances .
the key question is whether a better coordination of the resources in place could have prevented cholera from occurring in the first place .
bildunterschrift : aid workers are working ahrd to meet the needs of growing patient numbers but clear answers are difficult to come by where haiti is concerned .
the causes of cholera , lack of clean drinking water and poor sanitation are well-known , but at present , no one is sure exactly how the disease even broke out in artibonite .
poor sanitation , even pre-earthquake what is certain is that conditions in haiti even before the earthquake were far from adequate .
a study by the world health organization and unicef found that open defecation was prevalent among just under half of rural haitians and that 3.7 million of haiti 's total population of 9 million had no reliable source of clean drinking water .
moreover , from 1990 to 2008 , conditions deteriorated .
a similar study by the united nations in 2009 determined that 42 percent of haitians were not using an " improved water source . "
haiti ranks dead last among countries in south america and the caribbean in all major water and hygiene categories .
" cholera is a sickness of poverty that is common in refugee camps where there ’ s not enough drinking water , " ernst diekmann - a doctor with germany 's society for technical cooperation , or gtz - told deutsche welle .
" haiti was already an underprivileged country , and the situation was exacerbated by the natural catastrophe . "
problem exacerbated by refugees nonetheless , aid workers acknowledge that pre-existing deficiencies and the slow recovery process are two parts of the same overall problem that encouraged the cholera outbreak .
and the issue of earthquake refugees only exacerbates those problems .
bildunterschrift : as the disease spreads , burials are on the rise " the dramatic thing about haiti is that even before the earthquake the health infrastructure was fully inadequate , " said joost butenop , a medical adviser to the aid organization caritas .
" aid organizations have concentrated on the region specifically affected -lsb- by the earthquake -rsb- and have n't been following the refugees to any great extent . "
organizational challenges earlier this year , the humanitarian organization refugees international went even further , claiming that recovery efforts in haiti were not just sluggish , but " paralyzed . "
off the record , many people who work in the aid and assistance sector say that shortcomings in coordination often prevent help from getting where it 's needed - or problems from being effectively anticipated .
that task falls to the united nations and the haitian government , and representatives of the former have openly admitted that the situation in haiti tests their limits .
the will to help is there .
germany 's ministry for economic cooperation and development , for instance , says that most of the 51.4 million euros -lrb- $ 72 million -rrb- it was allocated for haiti has already been distributed or earmarked for future projects .
yet merely distinguishing between emergency needs and long-term developmental requirements , and figuring out which government ministry is responsible , can be a complicated process .
and coordinating the enormous number of private and public organizations trying to help in haiti represents an organizational task of the highest order .
at this point , no one can say definitively whether any particular authority should have foreseen the danger of cholera in haiti and taken precautionary steps to prevent it .
but the outbreak of the disease in a country that has been the focus of so much international assistance suggests that overall organization and coordination remain problems that hinder aid initiatives from having their maximum possible effect .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 15.11.2010 merkel reelected as head of christian democratic union party großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel needed a good election result chancellor angela merkel has won reelection as leader of the christian democratic union .
she gained widespread support at this week 's party conference , which comes ahead of several key state elections in 2011 . german chancellor angela merkel has been reelected as head of her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- party , a sign that the party stands behind merkel despite recent doubts of the effectiveness of merkel and the cdu in leading the government . merkel ran unopposed and garnered the support of just over 90 percent of her party colleagues .
two years ago she received 95 percent of the votes when she was elected party head .
observers believed a drastic drop in that number would have indicated discontent from within the cdu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stuttgart rail project has proven to be deeply divisive merkel 's cdu and its junior coalition partner , the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , have taken a beating in the opinion polls over the last year over an unpopular bailout for fellow eurozone member greece , the decision to extend the operating lives of nuclear power plants and an expensive rail infrastructure project in stuttgart that has inspired massive local protests . with elections to be held in six of germany 's 16 states , 2011 is set to be a key year for merkel 's government .
earlier this year , the center-right coalition already suffered a major blow when it lost power in the country 's most populous state north rhine-westphalia and control of the bundesrat , the country 's upper house of parliament , along with it . leadership renewal the cdu took another hit when president horst koehler stepped down in june after being criticized for suggesting the german military had a role in protecting the country 's economic interests .
several other big names have left the political stage and merkel is set to get a new team of leaders standing behind her . around 1,000 cdu delegates are gathered in karlsruhe , where the party also voted on merkel ’ s four deputy leaders .
education minister annette schavan was reelected to the post , while environment minister norbert roettgen , labor minister ursula von der leyen and hesse premier volker bouffier recieved their first nominations . schaeuble put to task ahead of the party conference , merkel reiterated her support for finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , whose suitability for the job has been questioned recently due to chronic health problems , which led the minister to a three-week hospitalization last month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble insists he 's fit enough to keep his post merkel maintained that schaeuble was a capable minister and that the party ’ s support for him was strong , telling zdf public television , " i enjoy being chancellor with schaeuble as my finance minister .

francois fillon has already been renamed as prime minister . the renewal of the french cabinet has been in the offing since march , and the resignations are considered a traditional formality , allowing the head of state to select new ministers without having to give any incumbents the axe . it was expected that fillon would be quickly reappointed as prime minister , while the new cabinet will likely be made up of politicians from sarkozy 's center-right ump party . the prime minister will likely assemble his new team for sarkozy 's approval as soon as monday . the reshuffle will be the fourth of sarkozy 's presidency .
the president has seen his popularity decline to around 30 percent over the introduction of a pension reform that increases the retirement age by two years . according to afp news agency , former prime minister and current bordeaux mayor alain juppe tacitly confirmed that he expected to return to government , possibly to take charge of the defense ministry .
foreign minister bernard kouchner , a high-profile former socialist , is expected to be replaced by a member of the ump . there has been mounting political tension in france in recent months as the president 's supporters jostle for position ahead of speculation that sarkozy will bid for re-election in 2012 . author : darren mara -lrb- afp , ap , dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , others wondered how a problem of this magnitude could even happen . the death toll from haiti 's cholera epidemic has reached more than 900 and the disease is present in six of the 10 provinces of the earthquake-battered caribbean country , the health ministry said over the weekend .
more than 15,000 people have been infected since the epidemic 's outbreak in late october , the health ministry said sunday , and the epidemic showed no sign of abating .
there were 120 new deaths since friday 's toll .
according to the ministry on monday , 917 people have died of the disease so far .
worse expected to come according to un estimates , up to 200,000 people could fall ill with cholera .
the world body on friday applied for another $ 163 million -lrb- 120 million euros -rrb- in donor aid .
the disease broke out in the northern artibonite region , where it continues to be most concentrated .
it is contracted through contaminated water and causes severe diarrhea and vomiting .
bildunterschrift : the fear is growing that the epidemic will spread to refugee camps authorities and international aid agencies were struggling to contain the latest crisis afflicting the impoverished island nation .
efforts are centering on preventing the disease from spreading in crowded city slums and tent camps that house over 1.3 million homeless people who survived the cataclysmic earthquake , nearly a year ago .
but the facts of the epidemic raise the question of how such a preventable disease could break out in a country that has been flooded with hundreds of millions of euros in foreign assistance since the earthquake .
resource coordination is problem " huge sums in aid money have gone there , but the people in the north seem to have been left to their own devices , " sven stockrahm , a journalist with german newspaper die zeit who wrote about the earthquake , told deutsche welle .
stockrahm stressed that his critical remarks were not aimed at humanitarian aid workers , who by all accounts are doing vital work under very trying circumstances .
the key question is whether a better coordination of the resources in place could have prevented cholera from occurring in the first place .
bildunterschrift : aid workers are working ahrd to meet the needs of growing patient numbers but clear answers are difficult to come by where haiti is concerned .
the causes of cholera , lack of clean drinking water and poor sanitation are well-known , but at present , no one is sure exactly how the disease even broke out in artibonite .
poor sanitation , even pre-earthquake what is certain is that conditions in haiti even before the earthquake were far from adequate .
a study by the world health organization and unicef found that open defecation was prevalent among just under half of rural haitians and that 3.7 million of haiti 's total population of 9 million had no reliable source of clean drinking water .
moreover , from 1990 to 2008 , conditions deteriorated .
a similar study by the united nations in 2009 determined that 42 percent of haitians were not using an " improved water source . "
haiti ranks dead last among countries in south america and the caribbean in all major water and hygiene categories .
" cholera is a sickness of poverty that is common in refugee camps where there ’ s not enough drinking water , " ernst diekmann - a doctor with germany 's society for technical cooperation , or gtz - told deutsche welle .
" haiti was already an underprivileged country , and the situation was exacerbated by the natural catastrophe . "
problem exacerbated by refugees nonetheless , aid workers acknowledge that pre-existing deficiencies and the slow recovery process are two parts of the same overall problem that encouraged the cholera outbreak .
and the issue of earthquake refugees only exacerbates those problems .
bildunterschrift : as the disease spreads , burials are on the rise " the dramatic thing about haiti is that even before the earthquake the health infrastructure was fully inadequate , " said joost butenop , a medical adviser to the aid organization caritas .
" aid organizations have concentrated on the region specifically affected -lsb- by the earthquake -rsb- and have n't been following the refugees to any great extent . "
organizational challenges earlier this year , the humanitarian organization refugees international went even further , claiming that recovery efforts in haiti were not just sluggish , but " paralyzed . "
off the record , many people who work in the aid and assistance sector say that shortcomings in coordination often prevent help from getting where it 's needed - or problems from being effectively anticipated .
that task falls to the united nations and the haitian government , and representatives of the former have openly admitted that the situation in haiti tests their limits .
the will to help is there .
germany 's ministry for economic cooperation and development , for instance , says that most of the 51.4 million euros -lrb- $ 72 million -rrb- it was allocated for haiti has already been distributed or earmarked for future projects .
yet merely distinguishing between emergency needs and long-term developmental requirements , and figuring out which government ministry is responsible , can be a complicated process .
and coordinating the enormous number of private and public organizations trying to help in haiti represents an organizational task of the highest order .
at this point , no one can say definitively whether any particular authority should have foreseen the danger of cholera in haiti and taken precautionary steps to prevent it .
but the outbreak of the disease in a country that has been the focus of so much international assistance suggests that overall organization and coordination remain problems that hinder aid initiatives from having their maximum possible effect .

the film , ' romeo and juliet in yiddish , ' gives the world 's most famous romance a new twist . move over montagues and capulets : here come the chabads and the satmars .
the two rival sects of ultra-orthodox jews face off in a witty and bittersweet film titled " romeo and juliet in yiddish . "
a chance encounter between director eve annenberg and some members of new york 's hasidic community developed into a friendship and collaboration on the film .
it explores the rough-and-tumble existence of young jews who have left the ultra-orthodox world behind .
annenberg was fascinated by a younger generation speaking a language she thought was more or less consigned to the archives . " my grandmother who spoke yiddish and my mother who spoke yiddish are now both dead , and i wo n't hear it again .
and yet , the lure of speaking yiddish and being around people with this verbal vitality is so strong , " annenberg said .
bildunterschrift : the film deals with tension between orthodox and secular jews an introduction to the bard the director also has a role in the film .
she plays an emergency room nurse who 's trying to finish her master 's degree in germanic languages .
after she accepts her advisor 's suggestion to translate " romeo and juliet " into yiddish , she recruits some young native speakers to help her out .
" i think this is the first ' romeo and juliet ' where they wake up in the morning , and romeo reaches for his glasses .
that was an important detail to me .
i wanted it to be , well , jewish .
and yes , we read a lot ! "
annenberg said with a laugh .
but shakespeare has n't been on the reading list for many in the ultra-orthodox community , which has remained closed to much of the outside world .
the young translators in the film have never heard of the bard .
they also do n't have much sense of romantic love .
life meets art in the film , annenberg 's character makes her preference for the secular clear and even declares that she hates the orthodox .
" i 'm expressing that jew-on-jew hostility that i 'd certainly like to see less of , and i see the movie as a rapprochement between the two camps , " annenberg said .
" if ever a bunch of people did n't understand each other that well , it 's the ultra-secular and the ultra-orthodox . "
in the film , the young translators ' personal stories begin to overlap with the plot of " romeo and juliet , " once they wrap their heads around it .
the back story is that these first-time actors , like their characters , are forging new lives outside of the ultra-orthodox community where they grew up .
melissa weisz plays juliet and traveled to berlin for the jewish film festival where the movie premiered this summer .
" we came to berlin and spoke to non-jews , and it gives you a whole different perception of the world , " weisz said .
" we were told that every gentile would hurt us .
the way we were raised is very insular and a little bit brainwashed . "
bildunterschrift : melissa weisz plays juliet more premieres ahead the actors ' experience in the german capital was fruitful .
not only were they on hand to receive the audience favorite award at berlin 's jewish film festival , they also received invitations to come back and guest lecture at yiddish courses .
lazer weisz plays the romeo character and enjoyed the feedback on the film from people in the audience . " they like the whole idea that yiddish is coming back to germany .
it 's very nice .
it makes the whole thing worth it in a way , " he said .
the film 's next stop is london on november 16 , and it will debut in new york in january .
the screenings offer a departure from the usual shakespearean experience .
since 65 percent of the movie is in yiddish , the scenes from romeo and juliet appear with the bard 's original lines subtitled in english .
if the film continues to charm audiences as it did in germany , perhaps another yiddish language production will follow .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de research -pipe- 15.11.2010 czech company produces air-cleansing paint großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photocatalysis has a wealth of potential practical uses czech scientists and companies are currently working on some exciting innovations in nanotechnology , including a new paint that uses photocatalytic oxydation to clean the air . a czech firm has recently started producing a powerful photocatalytic paint that cleans the air of cigarette smoke , viruses and bacteria in minutes , whilst the czech academy of sciences has just opened a new nanocenter to spearhead research into practical applications for nanoscience .
" this is an exciting time for science - something like a revolution , " said jiri rathousky , the project 's leader , as he demonstrated a contraption called a dip coater in the lab of the newly-opened center .
the center – aided by funding from the european union – is the pride and joy of the heyrovsky institute of physical chemistry , a rather drab concrete tower block in the northern suburbs of prague .
hidden away on the sixth floor , rathousky and his colleagues in white overalls are doing some truly remarkable things with very small materials .
the magic of photocatalysts " for example here we coat sheets of glass with a thin layer of a nanostructure called titanium dioxide , " rathousky explained .
" titanium dioxide is a very efficient photocatalyst , and in this way , we obtain a photocatalytically active surface .
this type of photocatalytically active surface can be used for example in air-conditioning , for cleaning the air , and for removal of pollutants by the action of light . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the paint cleared a cube of cigarette smoke in one hour photocatalysts , substances that speed up a chemical reaction when light hits them , have tremendous practical uses like sterilization and air cleansing .
in a small , rather dilapidated factory on the outskirts of prague , a company called advanced materials is putting titanium dioxide to use in something called photocatalytic paint , an incredibly clever , virtually translucent paint that actually cleans the air in your living room of everything from bacteria to cigarette smoke .
" even in a concentration of one cigarette per cubic metre , you see very high degradation rate , " said jan prochazka , advanced materials ' co-owner .
in one hour , he said , a cubic meter box used to test the paint is clean of cigarette smoke .
" we say -lsb- the paint will oxidize -rsb- ninety percent of all contaminants in 24 hours , but it 's much faster .
it 's just to stay on the safe side , " prochazka added .
molecular reaction the tiny titanium dioxide molecules in the paint react to uv rays in sunlight or special lamps , oxidizing everything from carcinogens to allergens to dust mites .
that means that titanium oxide molecules react with smoke or bacteria , essentially consuming it .
that leaves a by-product of water and carbon dioxide , which are harmless .
photocatalytic paint has been around for a while , but he says that their new technique has been refined to be hundreds of times more powerful and efficient , and could revolutionize the way air is cleaned in homes and offices .
however , this technique is still relatively new , and a 2008 study from the lawrence berkeley national laboratory in the us found that photocatalytic oxidization may increase the presence of formaldehyde , a potentially dangerous chemical , in a real-life , indoor setting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one industry analyst called nanotech " the oil industry of the future " undeterred , advanced materials is already shipping their product to spain , south africa and new zealand , and licences to make it in other countries are already being drawn up . the success of advanced materials and the creation of the nanocentre in prague have led some in the czech media to speak of the czech republic as having the potential to become a major force in nanotechnology in europe .
huge growth ahead but perhaps all of this trumpeting should be taken with a pinch of salt .
" nanotech is the new oil industry , " said dean freeman , a nanotech industry analyst with gartner research .
" there are many opportunities in the nanotech space for research .
the key is making a product that can get traction and be sold commercially .
from a research perspective i have not seen a great deal on nanotech from the czech republic .
-lsb- but that -rsb- could have more to do with how publicized any research is . "
however he added their success in accessing eu funds for nanotech projects – and the czech government 's commitment – certainly placed the czechs in a strong position to make a name for themselves on the global nanotech market .

meanwhile , others wondered how a problem of this magnitude could even happen . the death toll from haiti 's cholera epidemic has reached more than 900 and the disease is present in six of the 10 provinces of the earthquake-battered caribbean country , the health ministry said over the weekend .
more than 15,000 people have been infected since the epidemic 's outbreak in late october , the health ministry said sunday , and the epidemic showed no sign of abating .
there were 120 new deaths since friday 's toll .
according to the ministry on monday , 917 people have died of the disease so far .
worse expected to come according to un estimates , up to 200,000 people could fall ill with cholera .
the world body on friday applied for another $ 163 million -lrb- 120 million euros -rrb- in donor aid .
the disease broke out in the northern artibonite region , where it continues to be most concentrated .
it is contracted through contaminated water and causes severe diarrhea and vomiting .
bildunterschrift : the fear is growing that the epidemic will spread to refugee camps authorities and international aid agencies were struggling to contain the latest crisis afflicting the impoverished island nation .
efforts are centering on preventing the disease from spreading in crowded city slums and tent camps that house over 1.3 million homeless people who survived the cataclysmic earthquake , nearly a year ago .
but the facts of the epidemic raise the question of how such a preventable disease could break out in a country that has been flooded with hundreds of millions of euros in foreign assistance since the earthquake .
resource coordination is problem " huge sums in aid money have gone there , but the people in the north seem to have been left to their own devices , " sven stockrahm , a journalist with german newspaper die zeit who wrote about the earthquake , told deutsche welle .
stockrahm stressed that his critical remarks were not aimed at humanitarian aid workers , who by all accounts are doing vital work under very trying circumstances .
the key question is whether a better coordination of the resources in place could have prevented cholera from occurring in the first place .
bildunterschrift : aid workers are working ahrd to meet the needs of growing patient numbers but clear answers are difficult to come by where haiti is concerned .
the causes of cholera , lack of clean drinking water and poor sanitation are well-known , but at present , no one is sure exactly how the disease even broke out in artibonite .
poor sanitation , even pre-earthquake what is certain is that conditions in haiti even before the earthquake were far from adequate .
a study by the world health organization and unicef found that open defecation was prevalent among just under half of rural haitians and that 3.7 million of haiti 's total population of 9 million had no reliable source of clean drinking water .
moreover , from 1990 to 2008 , conditions deteriorated .
a similar study by the united nations in 2009 determined that 42 percent of haitians were not using an " improved water source . "
haiti ranks dead last among countries in south america and the caribbean in all major water and hygiene categories .
" cholera is a sickness of poverty that is common in refugee camps where there ’ s not enough drinking water , " ernst diekmann - a doctor with germany 's society for technical cooperation , or gtz - told deutsche welle .
" haiti was already an underprivileged country , and the situation was exacerbated by the natural catastrophe . "
problem exacerbated by refugees nonetheless , aid workers acknowledge that pre-existing deficiencies and the slow recovery process are two parts of the same overall problem that encouraged the cholera outbreak .
and the issue of earthquake refugees only exacerbates those problems .
bildunterschrift : as the disease spreads , burials are on the rise " the dramatic thing about haiti is that even before the earthquake the health infrastructure was fully inadequate , " said joost butenop , a medical adviser to the aid organization caritas .
" aid organizations have concentrated on the region specifically affected -lsb- by the earthquake -rsb- and have n't been following the refugees to any great extent . "
organizational challenges earlier this year , the humanitarian organization refugees international went even further , claiming that recovery efforts in haiti were not just sluggish , but " paralyzed . "
off the record , many people who work in the aid and assistance sector say that shortcomings in coordination often prevent help from getting where it 's needed - or problems from being effectively anticipated .
that task falls to the united nations and the haitian government , and representatives of the former have openly admitted that the situation in haiti tests their limits .
the will to help is there .
germany 's ministry for economic cooperation and development , for instance , says that most of the 51.4 million euros -lrb- $ 72 million -rrb- it was allocated for haiti has already been distributed or earmarked for future projects .
yet merely distinguishing between emergency needs and long-term developmental requirements , and figuring out which government ministry is responsible , can be a complicated process .
and coordinating the enormous number of private and public organizations trying to help in haiti represents an organizational task of the highest order .
at this point , no one can say definitively whether any particular authority should have foreseen the danger of cholera in haiti and taken precautionary steps to prevent it .
but the outbreak of the disease in a country that has been the focus of so much international assistance suggests that overall organization and coordination remain problems that hinder aid initiatives from having their maximum possible effect .

the film , ' romeo and juliet in yiddish , ' gives the world 's most famous romance a new twist . move over montagues and capulets : here come the chabads and the satmars .
the two rival sects of ultra-orthodox jews face off in a witty and bittersweet film titled " romeo and juliet in yiddish . "
a chance encounter between director eve annenberg and some members of new york 's hasidic community developed into a friendship and collaboration on the film .
it explores the rough-and-tumble existence of young jews who have left the ultra-orthodox world behind .
annenberg was fascinated by a younger generation speaking a language she thought was more or less consigned to the archives . " my grandmother who spoke yiddish and my mother who spoke yiddish are now both dead , and i wo n't hear it again .
and yet , the lure of speaking yiddish and being around people with this verbal vitality is so strong , " annenberg said .
bildunterschrift : the film deals with tension between orthodox and secular jews an introduction to the bard the director also has a role in the film .
she plays an emergency room nurse who 's trying to finish her master 's degree in germanic languages .
after she accepts her advisor 's suggestion to translate " romeo and juliet " into yiddish , she recruits some young native speakers to help her out .
" i think this is the first ' romeo and juliet ' where they wake up in the morning , and romeo reaches for his glasses .
that was an important detail to me .
i wanted it to be , well , jewish .
and yes , we read a lot ! "
annenberg said with a laugh .
but shakespeare has n't been on the reading list for many in the ultra-orthodox community , which has remained closed to much of the outside world .
the young translators in the film have never heard of the bard .
they also do n't have much sense of romantic love .
life meets art in the film , annenberg 's character makes her preference for the secular clear and even declares that she hates the orthodox .
" i 'm expressing that jew-on-jew hostility that i 'd certainly like to see less of , and i see the movie as a rapprochement between the two camps , " annenberg said .
" if ever a bunch of people did n't understand each other that well , it 's the ultra-secular and the ultra-orthodox . "
in the film , the young translators ' personal stories begin to overlap with the plot of " romeo and juliet , " once they wrap their heads around it .
the back story is that these first-time actors , like their characters , are forging new lives outside of the ultra-orthodox community where they grew up .
melissa weisz plays juliet and traveled to berlin for the jewish film festival where the movie premiered this summer .
" we came to berlin and spoke to non-jews , and it gives you a whole different perception of the world , " weisz said .
" we were told that every gentile would hurt us .
the way we were raised is very insular and a little bit brainwashed . "
bildunterschrift : melissa weisz plays juliet more premieres ahead the actors ' experience in the german capital was fruitful .
not only were they on hand to receive the audience favorite award at berlin 's jewish film festival , they also received invitations to come back and guest lecture at yiddish courses .
lazer weisz plays the romeo character and enjoyed the feedback on the film from people in the audience . " they like the whole idea that yiddish is coming back to germany .
it 's very nice .
it makes the whole thing worth it in a way , " he said .
the film 's next stop is london on november 16 , and it will debut in new york in january .
the screenings offer a departure from the usual shakespearean experience .
since 65 percent of the movie is in yiddish , the scenes from romeo and juliet appear with the bard 's original lines subtitled in english .
if the film continues to charm audiences as it did in germany , perhaps another yiddish language production will follow .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de research -pipe- 15.11.2010 czech company produces air-cleansing paint großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photocatalysis has a wealth of potential practical uses czech scientists and companies are currently working on some exciting innovations in nanotechnology , including a new paint that uses photocatalytic oxydation to clean the air . a czech firm has recently started producing a powerful photocatalytic paint that cleans the air of cigarette smoke , viruses and bacteria in minutes , whilst the czech academy of sciences has just opened a new nanocenter to spearhead research into practical applications for nanoscience .
" this is an exciting time for science - something like a revolution , " said jiri rathousky , the project 's leader , as he demonstrated a contraption called a dip coater in the lab of the newly-opened center .
the center – aided by funding from the european union – is the pride and joy of the heyrovsky institute of physical chemistry , a rather drab concrete tower block in the northern suburbs of prague .
hidden away on the sixth floor , rathousky and his colleagues in white overalls are doing some truly remarkable things with very small materials .
the magic of photocatalysts " for example here we coat sheets of glass with a thin layer of a nanostructure called titanium dioxide , " rathousky explained .
" titanium dioxide is a very efficient photocatalyst , and in this way , we obtain a photocatalytically active surface .
this type of photocatalytically active surface can be used for example in air-conditioning , for cleaning the air , and for removal of pollutants by the action of light . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the paint cleared a cube of cigarette smoke in one hour photocatalysts , substances that speed up a chemical reaction when light hits them , have tremendous practical uses like sterilization and air cleansing .
in a small , rather dilapidated factory on the outskirts of prague , a company called advanced materials is putting titanium dioxide to use in something called photocatalytic paint , an incredibly clever , virtually translucent paint that actually cleans the air in your living room of everything from bacteria to cigarette smoke .
" even in a concentration of one cigarette per cubic metre , you see very high degradation rate , " said jan prochazka , advanced materials ' co-owner .
in one hour , he said , a cubic meter box used to test the paint is clean of cigarette smoke .
" we say -lsb- the paint will oxidize -rsb- ninety percent of all contaminants in 24 hours , but it 's much faster .
it 's just to stay on the safe side , " prochazka added .
molecular reaction the tiny titanium dioxide molecules in the paint react to uv rays in sunlight or special lamps , oxidizing everything from carcinogens to allergens to dust mites .
that means that titanium oxide molecules react with smoke or bacteria , essentially consuming it .
that leaves a by-product of water and carbon dioxide , which are harmless .
photocatalytic paint has been around for a while , but he says that their new technique has been refined to be hundreds of times more powerful and efficient , and could revolutionize the way air is cleaned in homes and offices .
however , this technique is still relatively new , and a 2008 study from the lawrence berkeley national laboratory in the us found that photocatalytic oxidization may increase the presence of formaldehyde , a potentially dangerous chemical , in a real-life , indoor setting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one industry analyst called nanotech " the oil industry of the future " undeterred , advanced materials is already shipping their product to spain , south africa and new zealand , and licences to make it in other countries are already being drawn up . the success of advanced materials and the creation of the nanocentre in prague have led some in the czech media to speak of the czech republic as having the potential to become a major force in nanotechnology in europe .
huge growth ahead but perhaps all of this trumpeting should be taken with a pinch of salt .
" nanotech is the new oil industry , " said dean freeman , a nanotech industry analyst with gartner research .
" there are many opportunities in the nanotech space for research .
the key is making a product that can get traction and be sold commercially .
from a research perspective i have not seen a great deal on nanotech from the czech republic .
-lsb- but that -rsb- could have more to do with how publicized any research is . "
however he added their success in accessing eu funds for nanotech projects – and the czech government 's commitment – certainly placed the czechs in a strong position to make a name for themselves on the global nanotech market .

voter turnout in athens was 33 percent , with a national average of 50 percent .
the results were an encouraging sign for greek prime minister george papandreou , after drastic wage and pension cuts and consumer tax increases prompted widespread protest in recent months .

the socialists won mayoral races in the capital athens as well as in greece 's second-largest city , thessaloniki , for the first time in over two decades .
voter turnout in athens was 33 percent , with a national average of 50 percent .
the results were an encouraging sign for greek prime minister george papandreou , after drastic wage and pension cuts and consumer tax increases prompted widespread protest in recent months .
" today the nation has indicated to us that we should proceed with our course , " papandreou said .
the poll results come ahead of a monday visit by officials from the european union and the international monetary fund to assess greece 's implementation of a bailout worth 110 billion euros -lrb- $ 150 billion -rrb- .
the eu 's statistics agency , eurostat , said in statement that greece 's 2009 budget deficit reached 15.4 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , almost two percent higher than projected .
analysts say the increase makes it unlikely that greece will reach its target of lowering the deficit to 8.1 percent of gdp by the end of the year .

in order to secure its national interests , moscow must manage a tricky balancing act between the west and the east . flush with cash from booming oil and gas exports , moscow unilaterally pursued russian national interests during vladimir putin 's tenure as president .
in the process , russia 's relationship with the west deteriorated to a historic low point . but then the economic crisis hit .
energy prices collapsed and russia 's rapid growth ground to a halt . after dmitry medvedev assumed the presidency in 2008 , moscow sought to jumpstart the slumping russian economy through so-called " modernization alliances " with the us and the eu .
yet at the same time , the oil-rich country began consolidating its " strategic partnership " with an oil-hungry china .
russia wanted to pursue its national interests in economic modernization and growth and knew that it needed both the west and china in these endeavors . love-hate relationship moscow 's relationship with the west has a long history of ambivalence .
culturally tied to europe , yet also influenced by asia , russia sits awkwardly between two worlds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's relationship with the west deteriorated as nato expanded eastward " the russians do see themselves more as a part of western civilization , " andrew kuchins , director of the russia and eurasia program at the center for strategic and international studies , told deutsche welle .
" they are eurasian , a power bordering europe as well as the pacific ocean .
but the bulk of the population is in european russia . " with the collapse of the soviet union , moscow seemed to have taken a step toward definitively joining the west .
president boris yeltsin implemented a series of radical reforms designed to put russia 's political and economic system in synch with its former cold war enemies . but as the european union and nato rapidly expanded into the former eastern bloc , moscow felt marginalized in its own " near abroad . "
then vladimir putin came to power .
buoyed by surging oil and gas exports , putin sought to stabilize russia domestically and reassert its influence in the former soviet states . the developments put the west and russia on a collision course .
in the summer of 2008 , they finally collided in the south caucasus .
russia fought a lightening-quick war against georgia , a former soviet republic that has increasingly looked westward .
in response to the conflict , nato severed cooperation with moscow .
but according to dmitri trenin , director of the carnegie moscow center , the west also played a key role in the dispute . " it takes everyone who 's involved to organize a better framework for relations , " trenin told deutsche welle .
" the western policy that included some countries into western institutions and left others such as russia , but also georgia and ukraine beyond the perimeter was very risky .
that policy is responsible for the russian-georgian war . " pushing the reset button power changed hands in moscow and washington in quick succession , bringing new leaders and a new outlook on russia 's relationship with the west .
us president barack obama and medvedev saw an opportunity to focus on cooperation instead of confrontation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and russia are now cooperating on common interests " president medvedev knows that the modernization of the economy and russian society can not be executed without cooperation with the west , " alexander rahr , director of the russia and eurasia program at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle . he said us president obama did n't want to pursue a policy of containment against russia . " he needs russia in the fight against international terrorism in afghanistan and iraq , and he needs russian support to stop iran 's nuclear weapons program , " rahr said . as russian and western interests align , both sides have hinted at moving beyond a quid-pro-quo relationship and bringing moscow into a deeper security partnership .
in the lead up to the nato summit later this month in lisbon , secretary general anders fogh rasmussen has pushed the idea of including russia in a missile defense shield that would stretch from vancouver to vladivostok . " what russia and other countries in europe and north america need to work toward is a euro-atlantic security community , " trenin said .
" we 're not talking about alliances .
we 're not talking about russia joining nato .
we 're not talking about simply more of the same upgrades of russia 's relations with nato .
what we should be working toward is a state of play in the euro-atlantic area where war would not be an instrument of policy . " eastern horizon but a euro-atlantic security community is not the only game in town .
russia is hedging its bets and forging a strategic partnership with china , as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's economic growth is both an opportunity and a concern for russia " china is second only to the us in terms of countries that weigh in on the russian strategic mind , " trenin said .
" it is immensely important . " china 's meteoric growth has made it the world 's largest energy consumer .
russia in turn is one of the world 's largest energy producers and is therefore well-positioned to fuel china 's economy . the first pipeline connecting russian oil fields and chinese refineries was completed last september .
it delivers oil from eastern siberia to northeastern china .
moscow and beijing are also working together within the shanghai cooperation organization , a loose security partnership designed to combat threats such as separatism , terrorism and extremism . on the international stage , russia and china share a similar worldview .
they both prioritize national sovereignty and the pursuit of national interests over liberal values , such as democracy and human rights .
yet like russia 's relationship with the west , its growing ties with china face challenges . " there has always been this certain degree of unease despite all the happy talk and positive rhetoric of russia and china , " kuchins said .
china 's rapid growth made the russians nervous , he said . " the impact of the -lrb- economic -rrb- crisis was sort of an acceleration of that trend , " kuchins said .
" it leads them to question just how much the growth of chinese power is good for russian interests . " independence or isolation ? as russia simultaneously pursues partnerships with the west and china , it also wants to maintain its status as an independent power .
moscow has constructed a network of institutions to keep the former soviet states within its sphere of influence .
the commonwealth of independent states , the collective security treaty organization and the eurasian economic community could act as pillars of eurasian integration . " the default russian position is that they would like to be this great superpower , " kuchins said .
" there would be the west , russia and china .
but the reality suggests that 's not looking to be the case .
that forces them to possibly make some harder decisions about just how far they want to push this so-called independent foreign policy . " russia needs the west for economic modernization , and china presents a lucrative energy market .
yet moving too far too fast in either direction , or striking out on an independent path , could lead to moscow 's isolation . as a eurasian power , russia has little choice but to strike a balance in its relations with the east and the west . " we have to prepare ourselves for the reality that russia would like to integrate one leg in europe and the other in asia , " rahr said .
" if not integration , then it would like to at least work closely with the states of europe and asia . " author : spencer kimball editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 15.11.2010 leverkusen midfielder rolfes hopes injury nightmare is finally over großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolfes is a big physical player with a good passing eye a succession of knee injuries meant simon rolfes missed the 2010 world cup - a nearly worst-case scenario for any footballer .
he talked to deutsche welle about the ups and downs of trying to come back . before there was sami khedira , there was simon rolfes .
the 28-year-old midfielder was originally the one tipped to take over the stopper role from ageing veteran michael ballack .
but a meniscus injury in july 2009 ultimately stopped rolfes in his tracks just as he was reaching the peak of his career .
rolfes played through pain that fall .
after all , his club , bayer leverkusen , was topping the table , and he had established himself as a regular in the german national side .
but by october he had developed articular cartilage damage and had no option but to have an operation .
the problems did n't go away , and he was forced to go under the knife again in january and acknowledge that his dream of competing in south africa was over .
“ we were on a sensational run with leverkusen and topping the table at the winter break , ” rolfes told deutsche welle .
“ my plan was to come back in the second half of the season and be a full part of the team , since the games i had played that season had been the best of my career .
so , of course , the weeks following the january operation were really hard .
i realized i was n't going to play any role at all either in the bundesliga season or the world cup . ”
a slow but steady developer , rolfes had become an international caliber midfielder .
now he was forced to watch khedira take on a role in the german squad that he himself would have probably occupied , had he not been hurt .
khedira performed well in south africa and landed a deal with real madrid .
meanwhile , rolfes was just trying to regain his basic fitness .
daily drudgery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolfes had been getting regular starts for germany in one respect , rolfes has been lucky .
the injuries he suffered have ended many a footballer 's career .
but rehab work , to hear him describe it , is a total slog , and it is difficult for a top athlete to acknowledge that , through no fault of one 's own , one is not at the level one was just a few months before .
“ it takes time to accept and start looking forward again , ” rolfes said .
“ after the operation i was on crutches for eight weeks … and it hardly a lot of fun to lie around at home , exercising your leg or knee with a machine for six hours a day and watching your muscles virtually disappear . ”
rolfes also said that when he was able to work out with a football again , it was hard at first to commit to challenges .
overcoming fear , he said , came gradually as he got used to playing scrimmages in training sessions .
“ it 's such a long process , and in the beginning you ca n't imagine yourself being on the pitch again , ” rolfes remembered .
“ but step for step , they bring you along , and then at some point it 's over .
you get your confidence back in practice . ”
practice , in this case , does n't make perfect .
it gives a player the chance to regain what he 's lost .
positive outlook bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coming back from a knee injury takes lots of hard , boring work rolfes made his bundesliga comeback in late september , and so far , he 's been pretty good .
last month , he scored a pair of goals to help leverkusen beat wolfsburg , even though he only came on as a late substitute .
and perhaps more encouragingly , he 's played for a full 90 minutes in his last two games .
he also provided the assist for leverkusen 's lone goal in their win agaist st. pauli on the weekend , which took the team up to second in the bundesliga standings .
but will he ever be able to recapture the status he once had with germany head coach joachim loew ?
competition for spots in the midfield is fierce , with not even nominal team captain michael ballack being assured of making the squad .
rolfes draws hope from the very vagaries of football that put him out of commission for much of 2009 and 2010 .
“ a year ago , no one would have thought that bastian schweinsteiger and sami khedira would be the central midfielders at the world cup , ” rolfes said .
“ and likewise , no one knows what 's going to happen in two or three years ' time .
there 's always the possibility of injuries and other circumstances .
so you should n't concentrate on whether it 's difficult or not . ”
and rolfes does n't need to look far to find an example of hope .
his teammate at leverkusen , striker patrick helmes , was also knocked out of germany 's world cup squad by an injury , but has gotten a call-up to play in the nationalelf 's friendly against sweden this coming wednesday .
so even though rolfes has dropped off the radar screen of many casual germany fans , it would n't be all that surprising to find him on the plane when yogi and co. travel to euro 2012 in poland and ukraine , or even the 2014 world cup in brazil .
simon rolfes was interviewed by kamilla jarzina for dw-tv 's bundesliga kick off program .

meanwhile , others wondered how a problem of this magnitude could even happen . the death toll from haiti 's cholera epidemic has reached more than 900 and the disease is present in six of the 10 provinces of the earthquake-battered caribbean country , the health ministry said over the weekend .
more than 15,000 people have been infected since the epidemic 's outbreak in late october , the health ministry said sunday , and the epidemic showed no sign of abating .
there were 120 new deaths since friday 's toll .
according to the ministry on monday , 917 people have died of the disease so far .
worse expected to come according to un estimates , up to 200,000 people could fall ill with cholera .
the world body on friday applied for another $ 163 million -lrb- 120 million euros -rrb- in donor aid .
the disease broke out in the northern artibonite region , where it continues to be most concentrated .
it is contracted through contaminated water and causes severe diarrhea and vomiting .
bildunterschrift : the fear is growing that the epidemic will spread to refugee camps authorities and international aid agencies were struggling to contain the latest crisis afflicting the impoverished island nation .
efforts are centering on preventing the disease from spreading in crowded city slums and tent camps that house over 1.3 million homeless people who survived the cataclysmic earthquake , nearly a year ago .
but the facts of the epidemic raise the question of how such a preventable disease could break out in a country that has been flooded with hundreds of millions of euros in foreign assistance since the earthquake .
resource coordination is problem " huge sums in aid money have gone there , but the people in the north seem to have been left to their own devices , " sven stockrahm , a journalist with german newspaper die zeit who wrote about the earthquake , told deutsche welle .
stockrahm stressed that his critical remarks were not aimed at humanitarian aid workers , who by all accounts are doing vital work under very trying circumstances .
the key question is whether a better coordination of the resources in place could have prevented cholera from occurring in the first place .
bildunterschrift : aid workers are working ahrd to meet the needs of growing patient numbers but clear answers are difficult to come by where haiti is concerned .
the causes of cholera , lack of clean drinking water and poor sanitation are well-known , but at present , no one is sure exactly how the disease even broke out in artibonite .
poor sanitation , even pre-earthquake what is certain is that conditions in haiti even before the earthquake were far from adequate .
a study by the world health organization and unicef found that open defecation was prevalent among just under half of rural haitians and that 3.7 million of haiti 's total population of 9 million had no reliable source of clean drinking water .
moreover , from 1990 to 2008 , conditions deteriorated .
a similar study by the united nations in 2009 determined that 42 percent of haitians were not using an " improved water source . "
haiti ranks dead last among countries in south america and the caribbean in all major water and hygiene categories .
" cholera is a sickness of poverty that is common in refugee camps where there ’ s not enough drinking water , " ernst diekmann - a doctor with germany 's society for technical cooperation , or gtz - told deutsche welle .
" haiti was already an underprivileged country , and the situation was exacerbated by the natural catastrophe . "
problem exacerbated by refugees nonetheless , aid workers acknowledge that pre-existing deficiencies and the slow recovery process are two parts of the same overall problem that encouraged the cholera outbreak .
and the issue of earthquake refugees only exacerbates those problems .
bildunterschrift : as the disease spreads , burials are on the rise " the dramatic thing about haiti is that even before the earthquake the health infrastructure was fully inadequate , " said joost butenop , a medical adviser to the aid organization caritas .
" aid organizations have concentrated on the region specifically affected -lsb- by the earthquake -rsb- and have n't been following the refugees to any great extent . "
organizational challenges earlier this year , the humanitarian organization refugees international went even further , claiming that recovery efforts in haiti were not just sluggish , but " paralyzed . "
off the record , many people who work in the aid and assistance sector say that shortcomings in coordination often prevent help from getting where it 's needed - or problems from being effectively anticipated .
that task falls to the united nations and the haitian government , and representatives of the former have openly admitted that the situation in haiti tests their limits .
the will to help is there .
germany 's ministry for economic cooperation and development , for instance , says that most of the 51.4 million euros -lrb- $ 72 million -rrb- it was allocated for haiti has already been distributed or earmarked for future projects .
yet merely distinguishing between emergency needs and long-term developmental requirements , and figuring out which government ministry is responsible , can be a complicated process .
and coordinating the enormous number of private and public organizations trying to help in haiti represents an organizational task of the highest order .
at this point , no one can say definitively whether any particular authority should have foreseen the danger of cholera in haiti and taken precautionary steps to prevent it .
but the outbreak of the disease in a country that has been the focus of so much international assistance suggests that overall organization and coordination remain problems that hinder aid initiatives from having their maximum possible effect .

" everything is at stake - if the euro fails , europe will fail , " she told delegates at the christian democrats ' party convention , where she was reelected as head of her party .
" we need a new culture of stability in europe , " she added .
she even went so far as to criticize her predecessor , social democrat gerhard schroeder , for giving his consent for greece to join the eurozone , calling it " irresponsible " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's push for a crisis prevention mechanism are controversial harsh words on both sides the comments came as eu figures showed that greece 's deficit in 2009 rose to 15.4 percent of gdp , a big jump from the initial estimate of 13.6 percent .
greek prime minister george papandreou promptly hit back , insisting that measures proposed by germany to avoid future crises were pushing up interest rates paid by highly indebted countries like greece for their bonds .
" this could create a self-fulfilling prophecy , " papandreou said during a visit in paris .
" this could break backs .
this could force some economies into bankruptcy , " he added .
he was referring to plans by germany , supported by france , to make bondholders pay at least some of the costs in case of a default .
germany is also reluctant to extend the eurozone 's bailout package beyond 2013 .
politicians may balk at merkel 's frank words , but some analysts believe tough talk is long-overdue .
" involving investors in the costs of defaults is a good idea , " eugen keller , head of financial markets research at metzler bank told deutsche welle .
" fighting fire with fire , i.e. bailing out mortgage companies like fannie mae or freddie mac or companies like gm , as happened in the us , and in europe as well , is not a long-term solution , " he said .
keller points out that the credit bubble has built up over the years , with the discrepancies between loans issued and actual economic growth widening over several decades , especially in the us , but also in europe .
bildunterschrift : exports are the driving force behind germany 's economic motor swings and roundabouts while germany benefits enormously from the single currency , as 40 percent of its exports go to other eurozone members , and having one currency eliminates fluctuations in exchange rates , the risks of having the euro were indeed underestimated , according to keller .
" germany can afford to pay for other countries as part of the bailout package for greece for example , but at the end of the day , the differences between say germany and greece or italy in efficiency , for example when it comes to managing wage costs , are extreme , " keller told deutsche welle .
" our own stress tests as well as those of ratings agencies in 2008 , for example , have shown that the former greek currency , the drachme , would have had to be valued at 30 to 40 percent less in 2008 than at the time greece joined the eurozone . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 15.11.2010 leverkusen midfielder rolfes hopes injury nightmare is finally over großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolfes is a big physical player with a good passing eye a succession of knee injuries meant simon rolfes missed the 2010 world cup - a nearly worst-case scenario for any footballer .
he talked to deutsche welle about the ups and downs of trying to come back . before there was sami khedira , there was simon rolfes .
the 28-year-old midfielder was originally the one tipped to take over the stopper role from ageing veteran michael ballack .
but a meniscus injury in july 2009 ultimately stopped rolfes in his tracks just as he was reaching the peak of his career .
rolfes played through pain that fall .
after all , his club , bayer leverkusen , was topping the table , and he had established himself as a regular in the german national side .
but by october he had developed articular cartilage damage and had no option but to have an operation .
the problems did n't go away , and he was forced to go under the knife again in january and acknowledge that his dream of competing in south africa was over .
“ we were on a sensational run with leverkusen and topping the table at the winter break , ” rolfes told deutsche welle .
“ my plan was to come back in the second half of the season and be a full part of the team , since the games i had played that season had been the best of my career .
so , of course , the weeks following the january operation were really hard .
i realized i was n't going to play any role at all either in the bundesliga season or the world cup . ”
a slow but steady developer , rolfes had become an international caliber midfielder .
now he was forced to watch khedira take on a role in the german squad that he himself would have probably occupied , had he not been hurt .
khedira performed well in south africa and landed a deal with real madrid .
meanwhile , rolfes was just trying to regain his basic fitness .
daily drudgery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolfes had been getting regular starts for germany in one respect , rolfes has been lucky .
the injuries he suffered have ended many a footballer 's career .
but rehab work , to hear him describe it , is a total slog , and it is difficult for a top athlete to acknowledge that , through no fault of one 's own , one is not at the level one was just a few months before .
“ it takes time to accept and start looking forward again , ” rolfes said .
“ after the operation i was on crutches for eight weeks … and it hardly a lot of fun to lie around at home , exercising your leg or knee with a machine for six hours a day and watching your muscles virtually disappear . ”
rolfes also said that when he was able to work out with a football again , it was hard at first to commit to challenges .
overcoming fear , he said , came gradually as he got used to playing scrimmages in training sessions .
“ it 's such a long process , and in the beginning you ca n't imagine yourself being on the pitch again , ” rolfes remembered .
“ but step for step , they bring you along , and then at some point it 's over .
you get your confidence back in practice . ”
practice , in this case , does n't make perfect .
it gives a player the chance to regain what he 's lost .
positive outlook bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coming back from a knee injury takes lots of hard , boring work rolfes made his bundesliga comeback in late september , and so far , he 's been pretty good .
last month , he scored a pair of goals to help leverkusen beat wolfsburg , even though he only came on as a late substitute .
and perhaps more encouragingly , he 's played for a full 90 minutes in his last two games .
he also provided the assist for leverkusen 's lone goal in their win agaist st. pauli on the weekend , which took the team up to second in the bundesliga standings .
but will he ever be able to recapture the status he once had with germany head coach joachim loew ?
competition for spots in the midfield is fierce , with not even nominal team captain michael ballack being assured of making the squad .
rolfes draws hope from the very vagaries of football that put him out of commission for much of 2009 and 2010 .
“ a year ago , no one would have thought that bastian schweinsteiger and sami khedira would be the central midfielders at the world cup , ” rolfes said .
“ and likewise , no one knows what 's going to happen in two or three years ' time .
there 's always the possibility of injuries and other circumstances .
so you should n't concentrate on whether it 's difficult or not . ”
and rolfes does n't need to look far to find an example of hope .
his teammate at leverkusen , striker patrick helmes , was also knocked out of germany 's world cup squad by an injury , but has gotten a call-up to play in the nationalelf 's friendly against sweden this coming wednesday .
so even though rolfes has dropped off the radar screen of many casual germany fans , it would n't be all that surprising to find him on the plane when yogi and co. travel to euro 2012 in poland and ukraine , or even the 2014 world cup in brazil .
simon rolfes was interviewed by kamilla jarzina for dw-tv 's bundesliga kick off program .

the country is still refusing but so did greece before it bowed to pressure . speculation is rife about ireland 's course of action , as the country 's borrowing costs last week shot to record highs on concerns of a deficit set to hit 32 percent of gross domestic product this year .
monday kicked off with a report in the irish independent newspaper claiming that at a meeting of eurozone finance ministers this week , ireland plans to ask for money from the european union 's emergency fund to rescue its banks .
prompt denial an irish minister promptly fired off a denial about the country being in direct discussions about a bailout package from the european union .
while acknowledging that ireland is in " continuous talks " with the eu about its growing debt , dick roche , junior minister for european affairs , told newstalk radio that it is " frankly wrong and grossly irresponsible that this story is being said and that a frenzy is being created out there . "
the opposition claimed europe had already started moves to rescue the country , but the irish government denied it would need a bailout .
" ireland has made no application for external support , " a finance ministry spokesman said .
" ongoing contacts continue at official level with international colleagues in light of current market conditions . "
the rumor mill is almost certain to continue with every new day of uncertainty confronting irish banks .
at the end of last month , they owed 130 billion euros -lrb- $ 177 billion -rrb- of outstanding european central bank loans , up from 119 billion euros a month earlier .
numbers being floated around as part of a bailout deal range between 50 and 77 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment in ireland has soared to 13.2 percent the eu is reported to be keen for ireland to accept aid to avert a greek-style scenario in which budget problems in one country plunge the entire eurozone into crisis .
on monday , european central bank council member miguel angel fernandez ordonez prodded ireland to make a " final decision " on its fiscal crisis in a move to calm markets .
" the situation in the markets in recent weeks has been very negative due in some way to the lack of a final decision by ireland , " he told reporters in madrid .
" it 's not me who should take a decision about ireland ; it 's ireland that should take the right decision at the right moment . "
but the clock is ticking .
" i think ireland can hold out another three to four months maximum , and it should , hoping that some positive surprise on growth might calm the markets , " unicredit group chief economist marco annunziata told deutsche welle .
" but investors will remain nervous until the question is settled of whether or not eurozone sovereign debts might be restructured . "
stability program on track another european expert , who asked not to be identified , said the european finance ministers could reach a decision as early as this week to funnel funds to irish banks .
" these funds , which would help stabilize the banks , would be seen as a limited intervention , " the expert said .
there is no question about ireland 's sovereign debt , the expert added : the irish government has no immediate need for cash , being fully funded until mid-2011 , and its stability program is on track bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish banks owe billions to the european central bank germany has also pressed for ireland to accept aid , insiders say .
allaying investor concerns about irish finances would help advance chancellor angela merkel 's plan to require investors to help pay for future rescues .
european leaders , however , remain divided on merkel 's proposal , as they do on whether the ecb should keep buying bonds of debt-laden countries .
ireland 's debt problems stem largely from the country 's popped real estate bubble , when its local banks lent money too freely for construction projects .
on top of that was the irish government 's decision to provide a blanket guarantee to all bank creditors .
as a result , the country has experienced the worst recession of any major economy .
it has amassed debt of more than 100 billion euros and is struggling with an unemployment rate of 13.2 percent .
tough fiscal conditions a rescue plan would be deeply unpopular with irish voters , who value national independence and the low-tax regime that lured in foreign investment from u.s. and other non-european companies , fueling high growth rates over the past 20 years .
indeed , an eu bailout , with tough fiscal conditions attached , would be humiliating for a country once celebrated for its rags-to-riches transformation .
not unsurprisingly , critics of ireland 's action plan – or lack thereof – are wary of the country 's every move .
karel lannoo , chief executive officer of the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- in brussels , says the country should have acted long ago to steer clear of the financial challenges it now faces .
" ireland should never have given blanket coverage to banks in the first place , " lannoo told deutsche welle .
" and it should have let some of the banks fail . "
lannoo now questions the repercussions for europe .
" how many more of these financial disasters can we have ? " he asked .

in order to secure its national interests , moscow must manage a tricky balancing act between the west and the east . flush with cash from booming oil and gas exports , moscow unilaterally pursued russian national interests during vladimir putin 's tenure as president .
in the process , russia 's relationship with the west deteriorated to a historic low point . but then the economic crisis hit .
energy prices collapsed and russia 's rapid growth ground to a halt . after dmitry medvedev assumed the presidency in 2008 , moscow sought to jumpstart the slumping russian economy through so-called " modernization alliances " with the us and the eu .
yet at the same time , the oil-rich country began consolidating its " strategic partnership " with an oil-hungry china .
russia wanted to pursue its national interests in economic modernization and growth and knew that it needed both the west and china in these endeavors . love-hate relationship moscow 's relationship with the west has a long history of ambivalence .
culturally tied to europe , yet also influenced by asia , russia sits awkwardly between two worlds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's relationship with the west deteriorated as nato expanded eastward " the russians do see themselves more as a part of western civilization , " andrew kuchins , director of the russia and eurasia program at the center for strategic and international studies , told deutsche welle .
" they are eurasian , a power bordering europe as well as the pacific ocean .
but the bulk of the population is in european russia . " with the collapse of the soviet union , moscow seemed to have taken a step toward definitively joining the west .
president boris yeltsin implemented a series of radical reforms designed to put russia 's political and economic system in synch with its former cold war enemies . but as the european union and nato rapidly expanded into the former eastern bloc , moscow felt marginalized in its own " near abroad . "
then vladimir putin came to power .
buoyed by surging oil and gas exports , putin sought to stabilize russia domestically and reassert its influence in the former soviet states . the developments put the west and russia on a collision course .
in the summer of 2008 , they finally collided in the south caucasus .
russia fought a lightening-quick war against georgia , a former soviet republic that has increasingly looked westward .
in response to the conflict , nato severed cooperation with moscow .
but according to dmitri trenin , director of the carnegie moscow center , the west also played a key role in the dispute . " it takes everyone who 's involved to organize a better framework for relations , " trenin told deutsche welle .
" the western policy that included some countries into western institutions and left others such as russia , but also georgia and ukraine beyond the perimeter was very risky .
that policy is responsible for the russian-georgian war . " pushing the reset button power changed hands in moscow and washington in quick succession , bringing new leaders and a new outlook on russia 's relationship with the west .
us president barack obama and medvedev saw an opportunity to focus on cooperation instead of confrontation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and russia are now cooperating on common interests " president medvedev knows that the modernization of the economy and russian society can not be executed without cooperation with the west , " alexander rahr , director of the russia and eurasia program at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle . he said us president obama did n't want to pursue a policy of containment against russia . " he needs russia in the fight against international terrorism in afghanistan and iraq , and he needs russian support to stop iran 's nuclear weapons program , " rahr said . as russian and western interests align , both sides have hinted at moving beyond a quid-pro-quo relationship and bringing moscow into a deeper security partnership .
in the lead up to the nato summit later this month in lisbon , secretary general anders fogh rasmussen has pushed the idea of including russia in a missile defense shield that would stretch from vancouver to vladivostok . " what russia and other countries in europe and north america need to work toward is a euro-atlantic security community , " trenin said .
" we 're not talking about alliances .
we 're not talking about russia joining nato .
we 're not talking about simply more of the same upgrades of russia 's relations with nato .
what we should be working toward is a state of play in the euro-atlantic area where war would not be an instrument of policy . " eastern horizon but a euro-atlantic security community is not the only game in town .
russia is hedging its bets and forging a strategic partnership with china , as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's economic growth is both an opportunity and a concern for russia " china is second only to the us in terms of countries that weigh in on the russian strategic mind , " trenin said .
" it is immensely important . " china 's meteoric growth has made it the world 's largest energy consumer .
russia in turn is one of the world 's largest energy producers and is therefore well-positioned to fuel china 's economy . the first pipeline connecting russian oil fields and chinese refineries was completed last september .
it delivers oil from eastern siberia to northeastern china .
moscow and beijing are also working together within the shanghai cooperation organization , a loose security partnership designed to combat threats such as separatism , terrorism and extremism . on the international stage , russia and china share a similar worldview .
they both prioritize national sovereignty and the pursuit of national interests over liberal values , such as democracy and human rights .
yet like russia 's relationship with the west , its growing ties with china face challenges . " there has always been this certain degree of unease despite all the happy talk and positive rhetoric of russia and china , " kuchins said .
china 's rapid growth made the russians nervous , he said . " the impact of the -lrb- economic -rrb- crisis was sort of an acceleration of that trend , " kuchins said .
" it leads them to question just how much the growth of chinese power is good for russian interests . " independence or isolation ? as russia simultaneously pursues partnerships with the west and china , it also wants to maintain its status as an independent power .
moscow has constructed a network of institutions to keep the former soviet states within its sphere of influence .
the commonwealth of independent states , the collective security treaty organization and the eurasian economic community could act as pillars of eurasian integration . " the default russian position is that they would like to be this great superpower , " kuchins said .
" there would be the west , russia and china .
but the reality suggests that 's not looking to be the case .
that forces them to possibly make some harder decisions about just how far they want to push this so-called independent foreign policy . " russia needs the west for economic modernization , and china presents a lucrative energy market .
yet moving too far too fast in either direction , or striking out on an independent path , could lead to moscow 's isolation . as a eurasian power , russia has little choice but to strike a balance in its relations with the east and the west . " we have to prepare ourselves for the reality that russia would like to integrate one leg in europe and the other in asia , " rahr said .
" if not integration , then it would like to at least work closely with the states of europe and asia . " author : spencer kimball editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he talked to deutsche welle about the ups and downs of trying to come back . before there was sami khedira , there was simon rolfes .
the 28-year-old midfielder was originally the one tipped to take over the stopper role from ageing veteran michael ballack .
but a meniscus injury in july 2009 ultimately stopped rolfes in his tracks just as he was reaching the peak of his career .
rolfes played through pain that fall .
after all , his club , bayer leverkusen , was topping the table , and he had established himself as a regular in the german national side .
but by october he had developed articular cartilage damage and had no option but to have an operation .
the problems did n't go away , and he was forced to go under the knife again in january and acknowledge that his dream of competing in south africa was over .
“ we were on a sensational run with leverkusen and topping the table at the winter break , ” rolfes told deutsche welle .
“ my plan was to come back in the second half of the season and be a full part of the team , since the games i had played that season had been the best of my career .
so , of course , the weeks following the january operation were really hard .
i realized i was n't going to play any role at all either in the bundesliga season or the world cup . ”
a slow but steady developer , rolfes had become an international caliber midfielder .
now he was forced to watch khedira take on a role in the german squad that he himself would have probably occupied , had he not been hurt .
khedira performed well in south africa and landed a deal with real madrid .
meanwhile , rolfes was just trying to regain his basic fitness .

“ it takes time to accept and start looking forward again , ” rolfes said .
“ after the operation i was on crutches for eight weeks … and it hardly a lot of fun to lie around at home , exercising your leg or knee with a machine for six hours a day and watching your muscles virtually disappear . ”
rolfes also said that when he was able to work out with a football again , it was hard at first to commit to challenges .
overcoming fear , he said , came gradually as he got used to playing scrimmages in training sessions .
“ it 's such a long process , and in the beginning you ca n't imagine yourself being on the pitch again , ” rolfes remembered .
“ but step for step , they bring you along , and then at some point it 's over .

competition for spots in the midfield is fierce , with not even nominal team captain michael ballack being assured of making the squad .
rolfes draws hope from the very vagaries of football that put him out of commission for much of 2009 and 2010 .
“ a year ago , no one would have thought that bastian schweinsteiger and sami khedira would be the central midfielders at the world cup , ” rolfes said .
“ and likewise , no one knows what 's going to happen in two or three years ' time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 15.11.2010 ireland is still sidestepping what experts say is inevitable : a bailout großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plenty of irish voters are n't happy these days will ireland accept a bailout and help reverse a bond sell-off among the eurozone 's deficit-laden nations ?
the country is still refusing but so did greece before it bowed to pressure . speculation is rife about ireland 's course of action , as the country 's borrowing costs last week shot to record highs on concerns of a deficit set to hit 32 percent of gross domestic product this year .
monday kicked off with a report in the irish independent newspaper claiming that at a meeting of eurozone finance ministers this week , ireland plans to ask for money from the european union 's emergency fund to rescue its banks .
prompt denial an irish minister promptly fired off a denial about the country being in direct discussions about a bailout package from the european union .
while acknowledging that ireland is in " continuous talks " with the eu about its growing debt , dick roche , junior minister for european affairs , told newstalk radio that it is " frankly wrong and grossly irresponsible that this story is being said and that a frenzy is being created out there . "
the opposition claimed europe had already started moves to rescue the country , but the irish government denied it would need a bailout .
" ireland has made no application for external support , " a finance ministry spokesman said .
" ongoing contacts continue at official level with international colleagues in light of current market conditions . "
the rumor mill is almost certain to continue with every new day of uncertainty confronting irish banks .
at the end of last month , they owed 130 billion euros -lrb- $ 177 billion -rrb- of outstanding european central bank loans , up from 119 billion euros a month earlier .
numbers being floated around as part of a bailout deal range between 50 and 77 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment in ireland has soared to 13.2 percent the eu is reported to be keen for ireland to accept aid to avert a greek-style scenario in which budget problems in one country plunge the entire eurozone into crisis .
on monday , european central bank council member miguel angel fernandez ordonez prodded ireland to make a " final decision " on its fiscal crisis in a move to calm markets .
" the situation in the markets in recent weeks has been very negative due in some way to the lack of a final decision by ireland , " he told reporters in madrid .
" it 's not me who should take a decision about ireland ; it 's ireland that should take the right decision at the right moment . "
but the clock is ticking .
" i think ireland can hold out another three to four months maximum , and it should , hoping that some positive surprise on growth might calm the markets , " unicredit group chief economist marco annunziata told deutsche welle .
" but investors will remain nervous until the question is settled of whether or not eurozone sovereign debts might be restructured . "
stability program on track another european expert , who asked not to be identified , said the european finance ministers could reach a decision as early as this week to funnel funds to irish banks .
" these funds , which would help stabilize the banks , would be seen as a limited intervention , " the expert said .
there is no question about ireland 's sovereign debt , the expert added : the irish government has no immediate need for cash , being fully funded until mid-2011 , and its stability program is on track bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish banks owe billions to the european central bank germany has also pressed for ireland to accept aid , insiders say .
allaying investor concerns about irish finances would help advance chancellor angela merkel 's plan to require investors to help pay for future rescues .
european leaders , however , remain divided on merkel 's proposal , as they do on whether the ecb should keep buying bonds of debt-laden countries .
ireland 's debt problems stem largely from the country 's popped real estate bubble , when its local banks lent money too freely for construction projects .
on top of that was the irish government 's decision to provide a blanket guarantee to all bank creditors .
as a result , the country has experienced the worst recession of any major economy .
it has amassed debt of more than 100 billion euros and is struggling with an unemployment rate of 13.2 percent .
tough fiscal conditions a rescue plan would be deeply unpopular with irish voters , who value national independence and the low-tax regime that lured in foreign investment from u.s. and other non-european companies , fueling high growth rates over the past 20 years .
indeed , an eu bailout , with tough fiscal conditions attached , would be humiliating for a country once celebrated for its rags-to-riches transformation .
not unsurprisingly , critics of ireland 's action plan – or lack thereof – are wary of the country 's every move .
karel lannoo , chief executive officer of the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- in brussels , says the country should have acted long ago to steer clear of the financial challenges it now faces .
" ireland should never have given blanket coverage to banks in the first place , " lannoo told deutsche welle .
" and it should have let some of the banks fail . "
lannoo now questions the repercussions for europe .
" how many more of these financial disasters can we have ? " he asked .

meanwhile , others wondered how a problem of this magnitude could even happen . the death toll from haiti 's cholera epidemic has reached more than 900 and the disease is present in six of the 10 provinces of the earthquake-battered caribbean country , the health ministry said over the weekend .
more than 15,000 people have been infected since the epidemic 's outbreak in late october , the health ministry said sunday , and the epidemic showed no sign of abating .
there were 120 new deaths since friday 's toll .
according to the ministry on monday , 917 people have died of the disease so far .
worse expected to come according to un estimates , up to 200,000 people could fall ill with cholera .
the world body on friday applied for another $ 163 million -lrb- 120 million euros -rrb- in donor aid .
the disease broke out in the northern artibonite region , where it continues to be most concentrated .
it is contracted through contaminated water and causes severe diarrhea and vomiting .
bildunterschrift : the fear is growing that the epidemic will spread to refugee camps authorities and international aid agencies were struggling to contain the latest crisis afflicting the impoverished island nation .
efforts are centering on preventing the disease from spreading in crowded city slums and tent camps that house over 1.3 million homeless people who survived the cataclysmic earthquake , nearly a year ago .
but the facts of the epidemic raise the question of how such a preventable disease could break out in a country that has been flooded with hundreds of millions of euros in foreign assistance since the earthquake .
resource coordination is problem " huge sums in aid money have gone there , but the people in the north seem to have been left to their own devices , " sven stockrahm , a journalist with german newspaper die zeit who wrote about the earthquake , told deutsche welle .
stockrahm stressed that his critical remarks were not aimed at humanitarian aid workers , who by all accounts are doing vital work under very trying circumstances .
the key question is whether a better coordination of the resources in place could have prevented cholera from occurring in the first place .
bildunterschrift : aid workers are working ahrd to meet the needs of growing patient numbers but clear answers are difficult to come by where haiti is concerned .
the causes of cholera , lack of clean drinking water and poor sanitation are well-known , but at present , no one is sure exactly how the disease even broke out in artibonite .
poor sanitation , even pre-earthquake what is certain is that conditions in haiti even before the earthquake were far from adequate .
a study by the world health organization and unicef found that open defecation was prevalent among just under half of rural haitians and that 3.7 million of haiti 's total population of 9 million had no reliable source of clean drinking water .
moreover , from 1990 to 2008 , conditions deteriorated .
a similar study by the united nations in 2009 determined that 42 percent of haitians were not using an " improved water source . "
haiti ranks dead last among countries in south america and the caribbean in all major water and hygiene categories .
" cholera is a sickness of poverty that is common in refugee camps where there ’ s not enough drinking water , " ernst diekmann - a doctor with germany 's society for technical cooperation , or gtz - told deutsche welle .
" haiti was already an underprivileged country , and the situation was exacerbated by the natural catastrophe . "
problem exacerbated by refugees nonetheless , aid workers acknowledge that pre-existing deficiencies and the slow recovery process are two parts of the same overall problem that encouraged the cholera outbreak .
and the issue of earthquake refugees only exacerbates those problems .
bildunterschrift : as the disease spreads , burials are on the rise " the dramatic thing about haiti is that even before the earthquake the health infrastructure was fully inadequate , " said joost butenop , a medical adviser to the aid organization caritas .
" aid organizations have concentrated on the region specifically affected -lsb- by the earthquake -rsb- and have n't been following the refugees to any great extent . "
organizational challenges earlier this year , the humanitarian organization refugees international went even further , claiming that recovery efforts in haiti were not just sluggish , but " paralyzed . "
off the record , many people who work in the aid and assistance sector say that shortcomings in coordination often prevent help from getting where it 's needed - or problems from being effectively anticipated .
that task falls to the united nations and the haitian government , and representatives of the former have openly admitted that the situation in haiti tests their limits .
the will to help is there .
germany 's ministry for economic cooperation and development , for instance , says that most of the 51.4 million euros -lrb- $ 72 million -rrb- it was allocated for haiti has already been distributed or earmarked for future projects .
yet merely distinguishing between emergency needs and long-term developmental requirements , and figuring out which government ministry is responsible , can be a complicated process .
and coordinating the enormous number of private and public organizations trying to help in haiti represents an organizational task of the highest order .
at this point , no one can say definitively whether any particular authority should have foreseen the danger of cholera in haiti and taken precautionary steps to prevent it .
but the outbreak of the disease in a country that has been the focus of so much international assistance suggests that overall organization and coordination remain problems that hinder aid initiatives from having their maximum possible effect .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 15.11.2010 greek pm : german proposals put squeeze on debt-laden countries großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is determined to prevent future debt crises as german chancellor angela merkel warns that europe must adopt strict rules to avoid potential future debt crises , greek prime minister george papandreou accused germany of encouraging sovereign bankruptcies . as greece learned on monday that its massive budget deficit was even bigger than expected in 2009 , german chancellor angela merkel has renewed calls for a pan-european crisis mechanism that would help prevent future debt crises and protect the euro single currency .
" everything is at stake - if the euro fails , europe will fail , " she told delegates at the christian democrats ' party convention , where she was reelected as head of her party .
" we need a new culture of stability in europe , " she added .
she even went so far as to criticize her predecessor , social democrat gerhard schroeder , for giving his consent for greece to join the eurozone , calling it " irresponsible " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's push for a crisis prevention mechanism are controversial harsh words on both sides the comments came as eu figures showed that greece 's deficit in 2009 rose to 15.4 percent of gdp , a big jump from the initial estimate of 13.6 percent .
greek prime minister george papandreou promptly hit back , insisting that measures proposed by germany to avoid future crises were pushing up interest rates paid by highly indebted countries like greece for their bonds .
" this could create a self-fulfilling prophecy , " papandreou said during a visit in paris .
" this could break backs .
this could force some economies into bankruptcy , " he added .
he was referring to plans by germany , supported by france , to make bondholders pay at least some of the costs in case of a default .
germany is also reluctant to extend the eurozone 's bailout package beyond 2013 .
politicians may balk at merkel 's frank words , but some analysts believe tough talk is long-overdue .
" involving investors in the costs of defaults is a good idea , " eugen keller , head of financial markets research at metzler bank told deutsche welle .
" fighting fire with fire , i.e. bailing out mortgage companies like fannie mae or freddie mac or companies like gm , as happened in the us , and in europe as well , is not a long-term solution , " he said .
keller points out that the credit bubble has built up over the years , with the discrepancies between loans issued and actual economic growth widening over several decades , especially in the us , but also in europe .
bildunterschrift : exports are the driving force behind germany 's economic motor swings and roundabouts while germany benefits enormously from the single currency , as 40 percent of its exports go to other eurozone members , and having one currency eliminates fluctuations in exchange rates , the risks of having the euro were indeed underestimated , according to keller .
" germany can afford to pay for other countries as part of the bailout package for greece for example , but at the end of the day , the differences between say germany and greece or italy in efficiency , for example when it comes to managing wage costs , are extreme , " keller told deutsche welle .
" our own stress tests as well as those of ratings agencies in 2008 , for example , have shown that the former greek currency , the drachme , would have had to be valued at 30 to 40 percent less in 2008 than at the time greece joined the eurozone . "

he talked to deutsche welle about the ups and downs of trying to come back . before there was sami khedira , there was simon rolfes .
the 28-year-old midfielder was originally the one tipped to take over the stopper role from ageing veteran michael ballack .
but a meniscus injury in july 2009 ultimately stopped rolfes in his tracks just as he was reaching the peak of his career .
rolfes played through pain that fall .
after all , his club , bayer leverkusen , was topping the table , and he had established himself as a regular in the german national side .
but by october he had developed articular cartilage damage and had no option but to have an operation .
the problems did n't go away , and he was forced to go under the knife again in january and acknowledge that his dream of competing in south africa was over .
“ we were on a sensational run with leverkusen and topping the table at the winter break , ” rolfes told deutsche welle .
“ my plan was to come back in the second half of the season and be a full part of the team , since the games i had played that season had been the best of my career .
so , of course , the weeks following the january operation were really hard .
i realized i was n't going to play any role at all either in the bundesliga season or the world cup . ”
a slow but steady developer , rolfes had become an international caliber midfielder .
now he was forced to watch khedira take on a role in the german squad that he himself would have probably occupied , had he not been hurt .
khedira performed well in south africa and landed a deal with real madrid .
meanwhile , rolfes was just trying to regain his basic fitness .
daily drudgery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolfes had been getting regular starts for germany in one respect , rolfes has been lucky .
the injuries he suffered have ended many a footballer 's career .
but rehab work , to hear him describe it , is a total slog , and it is difficult for a top athlete to acknowledge that , through no fault of one 's own , one is not at the level one was just a few months before .
“ it takes time to accept and start looking forward again , ” rolfes said .
“ after the operation i was on crutches for eight weeks … and it hardly a lot of fun to lie around at home , exercising your leg or knee with a machine for six hours a day and watching your muscles virtually disappear . ”
rolfes also said that when he was able to work out with a football again , it was hard at first to commit to challenges .
overcoming fear , he said , came gradually as he got used to playing scrimmages in training sessions .
“ it 's such a long process , and in the beginning you ca n't imagine yourself being on the pitch again , ” rolfes remembered .
“ but step for step , they bring you along , and then at some point it 's over .
you get your confidence back in practice . ”
practice , in this case , does n't make perfect .
it gives a player the chance to regain what he 's lost .
positive outlook bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coming back from a knee injury takes lots of hard , boring work rolfes made his bundesliga comeback in late september , and so far , he 's been pretty good .
last month , he scored a pair of goals to help leverkusen beat wolfsburg , even though he only came on as a late substitute .
and perhaps more encouragingly , he 's played for a full 90 minutes in his last two games .
he also provided the assist for leverkusen 's lone goal in their win agaist st. pauli on the weekend , which took the team up to second in the bundesliga standings .
but will he ever be able to recapture the status he once had with germany head coach joachim loew ?
competition for spots in the midfield is fierce , with not even nominal team captain michael ballack being assured of making the squad .
rolfes draws hope from the very vagaries of football that put him out of commission for much of 2009 and 2010 .
“ a year ago , no one would have thought that bastian schweinsteiger and sami khedira would be the central midfielders at the world cup , ” rolfes said .
“ and likewise , no one knows what 's going to happen in two or three years ' time .
there 's always the possibility of injuries and other circumstances .
so you should n't concentrate on whether it 's difficult or not . ”
and rolfes does n't need to look far to find an example of hope .
his teammate at leverkusen , striker patrick helmes , was also knocked out of germany 's world cup squad by an injury , but has gotten a call-up to play in the nationalelf 's friendly against sweden this coming wednesday .
so even though rolfes has dropped off the radar screen of many casual germany fans , it would n't be all that surprising to find him on the plane when yogi and co. travel to euro 2012 in poland and ukraine , or even the 2014 world cup in brazil .

rolfes played through pain that fall .
after all , his club , bayer leverkusen , was topping the table , and he had established himself as a regular in the german national side .
but by october he had developed articular cartilage damage and had no option but to have an operation .
the problems did n't go away , and he was forced to go under the knife again in january and acknowledge that his dream of competing in south africa was over .
“ we were on a sensational run with leverkusen and topping the table at the winter break , ” rolfes told deutsche welle .
“ my plan was to come back in the second half of the season and be a full part of the team , since the games i had played that season had been the best of my career .
so , of course , the weeks following the january operation were really hard .
i realized i was n't going to play any role at all either in the bundesliga season or the world cup . ”
a slow but steady developer , rolfes had become an international caliber midfielder .
now he was forced to watch khedira take on a role in the german squad that he himself would have probably occupied , had he not been hurt .
khedira performed well in south africa and landed a deal with real madrid .
meanwhile , rolfes was just trying to regain his basic fitness .

“ after the operation i was on crutches for eight weeks … and it hardly a lot of fun to lie around at home , exercising your leg or knee with a machine for six hours a day and watching your muscles virtually disappear . ”
rolfes also said that when he was able to work out with a football again , it was hard at first to commit to challenges .

“ but step for step , they bring you along , and then at some point it 's over .

and perhaps more encouragingly , he 's played for a full 90 minutes in his last two games .
he also provided the assist for leverkusen 's lone goal in their win agaist st. pauli on the weekend , which took the team up to second in the bundesliga standings .
but will he ever be able to recapture the status he once had with germany head coach joachim loew ?
competition for spots in the midfield is fierce , with not even nominal team captain michael ballack being assured of making the squad .
rolfes draws hope from the very vagaries of football that put him out of commission for much of 2009 and 2010 .
“ a year ago , no one would have thought that bastian schweinsteiger and sami khedira would be the central midfielders at the world cup , ” rolfes said .
“ and likewise , no one knows what 's going to happen in two or three years ' time .
there 's always the possibility of injuries and other circumstances .
so you should n't concentrate on whether it 's difficult or not . ”
and rolfes does n't need to look far to find an example of hope .
his teammate at leverkusen , striker patrick helmes , was also knocked out of germany 's world cup squad by an injury , but has gotten a call-up to play in the nationalelf 's friendly against sweden this coming wednesday .
so even though rolfes has dropped off the radar screen of many casual germany fans , it would n't be all that surprising to find him on the plane when yogi and co. travel to euro 2012 in poland and ukraine , or even the 2014 world cup in brazil .

voter turnout in athens was 33 percent , with a national average of 50 percent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 15.11.2010 leverkusen midfielder rolfes hopes injury nightmare is finally over großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolfes is a big physical player with a good passing eye a succession of knee injuries meant simon rolfes missed the 2010 world cup - a nearly worst-case scenario for any footballer .
he talked to deutsche welle about the ups and downs of trying to come back . before there was sami khedira , there was simon rolfes .
the 28-year-old midfielder was originally the one tipped to take over the stopper role from ageing veteran michael ballack .
but a meniscus injury in july 2009 ultimately stopped rolfes in his tracks just as he was reaching the peak of his career .
rolfes played through pain that fall .
after all , his club , bayer leverkusen , was topping the table , and he had established himself as a regular in the german national side .
but by october he had developed articular cartilage damage and had no option but to have an operation .
the problems did n't go away , and he was forced to go under the knife again in january and acknowledge that his dream of competing in south africa was over .
“ we were on a sensational run with leverkusen and topping the table at the winter break , ” rolfes told deutsche welle .
“ my plan was to come back in the second half of the season and be a full part of the team , since the games i had played that season had been the best of my career .
so , of course , the weeks following the january operation were really hard .
i realized i was n't going to play any role at all either in the bundesliga season or the world cup . ”
a slow but steady developer , rolfes had become an international caliber midfielder .
now he was forced to watch khedira take on a role in the german squad that he himself would have probably occupied , had he not been hurt .
khedira performed well in south africa and landed a deal with real madrid .
meanwhile , rolfes was just trying to regain his basic fitness .
daily drudgery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolfes had been getting regular starts for germany in one respect , rolfes has been lucky .
the injuries he suffered have ended many a footballer 's career .
but rehab work , to hear him describe it , is a total slog , and it is difficult for a top athlete to acknowledge that , through no fault of one 's own , one is not at the level one was just a few months before .
“ it takes time to accept and start looking forward again , ” rolfes said .
“ after the operation i was on crutches for eight weeks … and it hardly a lot of fun to lie around at home , exercising your leg or knee with a machine for six hours a day and watching your muscles virtually disappear . ”
rolfes also said that when he was able to work out with a football again , it was hard at first to commit to challenges .
overcoming fear , he said , came gradually as he got used to playing scrimmages in training sessions .
“ it 's such a long process , and in the beginning you ca n't imagine yourself being on the pitch again , ” rolfes remembered .
“ but step for step , they bring you along , and then at some point it 's over .
you get your confidence back in practice . ”
practice , in this case , does n't make perfect .
it gives a player the chance to regain what he 's lost .
positive outlook bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coming back from a knee injury takes lots of hard , boring work rolfes made his bundesliga comeback in late september , and so far , he 's been pretty good .
last month , he scored a pair of goals to help leverkusen beat wolfsburg , even though he only came on as a late substitute .
and perhaps more encouragingly , he 's played for a full 90 minutes in his last two games .
he also provided the assist for leverkusen 's lone goal in their win agaist st. pauli on the weekend , which took the team up to second in the bundesliga standings .
but will he ever be able to recapture the status he once had with germany head coach joachim loew ?
competition for spots in the midfield is fierce , with not even nominal team captain michael ballack being assured of making the squad .
rolfes draws hope from the very vagaries of football that put him out of commission for much of 2009 and 2010 .
“ a year ago , no one would have thought that bastian schweinsteiger and sami khedira would be the central midfielders at the world cup , ” rolfes said .
“ and likewise , no one knows what 's going to happen in two or three years ' time .
there 's always the possibility of injuries and other circumstances .
so you should n't concentrate on whether it 's difficult or not . ”
and rolfes does n't need to look far to find an example of hope .
his teammate at leverkusen , striker patrick helmes , was also knocked out of germany 's world cup squad by an injury , but has gotten a call-up to play in the nationalelf 's friendly against sweden this coming wednesday .
so even though rolfes has dropped off the radar screen of many casual germany fans , it would n't be all that surprising to find him on the plane when yogi and co. travel to euro 2012 in poland and ukraine , or even the 2014 world cup in brazil .
simon rolfes was interviewed by kamilla jarzina for dw-tv 's bundesliga kick off program .

greek officials are expected to file an international arrest warrant . greek prosecutors are poised to issue an international arrest warrant for a former siemens executive involved in a bribery scandal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de research -pipe- 15.11.2010 czech company produces air-cleansing paint großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photocatalysis has a wealth of potential practical uses czech scientists and companies are currently working on some exciting innovations in nanotechnology , including a new paint that uses photocatalytic oxydation to clean the air . a czech firm has recently started producing a powerful photocatalytic paint that cleans the air of cigarette smoke , viruses and bacteria in minutes , whilst the czech academy of sciences has just opened a new nanocenter to spearhead research into practical applications for nanoscience .
" this is an exciting time for science - something like a revolution , " said jiri rathousky , the project 's leader , as he demonstrated a contraption called a dip coater in the lab of the newly-opened center .
the center – aided by funding from the european union – is the pride and joy of the heyrovsky institute of physical chemistry , a rather drab concrete tower block in the northern suburbs of prague .
hidden away on the sixth floor , rathousky and his colleagues in white overalls are doing some truly remarkable things with very small materials .
the magic of photocatalysts " for example here we coat sheets of glass with a thin layer of a nanostructure called titanium dioxide , " rathousky explained .
" titanium dioxide is a very efficient photocatalyst , and in this way , we obtain a photocatalytically active surface .
this type of photocatalytically active surface can be used for example in air-conditioning , for cleaning the air , and for removal of pollutants by the action of light . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the paint cleared a cube of cigarette smoke in one hour photocatalysts , substances that speed up a chemical reaction when light hits them , have tremendous practical uses like sterilization and air cleansing .
in a small , rather dilapidated factory on the outskirts of prague , a company called advanced materials is putting titanium dioxide to use in something called photocatalytic paint , an incredibly clever , virtually translucent paint that actually cleans the air in your living room of everything from bacteria to cigarette smoke .
" even in a concentration of one cigarette per cubic metre , you see very high degradation rate , " said jan prochazka , advanced materials ' co-owner .
in one hour , he said , a cubic meter box used to test the paint is clean of cigarette smoke .
" we say -lsb- the paint will oxidize -rsb- ninety percent of all contaminants in 24 hours , but it 's much faster .
it 's just to stay on the safe side , " prochazka added .
molecular reaction the tiny titanium dioxide molecules in the paint react to uv rays in sunlight or special lamps , oxidizing everything from carcinogens to allergens to dust mites .
that means that titanium oxide molecules react with smoke or bacteria , essentially consuming it .
that leaves a by-product of water and carbon dioxide , which are harmless .
photocatalytic paint has been around for a while , but he says that their new technique has been refined to be hundreds of times more powerful and efficient , and could revolutionize the way air is cleaned in homes and offices .
however , this technique is still relatively new , and a 2008 study from the lawrence berkeley national laboratory in the us found that photocatalytic oxidization may increase the presence of formaldehyde , a potentially dangerous chemical , in a real-life , indoor setting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one industry analyst called nanotech " the oil industry of the future " undeterred , advanced materials is already shipping their product to spain , south africa and new zealand , and licences to make it in other countries are already being drawn up . the success of advanced materials and the creation of the nanocentre in prague have led some in the czech media to speak of the czech republic as having the potential to become a major force in nanotechnology in europe .
huge growth ahead but perhaps all of this trumpeting should be taken with a pinch of salt .
" nanotech is the new oil industry , " said dean freeman , a nanotech industry analyst with gartner research .
" there are many opportunities in the nanotech space for research .
the key is making a product that can get traction and be sold commercially .
from a research perspective i have not seen a great deal on nanotech from the czech republic .
-lsb- but that -rsb- could have more to do with how publicized any research is . "
however he added their success in accessing eu funds for nanotech projects – and the czech government 's commitment – certainly placed the czechs in a strong position to make a name for themselves on the global nanotech market .

hidden away on the sixth floor , rathousky and his colleagues in white overalls are doing some truly remarkable things with very small materials .
the magic of photocatalysts " for example here we coat sheets of glass with a thin layer of a nanostructure called titanium dioxide , " rathousky explained .
" titanium dioxide is a very efficient photocatalyst , and in this way , we obtain a photocatalytically active surface .
this type of photocatalytically active surface can be used for example in air-conditioning , for cleaning the air , and for removal of pollutants by the action of light . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the paint cleared a cube of cigarette smoke in one hour photocatalysts , substances that speed up a chemical reaction when light hits them , have tremendous practical uses like sterilization and air cleansing .
in a small , rather dilapidated factory on the outskirts of prague , a company called advanced materials is putting titanium dioxide to use in something called photocatalytic paint , an incredibly clever , virtually translucent paint that actually cleans the air in your living room of everything from bacteria to cigarette smoke .
" even in a concentration of one cigarette per cubic metre , you see very high degradation rate , " said jan prochazka , advanced materials ' co-owner .
in one hour , he said , a cubic meter box used to test the paint is clean of cigarette smoke .
" we say -lsb- the paint will oxidize -rsb- ninety percent of all contaminants in 24 hours , but it 's much faster .
it 's just to stay on the safe side , " prochazka added .
molecular reaction the tiny titanium dioxide molecules in the paint react to uv rays in sunlight or special lamps , oxidizing everything from carcinogens to allergens to dust mites .
that means that titanium oxide molecules react with smoke or bacteria , essentially consuming it .
that leaves a by-product of water and carbon dioxide , which are harmless .
photocatalytic paint has been around for a while , but he says that their new technique has been refined to be hundreds of times more powerful and efficient , and could revolutionize the way air is cleaned in homes and offices .
however , this technique is still relatively new , and a 2008 study from the lawrence berkeley national laboratory in the us found that photocatalytic oxidization may increase the presence of formaldehyde , a potentially dangerous chemical , in a real-life , indoor setting .

huge growth ahead but perhaps all of this trumpeting should be taken with a pinch of salt .
" nanotech is the new oil industry , " said dean freeman , a nanotech industry analyst with gartner research .
" there are many opportunities in the nanotech space for research .
the key is making a product that can get traction and be sold commercially .

meanwhile , others wondered how a problem of this magnitude could even happen . the death toll from haiti 's cholera epidemic has reached more than 900 and the disease is present in six of the 10 provinces of the earthquake-battered caribbean country , the health ministry said over the weekend .
more than 15,000 people have been infected since the epidemic 's outbreak in late october , the health ministry said sunday , and the epidemic showed no sign of abating .
there were 120 new deaths since friday 's toll .
according to the ministry on monday , 917 people have died of the disease so far .
worse expected to come according to un estimates , up to 200,000 people could fall ill with cholera .
the world body on friday applied for another $ 163 million -lrb- 120 million euros -rrb- in donor aid .
the disease broke out in the northern artibonite region , where it continues to be most concentrated .
it is contracted through contaminated water and causes severe diarrhea and vomiting .
bildunterschrift : the fear is growing that the epidemic will spread to refugee camps authorities and international aid agencies were struggling to contain the latest crisis afflicting the impoverished island nation .
efforts are centering on preventing the disease from spreading in crowded city slums and tent camps that house over 1.3 million homeless people who survived the cataclysmic earthquake , nearly a year ago .
but the facts of the epidemic raise the question of how such a preventable disease could break out in a country that has been flooded with hundreds of millions of euros in foreign assistance since the earthquake .
resource coordination is problem " huge sums in aid money have gone there , but the people in the north seem to have been left to their own devices , " sven stockrahm , a journalist with german newspaper die zeit who wrote about the earthquake , told deutsche welle .
stockrahm stressed that his critical remarks were not aimed at humanitarian aid workers , who by all accounts are doing vital work under very trying circumstances .
the key question is whether a better coordination of the resources in place could have prevented cholera from occurring in the first place .
bildunterschrift : aid workers are working ahrd to meet the needs of growing patient numbers but clear answers are difficult to come by where haiti is concerned .
the causes of cholera , lack of clean drinking water and poor sanitation are well-known , but at present , no one is sure exactly how the disease even broke out in artibonite .
poor sanitation , even pre-earthquake what is certain is that conditions in haiti even before the earthquake were far from adequate .
a study by the world health organization and unicef found that open defecation was prevalent among just under half of rural haitians and that 3.7 million of haiti 's total population of 9 million had no reliable source of clean drinking water .
moreover , from 1990 to 2008 , conditions deteriorated .
a similar study by the united nations in 2009 determined that 42 percent of haitians were not using an " improved water source . "
haiti ranks dead last among countries in south america and the caribbean in all major water and hygiene categories .
" cholera is a sickness of poverty that is common in refugee camps where there ’ s not enough drinking water , " ernst diekmann - a doctor with germany 's society for technical cooperation , or gtz - told deutsche welle .
" haiti was already an underprivileged country , and the situation was exacerbated by the natural catastrophe . "
problem exacerbated by refugees nonetheless , aid workers acknowledge that pre-existing deficiencies and the slow recovery process are two parts of the same overall problem that encouraged the cholera outbreak .
and the issue of earthquake refugees only exacerbates those problems .
bildunterschrift : as the disease spreads , burials are on the rise " the dramatic thing about haiti is that even before the earthquake the health infrastructure was fully inadequate , " said joost butenop , a medical adviser to the aid organization caritas .
" aid organizations have concentrated on the region specifically affected -lsb- by the earthquake -rsb- and have n't been following the refugees to any great extent . "
organizational challenges earlier this year , the humanitarian organization refugees international went even further , claiming that recovery efforts in haiti were not just sluggish , but " paralyzed . "
off the record , many people who work in the aid and assistance sector say that shortcomings in coordination often prevent help from getting where it 's needed - or problems from being effectively anticipated .
that task falls to the united nations and the haitian government , and representatives of the former have openly admitted that the situation in haiti tests their limits .
the will to help is there .
germany 's ministry for economic cooperation and development , for instance , says that most of the 51.4 million euros -lrb- $ 72 million -rrb- it was allocated for haiti has already been distributed or earmarked for future projects .
yet merely distinguishing between emergency needs and long-term developmental requirements , and figuring out which government ministry is responsible , can be a complicated process .
and coordinating the enormous number of private and public organizations trying to help in haiti represents an organizational task of the highest order .
at this point , no one can say definitively whether any particular authority should have foreseen the danger of cholera in haiti and taken precautionary steps to prevent it .
but the outbreak of the disease in a country that has been the focus of so much international assistance suggests that overall organization and coordination remain problems that hinder aid initiatives from having their maximum possible effect .

meanwhile , others wondered how a problem of this magnitude could even happen . the death toll from haiti 's cholera epidemic has reached more than 900 and the disease is present in six of the 10 provinces of the earthquake-battered caribbean country , the health ministry said over the weekend .
more than 15,000 people have been infected since the epidemic 's outbreak in late october , the health ministry said sunday , and the epidemic showed no sign of abating .
there were 120 new deaths since friday 's toll .
according to the ministry on monday , 917 people have died of the disease so far .
worse expected to come according to un estimates , up to 200,000 people could fall ill with cholera .
the world body on friday applied for another $ 163 million -lrb- 120 million euros -rrb- in donor aid .
the disease broke out in the northern artibonite region , where it continues to be most concentrated .
it is contracted through contaminated water and causes severe diarrhea and vomiting .
bildunterschrift : the fear is growing that the epidemic will spread to refugee camps authorities and international aid agencies were struggling to contain the latest crisis afflicting the impoverished island nation .
efforts are centering on preventing the disease from spreading in crowded city slums and tent camps that house over 1.3 million homeless people who survived the cataclysmic earthquake , nearly a year ago .
but the facts of the epidemic raise the question of how such a preventable disease could break out in a country that has been flooded with hundreds of millions of euros in foreign assistance since the earthquake .
resource coordination is problem " huge sums in aid money have gone there , but the people in the north seem to have been left to their own devices , " sven stockrahm , a journalist with german newspaper die zeit who wrote about the earthquake , told deutsche welle .
stockrahm stressed that his critical remarks were not aimed at humanitarian aid workers , who by all accounts are doing vital work under very trying circumstances .
the key question is whether a better coordination of the resources in place could have prevented cholera from occurring in the first place .
bildunterschrift : aid workers are working ahrd to meet the needs of growing patient numbers but clear answers are difficult to come by where haiti is concerned .
the causes of cholera , lack of clean drinking water and poor sanitation are well-known , but at present , no one is sure exactly how the disease even broke out in artibonite .
poor sanitation , even pre-earthquake what is certain is that conditions in haiti even before the earthquake were far from adequate .
a study by the world health organization and unicef found that open defecation was prevalent among just under half of rural haitians and that 3.7 million of haiti 's total population of 9 million had no reliable source of clean drinking water .
moreover , from 1990 to 2008 , conditions deteriorated .
a similar study by the united nations in 2009 determined that 42 percent of haitians were not using an " improved water source . "
haiti ranks dead last among countries in south america and the caribbean in all major water and hygiene categories .
" cholera is a sickness of poverty that is common in refugee camps where there ’ s not enough drinking water , " ernst diekmann - a doctor with germany 's society for technical cooperation , or gtz - told deutsche welle .
" haiti was already an underprivileged country , and the situation was exacerbated by the natural catastrophe . "
problem exacerbated by refugees nonetheless , aid workers acknowledge that pre-existing deficiencies and the slow recovery process are two parts of the same overall problem that encouraged the cholera outbreak .
and the issue of earthquake refugees only exacerbates those problems .
bildunterschrift : as the disease spreads , burials are on the rise " the dramatic thing about haiti is that even before the earthquake the health infrastructure was fully inadequate , " said joost butenop , a medical adviser to the aid organization caritas .
" aid organizations have concentrated on the region specifically affected -lsb- by the earthquake -rsb- and have n't been following the refugees to any great extent . "
organizational challenges earlier this year , the humanitarian organization refugees international went even further , claiming that recovery efforts in haiti were not just sluggish , but " paralyzed . "
off the record , many people who work in the aid and assistance sector say that shortcomings in coordination often prevent help from getting where it 's needed - or problems from being effectively anticipated .
that task falls to the united nations and the haitian government , and representatives of the former have openly admitted that the situation in haiti tests their limits .
the will to help is there .
germany 's ministry for economic cooperation and development , for instance , says that most of the 51.4 million euros -lrb- $ 72 million -rrb- it was allocated for haiti has already been distributed or earmarked for future projects .
yet merely distinguishing between emergency needs and long-term developmental requirements , and figuring out which government ministry is responsible , can be a complicated process .
and coordinating the enormous number of private and public organizations trying to help in haiti represents an organizational task of the highest order .
at this point , no one can say definitively whether any particular authority should have foreseen the danger of cholera in haiti and taken precautionary steps to prevent it .
but the outbreak of the disease in a country that has been the focus of so much international assistance suggests that overall organization and coordination remain problems that hinder aid initiatives from having their maximum possible effect .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 15.11.2010 ireland is still sidestepping what experts say is inevitable : a bailout großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plenty of irish voters are n't happy these days will ireland accept a bailout and help reverse a bond sell-off among the eurozone 's deficit-laden nations ?
the country is still refusing but so did greece before it bowed to pressure . speculation is rife about ireland 's course of action , as the country 's borrowing costs last week shot to record highs on concerns of a deficit set to hit 32 percent of gross domestic product this year .
monday kicked off with a report in the irish independent newspaper claiming that at a meeting of eurozone finance ministers this week , ireland plans to ask for money from the european union 's emergency fund to rescue its banks .
prompt denial an irish minister promptly fired off a denial about the country being in direct discussions about a bailout package from the european union .
while acknowledging that ireland is in " continuous talks " with the eu about its growing debt , dick roche , junior minister for european affairs , told newstalk radio that it is " frankly wrong and grossly irresponsible that this story is being said and that a frenzy is being created out there . "
the opposition claimed europe had already started moves to rescue the country , but the irish government denied it would need a bailout .
" ireland has made no application for external support , " a finance ministry spokesman said .
" ongoing contacts continue at official level with international colleagues in light of current market conditions . "
the rumor mill is almost certain to continue with every new day of uncertainty confronting irish banks .
at the end of last month , they owed 130 billion euros -lrb- $ 177 billion -rrb- of outstanding european central bank loans , up from 119 billion euros a month earlier .
numbers being floated around as part of a bailout deal range between 50 and 77 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment in ireland has soared to 13.2 percent the eu is reported to be keen for ireland to accept aid to avert a greek-style scenario in which budget problems in one country plunge the entire eurozone into crisis .
on monday , european central bank council member miguel angel fernandez ordonez prodded ireland to make a " final decision " on its fiscal crisis in a move to calm markets .
" the situation in the markets in recent weeks has been very negative due in some way to the lack of a final decision by ireland , " he told reporters in madrid .
" it 's not me who should take a decision about ireland ; it 's ireland that should take the right decision at the right moment . "
but the clock is ticking .
" i think ireland can hold out another three to four months maximum , and it should , hoping that some positive surprise on growth might calm the markets , " unicredit group chief economist marco annunziata told deutsche welle .
" but investors will remain nervous until the question is settled of whether or not eurozone sovereign debts might be restructured . "
stability program on track another european expert , who asked not to be identified , said the european finance ministers could reach a decision as early as this week to funnel funds to irish banks .
" these funds , which would help stabilize the banks , would be seen as a limited intervention , " the expert said .
there is no question about ireland 's sovereign debt , the expert added : the irish government has no immediate need for cash , being fully funded until mid-2011 , and its stability program is on track bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish banks owe billions to the european central bank germany has also pressed for ireland to accept aid , insiders say .
allaying investor concerns about irish finances would help advance chancellor angela merkel 's plan to require investors to help pay for future rescues .

" the situation in the markets in recent weeks has been very negative due in some way to the lack of a final decision by ireland , " he told reporters in madrid .
" it 's not me who should take a decision about ireland ; it 's ireland that should take the right decision at the right moment . "
but the clock is ticking .
" i think ireland can hold out another three to four months maximum , and it should , hoping that some positive surprise on growth might calm the markets , " unicredit group chief economist marco annunziata told deutsche welle .
" but investors will remain nervous until the question is settled of whether or not eurozone sovereign debts might be restructured . "
stability program on track another european expert , who asked not to be identified , said the european finance ministers could reach a decision as early as this week to funnel funds to irish banks .
" these funds , which would help stabilize the banks , would be seen as a limited intervention , " the expert said .
there is no question about ireland 's sovereign debt , the expert added : the irish government has no immediate need for cash , being fully funded until mid-2011 , and its stability program is on track bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish banks owe billions to the european central bank germany has also pressed for ireland to accept aid , insiders say .
allaying investor concerns about irish finances would help advance chancellor angela merkel 's plan to require investors to help pay for future rescues .
european leaders , however , remain divided on merkel 's proposal , as they do on whether the ecb should keep buying bonds of debt-laden countries .
ireland 's debt problems stem largely from the country 's popped real estate bubble , when its local banks lent money too freely for construction projects .
on top of that was the irish government 's decision to provide a blanket guarantee to all bank creditors .
as a result , the country has experienced the worst recession of any major economy .
it has amassed debt of more than 100 billion euros and is struggling with an unemployment rate of 13.2 percent .
tough fiscal conditions a rescue plan would be deeply unpopular with irish voters , who value national independence and the low-tax regime that lured in foreign investment from u.s. and other non-european companies , fueling high growth rates over the past 20 years .
indeed , an eu bailout , with tough fiscal conditions attached , would be humiliating for a country once celebrated for its rags-to-riches transformation .
not unsurprisingly , critics of ireland 's action plan – or lack thereof – are wary of the country 's every move .
karel lannoo , chief executive officer of the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- in brussels , says the country should have acted long ago to steer clear of the financial challenges it now faces .
" ireland should never have given blanket coverage to banks in the first place , " lannoo told deutsche welle .
" and it should have let some of the banks fail . "
lannoo now questions the repercussions for europe .
" how many more of these financial disasters can we have ? " he asked .

the country is still refusing but so did greece before it bowed to pressure . speculation is rife about ireland 's course of action , as the country 's borrowing costs last week shot to record highs on concerns of a deficit set to hit 32 percent of gross domestic product this year .
monday kicked off with a report in the irish independent newspaper claiming that at a meeting of eurozone finance ministers this week , ireland plans to ask for money from the european union 's emergency fund to rescue its banks .
prompt denial an irish minister promptly fired off a denial about the country being in direct discussions about a bailout package from the european union .
while acknowledging that ireland is in " continuous talks " with the eu about its growing debt , dick roche , junior minister for european affairs , told newstalk radio that it is " frankly wrong and grossly irresponsible that this story is being said and that a frenzy is being created out there . "
the opposition claimed europe had already started moves to rescue the country , but the irish government denied it would need a bailout .
" ireland has made no application for external support , " a finance ministry spokesman said .
" ongoing contacts continue at official level with international colleagues in light of current market conditions . "
the rumor mill is almost certain to continue with every new day of uncertainty confronting irish banks .
at the end of last month , they owed 130 billion euros -lrb- $ 177 billion -rrb- of outstanding european central bank loans , up from 119 billion euros a month earlier .
numbers being floated around as part of a bailout deal range between 50 and 77 billion euros .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 15.11.2010 merkel reelected as head of christian democratic union party großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel needed a good election result chancellor angela merkel has won reelection as leader of the christian democratic union .
she gained widespread support at this week 's party conference , which comes ahead of several key state elections in 2011 . german chancellor angela merkel has been reelected as head of her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- party , a sign that the party stands behind merkel despite recent doubts of the effectiveness of merkel and the cdu in leading the government . merkel ran unopposed and garnered the support of just over 90 percent of her party colleagues .
two years ago she received 95 percent of the votes when she was elected party head .
observers believed a drastic drop in that number would have indicated discontent from within the cdu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stuttgart rail project has proven to be deeply divisive merkel 's cdu and its junior coalition partner , the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , have taken a beating in the opinion polls over the last year over an unpopular bailout for fellow eurozone member greece , the decision to extend the operating lives of nuclear power plants and an expensive rail infrastructure project in stuttgart that has inspired massive local protests . with elections to be held in six of germany 's 16 states , 2011 is set to be a key year for merkel 's government .
earlier this year , the center-right coalition already suffered a major blow when it lost power in the country 's most populous state north rhine-westphalia and control of the bundesrat , the country 's upper house of parliament , along with it . leadership renewal the cdu took another hit when president horst koehler stepped down in june after being criticized for suggesting the german military had a role in protecting the country 's economic interests .
several other big names have left the political stage and merkel is set to get a new team of leaders standing behind her . around 1,000 cdu delegates are gathered in karlsruhe , where the party also voted on merkel ’ s four deputy leaders .
education minister annette schavan was reelected to the post , while environment minister norbert roettgen , labor minister ursula von der leyen and hesse premier volker bouffier recieved their first nominations . schaeuble put to task ahead of the party conference , merkel reiterated her support for finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , whose suitability for the job has been questioned recently due to chronic health problems , which led the minister to a three-week hospitalization last month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble insists he 's fit enough to keep his post merkel maintained that schaeuble was a capable minister and that the party ’ s support for him was strong , telling zdf public television , " i enjoy being chancellor with schaeuble as my finance minister . " however , schaeuble ’ s health was not the only source of stress for the finance minister . merkel and schaeuble - who just returned from a g20 conference in seoul , where they defended germany ’ s trade surplus - have repelled demands for tax cuts , as politicians from both within and outside of the party have called for a strong reform to germany ’ s tax laws . cdu parliamentarian christian von stetten told the sunday newspaper bild am sonntag that an improvement to the current laws was needed : " if we don ’ t put through a tax simplification law that earns that name , then we aren ’ t taking our voters seriously , " he said . schaeuble , meanwhile , said that he was open to discussions on improving the tax law with government deputies in parliament . divisive issues also on monday , german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg is due to present delegates in karlsruhe with his plan for reforming germany ’ s military .
the delegates are expected to pass a resolution on ending military conscription in germany , despite the fact that the party has traditionally advocated maintaining compulsory military service for young men .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg advocates an ende to conscription another topic to be discussed is the question of preimplantation genetic diagnosis - the testing of artificially fertilized human eggs for congenital disorders prior to implantation . the issue has been hotly debated in recent weeks , with opponents of the practice claiming it to be a precursor to genetic engineering of human beings .
while the cdu remains divided over the matter , merkel has come out in favor of a ban , claiming it was impossible to differentiate between minor and major congenital disorders . merkel told zdf that she was , however , open to discussion on the topic .
" we will conduct this debate with great mutual respect , " she said .
she added that neither position in the debate was the " christian " one , as the issue divided even church authorities . author : david levitz , holly fox -lrb- afp , ap , dpa , -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 15.11.2010 merkel reelected as head of christian democratic union party großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel needed a good election result chancellor angela merkel has won reelection as leader of the christian democratic union .
she gained widespread support at this week 's party conference , which comes ahead of several key state elections in 2011 . german chancellor angela merkel has been reelected as head of her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- party , a sign that the party stands behind merkel despite recent doubts of the effectiveness of merkel and the cdu in leading the government . merkel ran unopposed and garnered the support of just over 90 percent of her party colleagues .
two years ago she received 95 percent of the votes when she was elected party head .
observers believed a drastic drop in that number would have indicated discontent from within the cdu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stuttgart rail project has proven to be deeply divisive merkel 's cdu and its junior coalition partner , the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , have taken a beating in the opinion polls over the last year over an unpopular bailout for fellow eurozone member greece , the decision to extend the operating lives of nuclear power plants and an expensive rail infrastructure project in stuttgart that has inspired massive local protests . with elections to be held in six of germany 's 16 states , 2011 is set to be a key year for merkel 's government .
earlier this year , the center-right coalition already suffered a major blow when it lost power in the country 's most populous state north rhine-westphalia and control of the bundesrat , the country 's upper house of parliament , along with it . leadership renewal the cdu took another hit when president horst koehler stepped down in june after being criticized for suggesting the german military had a role in protecting the country 's economic interests .
several other big names have left the political stage and merkel is set to get a new team of leaders standing behind her . around 1,000 cdu delegates are gathered in karlsruhe , where the party also voted on merkel ’ s four deputy leaders .
education minister annette schavan was reelected to the post , while environment minister norbert roettgen , labor minister ursula von der leyen and hesse premier volker bouffier recieved their first nominations . schaeuble put to task ahead of the party conference , merkel reiterated her support for finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , whose suitability for the job has been questioned recently due to chronic health problems , which led the minister to a three-week hospitalization last month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble insists he 's fit enough to keep his post merkel maintained that schaeuble was a capable minister and that the party ’ s support for him was strong , telling zdf public television , " i enjoy being chancellor with schaeuble as my finance minister . " however , schaeuble ’ s health was not the only source of stress for the finance minister . merkel and schaeuble - who just returned from a g20 conference in seoul , where they defended germany ’ s trade surplus - have repelled demands for tax cuts , as politicians from both within and outside of the party have called for a strong reform to germany ’ s tax laws . cdu parliamentarian christian von stetten told the sunday newspaper bild am sonntag that an improvement to the current laws was needed : " if we don ’ t put through a tax simplification law that earns that name , then we aren ’ t taking our voters seriously , " he said . schaeuble , meanwhile , said that he was open to discussions on improving the tax law with government deputies in parliament . divisive issues also on monday , german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg is due to present delegates in karlsruhe with his plan for reforming germany ’ s military .
the delegates are expected to pass a resolution on ending military conscription in germany , despite the fact that the party has traditionally advocated maintaining compulsory military service for young men .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg advocates an ende to conscription another topic to be discussed is the question of preimplantation genetic diagnosis - the testing of artificially fertilized human eggs for congenital disorders prior to implantation . the issue has been hotly debated in recent weeks , with opponents of the practice claiming it to be a precursor to genetic engineering of human beings .
while the cdu remains divided over the matter , merkel has come out in favor of a ban , claiming it was impossible to differentiate between minor and major congenital disorders . merkel told zdf that she was , however , open to discussion on the topic .
" we will conduct this debate with great mutual respect , " she said .
she added that neither position in the debate was the " christian " one , as the issue divided even church authorities . author : david levitz , holly fox -lrb- afp , ap , dpa , -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

if vettel appeared calm before the final race in abu dhabi , the 23-year-old german was overcome with emotion afterwards . sebastian vettel cried tears of joy after sunday 's race in abu dhabi , after his team radioed in to tell him he had clinched the world championship , seemingly against all the odds .
" unbelievable .
thank you lads .
i love you , " the 23-year-old german said with a quivering voice from the cockpit .
after that , all you could really make out on the transmission were loud cries of celebration from the man with the glittering helmet .
" baby schumi " was what the german tabloid press once called him , but it was michael schumacher himself who pointed out earlier this year that vettel had outgrown that nickname , and the youngster has now proved beyond any doubt that as world champion , he should stand in nobody 's shadow .
" i did n't know anything until i passed the checkered flag " this world championship is the high point of an already stellar career .
vettel was born in 1987 in the southwestern german town of heppenheim , and his father norbert ensured that sebastian was bitten by the motorsport bug very early .
aged four , vettel first thrashed a go-kart around his parents ' driveway , and his first successes - as with almost all modern racers - followed racing in go-karts in his youth .
eventually , the youngster was noticed , and promoted to the single-seater formula bmw racing series .
as a debutante , vettel was immediately runner-up , and the next year he came back and won an incredible 18 out of 20 races .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel 's tasted champagne as a winner five times in 2010 vettel moved on to formula 3 , where he never managed to claim the grand prize , but that was because his fame was already overtaking him and his rise up the ladder was accelerating .
in 2006 , he was given his first shot in a formula one car in a young driver test , immediately posting the fastest time .
the next year , in indianapolis , an injury to then bmw-sauber driver robert kubica gave vettel his chance on a race weekend .
still in his teens , he promptly became not only the youngest driver to compete in a grand prix -lrb- a record he has since lost -rrb- , but also the youngest-ever points-scorer in the sport 's history - bringing his bmw home in eighth on his debut .
the early-achiever continued tearing up f1 's age-related record book in the following season .
driving for the underfunded toro rosso team , vettel became the youngest ever pole-sitter and then winner in a single wet weekend in monza , doing the double for his minor team as the championship battle raged around him .
two years on , after being promoted to the red bull outfit , vettel has completed his cv , becoming the youngest world champion in the sport 's history , displacing 2008 winner lewis hamilton by less than a year .
" i am a bit speechless .
i do n't know what you are supposed to say at this moment , " a usually loquacious vettel admitted in the post-race press conference .
" to be honest i did n't know anything until i passed the checkered flag . "
vettel not only needed a win , championship leader fernando alonso had to finish fifth or lower for him to win the title , but the spanish ferrari driver had a poor race , and could only salvage seventh .
" i hate losing " bildunterschrift : the youngster 's love of winning is displayed by his trademark index-finger celebration vettel - never one to aim low - points to the three michaels as heroes of his childhood : michael schumacher , michael jordan and michael jackson .
vettel even dreamed of becoming a musician as a kid .
" it was funny when i finally realized that i did n't have the voice for it , " he admitted in later life .
nevertheless , vettel 's passion remained - he 's a huge beatles fan and record collector to this day .
vettel also tried out a number of sports in his youth before settling on motor racing .
" i never scored many goals , and did n't even get called on to play that often , " vettel lamented , recalling his time on the football pitch .
he also tried tennis , table tennis , and even beach volleyball , but never settled for long .
" i was just never the best , so i stopped playing .
i hate losing . "
finally , vettel started following in the first michael 's footsteps more seriously , turning his attention to racing – a sport whose ethos he seems to enjoy .
" it 's irrelevant whether you 're second or fifth .
the only important thing is being no. 1 . "
with 10 pole positions , five wins , and now a world championship in 2010 , vettel has achieved that goal .

deutsche welle 's sports writer arnulf boettcher provides his take on germany 's new sports hero . germany has a new sports hero : sebastian vettel , the youngest world champion in formula one history .
born in the south-western german town of heppenheim , vettel wears the formula one crown at just 23 years old - and surely not for the last time .
germany 's other formula one world-champion , michael schumacher , was 25 when he won his first of a record seven titles .
like schumacher , vettel is known for his meticulousness and obsession over detail .
but unlike his role model schumacher , vettel does n't come across as so serious .
instead , vettel is seen as quick-witted , youthfully mischievous , and almost always smiling .
that 's what makes him so likeable on the formula one scene .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arnulf boettcher vettel almost become world champion last year .
he was held back by technical problems with his red bull car , but hasty mistakes were part of the problem , too .
he narrowly escaped meeting the same fate again this year .
but the setbacks only appear to have made him stronger .
in the decisive race , he took first place and made no mistakes in a dominating race where he was the best driver among his competitors .
ten pole positions and five victories make vettel a worthy and well-deserving champion .
fernando alonso is left pondering what might have been as his ferrari team implemented the wrong strategy in the final race in abu dhabi .
as for his title chances , alonso benefitted from an illegal team order : his ferrari teammate felipe massa was leading at the hockenheim race , but was ordered to let alonso through , securing an extra seven points for the spaniard .
red bull , on the other hand , did not issue team orders in the 2010 season and earned great respect from all sides .
vettel benefitted from the new points system that made formula one decidedly more exciting .
five drivers were in contention for the title heading into the second-to-last race , and for the final event four were still in the running .
in the end , vettel triumphed , after coming into the race in third place 15 points behind and without having even occupied top spot .
now germany can relish a world-title fairy tale and a youthful world champion .
but any expectations that vettel could someday overtake michael schumacher as the record world champion are misguided .
formula one has become much too fast-paced , and five different champions in the last five years speak for themselves .

meanwhile , others wondered how a problem of this magnitude could even happen . the death toll from haiti 's cholera epidemic has reached more than 900 and the disease is present in six of the 10 provinces of the earthquake-battered caribbean country , the health ministry said over the weekend .
more than 15,000 people have been infected since the epidemic 's outbreak in late october , the health ministry said sunday , and the epidemic showed no sign of abating .
there were 120 new deaths since friday 's toll .
according to the ministry on monday , 917 people have died of the disease so far .
worse expected to come according to un estimates , up to 200,000 people could fall ill with cholera .
the world body on friday applied for another $ 163 million -lrb- 120 million euros -rrb- in donor aid .
the disease broke out in the northern artibonite region , where it continues to be most concentrated .
it is contracted through contaminated water and causes severe diarrhea and vomiting .
bildunterschrift : the fear is growing that the epidemic will spread to refugee camps authorities and international aid agencies were struggling to contain the latest crisis afflicting the impoverished island nation .
efforts are centering on preventing the disease from spreading in crowded city slums and tent camps that house over 1.3 million homeless people who survived the cataclysmic earthquake , nearly a year ago .
but the facts of the epidemic raise the question of how such a preventable disease could break out in a country that has been flooded with hundreds of millions of euros in foreign assistance since the earthquake .
resource coordination is problem " huge sums in aid money have gone there , but the people in the north seem to have been left to their own devices , " sven stockrahm , a journalist with german newspaper die zeit who wrote about the earthquake , told deutsche welle .
stockrahm stressed that his critical remarks were not aimed at humanitarian aid workers , who by all accounts are doing vital work under very trying circumstances .
the key question is whether a better coordination of the resources in place could have prevented cholera from occurring in the first place .
bildunterschrift : aid workers are working ahrd to meet the needs of growing patient numbers but clear answers are difficult to come by where haiti is concerned .
the causes of cholera , lack of clean drinking water and poor sanitation are well-known , but at present , no one is sure exactly how the disease even broke out in artibonite .
poor sanitation , even pre-earthquake what is certain is that conditions in haiti even before the earthquake were far from adequate .
a study by the world health organization and unicef found that open defecation was prevalent among just under half of rural haitians and that 3.7 million of haiti 's total population of 9 million had no reliable source of clean drinking water .
moreover , from 1990 to 2008 , conditions deteriorated .
a similar study by the united nations in 2009 determined that 42 percent of haitians were not using an " improved water source . "
haiti ranks dead last among countries in south america and the caribbean in all major water and hygiene categories .
" cholera is a sickness of poverty that is common in refugee camps where there ’ s not enough drinking water , " ernst diekmann - a doctor with germany 's society for technical cooperation , or gtz - told deutsche welle .
" haiti was already an underprivileged country , and the situation was exacerbated by the natural catastrophe . "
problem exacerbated by refugees nonetheless , aid workers acknowledge that pre-existing deficiencies and the slow recovery process are two parts of the same overall problem that encouraged the cholera outbreak .
and the issue of earthquake refugees only exacerbates those problems .
bildunterschrift : as the disease spreads , burials are on the rise " the dramatic thing about haiti is that even before the earthquake the health infrastructure was fully inadequate , " said joost butenop , a medical adviser to the aid organization caritas .
" aid organizations have concentrated on the region specifically affected -lsb- by the earthquake -rsb- and have n't been following the refugees to any great extent . "
organizational challenges earlier this year , the humanitarian organization refugees international went even further , claiming that recovery efforts in haiti were not just sluggish , but " paralyzed . "
off the record , many people who work in the aid and assistance sector say that shortcomings in coordination often prevent help from getting where it 's needed - or problems from being effectively anticipated .
that task falls to the united nations and the haitian government , and representatives of the former have openly admitted that the situation in haiti tests their limits .
the will to help is there .
germany 's ministry for economic cooperation and development , for instance , says that most of the 51.4 million euros -lrb- $ 72 million -rrb- it was allocated for haiti has already been distributed or earmarked for future projects .
yet merely distinguishing between emergency needs and long-term developmental requirements , and figuring out which government ministry is responsible , can be a complicated process .
and coordinating the enormous number of private and public organizations trying to help in haiti represents an organizational task of the highest order .
at this point , no one can say definitively whether any particular authority should have foreseen the danger of cholera in haiti and taken precautionary steps to prevent it .
but the outbreak of the disease in a country that has been the focus of so much international assistance suggests that overall organization and coordination remain problems that hinder aid initiatives from having their maximum possible effect .

if vettel appeared calm before the final race in abu dhabi , the 23-year-old german was overcome with emotion afterwards . sebastian vettel cried tears of joy after sunday 's race in abu dhabi , after his team radioed in to tell him he had clinched the world championship , seemingly against all the odds .
" unbelievable .
thank you lads .
i love you , " the 23-year-old german said with a quivering voice from the cockpit .
after that , all you could really make out on the transmission were loud cries of celebration from the man with the glittering helmet .
" baby schumi " was what the german tabloid press once called him , but it was michael schumacher himself who pointed out earlier this year that vettel had outgrown that nickname , and the youngster has now proved beyond any doubt that as world champion , he should stand in nobody 's shadow .
" i did n't know anything until i passed the checkered flag " this world championship is the high point of an already stellar career .
vettel was born in 1987 in the southwestern german town of heppenheim , and his father norbert ensured that sebastian was bitten by the motorsport bug very early .
aged four , vettel first thrashed a go-kart around his parents ' driveway , and his first successes - as with almost all modern racers - followed racing in go-karts in his youth .
eventually , the youngster was noticed , and promoted to the single-seater formula bmw racing series .
as a debutante , vettel was immediately runner-up , and the next year he came back and won an incredible 18 out of 20 races .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel 's tasted champagne as a winner five times in 2010 vettel moved on to formula 3 , where he never managed to claim the grand prize , but that was because his fame was already overtaking him and his rise up the ladder was accelerating .
in 2006 , he was given his first shot in a formula one car in a young driver test , immediately posting the fastest time .
the next year , in indianapolis , an injury to then bmw-sauber driver robert kubica gave vettel his chance on a race weekend .
still in his teens , he promptly became not only the youngest driver to compete in a grand prix -lrb- a record he has since lost -rrb- , but also the youngest-ever points-scorer in the sport 's history - bringing his bmw home in eighth on his debut .
the early-achiever continued tearing up f1 's age-related record book in the following season .
driving for the underfunded toro rosso team , vettel became the youngest ever pole-sitter and then winner in a single wet weekend in monza , doing the double for his minor team as the championship battle raged around him .
two years on , after being promoted to the red bull outfit , vettel has completed his cv , becoming the youngest world champion in the sport 's history , displacing 2008 winner lewis hamilton by less than a year .
" i am a bit speechless .
i do n't know what you are supposed to say at this moment , " a usually loquacious vettel admitted in the post-race press conference .
" to be honest i did n't know anything until i passed the checkered flag . "
vettel not only needed a win , championship leader fernando alonso had to finish fifth or lower for him to win the title , but the spanish ferrari driver had a poor race , and could only salvage seventh .
" i hate losing " bildunterschrift : the youngster 's love of winning is displayed by his trademark index-finger celebration vettel - never one to aim low - points to the three michaels as heroes of his childhood : michael schumacher , michael jordan and michael jackson .
vettel even dreamed of becoming a musician as a kid .
" it was funny when i finally realized that i did n't have the voice for it , " he admitted in later life .
nevertheless , vettel 's passion remained - he 's a huge beatles fan and record collector to this day .
vettel also tried out a number of sports in his youth before settling on motor racing .
" i never scored many goals , and did n't even get called on to play that often , " vettel lamented , recalling his time on the football pitch .
he also tried tennis , table tennis , and even beach volleyball , but never settled for long .
" i was just never the best , so i stopped playing .
i hate losing . "
finally , vettel started following in the first michael 's footsteps more seriously , turning his attention to racing – a sport whose ethos he seems to enjoy .
" it 's irrelevant whether you 're second or fifth .
the only important thing is being no. 1 . "
with 10 pole positions , five wins , and now a world championship in 2010 , vettel has achieved that goal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 15.11.2010 ireland is still sidestepping what experts say is inevitable : a bailout großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plenty of irish voters are n't happy these days will ireland accept a bailout and help reverse a bond sell-off among the eurozone 's deficit-laden nations ?
the country is still refusing but so did greece before it bowed to pressure . speculation is rife about ireland 's course of action , as the country 's borrowing costs last week shot to record highs on concerns of a deficit set to hit 32 percent of gross domestic product this year .
monday kicked off with a report in the irish independent newspaper claiming that at a meeting of eurozone finance ministers this week , ireland plans to ask for money from the european union 's emergency fund to rescue its banks .
prompt denial an irish minister promptly fired off a denial about the country being in direct discussions about a bailout package from the european union .
while acknowledging that ireland is in " continuous talks " with the eu about its growing debt , dick roche , junior minister for european affairs , told newstalk radio that it is " frankly wrong and grossly irresponsible that this story is being said and that a frenzy is being created out there . "
the opposition claimed europe had already started moves to rescue the country , but the irish government denied it would need a bailout .
" ireland has made no application for external support , " a finance ministry spokesman said .
" ongoing contacts continue at official level with international colleagues in light of current market conditions . "
the rumor mill is almost certain to continue with every new day of uncertainty confronting irish banks .
at the end of last month , they owed 130 billion euros -lrb- $ 177 billion -rrb- of outstanding european central bank loans , up from 119 billion euros a month earlier .
numbers being floated around as part of a bailout deal range between 50 and 77 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment in ireland has soared to 13.2 percent the eu is reported to be keen for ireland to accept aid to avert a greek-style scenario in which budget problems in one country plunge the entire eurozone into crisis .
on monday , european central bank council member miguel angel fernandez ordonez prodded ireland to make a " final decision " on its fiscal crisis in a move to calm markets .
" the situation in the markets in recent weeks has been very negative due in some way to the lack of a final decision by ireland , " he told reporters in madrid .
" it 's not me who should take a decision about ireland ; it 's ireland that should take the right decision at the right moment . "
but the clock is ticking .
" i think ireland can hold out another three to four months maximum , and it should , hoping that some positive surprise on growth might calm the markets , " unicredit group chief economist marco annunziata told deutsche welle .
" but investors will remain nervous until the question is settled of whether or not eurozone sovereign debts might be restructured . "
stability program on track another european expert , who asked not to be identified , said the european finance ministers could reach a decision as early as this week to funnel funds to irish banks .
" these funds , which would help stabilize the banks , would be seen as a limited intervention , " the expert said .
there is no question about ireland 's sovereign debt , the expert added : the irish government has no immediate need for cash , being fully funded until mid-2011 , and its stability program is on track bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish banks owe billions to the european central bank germany has also pressed for ireland to accept aid , insiders say .
allaying investor concerns about irish finances would help advance chancellor angela merkel 's plan to require investors to help pay for future rescues .
european leaders , however , remain divided on merkel 's proposal , as they do on whether the ecb should keep buying bonds of debt-laden countries .
ireland 's debt problems stem largely from the country 's popped real estate bubble , when its local banks lent money too freely for construction projects .
on top of that was the irish government 's decision to provide a blanket guarantee to all bank creditors .
as a result , the country has experienced the worst recession of any major economy .
it has amassed debt of more than 100 billion euros and is struggling with an unemployment rate of 13.2 percent .
tough fiscal conditions a rescue plan would be deeply unpopular with irish voters , who value national independence and the low-tax regime that lured in foreign investment from u.s. and other non-european companies , fueling high growth rates over the past 20 years .
indeed , an eu bailout , with tough fiscal conditions attached , would be humiliating for a country once celebrated for its rags-to-riches transformation .
not unsurprisingly , critics of ireland 's action plan – or lack thereof – are wary of the country 's every move .
karel lannoo , chief executive officer of the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- in brussels , says the country should have acted long ago to steer clear of the financial challenges it now faces .
" ireland should never have given blanket coverage to banks in the first place , " lannoo told deutsche welle .
" and it should have let some of the banks fail . "
lannoo now questions the repercussions for europe .
" how many more of these financial disasters can we have ? " he asked .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de formula one -pipe- 15.11.2010 opinion : vettel a worthy and well-deserving champ großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with sebasitan vettel 's first formula one drivers title , germany can celebrate a new world champion .
deutsche welle 's sports writer arnulf boettcher provides his take on germany 's new sports hero . germany has a new sports hero : sebastian vettel , the youngest world champion in formula one history .
born in the south-western german town of heppenheim , vettel wears the formula one crown at just 23 years old - and surely not for the last time .
germany 's other formula one world-champion , michael schumacher , was 25 when he won his first of a record seven titles .
like schumacher , vettel is known for his meticulousness and obsession over detail .
but unlike his role model schumacher , vettel does n't come across as so serious .
instead , vettel is seen as quick-witted , youthfully mischievous , and almost always smiling .
that 's what makes him so likeable on the formula one scene .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arnulf boettcher vettel almost become world champion last year .
he was held back by technical problems with his red bull car , but hasty mistakes were part of the problem , too .
he narrowly escaped meeting the same fate again this year .
but the setbacks only appear to have made him stronger .
in the decisive race , he took first place and made no mistakes in a dominating race where he was the best driver among his competitors .
ten pole positions and five victories make vettel a worthy and well-deserving champion .
fernando alonso is left pondering what might have been as his ferrari team implemented the wrong strategy in the final race in abu dhabi .
as for his title chances , alonso benefitted from an illegal team order : his ferrari teammate felipe massa was leading at the hockenheim race , but was ordered to let alonso through , securing an extra seven points for the spaniard .
red bull , on the other hand , did not issue team orders in the 2010 season and earned great respect from all sides .
vettel benefitted from the new points system that made formula one decidedly more exciting .
five drivers were in contention for the title heading into the second-to-last race , and for the final event four were still in the running .
in the end , vettel triumphed , after coming into the race in third place 15 points behind and without having even occupied top spot .
now germany can relish a world-title fairy tale and a youthful world champion .
but any expectations that vettel could someday overtake michael schumacher as the record world champion are misguided .
formula one has become much too fast-paced , and five different champions in the last five years speak for themselves .

dw-world.de forget ' baby schumi , ' now sebastian vettel is world champion sebastian vettel has become the youngest world champion in the history of formula one .
if vettel appeared calm before the final race in abu dhabi , the 23-year-old german was overcome with emotion afterwards .
-lrb- 15.11.2010 -rrb- sebastian vettel races to formula one world championship german formula one driver sebastian vettel has become the sport 's youngest champion after winning the abu dhabi grand prix .
the perfectly executed race caps a successful season for vettel and his red bull team .
-lrb- 14.11.2010 -rrb- vettel remains dark horse in season that should have been his sebastian vettel is one of four drivers with a shot at the formula one drivers ' championship in abu dhabi .
but not even victory on sunday would guarantee success , in a season the young german might have dominated .

after an eventful journey , dw reporter ali almakhlafi has reached mecca , and started answering dw users ' questions .
but first - a sudden change of clothes . on sunday , nov .
14 , the moment had come : two million pilgrims from all around the world , and i was right there in the middle of them .
i visited the holy al-haram mosque , and saw the kaaba at its center .
i 've got to admit it : i was completely mesmerized .
there is really such a big difference between seeing it in pictures or reading about it in articles , and actually standing in front of it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 100,000 security forces are there to protect some 2 million pilgrims i 've been to cologne cathedral , the vatican , and the hagia sophia in istanbul before .
but the kaaba is special to me .
childhood memories of religion class in yemen come up - and somehow things seem to have come full circle .
originally , i arrived with a group of pilgrims , but i lost them in the crowd .
never mind , i say to myself ; it 's good to be alone , for i first need to digest this experience by myself .
despite the kaaba 's deep impact on me , i 'm still here as a journalist .
well , as a journalist that looks like a pilgrim .
and just how did that come about ?
let me tell you .
after facing some unexpected problems , i decided to change my polo shirt and jeans for the pilgrim 's robes .
i decided i do n't want to be recognized as a visitor anymore .
i 've had enough trouble with that already .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt airport : pilgrims , saudis , and foreigners heading to jeddah in saudi arabia you really feel misplaced among the masses of muslim pilgrims if you are smooth-shaven and casually-dressed .
in fact , i 've felt like this since i left frankfurt airport : the other passengers gave me startled looks .
and at the check-in counter of saudi airlines , none of the employees expected me to have the special hajj-visa in my passport .
pilgrims need to get special luggage stickers , so that their cases arrive on the separate hajj terminal at jeddah airport .
well , i got the stickers and my luggage arrived at the right terminal as well .
but i did n't .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american movies with arabic subtitles are shown on the airplane after my flight , i found myself at the terminal for non-pilgrims .
the employees at jeddah airport had sent me there because of my " civilian " getup .
there i was – surrounded by international tourists and business people .
after more than an hour of confusion , i finally got the last shuttle bus to the proper terminal at around midnight .
i was the only passenger … or , the only one who was late .
an american in mecca that could n't have happened to jack -lrb- name changed -rrb- .
jack is american .
he converted to islam a few years ago .
we first meet at frankfurt airport .
i ask him about his white hajj-clothes .
i want to know how he feels in this outfit .
after all , most people from the west would only wear clothes like that to a costume party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stewardess with a modern interpretation of a traditional headscarf " this probably looks funny to some of the people here , i guess , " says jack .
" i can tell by their looks . "
but jack does n't care .
" the hajj-outfit is meant to be simple and modest .
it reveals that religious beliefs do n't distinguish between rich and poor , black and white , etc . "
jack makes his comments as a muslim , but the way he says them , with his typical american accent , it almost sounds more like an american ideal .
flying , shopping , watching cnn aboard my plane to jeddah , i make some more interesting observations .
for example : most pilgrims watch cnn .
some of them even watch american movies .
however , the movies ' love scenes are carefully retouched , even though they are rather harmless from a western point of view .
the stewardesses wear headscarves and speak english – even with the arab passengers .
and many of the bearded men , who first appeared to be rather strict , conservative , and humorless , turn out to be very friendly family men .
they play happily with their kids and advise their loosely veiled wives on what makeup to buy from the choice of duty free products .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hajj terminal at jeddah airport : 2 million people arrive here - with their luggage before i finally put on my new pilgrim 's outfit , i first want to thank all the dw users for commenting on my first diary entries on the english , german , and arabic dw facebook pages - and for wishing me a safe trip .
i would like to reply to a question posted by hans youssef ernst from germany on the arabic page : " i 'm a christian and i would like to accompany my muslim friends to religious feasts in mecca some day .
do you think that this will be possible in the future ? "
dear hans youssef , i do n't dare to try and make a forecast .
as far as i know , the koran does n't explicitly state that non-muslims are n't allowed to visit mecca - but , as always , this is a matter of interpretation .
from a saudi perspective , non-muslims are definitely not allowed to visit the holy sites of mecca .
as an islamic scholar told me here in mecca : " that should be accepted , just like western constitutions need to be accepted by muslims living in europe .
by no means , however , you should mistake this as a sign of a lack respect or even contempt for non-muslims . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw reporter ali almakhlafi can move on after a short delay among islamic scholars , you can find different opinions about this topic .
there 's even a prominent politician who strongly criticizes the current prohibition : libya 's muammar al-gaddafi – who 's clearly not known to be a good friend of the western world .
five years ago , gaddafi asked for christians and jews to be allowed to visit mecca .
however , so far nothing changed … this monday , november 15 , i want to experience the pilgrim 's prayers at mount arafat and i will then attend the feast of sacrifice at mina .
i 've already collected quite a number of voices from other pilgrims .
i 'll tell you more about them in my next diary entry .

after an eventful journey , dw reporter ali almakhlafi has reached mecca , and started answering dw users ' questions .
but first - a sudden change of clothes . on sunday , nov .
14 , the moment had come : two million pilgrims from all around the world , and i was right there in the middle of them .
i visited the holy al-haram mosque , and saw the kaaba at its center .
i 've got to admit it : i was completely mesmerized .
there is really such a big difference between seeing it in pictures or reading about it in articles , and actually standing in front of it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 100,000 security forces are there to protect some 2 million pilgrims i 've been to cologne cathedral , the vatican , and the hagia sophia in istanbul before .
but the kaaba is special to me .
childhood memories of religion class in yemen come up - and somehow things seem to have come full circle .
originally , i arrived with a group of pilgrims , but i lost them in the crowd .
never mind , i say to myself ; it 's good to be alone , for i first need to digest this experience by myself .
despite the kaaba 's deep impact on me , i 'm still here as a journalist .
well , as a journalist that looks like a pilgrim .
and just how did that come about ?
let me tell you .
after facing some unexpected problems , i decided to change my polo shirt and jeans for the pilgrim 's robes .
i decided i do n't want to be recognized as a visitor anymore .
i 've had enough trouble with that already .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt airport : pilgrims , saudis , and foreigners heading to jeddah in saudi arabia you really feel misplaced among the masses of muslim pilgrims if you are smooth-shaven and casually-dressed .
in fact , i 've felt like this since i left frankfurt airport : the other passengers gave me startled looks .
and at the check-in counter of saudi airlines , none of the employees expected me to have the special hajj-visa in my passport .
pilgrims need to get special luggage stickers , so that their cases arrive on the separate hajj terminal at jeddah airport .
well , i got the stickers and my luggage arrived at the right terminal as well .
but i did n't .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american movies with arabic subtitles are shown on the airplane after my flight , i found myself at the terminal for non-pilgrims .
the employees at jeddah airport had sent me there because of my " civilian " getup .
there i was – surrounded by international tourists and business people .
after more than an hour of confusion , i finally got the last shuttle bus to the proper terminal at around midnight .
i was the only passenger … or , the only one who was late .
an american in mecca that could n't have happened to jack -lrb- name changed -rrb- .
jack is american .
he converted to islam a few years ago .
we first meet at frankfurt airport .
i ask him about his white hajj-clothes .
i want to know how he feels in this outfit .
after all , most people from the west would only wear clothes like that to a costume party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stewardess with a modern interpretation of a traditional headscarf " this probably looks funny to some of the people here , i guess , " says jack .
" i can tell by their looks . "
but jack does n't care .
" the hajj-outfit is meant to be simple and modest .
it reveals that religious beliefs do n't distinguish between rich and poor , black and white , etc . "
jack makes his comments as a muslim , but the way he says them , with his typical american accent , it almost sounds more like an american ideal .
flying , shopping , watching cnn aboard my plane to jeddah , i make some more interesting observations .
for example : most pilgrims watch cnn .
some of them even watch american movies .
however , the movies ' love scenes are carefully retouched , even though they are rather harmless from a western point of view .
the stewardesses wear headscarves and speak english – even with the arab passengers .
and many of the bearded men , who first appeared to be rather strict , conservative , and humorless , turn out to be very friendly family men .
they play happily with their kids and advise their loosely veiled wives on what makeup to buy from the choice of duty free products .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hajj terminal at jeddah airport : 2 million people arrive here - with their luggage before i finally put on my new pilgrim 's outfit , i first want to thank all the dw users for commenting on my first diary entries on the english , german , and arabic dw facebook pages - and for wishing me a safe trip .
i would like to reply to a question posted by hans youssef ernst from germany on the arabic page : " i 'm a christian and i would like to accompany my muslim friends to religious feasts in mecca some day .
do you think that this will be possible in the future ? "
dear hans youssef , i do n't dare to try and make a forecast .
as far as i know , the koran does n't explicitly state that non-muslims are n't allowed to visit mecca - but , as always , this is a matter of interpretation .
from a saudi perspective , non-muslims are definitely not allowed to visit the holy sites of mecca .
as an islamic scholar told me here in mecca : " that should be accepted , just like western constitutions need to be accepted by muslims living in europe .
by no means , however , you should mistake this as a sign of a lack respect or even contempt for non-muslims . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw reporter ali almakhlafi can move on after a short delay among islamic scholars , you can find different opinions about this topic .
there 's even a prominent politician who strongly criticizes the current prohibition : libya 's muammar al-gaddafi – who 's clearly not known to be a good friend of the western world .
five years ago , gaddafi asked for christians and jews to be allowed to visit mecca .
however , so far nothing changed … this monday , november 15 , i want to experience the pilgrim 's prayers at mount arafat and i will then attend the feast of sacrifice at mina .
i 've already collected quite a number of voices from other pilgrims .
i 'll tell you more about them in my next diary entry .

in order to secure its national interests , moscow must manage a tricky balancing act between the west and the east . flush with cash from booming oil and gas exports , moscow unilaterally pursued russian national interests during vladimir putin 's tenure as president .
in the process , russia 's relationship with the west deteriorated to a historic low point . but then the economic crisis hit .
energy prices collapsed and russia 's rapid growth ground to a halt . after dmitry medvedev assumed the presidency in 2008 , moscow sought to jumpstart the slumping russian economy through so-called " modernization alliances " with the us and the eu .
yet at the same time , the oil-rich country began consolidating its " strategic partnership " with an oil-hungry china .
russia wanted to pursue its national interests in economic modernization and growth and knew that it needed both the west and china in these endeavors . love-hate relationship moscow 's relationship with the west has a long history of ambivalence .
culturally tied to europe , yet also influenced by asia , russia sits awkwardly between two worlds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's relationship with the west deteriorated as nato expanded eastward " the russians do see themselves more as a part of western civilization , " andrew kuchins , director of the russia and eurasia program at the center for strategic and international studies , told deutsche welle .
" they are eurasian , a power bordering europe as well as the pacific ocean .
but the bulk of the population is in european russia . " with the collapse of the soviet union , moscow seemed to have taken a step toward definitively joining the west .
president boris yeltsin implemented a series of radical reforms designed to put russia 's political and economic system in synch with its former cold war enemies . but as the european union and nato rapidly expanded into the former eastern bloc , moscow felt marginalized in its own " near abroad . "
then vladimir putin came to power .
buoyed by surging oil and gas exports , putin sought to stabilize russia domestically and reassert its influence in the former soviet states . the developments put the west and russia on a collision course .
in the summer of 2008 , they finally collided in the south caucasus .
russia fought a lightening-quick war against georgia , a former soviet republic that has increasingly looked westward .
in response to the conflict , nato severed cooperation with moscow .
but according to dmitri trenin , director of the carnegie moscow center , the west also played a key role in the dispute . " it takes everyone who 's involved to organize a better framework for relations , " trenin told deutsche welle .
" the western policy that included some countries into western institutions and left others such as russia , but also georgia and ukraine beyond the perimeter was very risky .
that policy is responsible for the russian-georgian war . " pushing the reset button power changed hands in moscow and washington in quick succession , bringing new leaders and a new outlook on russia 's relationship with the west .
us president barack obama and medvedev saw an opportunity to focus on cooperation instead of confrontation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and russia are now cooperating on common interests " president medvedev knows that the modernization of the economy and russian society can not be executed without cooperation with the west , " alexander rahr , director of the russia and eurasia program at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle . he said us president obama did n't want to pursue a policy of containment against russia . " he needs russia in the fight against international terrorism in afghanistan and iraq , and he needs russian support to stop iran 's nuclear weapons program , " rahr said . as russian and western interests align , both sides have hinted at moving beyond a quid-pro-quo relationship and bringing moscow into a deeper security partnership .
in the lead up to the nato summit later this month in lisbon , secretary general anders fogh rasmussen has pushed the idea of including russia in a missile defense shield that would stretch from vancouver to vladivostok . " what russia and other countries in europe and north america need to work toward is a euro-atlantic security community , " trenin said .
" we 're not talking about alliances .
we 're not talking about russia joining nato .
we 're not talking about simply more of the same upgrades of russia 's relations with nato .
what we should be working toward is a state of play in the euro-atlantic area where war would not be an instrument of policy . " eastern horizon but a euro-atlantic security community is not the only game in town .
russia is hedging its bets and forging a strategic partnership with china , as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's economic growth is both an opportunity and a concern for russia " china is second only to the us in terms of countries that weigh in on the russian strategic mind , " trenin said .
" it is immensely important . " china 's meteoric growth has made it the world 's largest energy consumer .
russia in turn is one of the world 's largest energy producers and is therefore well-positioned to fuel china 's economy . the first pipeline connecting russian oil fields and chinese refineries was completed last september .
it delivers oil from eastern siberia to northeastern china .
moscow and beijing are also working together within the shanghai cooperation organization , a loose security partnership designed to combat threats such as separatism , terrorism and extremism . on the international stage , russia and china share a similar worldview .
they both prioritize national sovereignty and the pursuit of national interests over liberal values , such as democracy and human rights .
yet like russia 's relationship with the west , its growing ties with china face challenges . " there has always been this certain degree of unease despite all the happy talk and positive rhetoric of russia and china , " kuchins said .
china 's rapid growth made the russians nervous , he said . " the impact of the -lrb- economic -rrb- crisis was sort of an acceleration of that trend , " kuchins said .
" it leads them to question just how much the growth of chinese power is good for russian interests . " independence or isolation ? as russia simultaneously pursues partnerships with the west and china , it also wants to maintain its status as an independent power .
moscow has constructed a network of institutions to keep the former soviet states within its sphere of influence .
the commonwealth of independent states , the collective security treaty organization and the eurasian economic community could act as pillars of eurasian integration . " the default russian position is that they would like to be this great superpower , " kuchins said .
" there would be the west , russia and china .
but the reality suggests that 's not looking to be the case .
that forces them to possibly make some harder decisions about just how far they want to push this so-called independent foreign policy . " russia needs the west for economic modernization , and china presents a lucrative energy market .
yet moving too far too fast in either direction , or striking out on an independent path , could lead to moscow 's isolation . as a eurasian power , russia has little choice but to strike a balance in its relations with the east and the west . " we have to prepare ourselves for the reality that russia would like to integrate one leg in europe and the other in asia , " rahr said .
" if not integration , then it would like to at least work closely with the states of europe and asia . " author : spencer kimball editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia wanted to pursue its national interests in economic modernization and growth and knew that it needed both the west and china in these endeavors . love-hate relationship moscow 's relationship with the west has a long history of ambivalence .
culturally tied to europe , yet also influenced by asia , russia sits awkwardly between two worlds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's relationship with the west deteriorated as nato expanded eastward " the russians do see themselves more as a part of western civilization , " andrew kuchins , director of the russia and eurasia program at the center for strategic and international studies , told deutsche welle .
" they are eurasian , a power bordering europe as well as the pacific ocean .
but the bulk of the population is in european russia . " with the collapse of the soviet union , moscow seemed to have taken a step toward definitively joining the west .
president boris yeltsin implemented a series of radical reforms designed to put russia 's political and economic system in synch with its former cold war enemies . but as the european union and nato rapidly expanded into the former eastern bloc , moscow felt marginalized in its own " near abroad . "
then vladimir putin came to power .
buoyed by surging oil and gas exports , putin sought to stabilize russia domestically and reassert its influence in the former soviet states . the developments put the west and russia on a collision course .
in the summer of 2008 , they finally collided in the south caucasus .
russia fought a lightening-quick war against georgia , a former soviet republic that has increasingly looked westward .
in response to the conflict , nato severed cooperation with moscow .
but according to dmitri trenin , director of the carnegie moscow center , the west also played a key role in the dispute . " it takes everyone who 's involved to organize a better framework for relations , " trenin told deutsche welle .
" the western policy that included some countries into western institutions and left others such as russia , but also georgia and ukraine beyond the perimeter was very risky .
that policy is responsible for the russian-georgian war . " pushing the reset button power changed hands in moscow and washington in quick succession , bringing new leaders and a new outlook on russia 's relationship with the west .
us president barack obama and medvedev saw an opportunity to focus on cooperation instead of confrontation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and russia are now cooperating on common interests " president medvedev knows that the modernization of the economy and russian society can not be executed without cooperation with the west , " alexander rahr , director of the russia and eurasia program at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle . he said us president obama did n't want to pursue a policy of containment against russia . " he needs russia in the fight against international terrorism in afghanistan and iraq , and he needs russian support to stop iran 's nuclear weapons program , " rahr said . as russian and western interests align , both sides have hinted at moving beyond a quid-pro-quo relationship and bringing moscow into a deeper security partnership .
in the lead up to the nato summit later this month in lisbon , secretary general anders fogh rasmussen has pushed the idea of including russia in a missile defense shield that would stretch from vancouver to vladivostok . " what russia and other countries in europe and north america need to work toward is a euro-atlantic security community , " trenin said .
" we 're not talking about alliances .
we 're not talking about russia joining nato .
we 're not talking about simply more of the same upgrades of russia 's relations with nato .
what we should be working toward is a state of play in the euro-atlantic area where war would not be an instrument of policy . " eastern horizon but a euro-atlantic security community is not the only game in town .
russia is hedging its bets and forging a strategic partnership with china , as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's economic growth is both an opportunity and a concern for russia " china is second only to the us in terms of countries that weigh in on the russian strategic mind , " trenin said .
" it is immensely important . " china 's meteoric growth has made it the world 's largest energy consumer .
russia in turn is one of the world 's largest energy producers and is therefore well-positioned to fuel china 's economy . the first pipeline connecting russian oil fields and chinese refineries was completed last september .
it delivers oil from eastern siberia to northeastern china .
moscow and beijing are also working together within the shanghai cooperation organization , a loose security partnership designed to combat threats such as separatism , terrorism and extremism . on the international stage , russia and china share a similar worldview .
they both prioritize national sovereignty and the pursuit of national interests over liberal values , such as democracy and human rights .
yet like russia 's relationship with the west , its growing ties with china face challenges . " there has always been this certain degree of unease despite all the happy talk and positive rhetoric of russia and china , " kuchins said .
china 's rapid growth made the russians nervous , he said . " the impact of the -lrb- economic -rrb- crisis was sort of an acceleration of that trend , " kuchins said .
" it leads them to question just how much the growth of chinese power is good for russian interests . " independence or isolation ? as russia simultaneously pursues partnerships with the west and china , it also wants to maintain its status as an independent power .
moscow has constructed a network of institutions to keep the former soviet states within its sphere of influence .
the commonwealth of independent states , the collective security treaty organization and the eurasian economic community could act as pillars of eurasian integration . " the default russian position is that they would like to be this great superpower , " kuchins said .
" there would be the west , russia and china .
but the reality suggests that 's not looking to be the case .
that forces them to possibly make some harder decisions about just how far they want to push this so-called independent foreign policy . " russia needs the west for economic modernization , and china presents a lucrative energy market .
yet moving too far too fast in either direction , or striking out on an independent path , could lead to moscow 's isolation . as a eurasian power , russia has little choice but to strike a balance in its relations with the east and the west .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de motor racing -pipe- 15.11.2010 forget ' baby schumi , ' now sebastian vettel is world champion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not just a champion , but the youngest in f1 history sebastian vettel has become the youngest world champion in the history of formula one .
if vettel appeared calm before the final race in abu dhabi , the 23-year-old german was overcome with emotion afterwards . sebastian vettel cried tears of joy after sunday 's race in abu dhabi , after his team radioed in to tell him he had clinched the world championship , seemingly against all the odds .
" unbelievable .
thank you lads .
i love you , " the 23-year-old german said with a quivering voice from the cockpit .
after that , all you could really make out on the transmission were loud cries of celebration from the man with the glittering helmet .
" baby schumi " was what the german tabloid press once called him , but it was michael schumacher himself who pointed out earlier this year that vettel had outgrown that nickname , and the youngster has now proved beyond any doubt that as world champion , he should stand in nobody 's shadow .
" i did n't know anything until i passed the checkered flag " this world championship is the high point of an already stellar career .
vettel was born in 1987 in the southwestern german town of heppenheim , and his father norbert ensured that sebastian was bitten by the motorsport bug very early .
aged four , vettel first thrashed a go-kart around his parents ' driveway , and his first successes - as with almost all modern racers - followed racing in go-karts in his youth .
eventually , the youngster was noticed , and promoted to the single-seater formula bmw racing series .
as a debutante , vettel was immediately runner-up , and the next year he came back and won an incredible 18 out of 20 races .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel 's tasted champagne as a winner five times in 2010 vettel moved on to formula 3 , where he never managed to claim the grand prize , but that was because his fame was already overtaking him and his rise up the ladder was accelerating .
in 2006 , he was given his first shot in a formula one car in a young driver test , immediately posting the fastest time .
the next year , in indianapolis , an injury to then bmw-sauber driver robert kubica gave vettel his chance on a race weekend .
still in his teens , he promptly became not only the youngest driver to compete in a grand prix -lrb- a record he has since lost -rrb- , but also the youngest-ever points-scorer in the sport 's history - bringing his bmw home in eighth on his debut .
the early-achiever continued tearing up f1 's age-related record book in the following season .
driving for the underfunded toro rosso team , vettel became the youngest ever pole-sitter and then winner in a single wet weekend in monza , doing the double for his minor team as the championship battle raged around him .
two years on , after being promoted to the red bull outfit , vettel has completed his cv , becoming the youngest world champion in the sport 's history , displacing 2008 winner lewis hamilton by less than a year .
" i am a bit speechless .
i do n't know what you are supposed to say at this moment , " a usually loquacious vettel admitted in the post-race press conference .
" to be honest i did n't know anything until i passed the checkered flag . "
vettel not only needed a win , championship leader fernando alonso had to finish fifth or lower for him to win the title , but the spanish ferrari driver had a poor race , and could only salvage seventh .
" i hate losing " bildunterschrift : the youngster 's love of winning is displayed by his trademark index-finger celebration vettel - never one to aim low - points to the three michaels as heroes of his childhood : michael schumacher , michael jordan and michael jackson .
vettel even dreamed of becoming a musician as a kid .
" it was funny when i finally realized that i did n't have the voice for it , " he admitted in later life .
nevertheless , vettel 's passion remained - he 's a huge beatles fan and record collector to this day .
vettel also tried out a number of sports in his youth before settling on motor racing .
" i never scored many goals , and did n't even get called on to play that often , " vettel lamented , recalling his time on the football pitch .
he also tried tennis , table tennis , and even beach volleyball , but never settled for long .
" i was just never the best , so i stopped playing .
i hate losing . "
finally , vettel started following in the first michael 's footsteps more seriously , turning his attention to racing – a sport whose ethos he seems to enjoy .
" it 's irrelevant whether you 're second or fifth .
the only important thing is being no. 1 . "
with 10 pole positions , five wins , and now a world championship in 2010 , vettel has achieved that goal .

he talked to deutsche welle about the ups and downs of trying to come back . before there was sami khedira , there was simon rolfes .
the 28-year-old midfielder was originally the one tipped to take over the stopper role from ageing veteran michael ballack .
but a meniscus injury in july 2009 ultimately stopped rolfes in his tracks just as he was reaching the peak of his career .
rolfes played through pain that fall .
after all , his club , bayer leverkusen , was topping the table , and he had established himself as a regular in the german national side .
but by october he had developed articular cartilage damage and had no option but to have an operation .
the problems did n't go away , and he was forced to go under the knife again in january and acknowledge that his dream of competing in south africa was over .
“ we were on a sensational run with leverkusen and topping the table at the winter break , ” rolfes told deutsche welle .
“ my plan was to come back in the second half of the season and be a full part of the team , since the games i had played that season had been the best of my career .
so , of course , the weeks following the january operation were really hard .
i realized i was n't going to play any role at all either in the bundesliga season or the world cup . ”
a slow but steady developer , rolfes had become an international caliber midfielder .
now he was forced to watch khedira take on a role in the german squad that he himself would have probably occupied , had he not been hurt .
khedira performed well in south africa and landed a deal with real madrid .
meanwhile , rolfes was just trying to regain his basic fitness .
daily drudgery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolfes had been getting regular starts for germany in one respect , rolfes has been lucky .

“ it takes time to accept and start looking forward again , ” rolfes said .
“ after the operation i was on crutches for eight weeks … and it hardly a lot of fun to lie around at home , exercising your leg or knee with a machine for six hours a day and watching your muscles virtually disappear . ”
rolfes also said that when he was able to work out with a football again , it was hard at first to commit to challenges .
overcoming fear , he said , came gradually as he got used to playing scrimmages in training sessions .
“ it 's such a long process , and in the beginning you ca n't imagine yourself being on the pitch again , ” rolfes remembered .
“ but step for step , they bring you along , and then at some point it 's over .
you get your confidence back in practice . ”
practice , in this case , does n't make perfect .
it gives a player the chance to regain what he 's lost .

last month , he scored a pair of goals to help leverkusen beat wolfsburg , even though he only came on as a late substitute .
and perhaps more encouragingly , he 's played for a full 90 minutes in his last two games .
he also provided the assist for leverkusen 's lone goal in their win agaist st. pauli on the weekend , which took the team up to second in the bundesliga standings .
but will he ever be able to recapture the status he once had with germany head coach joachim loew ?
competition for spots in the midfield is fierce , with not even nominal team captain michael ballack being assured of making the squad .
rolfes draws hope from the very vagaries of football that put him out of commission for much of 2009 and 2010 .
“ a year ago , no one would have thought that bastian schweinsteiger and sami khedira would be the central midfielders at the world cup , ” rolfes said .
“ and likewise , no one knows what 's going to happen in two or three years ' time .
there 's always the possibility of injuries and other circumstances .
so you should n't concentrate on whether it 's difficult or not . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 15.11.2010 leverkusen midfielder rolfes hopes injury nightmare is finally over großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolfes is a big physical player with a good passing eye a succession of knee injuries meant simon rolfes missed the 2010 world cup - a nearly worst-case scenario for any footballer .
he talked to deutsche welle about the ups and downs of trying to come back . before there was sami khedira , there was simon rolfes .
the 28-year-old midfielder was originally the one tipped to take over the stopper role from ageing veteran michael ballack .
but a meniscus injury in july 2009 ultimately stopped rolfes in his tracks just as he was reaching the peak of his career .
rolfes played through pain that fall .
after all , his club , bayer leverkusen , was topping the table , and he had established himself as a regular in the german national side .
but by october he had developed articular cartilage damage and had no option but to have an operation .
the problems did n't go away , and he was forced to go under the knife again in january and acknowledge that his dream of competing in south africa was over .
“ we were on a sensational run with leverkusen and topping the table at the winter break , ” rolfes told deutsche welle .
“ my plan was to come back in the second half of the season and be a full part of the team , since the games i had played that season had been the best of my career .
so , of course , the weeks following the january operation were really hard .
i realized i was n't going to play any role at all either in the bundesliga season or the world cup . ”
a slow but steady developer , rolfes had become an international caliber midfielder .
now he was forced to watch khedira take on a role in the german squad that he himself would have probably occupied , had he not been hurt .
khedira performed well in south africa and landed a deal with real madrid .
meanwhile , rolfes was just trying to regain his basic fitness .
daily drudgery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolfes had been getting regular starts for germany in one respect , rolfes has been lucky .
the injuries he suffered have ended many a footballer 's career .
but rehab work , to hear him describe it , is a total slog , and it is difficult for a top athlete to acknowledge that , through no fault of one 's own , one is not at the level one was just a few months before .
“ it takes time to accept and start looking forward again , ” rolfes said .
“ after the operation i was on crutches for eight weeks … and it hardly a lot of fun to lie around at home , exercising your leg or knee with a machine for six hours a day and watching your muscles virtually disappear . ”
rolfes also said that when he was able to work out with a football again , it was hard at first to commit to challenges .
overcoming fear , he said , came gradually as he got used to playing scrimmages in training sessions .
“ it 's such a long process , and in the beginning you ca n't imagine yourself being on the pitch again , ” rolfes remembered .
“ but step for step , they bring you along , and then at some point it 's over .
you get your confidence back in practice . ”
practice , in this case , does n't make perfect .
it gives a player the chance to regain what he 's lost .
positive outlook bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coming back from a knee injury takes lots of hard , boring work rolfes made his bundesliga comeback in late september , and so far , he 's been pretty good .
last month , he scored a pair of goals to help leverkusen beat wolfsburg , even though he only came on as a late substitute .
and perhaps more encouragingly , he 's played for a full 90 minutes in his last two games .
he also provided the assist for leverkusen 's lone goal in their win agaist st. pauli on the weekend , which took the team up to second in the bundesliga standings .
but will he ever be able to recapture the status he once had with germany head coach joachim loew ?
competition for spots in the midfield is fierce , with not even nominal team captain michael ballack being assured of making the squad .
rolfes draws hope from the very vagaries of football that put him out of commission for much of 2009 and 2010 .
“ a year ago , no one would have thought that bastian schweinsteiger and sami khedira would be the central midfielders at the world cup , ” rolfes said .
“ and likewise , no one knows what 's going to happen in two or three years ' time .
there 's always the possibility of injuries and other circumstances .
so you should n't concentrate on whether it 's difficult or not . ”
and rolfes does n't need to look far to find an example of hope .
his teammate at leverkusen , striker patrick helmes , was also knocked out of germany 's world cup squad by an injury , but has gotten a call-up to play in the nationalelf 's friendly against sweden this coming wednesday .
so even though rolfes has dropped off the radar screen of many casual germany fans , it would n't be all that surprising to find him on the plane when yogi and co. travel to euro 2012 in poland and ukraine , or even the 2014 world cup in brazil .
simon rolfes was interviewed by kamilla jarzina for dw-tv 's bundesliga kick off program .

the filter , about the size and shape of a teabag , would be inexpensive , easy to distribute and simple to use . marelize botes is conducting a final set of tests on a new type of diminutive water filter before industrial production can begin .
the microbiologist pours water from a plastic bottle though a high-tech , teabag-sized filter before analyzing it in her in her laboratory at the university of stellenbosch in south africa . " the filter is much cheaper than bottled water as well as any other filter on the market , " she told deutsche welle . instead of being filled with black or green tea , the bag contains active carbon granules and is made from nanofibers treated with biocide , which kills bacteria rather than simply filtering them from the water . nanotech for pennies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting clean drinking water everywhere is not always possible " this project takes nanotechnology to the poorest of the poor people who live in this world , and it will make a difference in their lives , " said eugen cloete , who in addition to inventing the filter is dean of the faculty of science at stellenbosch university and chair of stellenbosch university 's water institute . with some 300 million people in africa - and over a billion worldwide - living without access to clean drinking water , the need for such a filter is huge .
when in mass production , the developers said they expect the teabag to cost just a few south african cents -lrb- under half a us cent and under a third of a euro cent -rrb- . in addition to being inexpensive , botes said , the filter is also easy to distribute to rural area and simple to use as it can be place in an adapter that fits on nearly any regular-sized plastic bottle .
each filter can clean one liter -lrb- one quart -rrb- of the most polluted water to the point where it is completely safe to drink .

she gained widespread support at this week 's party conference , which comes ahead of several key state elections in 2011 . german chancellor angela merkel has been reelected as head of her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- party , a sign that the party stands behind merkel despite recent doubts of the effectiveness of merkel and the cdu in leading the government . merkel ran unopposed and garnered the support of just over 90 percent of her party colleagues .
two years ago she received 95 percent of the votes when she was elected party head .
observers believed a drastic drop in that number would have indicated discontent from within the cdu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stuttgart rail project has proven to be deeply divisive merkel 's cdu and its junior coalition partner , the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , have taken a beating in the opinion polls over the last year over an unpopular bailout for fellow eurozone member greece , the decision to extend the operating lives of nuclear power plants and an expensive rail infrastructure project in stuttgart that has inspired massive local protests . with elections to be held in six of germany 's 16 states , 2011 is set to be a key year for merkel 's government .
earlier this year , the center-right coalition already suffered a major blow when it lost power in the country 's most populous state north rhine-westphalia and control of the bundesrat , the country 's upper house of parliament , along with it . leadership renewal the cdu took another hit when president horst koehler stepped down in june after being criticized for suggesting the german military had a role in protecting the country 's economic interests .
several other big names have left the political stage and merkel is set to get a new team of leaders standing behind her . around 1,000 cdu delegates are gathered in karlsruhe , where the party also voted on merkel ’ s four deputy leaders .
education minister annette schavan was reelected to the post , while environment minister norbert roettgen , labor minister ursula von der leyen and hesse premier volker bouffier recieved their first nominations . schaeuble put to task ahead of the party conference , merkel reiterated her support for finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , whose suitability for the job has been questioned recently due to chronic health problems , which led the minister to a three-week hospitalization last month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble insists he 's fit enough to keep his post merkel maintained that schaeuble was a capable minister and that the party ’ s support for him was strong , telling zdf public television , " i enjoy being chancellor with schaeuble as my finance minister . " however , schaeuble ’ s health was not the only source of stress for the finance minister . merkel and schaeuble - who just returned from a g20 conference in seoul , where they defended germany ’ s trade surplus - have repelled demands for tax cuts , as politicians from both within and outside of the party have called for a strong reform to germany ’ s tax laws . cdu parliamentarian christian von stetten told the sunday newspaper bild am sonntag that an improvement to the current laws was needed : " if we don ’ t put through a tax simplification law that earns that name , then we aren ’ t taking our voters seriously , " he said . schaeuble , meanwhile , said that he was open to discussions on improving the tax law with government deputies in parliament . divisive issues also on monday , german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg is due to present delegates in karlsruhe with his plan for reforming germany ’ s military .
the delegates are expected to pass a resolution on ending military conscription in germany , despite the fact that the party has traditionally advocated maintaining compulsory military service for young men .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg advocates an ende to conscription another topic to be discussed is the question of preimplantation genetic diagnosis - the testing of artificially fertilized human eggs for congenital disorders prior to implantation . the issue has been hotly debated in recent weeks , with opponents of the practice claiming it to be a precursor to genetic engineering of human beings .
while the cdu remains divided over the matter , merkel has come out in favor of a ban , claiming it was impossible to differentiate between minor and major congenital disorders . merkel told zdf that she was , however , open to discussion on the topic .
" we will conduct this debate with great mutual respect , " she said .
she added that neither position in the debate was the " christian " one , as the issue divided even church authorities . author : david levitz , holly fox -lrb- afp , ap , dpa , -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de research -pipe- 15.11.2010 czech company produces air-cleansing paint großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photocatalysis has a wealth of potential practical uses czech scientists and companies are currently working on some exciting innovations in nanotechnology , including a new paint that uses photocatalytic oxydation to clean the air . a czech firm has recently started producing a powerful photocatalytic paint that cleans the air of cigarette smoke , viruses and bacteria in minutes , whilst the czech academy of sciences has just opened a new nanocenter to spearhead research into practical applications for nanoscience .
" this is an exciting time for science - something like a revolution , " said jiri rathousky , the project 's leader , as he demonstrated a contraption called a dip coater in the lab of the newly-opened center .
the center – aided by funding from the european union – is the pride and joy of the heyrovsky institute of physical chemistry , a rather drab concrete tower block in the northern suburbs of prague .
hidden away on the sixth floor , rathousky and his colleagues in white overalls are doing some truly remarkable things with very small materials .
the magic of photocatalysts " for example here we coat sheets of glass with a thin layer of a nanostructure called titanium dioxide , " rathousky explained .
" titanium dioxide is a very efficient photocatalyst , and in this way , we obtain a photocatalytically active surface .
this type of photocatalytically active surface can be used for example in air-conditioning , for cleaning the air , and for removal of pollutants by the action of light . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the paint cleared a cube of cigarette smoke in one hour photocatalysts , substances that speed up a chemical reaction when light hits them , have tremendous practical uses like sterilization and air cleansing .
in a small , rather dilapidated factory on the outskirts of prague , a company called advanced materials is putting titanium dioxide to use in something called photocatalytic paint , an incredibly clever , virtually translucent paint that actually cleans the air in your living room of everything from bacteria to cigarette smoke .
" even in a concentration of one cigarette per cubic metre , you see very high degradation rate , " said jan prochazka , advanced materials ' co-owner .
in one hour , he said , a cubic meter box used to test the paint is clean of cigarette smoke .
" we say -lsb- the paint will oxidize -rsb- ninety percent of all contaminants in 24 hours , but it 's much faster .
it 's just to stay on the safe side , " prochazka added .
molecular reaction the tiny titanium dioxide molecules in the paint react to uv rays in sunlight or special lamps , oxidizing everything from carcinogens to allergens to dust mites .
that means that titanium oxide molecules react with smoke or bacteria , essentially consuming it .
that leaves a by-product of water and carbon dioxide , which are harmless .
photocatalytic paint has been around for a while , but he says that their new technique has been refined to be hundreds of times more powerful and efficient , and could revolutionize the way air is cleaned in homes and offices .
however , this technique is still relatively new , and a 2008 study from the lawrence berkeley national laboratory in the us found that photocatalytic oxidization may increase the presence of formaldehyde , a potentially dangerous chemical , in a real-life , indoor setting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one industry analyst called nanotech " the oil industry of the future " undeterred , advanced materials is already shipping their product to spain , south africa and new zealand , and licences to make it in other countries are already being drawn up . the success of advanced materials and the creation of the nanocentre in prague have led some in the czech media to speak of the czech republic as having the potential to become a major force in nanotechnology in europe .
huge growth ahead but perhaps all of this trumpeting should be taken with a pinch of salt .
" nanotech is the new oil industry , " said dean freeman , a nanotech industry analyst with gartner research .
" there are many opportunities in the nanotech space for research .
the key is making a product that can get traction and be sold commercially .
from a research perspective i have not seen a great deal on nanotech from the czech republic .
-lsb- but that -rsb- could have more to do with how publicized any research is . "
however he added their success in accessing eu funds for nanotech projects – and the czech government 's commitment – certainly placed the czechs in a strong position to make a name for themselves on the global nanotech market .

if vettel appeared calm before the final race in abu dhabi , the 23-year-old german was overcome with emotion afterwards . sebastian vettel cried tears of joy after sunday 's race in abu dhabi , after his team radioed in to tell him he had clinched the world championship , seemingly against all the odds .
" unbelievable .
thank you lads .
i love you , " the 23-year-old german said with a quivering voice from the cockpit .
after that , all you could really make out on the transmission were loud cries of celebration from the man with the glittering helmet .
" baby schumi " was what the german tabloid press once called him , but it was michael schumacher himself who pointed out earlier this year that vettel had outgrown that nickname , and the youngster has now proved beyond any doubt that as world champion , he should stand in nobody 's shadow .
" i did n't know anything until i passed the checkered flag " this world championship is the high point of an already stellar career .
vettel was born in 1987 in the southwestern german town of heppenheim , and his father norbert ensured that sebastian was bitten by the motorsport bug very early .
aged four , vettel first thrashed a go-kart around his parents ' driveway , and his first successes - as with almost all modern racers - followed racing in go-karts in his youth .
eventually , the youngster was noticed , and promoted to the single-seater formula bmw racing series .
as a debutante , vettel was immediately runner-up , and the next year he came back and won an incredible 18 out of 20 races .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel 's tasted champagne as a winner five times in 2010 vettel moved on to formula 3 , where he never managed to claim the grand prize , but that was because his fame was already overtaking him and his rise up the ladder was accelerating .
in 2006 , he was given his first shot in a formula one car in a young driver test , immediately posting the fastest time .
the next year , in indianapolis , an injury to then bmw-sauber driver robert kubica gave vettel his chance on a race weekend .
still in his teens , he promptly became not only the youngest driver to compete in a grand prix -lrb- a record he has since lost -rrb- , but also the youngest-ever points-scorer in the sport 's history - bringing his bmw home in eighth on his debut .
the early-achiever continued tearing up f1 's age-related record book in the following season .
driving for the underfunded toro rosso team , vettel became the youngest ever pole-sitter and then winner in a single wet weekend in monza , doing the double for his minor team as the championship battle raged around him .
two years on , after being promoted to the red bull outfit , vettel has completed his cv , becoming the youngest world champion in the sport 's history , displacing 2008 winner lewis hamilton by less than a year .
" i am a bit speechless .
i do n't know what you are supposed to say at this moment , " a usually loquacious vettel admitted in the post-race press conference .
" to be honest i did n't know anything until i passed the checkered flag . "
vettel not only needed a win , championship leader fernando alonso had to finish fifth or lower for him to win the title , but the spanish ferrari driver had a poor race , and could only salvage seventh .
" i hate losing " bildunterschrift : the youngster 's love of winning is displayed by his trademark index-finger celebration vettel - never one to aim low - points to the three michaels as heroes of his childhood : michael schumacher , michael jordan and michael jackson .
vettel even dreamed of becoming a musician as a kid .
" it was funny when i finally realized that i did n't have the voice for it , " he admitted in later life .
nevertheless , vettel 's passion remained - he 's a huge beatles fan and record collector to this day .
vettel also tried out a number of sports in his youth before settling on motor racing .
" i never scored many goals , and did n't even get called on to play that often , " vettel lamented , recalling his time on the football pitch .
he also tried tennis , table tennis , and even beach volleyball , but never settled for long .
" i was just never the best , so i stopped playing .
i hate losing . "
finally , vettel started following in the first michael 's footsteps more seriously , turning his attention to racing – a sport whose ethos he seems to enjoy .
" it 's irrelevant whether you 're second or fifth .
the only important thing is being no. 1 . "
with 10 pole positions , five wins , and now a world championship in 2010 , vettel has achieved that goal .

meanwhile , others wondered how a problem of this magnitude could even happen . the death toll from haiti 's cholera epidemic has reached more than 900 and the disease is present in six of the 10 provinces of the earthquake-battered caribbean country , the health ministry said over the weekend .
more than 15,000 people have been infected since the epidemic 's outbreak in late october , the health ministry said sunday , and the epidemic showed no sign of abating .
there were 120 new deaths since friday 's toll .
according to the ministry on monday , 917 people have died of the disease so far .
worse expected to come according to un estimates , up to 200,000 people could fall ill with cholera .
the world body on friday applied for another $ 163 million -lrb- 120 million euros -rrb- in donor aid .
the disease broke out in the northern artibonite region , where it continues to be most concentrated .
it is contracted through contaminated water and causes severe diarrhea and vomiting .
bildunterschrift : the fear is growing that the epidemic will spread to refugee camps authorities and international aid agencies were struggling to contain the latest crisis afflicting the impoverished island nation .
efforts are centering on preventing the disease from spreading in crowded city slums and tent camps that house over 1.3 million homeless people who survived the cataclysmic earthquake , nearly a year ago .
but the facts of the epidemic raise the question of how such a preventable disease could break out in a country that has been flooded with hundreds of millions of euros in foreign assistance since the earthquake .
resource coordination is problem " huge sums in aid money have gone there , but the people in the north seem to have been left to their own devices , " sven stockrahm , a journalist with german newspaper die zeit who wrote about the earthquake , told deutsche welle .
stockrahm stressed that his critical remarks were not aimed at humanitarian aid workers , who by all accounts are doing vital work under very trying circumstances .
the key question is whether a better coordination of the resources in place could have prevented cholera from occurring in the first place .
bildunterschrift : aid workers are working ahrd to meet the needs of growing patient numbers but clear answers are difficult to come by where haiti is concerned .
the causes of cholera , lack of clean drinking water and poor sanitation are well-known , but at present , no one is sure exactly how the disease even broke out in artibonite .
poor sanitation , even pre-earthquake what is certain is that conditions in haiti even before the earthquake were far from adequate .
a study by the world health organization and unicef found that open defecation was prevalent among just under half of rural haitians and that 3.7 million of haiti 's total population of 9 million had no reliable source of clean drinking water .
moreover , from 1990 to 2008 , conditions deteriorated .
a similar study by the united nations in 2009 determined that 42 percent of haitians were not using an " improved water source . "
haiti ranks dead last among countries in south america and the caribbean in all major water and hygiene categories .
" cholera is a sickness of poverty that is common in refugee camps where there ’ s not enough drinking water , " ernst diekmann - a doctor with germany 's society for technical cooperation , or gtz - told deutsche welle .
" haiti was already an underprivileged country , and the situation was exacerbated by the natural catastrophe . "
problem exacerbated by refugees nonetheless , aid workers acknowledge that pre-existing deficiencies and the slow recovery process are two parts of the same overall problem that encouraged the cholera outbreak .
and the issue of earthquake refugees only exacerbates those problems .
bildunterschrift : as the disease spreads , burials are on the rise " the dramatic thing about haiti is that even before the earthquake the health infrastructure was fully inadequate , " said joost butenop , a medical adviser to the aid organization caritas .
" aid organizations have concentrated on the region specifically affected -lsb- by the earthquake -rsb- and have n't been following the refugees to any great extent . "
organizational challenges earlier this year , the humanitarian organization refugees international went even further , claiming that recovery efforts in haiti were not just sluggish , but " paralyzed . "
off the record , many people who work in the aid and assistance sector say that shortcomings in coordination often prevent help from getting where it 's needed - or problems from being effectively anticipated .
that task falls to the united nations and the haitian government , and representatives of the former have openly admitted that the situation in haiti tests their limits .
the will to help is there .
germany 's ministry for economic cooperation and development , for instance , says that most of the 51.4 million euros -lrb- $ 72 million -rrb- it was allocated for haiti has already been distributed or earmarked for future projects .
yet merely distinguishing between emergency needs and long-term developmental requirements , and figuring out which government ministry is responsible , can be a complicated process .
and coordinating the enormous number of private and public organizations trying to help in haiti represents an organizational task of the highest order .
at this point , no one can say definitively whether any particular authority should have foreseen the danger of cholera in haiti and taken precautionary steps to prevent it .
but the outbreak of the disease in a country that has been the focus of so much international assistance suggests that overall organization and coordination remain problems that hinder aid initiatives from having their maximum possible effect .

the country is still refusing but so did greece before it bowed to pressure . speculation is rife about ireland 's course of action , as the country 's borrowing costs last week shot to record highs on concerns of a deficit set to hit 32 percent of gross domestic product this year .
monday kicked off with a report in the irish independent newspaper claiming that at a meeting of eurozone finance ministers this week , ireland plans to ask for money from the european union 's emergency fund to rescue its banks .
prompt denial an irish minister promptly fired off a denial about the country being in direct discussions about a bailout package from the european union .
while acknowledging that ireland is in " continuous talks " with the eu about its growing debt , dick roche , junior minister for european affairs , told newstalk radio that it is " frankly wrong and grossly irresponsible that this story is being said and that a frenzy is being created out there . "
the opposition claimed europe had already started moves to rescue the country , but the irish government denied it would need a bailout .
" ireland has made no application for external support , " a finance ministry spokesman said .
" ongoing contacts continue at official level with international colleagues in light of current market conditions . "
the rumor mill is almost certain to continue with every new day of uncertainty confronting irish banks .
at the end of last month , they owed 130 billion euros -lrb- $ 177 billion -rrb- of outstanding european central bank loans , up from 119 billion euros a month earlier .
numbers being floated around as part of a bailout deal range between 50 and 77 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment in ireland has soared to 13.2 percent the eu is reported to be keen for ireland to accept aid to avert a greek-style scenario in which budget problems in one country plunge the entire eurozone into crisis .
on monday , european central bank council member miguel angel fernandez ordonez prodded ireland to make a " final decision " on its fiscal crisis in a move to calm markets .
" the situation in the markets in recent weeks has been very negative due in some way to the lack of a final decision by ireland , " he told reporters in madrid .
" it 's not me who should take a decision about ireland ; it 's ireland that should take the right decision at the right moment . "
but the clock is ticking .
" i think ireland can hold out another three to four months maximum , and it should , hoping that some positive surprise on growth might calm the markets , " unicredit group chief economist marco annunziata told deutsche welle .
" but investors will remain nervous until the question is settled of whether or not eurozone sovereign debts might be restructured . "
stability program on track another european expert , who asked not to be identified , said the european finance ministers could reach a decision as early as this week to funnel funds to irish banks .
" these funds , which would help stabilize the banks , would be seen as a limited intervention , " the expert said .
there is no question about ireland 's sovereign debt , the expert added : the irish government has no immediate need for cash , being fully funded until mid-2011 , and its stability program is on track bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish banks owe billions to the european central bank germany has also pressed for ireland to accept aid , insiders say .
allaying investor concerns about irish finances would help advance chancellor angela merkel 's plan to require investors to help pay for future rescues .
european leaders , however , remain divided on merkel 's proposal , as they do on whether the ecb should keep buying bonds of debt-laden countries .
ireland 's debt problems stem largely from the country 's popped real estate bubble , when its local banks lent money too freely for construction projects .
on top of that was the irish government 's decision to provide a blanket guarantee to all bank creditors .
as a result , the country has experienced the worst recession of any major economy .
it has amassed debt of more than 100 billion euros and is struggling with an unemployment rate of 13.2 percent .
tough fiscal conditions a rescue plan would be deeply unpopular with irish voters , who value national independence and the low-tax regime that lured in foreign investment from u.s. and other non-european companies , fueling high growth rates over the past 20 years .
indeed , an eu bailout , with tough fiscal conditions attached , would be humiliating for a country once celebrated for its rags-to-riches transformation .
not unsurprisingly , critics of ireland 's action plan – or lack thereof – are wary of the country 's every move .
karel lannoo , chief executive officer of the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- in brussels , says the country should have acted long ago to steer clear of the financial challenges it now faces .
" ireland should never have given blanket coverage to banks in the first place , " lannoo told deutsche welle .
" and it should have let some of the banks fail . "
lannoo now questions the repercussions for europe .
" how many more of these financial disasters can we have ? " he asked .

the country is still refusing but so did greece before it bowed to pressure . speculation is rife about ireland 's course of action , as the country 's borrowing costs last week shot to record highs on concerns of a deficit set to hit 32 percent of gross domestic product this year .
monday kicked off with a report in the irish independent newspaper claiming that at a meeting of eurozone finance ministers this week , ireland plans to ask for money from the european union 's emergency fund to rescue its banks .
prompt denial an irish minister promptly fired off a denial about the country being in direct discussions about a bailout package from the european union .
while acknowledging that ireland is in " continuous talks " with the eu about its growing debt , dick roche , junior minister for european affairs , told newstalk radio that it is " frankly wrong and grossly irresponsible that this story is being said and that a frenzy is being created out there . "
the opposition claimed europe had already started moves to rescue the country , but the irish government denied it would need a bailout .
" ireland has made no application for external support , " a finance ministry spokesman said .
" ongoing contacts continue at official level with international colleagues in light of current market conditions . "
the rumor mill is almost certain to continue with every new day of uncertainty confronting irish banks .
at the end of last month , they owed 130 billion euros -lrb- $ 177 billion -rrb- of outstanding european central bank loans , up from 119 billion euros a month earlier .
numbers being floated around as part of a bailout deal range between 50 and 77 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment in ireland has soared to 13.2 percent the eu is reported to be keen for ireland to accept aid to avert a greek-style scenario in which budget problems in one country plunge the entire eurozone into crisis .
on monday , european central bank council member miguel angel fernandez ordonez prodded ireland to make a " final decision " on its fiscal crisis in a move to calm markets .
" the situation in the markets in recent weeks has been very negative due in some way to the lack of a final decision by ireland , " he told reporters in madrid .
" it 's not me who should take a decision about ireland ; it 's ireland that should take the right decision at the right moment . "
but the clock is ticking .
" i think ireland can hold out another three to four months maximum , and it should , hoping that some positive surprise on growth might calm the markets , " unicredit group chief economist marco annunziata told deutsche welle .
" but investors will remain nervous until the question is settled of whether or not eurozone sovereign debts might be restructured . "
stability program on track another european expert , who asked not to be identified , said the european finance ministers could reach a decision as early as this week to funnel funds to irish banks .
" these funds , which would help stabilize the banks , would be seen as a limited intervention , " the expert said .
there is no question about ireland 's sovereign debt , the expert added : the irish government has no immediate need for cash , being fully funded until mid-2011 , and its stability program is on track bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish banks owe billions to the european central bank germany has also pressed for ireland to accept aid , insiders say .
allaying investor concerns about irish finances would help advance chancellor angela merkel 's plan to require investors to help pay for future rescues .
european leaders , however , remain divided on merkel 's proposal , as they do on whether the ecb should keep buying bonds of debt-laden countries .
ireland 's debt problems stem largely from the country 's popped real estate bubble , when its local banks lent money too freely for construction projects .
on top of that was the irish government 's decision to provide a blanket guarantee to all bank creditors .
as a result , the country has experienced the worst recession of any major economy .
it has amassed debt of more than 100 billion euros and is struggling with an unemployment rate of 13.2 percent .
tough fiscal conditions a rescue plan would be deeply unpopular with irish voters , who value national independence and the low-tax regime that lured in foreign investment from u.s. and other non-european companies , fueling high growth rates over the past 20 years .
indeed , an eu bailout , with tough fiscal conditions attached , would be humiliating for a country once celebrated for its rags-to-riches transformation .
not unsurprisingly , critics of ireland 's action plan – or lack thereof – are wary of the country 's every move .
karel lannoo , chief executive officer of the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- in brussels , says the country should have acted long ago to steer clear of the financial challenges it now faces .
" ireland should never have given blanket coverage to banks in the first place , " lannoo told deutsche welle .
" and it should have let some of the banks fail . "
lannoo now questions the repercussions for europe .
" how many more of these financial disasters can we have ? " he asked .

but experts say a ban would cause unnecessary stress for couples . thanks to a recent ruling by the federal court of justice , german women having a ' test-tube baby ' have the option of letting the doctor check if the embryo which will be implanted in her womb is likely to suffer from any serious diseases .
if the chances are high , she can decide not to have it implanted and try again .
such pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- used to be illegal in germany , but the decision in july found that such a test was legal if it was intended to exclude a serious handicap .
this caused consternation among germany 's christians , not least those belonging to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
many argued that an embryo enjoys complete human rights from the moment a sperm fertilizes an egg , and after some deliberation , merkel came down on their side last month .
disunity among mainstream christians in her opening speech at this week 's party conference , the chancellor gave a brief but unambiguous reiteration of her position : " i 'm in favor of a ban , because we ca n't properly define the boundaries . "
she did however acknowledge that many party colleagues have a different opinion , and welcomed a frank debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the boundaries of pid were too difficult to define prominent cdu members – notably cabinet ministers ursula von der leyen and kristina schroeder - as well as merkel 's coalition partners the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , see it differently , and have proposed a controlled use of pgd .
the issue divides other parties too , and when the issue comes before german parliament , it has been decided that the question will be decided by a free ‘ conscience ' vote , independent of party lines .
the main argument in favor of pgd simply points out that german law allows women to have an abortion even in the ninth month , if a test of the fetus shows a serious health condition .
if more diagnoses could be carried out before implantation , many such traumatic abortions could be avoided .
" it 's quite a contradiction that we do n't allow the cells to be checked , " argued cdu parliamentary state secretary peter hintze .
" but we do allow the fetus to be checked in the womb .
we should get rid of this contradiction . "
defining the boundaries the particular ' boundary ' that merkel feels is so difficult to define is between screening out genes that might lead to illness , handicaps or birth defects and producing what is known as ' designer babies . '
from a scientific point of view , it 's important to point out that ' diagnosis ' is a slightly misleading description , since the process does not involve identifying an illness in an embryo .
instead , pgd is a test for certain genetic conditions that could lead to disease .
pgd was first developed in britain in the late 1980s , and was first used for sex determination on embryos with diseases linked to certain chromosomes .
not long after the first successful births , it was banned in germany under the 1990 embryo protection act .
its main application is for determining the presence of recessive genetic disorders like cystic fibrosis , beta-thalassemia , sickle cell disease and spinal muscular atrophy type 1 .
the most common dominant diseases that can be screened by pgd are myotonic dystrophy , huntington 's disease and charcot-marie-tooth disease .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an outright ban would likely send many germans abroad for treatment it is also used to test for chromosomal abnormalities , which if excluded can increase the chances of ivf treatment being successful , by reducing the rate of miscarriages .
broad consensus in europe pgd is allowed in britain , but only for determining the presence of serious hereditary diseases or chromosome disorders .
in france , the procedure is only allowed if an inherited disease has been identified in one of the parents , and only if both parents have been living together for two years .
a similarly limited application of pgd is also in place in belgium , the netherlands , belgium , italy , and greece .
meanwhile an outright ban is in place in austria , ireland and switzerland .
but there is a fairly ambiguous legal position on pgd in many countries , where it is not expressly banned , but is implicitly prohibited through regulations on embryo research – this is the case in many us states .
sascha rudat , spokesman for the berlin chamber of physicians , told deutsche welle , " the problem is that couples where hereditary diseases are present , could say , ' we 're going abroad to have it done there . '
and of course that is n't desirable .
that 's a lot of stress , so i think we should re-consider whether a total ban is a good idea . "
rudat says the risks and stress of travel to a foreign country only make a complex and emotionally-charged treatment even more difficult .
" some couples are already in a stressful situation , " he said .
" as i said , they are often couples who already have certain hereditary illnesses , who may already have had a handicapped child , and who only want to do everything right .
if they travel it just adds extra burdens . "
for this reason , rudat believes that a regulated application is the only fair solution .
" we do n't consider a total ban desirable , " says rudat .
" we think that pgd should be possible under very strict conditions .
they are of course important . "

" everything is at stake - if the euro fails , europe will fail , " she told delegates at the christian democrats ' party convention , where she was reelected as head of her party .
" we need a new culture of stability in europe , " she added .
she even went so far as to criticize her predecessor , social democrat gerhard schroeder , for giving his consent for greece to join the eurozone , calling it " irresponsible " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's push for a crisis prevention mechanism are controversial harsh words on both sides the comments came as eu figures showed that greece 's deficit in 2009 rose to 15.4 percent of gdp , a big jump from the initial estimate of 13.6 percent .
greek prime minister george papandreou promptly hit back , insisting that measures proposed by germany to avoid future crises were pushing up interest rates paid by highly indebted countries like greece for their bonds .
" this could create a self-fulfilling prophecy , " papandreou said during a visit in paris .
" this could break backs .
this could force some economies into bankruptcy , " he added .
he was referring to plans by germany , supported by france , to make bondholders pay at least some of the costs in case of a default .
germany is also reluctant to extend the eurozone 's bailout package beyond 2013 .
politicians may balk at merkel 's frank words , but some analysts believe tough talk is long-overdue .
" involving investors in the costs of defaults is a good idea , " eugen keller , head of financial markets research at metzler bank told deutsche welle .
" fighting fire with fire , i.e. bailing out mortgage companies like fannie mae or freddie mac or companies like gm , as happened in the us , and in europe as well , is not a long-term solution , " he said .
keller points out that the credit bubble has built up over the years , with the discrepancies between loans issued and actual economic growth widening over several decades , especially in the us , but also in europe .
bildunterschrift : exports are the driving force behind germany 's economic motor swings and roundabouts while germany benefits enormously from the single currency , as 40 percent of its exports go to other eurozone members , and having one currency eliminates fluctuations in exchange rates , the risks of having the euro were indeed underestimated , according to keller .
" germany can afford to pay for other countries as part of the bailout package for greece for example , but at the end of the day , the differences between say germany and greece or italy in efficiency , for example when it comes to managing wage costs , are extreme , " keller told deutsche welle .
" our own stress tests as well as those of ratings agencies in 2008 , for example , have shown that the former greek currency , the drachme , would have had to be valued at 30 to 40 percent less in 2008 than at the time greece joined the eurozone . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de formula one -pipe- 15.11.2010 opinion : vettel a worthy and well-deserving champ großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with sebasitan vettel 's first formula one drivers title , germany can celebrate a new world champion .
deutsche welle 's sports writer arnulf boettcher provides his take on germany 's new sports hero . germany has a new sports hero : sebastian vettel , the youngest world champion in formula one history .
born in the south-western german town of heppenheim , vettel wears the formula one crown at just 23 years old - and surely not for the last time .
germany 's other formula one world-champion , michael schumacher , was 25 when he won his first of a record seven titles .
like schumacher , vettel is known for his meticulousness and obsession over detail .
but unlike his role model schumacher , vettel does n't come across as so serious .
instead , vettel is seen as quick-witted , youthfully mischievous , and almost always smiling .
that 's what makes him so likeable on the formula one scene .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arnulf boettcher vettel almost become world champion last year .
he was held back by technical problems with his red bull car , but hasty mistakes were part of the problem , too .
he narrowly escaped meeting the same fate again this year .
but the setbacks only appear to have made him stronger .
in the decisive race , he took first place and made no mistakes in a dominating race where he was the best driver among his competitors .
ten pole positions and five victories make vettel a worthy and well-deserving champion .
fernando alonso is left pondering what might have been as his ferrari team implemented the wrong strategy in the final race in abu dhabi .
as for his title chances , alonso benefitted from an illegal team order : his ferrari teammate felipe massa was leading at the hockenheim race , but was ordered to let alonso through , securing an extra seven points for the spaniard .
red bull , on the other hand , did not issue team orders in the 2010 season and earned great respect from all sides .
vettel benefitted from the new points system that made formula one decidedly more exciting .
five drivers were in contention for the title heading into the second-to-last race , and for the final event four were still in the running .
in the end , vettel triumphed , after coming into the race in third place 15 points behind and without having even occupied top spot .
now germany can relish a world-title fairy tale and a youthful world champion .
but any expectations that vettel could someday overtake michael schumacher as the record world champion are misguided .
formula one has become much too fast-paced , and five different champions in the last five years speak for themselves .

dw-world.de forget ' baby schumi , ' now sebastian vettel is world champion sebastian vettel has become the youngest world champion in the history of formula one .
if vettel appeared calm before the final race in abu dhabi , the 23-year-old german was overcome with emotion afterwards .
-lrb- 15.11.2010 -rrb- sebastian vettel races to formula one world championship german formula one driver sebastian vettel has become the sport 's youngest champion after winning the abu dhabi grand prix .
the perfectly executed race caps a successful season for vettel and his red bull team .
-lrb- 14.11.2010 -rrb- vettel remains dark horse in season that should have been his sebastian vettel is one of four drivers with a shot at the formula one drivers ' championship in abu dhabi .
but not even victory on sunday would guarantee success , in a season the young german might have dominated .

deutsche welle 's sports writer arnulf boettcher provides his take on germany 's new sports hero . germany has a new sports hero : sebastian vettel , the youngest world champion in formula one history .
born in the south-western german town of heppenheim , vettel wears the formula one crown at just 23 years old - and surely not for the last time .
germany 's other formula one world-champion , michael schumacher , was 25 when he won his first of a record seven titles .
like schumacher , vettel is known for his meticulousness and obsession over detail .
but unlike his role model schumacher , vettel does n't come across as so serious .
instead , vettel is seen as quick-witted , youthfully mischievous , and almost always smiling .
that 's what makes him so likeable on the formula one scene .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arnulf boettcher vettel almost become world champion last year .
he was held back by technical problems with his red bull car , but hasty mistakes were part of the problem , too .
he narrowly escaped meeting the same fate again this year .
but the setbacks only appear to have made him stronger .
in the decisive race , he took first place and made no mistakes in a dominating race where he was the best driver among his competitors .
ten pole positions and five victories make vettel a worthy and well-deserving champion .
fernando alonso is left pondering what might have been as his ferrari team implemented the wrong strategy in the final race in abu dhabi .
as for his title chances , alonso benefitted from an illegal team order : his ferrari teammate felipe massa was leading at the hockenheim race , but was ordered to let alonso through , securing an extra seven points for the spaniard .
red bull , on the other hand , did not issue team orders in the 2010 season and earned great respect from all sides .
vettel benefitted from the new points system that made formula one decidedly more exciting .
five drivers were in contention for the title heading into the second-to-last race , and for the final event four were still in the running .
in the end , vettel triumphed , after coming into the race in third place 15 points behind and without having even occupied top spot .
now germany can relish a world-title fairy tale and a youthful world champion .
but any expectations that vettel could someday overtake michael schumacher as the record world champion are misguided .
formula one has become much too fast-paced , and five different champions in the last five years speak for themselves .

environmental campaigners are outraged , saying the crops are still potentially dangerous . according to environmental group friends of the earth europe -lrb- foee -rrb- , the european commission is planning to allow traces of non-approved gm crops in imports coming into europe -lrb- with a threshold of 0.1 percent -rrb- .
" europe would effectively open its borders for gm crops which are not authorized or assessed for their safety in any country of the world , " an foee statement said .
a number of european union governments on monday urged the bloc 's executive to allow tiny traces of gm material in food imports for human consumption as well as in animal feed , an eu source said .
however , it is not yet clear whether enough eu governments support the change to force the european commission to amend its proposal , and a final decision is unlikely before january at the earliest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers say the imports are necessary to keep prices down " the european commission is bowing to the scaremongering tactics of the biotech industry , and as a result , opening europe 's markets to unauthorized gm food and feed . "
mute schimpf , an foee food campaigner said .
" europe 's laws on genetically modified foods are there for a reason – to protect the public and the environment . "
biotech pressure environmentalists believe that the eu 's hand is being forced by the bio-technology industry , which is arguing that the eu 's total ban on gm crops could bring about a crisis in the feed sector , and farmers may be forced to slaughter animals rather than let them starve .
" this is based upon the false argument that international trade is severely disrupted when shipments of feed containing unauthorised gm feed are rejected , " the foee said .
the campaigners claimed that no shipment from any feed importing country -lrb- us , argentina or brazil -rrb- was rejected at a european port in 2010 .
" the right of the public to say no to gm foods and feeds must be respected , " schimpf demanded .
" member states should reject this proposal and maintain europe 's position on zero tolerance . "
farmers ' interests but european farmer organizations have shown little concern over the proposal .
amanda cheesley , spokeswoman for copa cogeca , the umbrella group of european farming organizations , told deutsche welle , " we are not averse to imports of gm feed coming in .
if it 's been approved under the commission 's authorization procedures , then we do n't have a problem with it . "
cheesley believes that the eu 's current zero tolerance policy is unsustainable .
" we want a solution to be found to that because in practise you ca n't have zero tolerance , " she said .
" it stops imports coming in , which means that feed prices go too high for livestock . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has criticized the eu 's gm assessment procedures cheesley says that europe 's farmers have other worries .
" we have concerns about the commission 's proposals to let member states have different policies on gm products , " she said .
the commission made legal proposals in july to allow national governments make their own decisions on the controversial crops , in a bid to break the longstanding eu deadlock on new gm product approvals .
but a new opinion from the eu council of ministers ' legal service could deal a fatal blow to the plans , after several eu governments already expressed fears that the draft law risks breaching world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- rules .
new guidelines the european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- has also set out new guidelines for biotech companies submitting gm crops for eu approval on friday , including on possible long-term effects of gm crops and their impacts on insects and other plants .
the new guidelines follow a request from eu governments in 2008 to strengthen efsa 's gm crop assessment procedures , and criticism from countries including france that efsa had failed to take full account of environmental concerns when approving new crops .
france has refused to discuss european commission proposals to let member states decide whether to grow or ban gm crops , until the eu 's assessment procedures have been strengthened .
in december , the commission is due to publish a report on the socio-economic risks and benefits of gm crops , and new rules on monitoring gm crops are due next year , as part of the wider overhaul of the bloc 's approval and assessment procedures .

environmental campaigners are outraged , saying the crops are still potentially dangerous . according to environmental group friends of the earth europe -lrb- foee -rrb- , the european commission is planning to allow traces of non-approved gm crops in imports coming into europe -lrb- with a threshold of 0.1 percent -rrb- .
" europe would effectively open its borders for gm crops which are not authorized or assessed for their safety in any country of the world , " an foee statement said .
a number of european union governments on monday urged the bloc 's executive to allow tiny traces of gm material in food imports for human consumption as well as in animal feed , an eu source said .
however , it is not yet clear whether enough eu governments support the change to force the european commission to amend its proposal , and a final decision is unlikely before january at the earliest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers say the imports are necessary to keep prices down " the european commission is bowing to the scaremongering tactics of the biotech industry , and as a result , opening europe 's markets to unauthorized gm food and feed . "
mute schimpf , an foee food campaigner said .
" europe 's laws on genetically modified foods are there for a reason – to protect the public and the environment . "
biotech pressure environmentalists believe that the eu 's hand is being forced by the bio-technology industry , which is arguing that the eu 's total ban on gm crops could bring about a crisis in the feed sector , and farmers may be forced to slaughter animals rather than let them starve .
" this is based upon the false argument that international trade is severely disrupted when shipments of feed containing unauthorised gm feed are rejected , " the foee said .
the campaigners claimed that no shipment from any feed importing country -lrb- us , argentina or brazil -rrb- was rejected at a european port in 2010 .
" the right of the public to say no to gm foods and feeds must be respected , " schimpf demanded .
" member states should reject this proposal and maintain europe 's position on zero tolerance . "
farmers ' interests but european farmer organizations have shown little concern over the proposal .
amanda cheesley , spokeswoman for copa cogeca , the umbrella group of european farming organizations , told deutsche welle , " we are not averse to imports of gm feed coming in .
if it 's been approved under the commission 's authorization procedures , then we do n't have a problem with it . "
cheesley believes that the eu 's current zero tolerance policy is unsustainable .
" we want a solution to be found to that because in practise you ca n't have zero tolerance , " she said .
" it stops imports coming in , which means that feed prices go too high for livestock . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has criticized the eu 's gm assessment procedures cheesley says that europe 's farmers have other worries .
" we have concerns about the commission 's proposals to let member states have different policies on gm products , " she said .
the commission made legal proposals in july to allow national governments make their own decisions on the controversial crops , in a bid to break the longstanding eu deadlock on new gm product approvals .
but a new opinion from the eu council of ministers ' legal service could deal a fatal blow to the plans , after several eu governments already expressed fears that the draft law risks breaching world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- rules .
new guidelines the european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- has also set out new guidelines for biotech companies submitting gm crops for eu approval on friday , including on possible long-term effects of gm crops and their impacts on insects and other plants .
the new guidelines follow a request from eu governments in 2008 to strengthen efsa 's gm crop assessment procedures , and criticism from countries including france that efsa had failed to take full account of environmental concerns when approving new crops .
france has refused to discuss european commission proposals to let member states decide whether to grow or ban gm crops , until the eu 's assessment procedures have been strengthened .
in december , the commission is due to publish a report on the socio-economic risks and benefits of gm crops , and new rules on monitoring gm crops are due next year , as part of the wider overhaul of the bloc 's approval and assessment procedures .

fillon was joined in his resignation by the rest of the french government . france 's government has moved a step closer to a full-scale reshuffle as president nicolas sarkozy accepted the formal resignation of his cabinet .
francois fillon has already been renamed as prime minister . the renewal of the french cabinet has been in the offing since march , and the resignations are considered a traditional formality , allowing the head of state to select new ministers without having to give any incumbents the axe . it was expected that fillon would be quickly reappointed as prime minister , while the new cabinet will likely be made up of politicians from sarkozy 's center-right ump party . the prime minister will likely assemble his new team for sarkozy 's approval as soon as monday . the reshuffle will be the fourth of sarkozy 's presidency .
the president has seen his popularity decline to around 30 percent over the introduction of a pension reform that increases the retirement age by two years . according to afp news agency , former prime minister and current bordeaux mayor alain juppe tacitly confirmed that he expected to return to government , possibly to take charge of the defense ministry .
foreign minister bernard kouchner , a high-profile former socialist , is expected to be replaced by a member of the ump . there has been mounting political tension in france in recent months as the president 's supporters jostle for position ahead of speculation that sarkozy will bid for re-election in 2012 . author : darren mara -lrb- afp , ap , dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the socialists won mayoral races in the capital athens as well as in greece 's second-largest city , thessaloniki , for the first time in over two decades .
voter turnout in athens was 33 percent , with a national average of 50 percent .
the results were an encouraging sign for greek prime minister george papandreou , after drastic wage and pension cuts and consumer tax increases prompted widespread protest in recent months .
" today the nation has indicated to us that we should proceed with our course , " papandreou said .
the poll results come ahead of a monday visit by officials from the european union and the international monetary fund to assess greece 's implementation of a bailout worth 110 billion euros -lrb- $ 150 billion -rrb- .
the eu 's statistics agency , eurostat , said in statement that greece 's 2009 budget deficit reached 15.4 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , almost two percent higher than projected .
analysts say the increase makes it unlikely that greece will reach its target of lowering the deficit to 8.1 percent of gdp by the end of the year .

they can stop off at the library and browse through a wide selection of books . it 's a daily task that dick van tol does with pride : tidying up all the books spread across tables and colorful seats .
but his workplace is n't your average library ; it 's located in the middle of one of europe 's busiest airports - schiphol in amsterdam .
the library is situated in the international transfers area , where a whole boulevard promoting dutch culture has been built .
it stands right next to schiphol 's branch of the netherlands ' main museum - the rijksmuseum .
" the idea was very simple : let 's lend books to passengers who go on holiday and they can bring the books back when they return , " said van tol , of probiblio , the institution that came up with the idea of an airport library .
" but then we realized that , logistically , it gets very complicated . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amsterdam 's airport is a major hub in central europe cozy retreat from traveling what the organizers decided to do was to arrange the space with a handful of tall shelves containing 1,200 books in 29 languages , most of them in english and german .
passengers can choose from a variety of themes - from photography and architecture to history and fiction - and browse through them , returning them to the shelves before their next flight .
they can also nestle down and relax in the enormous orange and purple chairs while flipping through the books that have caught their fancy .
" most of the 18 million people who only change planes here do n't see anything of holland , " van tol pointed out .
" and this is an opportunity to get acquainted with what holland looks like .
so , we also have - apart from the books - a photo exhibition about dutch landscapes . "
dutch culture to-go and that 's not all .
the library also boasts a multimedia offering , which includes ipads spread throughout the space so that passengers can watch videos and listen to dutch music .
occasionally , however , users try to hack the system in order to access the internet and this forces the computers to shut down for a large part of the day .
still , when they are in working order , users can hear tracks by world-famous dj tiesto or rock-chick anouk , or watch videos .
if they do n't have time to view everything that catches their eye , they can hook up to a touch screen located in the middle of the library and download videos about dutch paintings , fashion and design directly to their cell phones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the library helps travelers get to know holland - without leaving the airport something for everyone for some travelers , the paper part of schiphol 's lay-over library is just as interesting as the digital offerings .
" we 've found russian books for children here , " one male traveler said .
" it 's a good way to occupy the kids if you have time on your hands . "
another traveler said she would n't use the library because she always carries a book with her .
but the library is n't just for bookworms .
" i 've come here a second time now , " one man quipped .
" i like the ambience , so i come here immediately to relax and unwind .
i 'm just too tired to look at the books . "
project manager van tol , though , is n't deterred .
" the books are very well used here , " he said laughing - so not everyone just stops by for the comfortable chairs .
having opened in august , the library is still developing its collection .
users , for their part , have n't taken advantage of the honor system too much .
so far , only about a dozen books have been stolen , van tol said , and replacing them is cheaper than providing a 24-hour security service . author : cintia taylor -lrb- als -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the socialists won mayoral races in the capital athens as well as in greece 's second-largest city , thessaloniki , for the first time in over two decades .
voter turnout in athens was 33 percent , with a national average of 50 percent .
the results were an encouraging sign for greek prime minister george papandreou , after drastic wage and pension cuts and consumer tax increases prompted widespread protest in recent months .
" today the nation has indicated to us that we should proceed with our course , " papandreou said .
the poll results come ahead of a monday visit by officials from the european union and the international monetary fund to assess greece 's implementation of a bailout worth 110 billion euros -lrb- $ 150 billion -rrb- .
the eu 's statistics agency , eurostat , said in statement that greece 's 2009 budget deficit reached 15.4 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , almost two percent higher than projected .
analysts say the increase makes it unlikely that greece will reach its target of lowering the deficit to 8.1 percent of gdp by the end of the year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de research -pipe- 15.11.2010 czech company produces air-cleansing paint großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photocatalysis has a wealth of potential practical uses czech scientists and companies are currently working on some exciting innovations in nanotechnology , including a new paint that uses photocatalytic oxydation to clean the air . a czech firm has recently started producing a powerful photocatalytic paint that cleans the air of cigarette smoke , viruses and bacteria in minutes , whilst the czech academy of sciences has just opened a new nanocenter to spearhead research into practical applications for nanoscience .
" this is an exciting time for science - something like a revolution , " said jiri rathousky , the project 's leader , as he demonstrated a contraption called a dip coater in the lab of the newly-opened center .
the center – aided by funding from the european union – is the pride and joy of the heyrovsky institute of physical chemistry , a rather drab concrete tower block in the northern suburbs of prague .
hidden away on the sixth floor , rathousky and his colleagues in white overalls are doing some truly remarkable things with very small materials .
the magic of photocatalysts " for example here we coat sheets of glass with a thin layer of a nanostructure called titanium dioxide , " rathousky explained .
" titanium dioxide is a very efficient photocatalyst , and in this way , we obtain a photocatalytically active surface .
this type of photocatalytically active surface can be used for example in air-conditioning , for cleaning the air , and for removal of pollutants by the action of light . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the paint cleared a cube of cigarette smoke in one hour photocatalysts , substances that speed up a chemical reaction when light hits them , have tremendous practical uses like sterilization and air cleansing .
in a small , rather dilapidated factory on the outskirts of prague , a company called advanced materials is putting titanium dioxide to use in something called photocatalytic paint , an incredibly clever , virtually translucent paint that actually cleans the air in your living room of everything from bacteria to cigarette smoke .
" even in a concentration of one cigarette per cubic metre , you see very high degradation rate , " said jan prochazka , advanced materials ' co-owner .
in one hour , he said , a cubic meter box used to test the paint is clean of cigarette smoke .
" we say -lsb- the paint will oxidize -rsb- ninety percent of all contaminants in 24 hours , but it 's much faster .
it 's just to stay on the safe side , " prochazka added .
molecular reaction the tiny titanium dioxide molecules in the paint react to uv rays in sunlight or special lamps , oxidizing everything from carcinogens to allergens to dust mites .
that means that titanium oxide molecules react with smoke or bacteria , essentially consuming it .
that leaves a by-product of water and carbon dioxide , which are harmless .
photocatalytic paint has been around for a while , but he says that their new technique has been refined to be hundreds of times more powerful and efficient , and could revolutionize the way air is cleaned in homes and offices .
however , this technique is still relatively new , and a 2008 study from the lawrence berkeley national laboratory in the us found that photocatalytic oxidization may increase the presence of formaldehyde , a potentially dangerous chemical , in a real-life , indoor setting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one industry analyst called nanotech " the oil industry of the future " undeterred , advanced materials is already shipping their product to spain , south africa and new zealand , and licences to make it in other countries are already being drawn up . the success of advanced materials and the creation of the nanocentre in prague have led some in the czech media to speak of the czech republic as having the potential to become a major force in nanotechnology in europe .
huge growth ahead but perhaps all of this trumpeting should be taken with a pinch of salt .
" nanotech is the new oil industry , " said dean freeman , a nanotech industry analyst with gartner research .
" there are many opportunities in the nanotech space for research .
the key is making a product that can get traction and be sold commercially .
from a research perspective i have not seen a great deal on nanotech from the czech republic .

" this is an exciting time for science - something like a revolution , " said jiri rathousky , the project 's leader , as he demonstrated a contraption called a dip coater in the lab of the newly-opened center .
the center – aided by funding from the european union – is the pride and joy of the heyrovsky institute of physical chemistry , a rather drab concrete tower block in the northern suburbs of prague .
hidden away on the sixth floor , rathousky and his colleagues in white overalls are doing some truly remarkable things with very small materials .
the magic of photocatalysts " for example here we coat sheets of glass with a thin layer of a nanostructure called titanium dioxide , " rathousky explained .
" titanium dioxide is a very efficient photocatalyst , and in this way , we obtain a photocatalytically active surface .
this type of photocatalytically active surface can be used for example in air-conditioning , for cleaning the air , and for removal of pollutants by the action of light . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the paint cleared a cube of cigarette smoke in one hour photocatalysts , substances that speed up a chemical reaction when light hits them , have tremendous practical uses like sterilization and air cleansing .
in a small , rather dilapidated factory on the outskirts of prague , a company called advanced materials is putting titanium dioxide to use in something called photocatalytic paint , an incredibly clever , virtually translucent paint that actually cleans the air in your living room of everything from bacteria to cigarette smoke .
" even in a concentration of one cigarette per cubic metre , you see very high degradation rate , " said jan prochazka , advanced materials ' co-owner .
in one hour , he said , a cubic meter box used to test the paint is clean of cigarette smoke .
" we say -lsb- the paint will oxidize -rsb- ninety percent of all contaminants in 24 hours , but it 's much faster .
it 's just to stay on the safe side , " prochazka added .
molecular reaction the tiny titanium dioxide molecules in the paint react to uv rays in sunlight or special lamps , oxidizing everything from carcinogens to allergens to dust mites .
that means that titanium oxide molecules react with smoke or bacteria , essentially consuming it .
that leaves a by-product of water and carbon dioxide , which are harmless .
photocatalytic paint has been around for a while , but he says that their new technique has been refined to be hundreds of times more powerful and efficient , and could revolutionize the way air is cleaned in homes and offices .
however , this technique is still relatively new , and a 2008 study from the lawrence berkeley national laboratory in the us found that photocatalytic oxidization may increase the presence of formaldehyde , a potentially dangerous chemical , in a real-life , indoor setting .

meanwhile , others wondered how a problem of this magnitude could even happen . the death toll from haiti 's cholera epidemic has reached more than 900 and the disease is present in six of the 10 provinces of the earthquake-battered caribbean country , the health ministry said over the weekend .
more than 15,000 people have been infected since the epidemic 's outbreak in late october , the health ministry said sunday , and the epidemic showed no sign of abating .
there were 120 new deaths since friday 's toll .
according to the ministry on monday , 917 people have died of the disease so far .
worse expected to come according to un estimates , up to 200,000 people could fall ill with cholera .
the world body on friday applied for another $ 163 million -lrb- 120 million euros -rrb- in donor aid .
the disease broke out in the northern artibonite region , where it continues to be most concentrated .
it is contracted through contaminated water and causes severe diarrhea and vomiting .
bildunterschrift : the fear is growing that the epidemic will spread to refugee camps authorities and international aid agencies were struggling to contain the latest crisis afflicting the impoverished island nation .
efforts are centering on preventing the disease from spreading in crowded city slums and tent camps that house over 1.3 million homeless people who survived the cataclysmic earthquake , nearly a year ago .
but the facts of the epidemic raise the question of how such a preventable disease could break out in a country that has been flooded with hundreds of millions of euros in foreign assistance since the earthquake .
resource coordination is problem " huge sums in aid money have gone there , but the people in the north seem to have been left to their own devices , " sven stockrahm , a journalist with german newspaper die zeit who wrote about the earthquake , told deutsche welle .
stockrahm stressed that his critical remarks were not aimed at humanitarian aid workers , who by all accounts are doing vital work under very trying circumstances .
the key question is whether a better coordination of the resources in place could have prevented cholera from occurring in the first place .
bildunterschrift : aid workers are working ahrd to meet the needs of growing patient numbers but clear answers are difficult to come by where haiti is concerned .
the causes of cholera , lack of clean drinking water and poor sanitation are well-known , but at present , no one is sure exactly how the disease even broke out in artibonite .
poor sanitation , even pre-earthquake what is certain is that conditions in haiti even before the earthquake were far from adequate .
a study by the world health organization and unicef found that open defecation was prevalent among just under half of rural haitians and that 3.7 million of haiti 's total population of 9 million had no reliable source of clean drinking water .
moreover , from 1990 to 2008 , conditions deteriorated .
a similar study by the united nations in 2009 determined that 42 percent of haitians were not using an " improved water source . "
haiti ranks dead last among countries in south america and the caribbean in all major water and hygiene categories .
" cholera is a sickness of poverty that is common in refugee camps where there ’ s not enough drinking water , " ernst diekmann - a doctor with germany 's society for technical cooperation , or gtz - told deutsche welle .
" haiti was already an underprivileged country , and the situation was exacerbated by the natural catastrophe . "
problem exacerbated by refugees nonetheless , aid workers acknowledge that pre-existing deficiencies and the slow recovery process are two parts of the same overall problem that encouraged the cholera outbreak .
and the issue of earthquake refugees only exacerbates those problems .
bildunterschrift : as the disease spreads , burials are on the rise " the dramatic thing about haiti is that even before the earthquake the health infrastructure was fully inadequate , " said joost butenop , a medical adviser to the aid organization caritas .
" aid organizations have concentrated on the region specifically affected -lsb- by the earthquake -rsb- and have n't been following the refugees to any great extent . "
organizational challenges earlier this year , the humanitarian organization refugees international went even further , claiming that recovery efforts in haiti were not just sluggish , but " paralyzed . "
off the record , many people who work in the aid and assistance sector say that shortcomings in coordination often prevent help from getting where it 's needed - or problems from being effectively anticipated .
that task falls to the united nations and the haitian government , and representatives of the former have openly admitted that the situation in haiti tests their limits .
the will to help is there .
germany 's ministry for economic cooperation and development , for instance , says that most of the 51.4 million euros -lrb- $ 72 million -rrb- it was allocated for haiti has already been distributed or earmarked for future projects .
yet merely distinguishing between emergency needs and long-term developmental requirements , and figuring out which government ministry is responsible , can be a complicated process .
and coordinating the enormous number of private and public organizations trying to help in haiti represents an organizational task of the highest order .
at this point , no one can say definitively whether any particular authority should have foreseen the danger of cholera in haiti and taken precautionary steps to prevent it .
but the outbreak of the disease in a country that has been the focus of so much international assistance suggests that overall organization and coordination remain problems that hinder aid initiatives from having their maximum possible effect .

the two rival sects of ultra-orthodox jews face off in a witty and bittersweet film titled " romeo and juliet in yiddish . "
a chance encounter between director eve annenberg and some members of new york 's hasidic community developed into a friendship and collaboration on the film .
it explores the rough-and-tumble existence of young jews who have left the ultra-orthodox world behind .
annenberg was fascinated by a younger generation speaking a language she thought was more or less consigned to the archives . " my grandmother who spoke yiddish and my mother who spoke yiddish are now both dead , and i wo n't hear it again .
and yet , the lure of speaking yiddish and being around people with this verbal vitality is so strong , " annenberg said .

" if ever a bunch of people did n't understand each other that well , it 's the ultra-secular and the ultra-orthodox . "
in the film , the young translators ' personal stories begin to overlap with the plot of " romeo and juliet , " once they wrap their heads around it .

the film , ' romeo and juliet in yiddish , ' gives the world 's most famous romance a new twist . move over montagues and capulets : here come the chabads and the satmars .
the two rival sects of ultra-orthodox jews face off in a witty and bittersweet film titled " romeo and juliet in yiddish . "
a chance encounter between director eve annenberg and some members of new york 's hasidic community developed into a friendship and collaboration on the film .
it explores the rough-and-tumble existence of young jews who have left the ultra-orthodox world behind .
annenberg was fascinated by a younger generation speaking a language she thought was more or less consigned to the archives . " my grandmother who spoke yiddish and my mother who spoke yiddish are now both dead , and i wo n't hear it again .
and yet , the lure of speaking yiddish and being around people with this verbal vitality is so strong , " annenberg said .
bildunterschrift : the film deals with tension between orthodox and secular jews an introduction to the bard the director also has a role in the film .
she plays an emergency room nurse who 's trying to finish her master 's degree in germanic languages .
after she accepts her advisor 's suggestion to translate " romeo and juliet " into yiddish , she recruits some young native speakers to help her out .
" i think this is the first ' romeo and juliet ' where they wake up in the morning , and romeo reaches for his glasses .
that was an important detail to me .
i wanted it to be , well , jewish .
and yes , we read a lot ! "
annenberg said with a laugh .
but shakespeare has n't been on the reading list for many in the ultra-orthodox community , which has remained closed to much of the outside world .
the young translators in the film have never heard of the bard .
they also do n't have much sense of romantic love .
life meets art in the film , annenberg 's character makes her preference for the secular clear and even declares that she hates the orthodox .
" i 'm expressing that jew-on-jew hostility that i 'd certainly like to see less of , and i see the movie as a rapprochement between the two camps , " annenberg said .
" if ever a bunch of people did n't understand each other that well , it 's the ultra-secular and the ultra-orthodox . "
in the film , the young translators ' personal stories begin to overlap with the plot of " romeo and juliet , " once they wrap their heads around it .
the back story is that these first-time actors , like their characters , are forging new lives outside of the ultra-orthodox community where they grew up .
melissa weisz plays juliet and traveled to berlin for the jewish film festival where the movie premiered this summer .
" we came to berlin and spoke to non-jews , and it gives you a whole different perception of the world , " weisz said .
" we were told that every gentile would hurt us .
the way we were raised is very insular and a little bit brainwashed . "
bildunterschrift : melissa weisz plays juliet more premieres ahead the actors ' experience in the german capital was fruitful .
not only were they on hand to receive the audience favorite award at berlin 's jewish film festival , they also received invitations to come back and guest lecture at yiddish courses .
lazer weisz plays the romeo character and enjoyed the feedback on the film from people in the audience . " they like the whole idea that yiddish is coming back to germany .
it 's very nice .
it makes the whole thing worth it in a way , " he said .
the film 's next stop is london on november 16 , and it will debut in new york in january .
the screenings offer a departure from the usual shakespearean experience .
since 65 percent of the movie is in yiddish , the scenes from romeo and juliet appear with the bard 's original lines subtitled in english .
if the film continues to charm audiences as it did in germany , perhaps another yiddish language production will follow .

he talked to deutsche welle about the ups and downs of trying to come back . before there was sami khedira , there was simon rolfes .
the 28-year-old midfielder was originally the one tipped to take over the stopper role from ageing veteran michael ballack .
but a meniscus injury in july 2009 ultimately stopped rolfes in his tracks just as he was reaching the peak of his career .
rolfes played through pain that fall .
after all , his club , bayer leverkusen , was topping the table , and he had established himself as a regular in the german national side .
but by october he had developed articular cartilage damage and had no option but to have an operation .
the problems did n't go away , and he was forced to go under the knife again in january and acknowledge that his dream of competing in south africa was over .
“ we were on a sensational run with leverkusen and topping the table at the winter break , ” rolfes told deutsche welle .
“ my plan was to come back in the second half of the season and be a full part of the team , since the games i had played that season had been the best of my career .
so , of course , the weeks following the january operation were really hard .
i realized i was n't going to play any role at all either in the bundesliga season or the world cup . ”
a slow but steady developer , rolfes had become an international caliber midfielder .
now he was forced to watch khedira take on a role in the german squad that he himself would have probably occupied , had he not been hurt .
khedira performed well in south africa and landed a deal with real madrid .
meanwhile , rolfes was just trying to regain his basic fitness .
daily drudgery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolfes had been getting regular starts for germany in one respect , rolfes has been lucky .
the injuries he suffered have ended many a footballer 's career .
but rehab work , to hear him describe it , is a total slog , and it is difficult for a top athlete to acknowledge that , through no fault of one 's own , one is not at the level one was just a few months before .
“ it takes time to accept and start looking forward again , ” rolfes said .
“ after the operation i was on crutches for eight weeks … and it hardly a lot of fun to lie around at home , exercising your leg or knee with a machine for six hours a day and watching your muscles virtually disappear . ”
rolfes also said that when he was able to work out with a football again , it was hard at first to commit to challenges .
overcoming fear , he said , came gradually as he got used to playing scrimmages in training sessions .
“ it 's such a long process , and in the beginning you ca n't imagine yourself being on the pitch again , ” rolfes remembered .
“ but step for step , they bring you along , and then at some point it 's over .
you get your confidence back in practice . ”
practice , in this case , does n't make perfect .
it gives a player the chance to regain what he 's lost .
positive outlook bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coming back from a knee injury takes lots of hard , boring work rolfes made his bundesliga comeback in late september , and so far , he 's been pretty good .
last month , he scored a pair of goals to help leverkusen beat wolfsburg , even though he only came on as a late substitute .
and perhaps more encouragingly , he 's played for a full 90 minutes in his last two games .
he also provided the assist for leverkusen 's lone goal in their win agaist st. pauli on the weekend , which took the team up to second in the bundesliga standings .
but will he ever be able to recapture the status he once had with germany head coach joachim loew ?
competition for spots in the midfield is fierce , with not even nominal team captain michael ballack being assured of making the squad .
rolfes draws hope from the very vagaries of football that put him out of commission for much of 2009 and 2010 .
“ a year ago , no one would have thought that bastian schweinsteiger and sami khedira would be the central midfielders at the world cup , ” rolfes said .
“ and likewise , no one knows what 's going to happen in two or three years ' time .
there 's always the possibility of injuries and other circumstances .
so you should n't concentrate on whether it 's difficult or not . ”
and rolfes does n't need to look far to find an example of hope .
his teammate at leverkusen , striker patrick helmes , was also knocked out of germany 's world cup squad by an injury , but has gotten a call-up to play in the nationalelf 's friendly against sweden this coming wednesday .
so even though rolfes has dropped off the radar screen of many casual germany fans , it would n't be all that surprising to find him on the plane when yogi and co. travel to euro 2012 in poland and ukraine , or even the 2014 world cup in brazil .

the filter , about the size and shape of a teabag , would be inexpensive , easy to distribute and simple to use . marelize botes is conducting a final set of tests on a new type of diminutive water filter before industrial production can begin .
the microbiologist pours water from a plastic bottle though a high-tech , teabag-sized filter before analyzing it in her in her laboratory at the university of stellenbosch in south africa . " the filter is much cheaper than bottled water as well as any other filter on the market , " she told deutsche welle . instead of being filled with black or green tea , the bag contains active carbon granules and is made from nanofibers treated with biocide , which kills bacteria rather than simply filtering them from the water . nanotech for pennies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting clean drinking water everywhere is not always possible " this project takes nanotechnology to the poorest of the poor people who live in this world , and it will make a difference in their lives , " said eugen cloete , who in addition to inventing the filter is dean of the faculty of science at stellenbosch university and chair of stellenbosch university 's water institute . with some 300 million people in africa - and over a billion worldwide - living without access to clean drinking water , the need for such a filter is huge .
when in mass production , the developers said they expect the teabag to cost just a few south african cents -lrb- under half a us cent and under a third of a euro cent -rrb- . in addition to being inexpensive , botes said , the filter is also easy to distribute to rural area and simple to use as it can be place in an adapter that fits on nearly any regular-sized plastic bottle .
each filter can clean one liter -lrb- one quart -rrb- of the most polluted water to the point where it is completely safe to drink .
once used , the filter can be disposed of and is biodegradable . african countries , led by somalia , mauritania and sudan , were ranked to have the most vulnerable water supplies , according to a june report by uk-based risk consultancy firm maplecroft . decentralized use bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the filter can be used anywhere , cloete said the filter 's small size and light weight make it ideal for rural areas where other means of filtration do not exist , cloete said . " it is simply impossible to build purification infrastructure at every polluted stream , " cloete said .
" so we have to take the solution to the people .
the water is cleaned right then and there when you drink from the bottle . " the filter is now undergoing testing by the south african bureau of standards , after which cloete and his team hope it can be rolled out to the united nations and non-governmental organizations that have expressed interest in it by the end of the year . the project grew out of research into larger filters , according to cloete . " we were busy developing filters for larger applications , but when you do the tests in the labatory you do the tests on a much smaller scale , " he said .
" the results we were getting on a smaller amount of water promoted me to think about a smaller application . " author : joerg poppendieck , sean sinico editor : anke rasper send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 15.11.2010 ' romeo and juliet in yiddish ' explores jew-on-jew hostility , says director großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " romeo and juliet in yiddish " premieres in the uk on november 16 shakespeare has been translated into some 80 languages and was likely translated into yiddish in the late 19th century .
the film , ' romeo and juliet in yiddish , ' gives the world 's most famous romance a new twist . move over montagues and capulets : here come the chabads and the satmars .
the two rival sects of ultra-orthodox jews face off in a witty and bittersweet film titled " romeo and juliet in yiddish . "
a chance encounter between director eve annenberg and some members of new york 's hasidic community developed into a friendship and collaboration on the film .
it explores the rough-and-tumble existence of young jews who have left the ultra-orthodox world behind .
annenberg was fascinated by a younger generation speaking a language she thought was more or less consigned to the archives . " my grandmother who spoke yiddish and my mother who spoke yiddish are now both dead , and i wo n't hear it again .
and yet , the lure of speaking yiddish and being around people with this verbal vitality is so strong , " annenberg said .
bildunterschrift : the film deals with tension between orthodox and secular jews an introduction to the bard the director also has a role in the film .
she plays an emergency room nurse who 's trying to finish her master 's degree in germanic languages .
after she accepts her advisor 's suggestion to translate " romeo and juliet " into yiddish , she recruits some young native speakers to help her out .
" i think this is the first ' romeo and juliet ' where they wake up in the morning , and romeo reaches for his glasses .
that was an important detail to me .
i wanted it to be , well , jewish .
and yes , we read a lot ! "
annenberg said with a laugh .
but shakespeare has n't been on the reading list for many in the ultra-orthodox community , which has remained closed to much of the outside world .
the young translators in the film have never heard of the bard .
they also do n't have much sense of romantic love .
life meets art in the film , annenberg 's character makes her preference for the secular clear and even declares that she hates the orthodox .
" i 'm expressing that jew-on-jew hostility that i 'd certainly like to see less of , and i see the movie as a rapprochement between the two camps , " annenberg said .
" if ever a bunch of people did n't understand each other that well , it 's the ultra-secular and the ultra-orthodox . "
in the film , the young translators ' personal stories begin to overlap with the plot of " romeo and juliet , " once they wrap their heads around it .
the back story is that these first-time actors , like their characters , are forging new lives outside of the ultra-orthodox community where they grew up .
melissa weisz plays juliet and traveled to berlin for the jewish film festival where the movie premiered this summer .
" we came to berlin and spoke to non-jews , and it gives you a whole different perception of the world , " weisz said .
" we were told that every gentile would hurt us .
the way we were raised is very insular and a little bit brainwashed . "
bildunterschrift : melissa weisz plays juliet more premieres ahead the actors ' experience in the german capital was fruitful .
not only were they on hand to receive the audience favorite award at berlin 's jewish film festival , they also received invitations to come back and guest lecture at yiddish courses .
lazer weisz plays the romeo character and enjoyed the feedback on the film from people in the audience . " they like the whole idea that yiddish is coming back to germany .
it 's very nice .
it makes the whole thing worth it in a way , " he said .
the film 's next stop is london on november 16 , and it will debut in new york in january .
the screenings offer a departure from the usual shakespearean experience .
since 65 percent of the movie is in yiddish , the scenes from romeo and juliet appear with the bard 's original lines subtitled in english .
if the film continues to charm audiences as it did in germany , perhaps another yiddish language production will follow .

meanwhile , others wondered how a problem of this magnitude could even happen . the death toll from haiti 's cholera epidemic has reached more than 900 and the disease is present in six of the 10 provinces of the earthquake-battered caribbean country , the health ministry said over the weekend .
more than 15,000 people have been infected since the epidemic 's outbreak in late october , the health ministry said sunday , and the epidemic showed no sign of abating .
there were 120 new deaths since friday 's toll .
according to the ministry on monday , 917 people have died of the disease so far .
worse expected to come according to un estimates , up to 200,000 people could fall ill with cholera .
the world body on friday applied for another $ 163 million -lrb- 120 million euros -rrb- in donor aid .
the disease broke out in the northern artibonite region , where it continues to be most concentrated .
it is contracted through contaminated water and causes severe diarrhea and vomiting .
bildunterschrift : the fear is growing that the epidemic will spread to refugee camps authorities and international aid agencies were struggling to contain the latest crisis afflicting the impoverished island nation .
efforts are centering on preventing the disease from spreading in crowded city slums and tent camps that house over 1.3 million homeless people who survived the cataclysmic earthquake , nearly a year ago .
but the facts of the epidemic raise the question of how such a preventable disease could break out in a country that has been flooded with hundreds of millions of euros in foreign assistance since the earthquake .
resource coordination is problem " huge sums in aid money have gone there , but the people in the north seem to have been left to their own devices , " sven stockrahm , a journalist with german newspaper die zeit who wrote about the earthquake , told deutsche welle .
stockrahm stressed that his critical remarks were not aimed at humanitarian aid workers , who by all accounts are doing vital work under very trying circumstances .
the key question is whether a better coordination of the resources in place could have prevented cholera from occurring in the first place .
bildunterschrift : aid workers are working ahrd to meet the needs of growing patient numbers but clear answers are difficult to come by where haiti is concerned .
the causes of cholera , lack of clean drinking water and poor sanitation are well-known , but at present , no one is sure exactly how the disease even broke out in artibonite .
poor sanitation , even pre-earthquake what is certain is that conditions in haiti even before the earthquake were far from adequate .
a study by the world health organization and unicef found that open defecation was prevalent among just under half of rural haitians and that 3.7 million of haiti 's total population of 9 million had no reliable source of clean drinking water .
moreover , from 1990 to 2008 , conditions deteriorated .
a similar study by the united nations in 2009 determined that 42 percent of haitians were not using an " improved water source . "
haiti ranks dead last among countries in south america and the caribbean in all major water and hygiene categories .
" cholera is a sickness of poverty that is common in refugee camps where there ’ s not enough drinking water , " ernst diekmann - a doctor with germany 's society for technical cooperation , or gtz - told deutsche welle .
" haiti was already an underprivileged country , and the situation was exacerbated by the natural catastrophe . "
problem exacerbated by refugees nonetheless , aid workers acknowledge that pre-existing deficiencies and the slow recovery process are two parts of the same overall problem that encouraged the cholera outbreak .
and the issue of earthquake refugees only exacerbates those problems .
bildunterschrift : as the disease spreads , burials are on the rise " the dramatic thing about haiti is that even before the earthquake the health infrastructure was fully inadequate , " said joost butenop , a medical adviser to the aid organization caritas .
" aid organizations have concentrated on the region specifically affected -lsb- by the earthquake -rsb- and have n't been following the refugees to any great extent . "
organizational challenges earlier this year , the humanitarian organization refugees international went even further , claiming that recovery efforts in haiti were not just sluggish , but " paralyzed . "
off the record , many people who work in the aid and assistance sector say that shortcomings in coordination often prevent help from getting where it 's needed - or problems from being effectively anticipated .
that task falls to the united nations and the haitian government , and representatives of the former have openly admitted that the situation in haiti tests their limits .
the will to help is there .
germany 's ministry for economic cooperation and development , for instance , says that most of the 51.4 million euros -lrb- $ 72 million -rrb- it was allocated for haiti has already been distributed or earmarked for future projects .
yet merely distinguishing between emergency needs and long-term developmental requirements , and figuring out which government ministry is responsible , can be a complicated process .
and coordinating the enormous number of private and public organizations trying to help in haiti represents an organizational task of the highest order .
at this point , no one can say definitively whether any particular authority should have foreseen the danger of cholera in haiti and taken precautionary steps to prevent it .
but the outbreak of the disease in a country that has been the focus of so much international assistance suggests that overall organization and coordination remain problems that hinder aid initiatives from having their maximum possible effect .

but the outbreak of the disease in a country that has been the focus of so much international assistance suggests that overall organization and coordination remain problems that hinder aid initiatives from having their maximum possible effect .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 15.11.2010 leverkusen midfielder rolfes hopes injury nightmare is finally over großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolfes is a big physical player with a good passing eye a succession of knee injuries meant simon rolfes missed the 2010 world cup - a nearly worst-case scenario for any footballer .
he talked to deutsche welle about the ups and downs of trying to come back . before there was sami khedira , there was simon rolfes .
the 28-year-old midfielder was originally the one tipped to take over the stopper role from ageing veteran michael ballack .
but a meniscus injury in july 2009 ultimately stopped rolfes in his tracks just as he was reaching the peak of his career .
rolfes played through pain that fall .
after all , his club , bayer leverkusen , was topping the table , and he had established himself as a regular in the german national side .
but by october he had developed articular cartilage damage and had no option but to have an operation .
the problems did n't go away , and he was forced to go under the knife again in january and acknowledge that his dream of competing in south africa was over .
“ we were on a sensational run with leverkusen and topping the table at the winter break , ” rolfes told deutsche welle .
“ my plan was to come back in the second half of the season and be a full part of the team , since the games i had played that season had been the best of my career .
so , of course , the weeks following the january operation were really hard .
i realized i was n't going to play any role at all either in the bundesliga season or the world cup . ”
a slow but steady developer , rolfes had become an international caliber midfielder .
now he was forced to watch khedira take on a role in the german squad that he himself would have probably occupied , had he not been hurt .
khedira performed well in south africa and landed a deal with real madrid .
meanwhile , rolfes was just trying to regain his basic fitness .
daily drudgery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolfes had been getting regular starts for germany in one respect , rolfes has been lucky .
the injuries he suffered have ended many a footballer 's career .
but rehab work , to hear him describe it , is a total slog , and it is difficult for a top athlete to acknowledge that , through no fault of one 's own , one is not at the level one was just a few months before .
“ it takes time to accept and start looking forward again , ” rolfes said .
“ after the operation i was on crutches for eight weeks … and it hardly a lot of fun to lie around at home , exercising your leg or knee with a machine for six hours a day and watching your muscles virtually disappear . ”
rolfes also said that when he was able to work out with a football again , it was hard at first to commit to challenges .
overcoming fear , he said , came gradually as he got used to playing scrimmages in training sessions .
“ it 's such a long process , and in the beginning you ca n't imagine yourself being on the pitch again , ” rolfes remembered .
“ but step for step , they bring you along , and then at some point it 's over .
you get your confidence back in practice . ”
practice , in this case , does n't make perfect .
it gives a player the chance to regain what he 's lost .
positive outlook bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coming back from a knee injury takes lots of hard , boring work rolfes made his bundesliga comeback in late september , and so far , he 's been pretty good .
last month , he scored a pair of goals to help leverkusen beat wolfsburg , even though he only came on as a late substitute .
and perhaps more encouragingly , he 's played for a full 90 minutes in his last two games .
he also provided the assist for leverkusen 's lone goal in their win agaist st. pauli on the weekend , which took the team up to second in the bundesliga standings .
but will he ever be able to recapture the status he once had with germany head coach joachim loew ?
competition for spots in the midfield is fierce , with not even nominal team captain michael ballack being assured of making the squad .
rolfes draws hope from the very vagaries of football that put him out of commission for much of 2009 and 2010 .
“ a year ago , no one would have thought that bastian schweinsteiger and sami khedira would be the central midfielders at the world cup , ” rolfes said .
“ and likewise , no one knows what 's going to happen in two or three years ' time .
there 's always the possibility of injuries and other circumstances .
so you should n't concentrate on whether it 's difficult or not . ”
and rolfes does n't need to look far to find an example of hope .
his teammate at leverkusen , striker patrick helmes , was also knocked out of germany 's world cup squad by an injury , but has gotten a call-up to play in the nationalelf 's friendly against sweden this coming wednesday .
so even though rolfes has dropped off the radar screen of many casual germany fans , it would n't be all that surprising to find him on the plane when yogi and co. travel to euro 2012 in poland and ukraine , or even the 2014 world cup in brazil .
simon rolfes was interviewed by kamilla jarzina for dw-tv 's bundesliga kick off program .

the filter , about the size and shape of a teabag , would be inexpensive , easy to distribute and simple to use . marelize botes is conducting a final set of tests on a new type of diminutive water filter before industrial production can begin .
the microbiologist pours water from a plastic bottle though a high-tech , teabag-sized filter before analyzing it in her in her laboratory at the university of stellenbosch in south africa . " the filter is much cheaper than bottled water as well as any other filter on the market , " she told deutsche welle . instead of being filled with black or green tea , the bag contains active carbon granules and is made from nanofibers treated with biocide , which kills bacteria rather than simply filtering them from the water . nanotech for pennies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting clean drinking water everywhere is not always possible " this project takes nanotechnology to the poorest of the poor people who live in this world , and it will make a difference in their lives , " said eugen cloete , who in addition to inventing the filter is dean of the faculty of science at stellenbosch university and chair of stellenbosch university 's water institute . with some 300 million people in africa - and over a billion worldwide - living without access to clean drinking water , the need for such a filter is huge .
when in mass production , the developers said they expect the teabag to cost just a few south african cents -lrb- under half a us cent and under a third of a euro cent -rrb- . in addition to being inexpensive , botes said , the filter is also easy to distribute to rural area and simple to use as it can be place in an adapter that fits on nearly any regular-sized plastic bottle .
each filter can clean one liter -lrb- one quart -rrb- of the most polluted water to the point where it is completely safe to drink .
once used , the filter can be disposed of and is biodegradable . african countries , led by somalia , mauritania and sudan , were ranked to have the most vulnerable water supplies , according to a june report by uk-based risk consultancy firm maplecroft . decentralized use bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the filter can be used anywhere , cloete said the filter 's small size and light weight make it ideal for rural areas where other means of filtration do not exist , cloete said . " it is simply impossible to build purification infrastructure at every polluted stream , " cloete said .
" so we have to take the solution to the people .
the water is cleaned right then and there when you drink from the bottle . " the filter is now undergoing testing by the south african bureau of standards , after which cloete and his team hope it can be rolled out to the united nations and non-governmental organizations that have expressed interest in it by the end of the year . the project grew out of research into larger filters , according to cloete . " we were busy developing filters for larger applications , but when you do the tests in the labatory you do the tests on a much smaller scale , " he said .
" the results we were getting on a smaller amount of water promoted me to think about a smaller application . " author : joerg poppendieck , sean sinico editor : anke rasper send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

if vettel appeared calm before the final race in abu dhabi , the 23-year-old german was overcome with emotion afterwards . sebastian vettel cried tears of joy after sunday 's race in abu dhabi , after his team radioed in to tell him he had clinched the world championship , seemingly against all the odds .
" unbelievable .
thank you lads .
i love you , " the 23-year-old german said with a quivering voice from the cockpit .
after that , all you could really make out on the transmission were loud cries of celebration from the man with the glittering helmet .
" baby schumi " was what the german tabloid press once called him , but it was michael schumacher himself who pointed out earlier this year that vettel had outgrown that nickname , and the youngster has now proved beyond any doubt that as world champion , he should stand in nobody 's shadow .
" i did n't know anything until i passed the checkered flag " this world championship is the high point of an already stellar career .
vettel was born in 1987 in the southwestern german town of heppenheim , and his father norbert ensured that sebastian was bitten by the motorsport bug very early .
aged four , vettel first thrashed a go-kart around his parents ' driveway , and his first successes - as with almost all modern racers - followed racing in go-karts in his youth .
eventually , the youngster was noticed , and promoted to the single-seater formula bmw racing series .
as a debutante , vettel was immediately runner-up , and the next year he came back and won an incredible 18 out of 20 races .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel 's tasted champagne as a winner five times in 2010 vettel moved on to formula 3 , where he never managed to claim the grand prize , but that was because his fame was already overtaking him and his rise up the ladder was accelerating .
in 2006 , he was given his first shot in a formula one car in a young driver test , immediately posting the fastest time .
the next year , in indianapolis , an injury to then bmw-sauber driver robert kubica gave vettel his chance on a race weekend .
still in his teens , he promptly became not only the youngest driver to compete in a grand prix -lrb- a record he has since lost -rrb- , but also the youngest-ever points-scorer in the sport 's history - bringing his bmw home in eighth on his debut .
the early-achiever continued tearing up f1 's age-related record book in the following season .
driving for the underfunded toro rosso team , vettel became the youngest ever pole-sitter and then winner in a single wet weekend in monza , doing the double for his minor team as the championship battle raged around him .
two years on , after being promoted to the red bull outfit , vettel has completed his cv , becoming the youngest world champion in the sport 's history , displacing 2008 winner lewis hamilton by less than a year .
" i am a bit speechless .
i do n't know what you are supposed to say at this moment , " a usually loquacious vettel admitted in the post-race press conference .
" to be honest i did n't know anything until i passed the checkered flag . "
vettel not only needed a win , championship leader fernando alonso had to finish fifth or lower for him to win the title , but the spanish ferrari driver had a poor race , and could only salvage seventh .
" i hate losing " bildunterschrift : the youngster 's love of winning is displayed by his trademark index-finger celebration vettel - never one to aim low - points to the three michaels as heroes of his childhood : michael schumacher , michael jordan and michael jackson .
vettel even dreamed of becoming a musician as a kid .
" it was funny when i finally realized that i did n't have the voice for it , " he admitted in later life .
nevertheless , vettel 's passion remained - he 's a huge beatles fan and record collector to this day .
vettel also tried out a number of sports in his youth before settling on motor racing .
" i never scored many goals , and did n't even get called on to play that often , " vettel lamented , recalling his time on the football pitch .
he also tried tennis , table tennis , and even beach volleyball , but never settled for long .
" i was just never the best , so i stopped playing .
i hate losing . "
finally , vettel started following in the first michael 's footsteps more seriously , turning his attention to racing – a sport whose ethos he seems to enjoy .
" it 's irrelevant whether you 're second or fifth .
the only important thing is being no. 1 . "
with 10 pole positions , five wins , and now a world championship in 2010 , vettel has achieved that goal .

finally , vettel started following in the first michael 's footsteps more seriously , turning his attention to racing – a sport whose ethos he seems to enjoy .
" it 's irrelevant whether you 're second or fifth .
the only important thing is being no. 1 . "
with 10 pole positions , five wins , and now a world championship in 2010 , vettel has achieved that goal .

after an eventful journey , dw reporter ali almakhlafi has reached mecca , and started answering dw users ' questions .
but first - a sudden change of clothes . on sunday , nov .
14 , the moment had come : two million pilgrims from all around the world , and i was right there in the middle of them .
i visited the holy al-haram mosque , and saw the kaaba at its center .
i 've got to admit it : i was completely mesmerized .
there is really such a big difference between seeing it in pictures or reading about it in articles , and actually standing in front of it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 100,000 security forces are there to protect some 2 million pilgrims i 've been to cologne cathedral , the vatican , and the hagia sophia in istanbul before .
but the kaaba is special to me .
childhood memories of religion class in yemen come up - and somehow things seem to have come full circle .
originally , i arrived with a group of pilgrims , but i lost them in the crowd .
never mind , i say to myself ; it 's good to be alone , for i first need to digest this experience by myself .
despite the kaaba 's deep impact on me , i 'm still here as a journalist .
well , as a journalist that looks like a pilgrim .
and just how did that come about ?
let me tell you .
after facing some unexpected problems , i decided to change my polo shirt and jeans for the pilgrim 's robes .
i decided i do n't want to be recognized as a visitor anymore .
i 've had enough trouble with that already .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt airport : pilgrims , saudis , and foreigners heading to jeddah in saudi arabia you really feel misplaced among the masses of muslim pilgrims if you are smooth-shaven and casually-dressed .
in fact , i 've felt like this since i left frankfurt airport : the other passengers gave me startled looks .
and at the check-in counter of saudi airlines , none of the employees expected me to have the special hajj-visa in my passport .
pilgrims need to get special luggage stickers , so that their cases arrive on the separate hajj terminal at jeddah airport .
well , i got the stickers and my luggage arrived at the right terminal as well .
but i did n't .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american movies with arabic subtitles are shown on the airplane after my flight , i found myself at the terminal for non-pilgrims .
the employees at jeddah airport had sent me there because of my " civilian " getup .
there i was – surrounded by international tourists and business people .
after more than an hour of confusion , i finally got the last shuttle bus to the proper terminal at around midnight .
i was the only passenger … or , the only one who was late .
an american in mecca that could n't have happened to jack -lrb- name changed -rrb- .
jack is american .
he converted to islam a few years ago .
we first meet at frankfurt airport .
i ask him about his white hajj-clothes .
i want to know how he feels in this outfit .
after all , most people from the west would only wear clothes like that to a costume party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stewardess with a modern interpretation of a traditional headscarf " this probably looks funny to some of the people here , i guess , " says jack .
" i can tell by their looks . "
but jack does n't care .
" the hajj-outfit is meant to be simple and modest .
it reveals that religious beliefs do n't distinguish between rich and poor , black and white , etc . "
jack makes his comments as a muslim , but the way he says them , with his typical american accent , it almost sounds more like an american ideal .
flying , shopping , watching cnn aboard my plane to jeddah , i make some more interesting observations .
for example : most pilgrims watch cnn .
some of them even watch american movies .
however , the movies ' love scenes are carefully retouched , even though they are rather harmless from a western point of view .
the stewardesses wear headscarves and speak english – even with the arab passengers .
and many of the bearded men , who first appeared to be rather strict , conservative , and humorless , turn out to be very friendly family men .
they play happily with their kids and advise their loosely veiled wives on what makeup to buy from the choice of duty free products .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hajj terminal at jeddah airport : 2 million people arrive here - with their luggage before i finally put on my new pilgrim 's outfit , i first want to thank all the dw users for commenting on my first diary entries on the english , german , and arabic dw facebook pages - and for wishing me a safe trip .
i would like to reply to a question posted by hans youssef ernst from germany on the arabic page : " i 'm a christian and i would like to accompany my muslim friends to religious feasts in mecca some day .
do you think that this will be possible in the future ? "
dear hans youssef , i do n't dare to try and make a forecast .
as far as i know , the koran does n't explicitly state that non-muslims are n't allowed to visit mecca - but , as always , this is a matter of interpretation .
from a saudi perspective , non-muslims are definitely not allowed to visit the holy sites of mecca .
as an islamic scholar told me here in mecca : " that should be accepted , just like western constitutions need to be accepted by muslims living in europe .
by no means , however , you should mistake this as a sign of a lack respect or even contempt for non-muslims . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw reporter ali almakhlafi can move on after a short delay among islamic scholars , you can find different opinions about this topic .
there 's even a prominent politician who strongly criticizes the current prohibition : libya 's muammar al-gaddafi – who 's clearly not known to be a good friend of the western world .
five years ago , gaddafi asked for christians and jews to be allowed to visit mecca .
however , so far nothing changed … this monday , november 15 , i want to experience the pilgrim 's prayers at mount arafat and i will then attend the feast of sacrifice at mina .
i 've already collected quite a number of voices from other pilgrims .
i 'll tell you more about them in my next diary entry .

however , no binding commitments or clear timelines were set . the 18th apec summit in yokohama ended slightly earlier than planned - perhaps because us president obama wanted to visit the city of kamakura or because there was a lack of commitment . the chair of the summit , japanese prime minister naoto kan , spoke just before lunch : " i can tell you that the state and government heads of the 21 apec nations have made a declaration that will be called the yokohama vision . " the asia-pacific region has shown its great strength for recovery .
in my opinion , it is one of the centers of the world economy and one of the driving forces behind further development . " balanced , sustainable and innovative growth the " yokohama vision " points out the direction towards growth for the future and stipulates that this should be balanced , sustainable , innovative , secure and inclusive but it sets no concrete deadlines .
what is clear is that the apec forum looks set to remain non-binding and optional . bildunterschrift : us president barack obama and japan 's prime minister naoto kan met on the sidelines of apec prime minister kan said the main goal remained the removal of trade barriers and added that other regional groupings would play a part in helping this be achieved . although kan joined a trans-pacific partnership summit held on the sidelines of apec as an observer , japan has not yet said whether it will become a member , despite overtures from the us and australia .
kan is in favor of japan joining but faces resistance in his government . obama urges a boosting of domestic demand beijing meanwhile prefers the " asean plus 3 " grouping , which does not include the us , as president barack obama hinted at in a speech that has worried some asian nations . " one of the important lessons the economic crisis taught us is the limit of depending primarily on american consumers and asian exports to drive economic growth , " obama said . " countries with large surpluses must shift away from an unhealthy dependence on exports and take steps to boost domestic demand . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were plenty of photo opportunities at the four-day summit this line has become almost like a mantra for president obama and he will surely take it up again when the us takes over the chair of the apec forum next year . apec 's 21 economies account for over 50 percent of the world ’ s global economy and more than 45 percent of its trade . author : peter kujath -lrb- act -rrb- editor : arun chowdhury send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after an eventful journey , dw reporter ali almakhlafi has reached mecca , and started answering dw users ' questions .
but first - a sudden change of clothes . on sunday , nov .
14 , the moment had come : two million pilgrims from all around the world , and i was right there in the middle of them .
i visited the holy al-haram mosque , and saw the kaaba at its center .
i 've got to admit it : i was completely mesmerized .
there is really such a big difference between seeing it in pictures or reading about it in articles , and actually standing in front of it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 100,000 security forces are there to protect some 2 million pilgrims i 've been to cologne cathedral , the vatican , and the hagia sophia in istanbul before .
but the kaaba is special to me .
childhood memories of religion class in yemen come up - and somehow things seem to have come full circle .
originally , i arrived with a group of pilgrims , but i lost them in the crowd .
never mind , i say to myself ; it 's good to be alone , for i first need to digest this experience by myself .
despite the kaaba 's deep impact on me , i 'm still here as a journalist .
well , as a journalist that looks like a pilgrim .
and just how did that come about ?
let me tell you .
after facing some unexpected problems , i decided to change my polo shirt and jeans for the pilgrim 's robes .
i decided i do n't want to be recognized as a visitor anymore .
i 've had enough trouble with that already .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt airport : pilgrims , saudis , and foreigners heading to jeddah in saudi arabia you really feel misplaced among the masses of muslim pilgrims if you are smooth-shaven and casually-dressed .
in fact , i 've felt like this since i left frankfurt airport : the other passengers gave me startled looks .
and at the check-in counter of saudi airlines , none of the employees expected me to have the special hajj-visa in my passport .
pilgrims need to get special luggage stickers , so that their cases arrive on the separate hajj terminal at jeddah airport .
well , i got the stickers and my luggage arrived at the right terminal as well .
but i did n't .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american movies with arabic subtitles are shown on the airplane after my flight , i found myself at the terminal for non-pilgrims .
the employees at jeddah airport had sent me there because of my " civilian " getup .
there i was – surrounded by international tourists and business people .
after more than an hour of confusion , i finally got the last shuttle bus to the proper terminal at around midnight .
i was the only passenger … or , the only one who was late .
an american in mecca that could n't have happened to jack -lrb- name changed -rrb- .
jack is american .
he converted to islam a few years ago .
we first meet at frankfurt airport .
i ask him about his white hajj-clothes .
i want to know how he feels in this outfit .
after all , most people from the west would only wear clothes like that to a costume party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stewardess with a modern interpretation of a traditional headscarf " this probably looks funny to some of the people here , i guess , " says jack .
" i can tell by their looks . "
but jack does n't care .
" the hajj-outfit is meant to be simple and modest .
it reveals that religious beliefs do n't distinguish between rich and poor , black and white , etc . "
jack makes his comments as a muslim , but the way he says them , with his typical american accent , it almost sounds more like an american ideal .
flying , shopping , watching cnn aboard my plane to jeddah , i make some more interesting observations .
for example : most pilgrims watch cnn .
some of them even watch american movies .
however , the movies ' love scenes are carefully retouched , even though they are rather harmless from a western point of view .
the stewardesses wear headscarves and speak english – even with the arab passengers .
and many of the bearded men , who first appeared to be rather strict , conservative , and humorless , turn out to be very friendly family men .
they play happily with their kids and advise their loosely veiled wives on what makeup to buy from the choice of duty free products .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hajj terminal at jeddah airport : 2 million people arrive here - with their luggage before i finally put on my new pilgrim 's outfit , i first want to thank all the dw users for commenting on my first diary entries on the english , german , and arabic dw facebook pages - and for wishing me a safe trip .
i would like to reply to a question posted by hans youssef ernst from germany on the arabic page : " i 'm a christian and i would like to accompany my muslim friends to religious feasts in mecca some day .
do you think that this will be possible in the future ? "
dear hans youssef , i do n't dare to try and make a forecast .
as far as i know , the koran does n't explicitly state that non-muslims are n't allowed to visit mecca - but , as always , this is a matter of interpretation .
from a saudi perspective , non-muslims are definitely not allowed to visit the holy sites of mecca .
as an islamic scholar told me here in mecca : " that should be accepted , just like western constitutions need to be accepted by muslims living in europe .
by no means , however , you should mistake this as a sign of a lack respect or even contempt for non-muslims . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw reporter ali almakhlafi can move on after a short delay among islamic scholars , you can find different opinions about this topic .
there 's even a prominent politician who strongly criticizes the current prohibition : libya 's muammar al-gaddafi – who 's clearly not known to be a good friend of the western world .
five years ago , gaddafi asked for christians and jews to be allowed to visit mecca .
however , so far nothing changed … this monday , november 15 , i want to experience the pilgrim 's prayers at mount arafat and i will then attend the feast of sacrifice at mina .
i 've already collected quite a number of voices from other pilgrims .
i 'll tell you more about them in my next diary entry .

the ministers are supporters of parliamentary speaker gianfranco fini , a berlusconi rival . political problems in italy continue to escalate as four ministers - europe minister andrea ronchi , deputy economic development minister adolfo urso and two junior ministers - resigned from their posts in the government on monday .
" we all agree today that we need to move to a new phase in the italian centre-right , " said urso on news channel skytg24 monday .
the resignations indicate waning support for prime minister silvio berlusconi .
the four ministers who resigned are all supporters of former berlusconi ally-turned-rival gianfranco fini , who is speaker of the parliament .
fini and his supports in the future and freedom movement hope to see berlusconi resign .
the demand follows the latest in a long-running series of sex-scandal allegations involving berlusconi .
earlier in the month , fini had threatened to start pulling ministers out of the government if berlusconi did n't step down .
monday 's resignations show fini made good on his promise .
budget comes first however , berlusconi has called for a vote of confidence in parliament and would be willing to face political rivals at the polls if snap elections are deemed necessary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fini would like to see berlusconi resign but such a vote is not likely to come before the italian government passes its 2011 budget in the coming weeks , a decision which is itself a thorny issue due to italy 's massive debt problem .
the political turmoil could play out in a number of different ways in italy .
should berlusconi lose a vote of confidence , it would be up to president giorgio napolitano to decide if the existing parliament could form a new government .
napolitano could also appoint an interim government until new elections can take place .
if no agreement can be reached on a new government , parliament would be dissolved and snap elections would take place within 70 days .

if no agreement can be reached on a new government , parliament would be dissolved and snap elections would take place within 70 days .

" everything is at stake - if the euro fails , europe will fail , " she told delegates at the christian democrats ' party convention , where she was reelected as head of her party .
" we need a new culture of stability in europe , " she added .
she even went so far as to criticize her predecessor , social democrat gerhard schroeder , for giving his consent for greece to join the eurozone , calling it " irresponsible " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's push for a crisis prevention mechanism are controversial harsh words on both sides the comments came as eu figures showed that greece 's deficit in 2009 rose to 15.4 percent of gdp , a big jump from the initial estimate of 13.6 percent .
greek prime minister george papandreou promptly hit back , insisting that measures proposed by germany to avoid future crises were pushing up interest rates paid by highly indebted countries like greece for their bonds .
" this could create a self-fulfilling prophecy , " papandreou said during a visit in paris .
" this could break backs .
this could force some economies into bankruptcy , " he added .
he was referring to plans by germany , supported by france , to make bondholders pay at least some of the costs in case of a default .
germany is also reluctant to extend the eurozone 's bailout package beyond 2013 .
politicians may balk at merkel 's frank words , but some analysts believe tough talk is long-overdue .
" involving investors in the costs of defaults is a good idea , " eugen keller , head of financial markets research at metzler bank told deutsche welle .
" fighting fire with fire , i.e. bailing out mortgage companies like fannie mae or freddie mac or companies like gm , as happened in the us , and in europe as well , is not a long-term solution , " he said .
keller points out that the credit bubble has built up over the years , with the discrepancies between loans issued and actual economic growth widening over several decades , especially in the us , but also in europe .
bildunterschrift : exports are the driving force behind germany 's economic motor swings and roundabouts while germany benefits enormously from the single currency , as 40 percent of its exports go to other eurozone members , and having one currency eliminates fluctuations in exchange rates , the risks of having the euro were indeed underestimated , according to keller .
" germany can afford to pay for other countries as part of the bailout package for greece for example , but at the end of the day , the differences between say germany and greece or italy in efficiency , for example when it comes to managing wage costs , are extreme , " keller told deutsche welle .
" our own stress tests as well as those of ratings agencies in 2008 , for example , have shown that the former greek currency , the drachme , would have had to be valued at 30 to 40 percent less in 2008 than at the time greece joined the eurozone . "

greek prime minister george papandreou promptly hit back , insisting that measures proposed by germany to avoid future crises were pushing up interest rates paid by highly indebted countries like greece for their bonds .
" this could create a self-fulfilling prophecy , " papandreou said during a visit in paris .
" this could break backs .
this could force some economies into bankruptcy , " he added .
he was referring to plans by germany , supported by france , to make bondholders pay at least some of the costs in case of a default .
germany is also reluctant to extend the eurozone 's bailout package beyond 2013 .

" involving investors in the costs of defaults is a good idea , " eugen keller , head of financial markets research at metzler bank told deutsche welle .
" fighting fire with fire , i.e. bailing out mortgage companies like fannie mae or freddie mac or companies like gm , as happened in the us , and in europe as well , is not a long-term solution , " he said .
keller points out that the credit bubble has built up over the years , with the discrepancies between loans issued and actual economic growth widening over several decades , especially in the us , but also in europe .
bildunterschrift : exports are the driving force behind germany 's economic motor swings and roundabouts while germany benefits enormously from the single currency , as 40 percent of its exports go to other eurozone members , and having one currency eliminates fluctuations in exchange rates , the risks of having the euro were indeed underestimated , according to keller .
" germany can afford to pay for other countries as part of the bailout package for greece for example , but at the end of the day , the differences between say germany and greece or italy in efficiency , for example when it comes to managing wage costs , are extreme , " keller told deutsche welle .
" our own stress tests as well as those of ratings agencies in 2008 , for example , have shown that the former greek currency , the drachme , would have had to be valued at 30 to 40 percent less in 2008 than at the time greece joined the eurozone . "

deutsche welle 's sports writer arnulf boettcher provides his take on germany 's new sports hero . germany has a new sports hero : sebastian vettel , the youngest world champion in formula one history .
born in the south-western german town of heppenheim , vettel wears the formula one crown at just 23 years old - and surely not for the last time .
germany 's other formula one world-champion , michael schumacher , was 25 when he won his first of a record seven titles .
like schumacher , vettel is known for his meticulousness and obsession over detail .
but unlike his role model schumacher , vettel does n't come across as so serious .
instead , vettel is seen as quick-witted , youthfully mischievous , and almost always smiling .
that 's what makes him so likeable on the formula one scene .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arnulf boettcher vettel almost become world champion last year .
he was held back by technical problems with his red bull car , but hasty mistakes were part of the problem , too .
he narrowly escaped meeting the same fate again this year .
but the setbacks only appear to have made him stronger .
in the decisive race , he took first place and made no mistakes in a dominating race where he was the best driver among his competitors .
ten pole positions and five victories make vettel a worthy and well-deserving champion .
fernando alonso is left pondering what might have been as his ferrari team implemented the wrong strategy in the final race in abu dhabi .
as for his title chances , alonso benefitted from an illegal team order : his ferrari teammate felipe massa was leading at the hockenheim race , but was ordered to let alonso through , securing an extra seven points for the spaniard .
red bull , on the other hand , did not issue team orders in the 2010 season and earned great respect from all sides .
vettel benefitted from the new points system that made formula one decidedly more exciting .
five drivers were in contention for the title heading into the second-to-last race , and for the final event four were still in the running .
in the end , vettel triumphed , after coming into the race in third place 15 points behind and without having even occupied top spot .
now germany can relish a world-title fairy tale and a youthful world champion .
but any expectations that vettel could someday overtake michael schumacher as the record world champion are misguided .
formula one has become much too fast-paced , and five different champions in the last five years speak for themselves .

deutsche welle 's sports writer arnulf boettcher provides his take on germany 's new sports hero . germany has a new sports hero : sebastian vettel , the youngest world champion in formula one history .
born in the south-western german town of heppenheim , vettel wears the formula one crown at just 23 years old - and surely not for the last time .
germany 's other formula one world-champion , michael schumacher , was 25 when he won his first of a record seven titles .
like schumacher , vettel is known for his meticulousness and obsession over detail .
but unlike his role model schumacher , vettel does n't come across as so serious .
instead , vettel is seen as quick-witted , youthfully mischievous , and almost always smiling .
that 's what makes him so likeable on the formula one scene .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arnulf boettcher vettel almost become world champion last year .
he was held back by technical problems with his red bull car , but hasty mistakes were part of the problem , too .

but the setbacks only appear to have made him stronger .
in the decisive race , he took first place and made no mistakes in a dominating race where he was the best driver among his competitors .
ten pole positions and five victories make vettel a worthy and well-deserving champion .

as for his title chances , alonso benefitted from an illegal team order : his ferrari teammate felipe massa was leading at the hockenheim race , but was ordered to let alonso through , securing an extra seven points for the spaniard .

if vettel appeared calm before the final race in abu dhabi , the 23-year-old german was overcome with emotion afterwards . sebastian vettel cried tears of joy after sunday 's race in abu dhabi , after his team radioed in to tell him he had clinched the world championship , seemingly against all the odds .
" unbelievable .
thank you lads .
i love you , " the 23-year-old german said with a quivering voice from the cockpit .
after that , all you could really make out on the transmission were loud cries of celebration from the man with the glittering helmet .
" baby schumi " was what the german tabloid press once called him , but it was michael schumacher himself who pointed out earlier this year that vettel had outgrown that nickname , and the youngster has now proved beyond any doubt that as world champion , he should stand in nobody 's shadow .
" i did n't know anything until i passed the checkered flag " this world championship is the high point of an already stellar career .
vettel was born in 1987 in the southwestern german town of heppenheim , and his father norbert ensured that sebastian was bitten by the motorsport bug very early .
aged four , vettel first thrashed a go-kart around his parents ' driveway , and his first successes - as with almost all modern racers - followed racing in go-karts in his youth .
eventually , the youngster was noticed , and promoted to the single-seater formula bmw racing series .
as a debutante , vettel was immediately runner-up , and the next year he came back and won an incredible 18 out of 20 races .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel 's tasted champagne as a winner five times in 2010 vettel moved on to formula 3 , where he never managed to claim the grand prize , but that was because his fame was already overtaking him and his rise up the ladder was accelerating .
in 2006 , he was given his first shot in a formula one car in a young driver test , immediately posting the fastest time .
the next year , in indianapolis , an injury to then bmw-sauber driver robert kubica gave vettel his chance on a race weekend .
still in his teens , he promptly became not only the youngest driver to compete in a grand prix -lrb- a record he has since lost -rrb- , but also the youngest-ever points-scorer in the sport 's history - bringing his bmw home in eighth on his debut .
the early-achiever continued tearing up f1 's age-related record book in the following season .
driving for the underfunded toro rosso team , vettel became the youngest ever pole-sitter and then winner in a single wet weekend in monza , doing the double for his minor team as the championship battle raged around him .
two years on , after being promoted to the red bull outfit , vettel has completed his cv , becoming the youngest world champion in the sport 's history , displacing 2008 winner lewis hamilton by less than a year .
" i am a bit speechless .
i do n't know what you are supposed to say at this moment , " a usually loquacious vettel admitted in the post-race press conference .
" to be honest i did n't know anything until i passed the checkered flag . "
vettel not only needed a win , championship leader fernando alonso had to finish fifth or lower for him to win the title , but the spanish ferrari driver had a poor race , and could only salvage seventh .
" i hate losing " bildunterschrift : the youngster 's love of winning is displayed by his trademark index-finger celebration vettel - never one to aim low - points to the three michaels as heroes of his childhood : michael schumacher , michael jordan and michael jackson .
vettel even dreamed of becoming a musician as a kid .
" it was funny when i finally realized that i did n't have the voice for it , " he admitted in later life .
nevertheless , vettel 's passion remained - he 's a huge beatles fan and record collector to this day .
vettel also tried out a number of sports in his youth before settling on motor racing .
" i never scored many goals , and did n't even get called on to play that often , " vettel lamented , recalling his time on the football pitch .
he also tried tennis , table tennis , and even beach volleyball , but never settled for long .
" i was just never the best , so i stopped playing .
i hate losing . "
finally , vettel started following in the first michael 's footsteps more seriously , turning his attention to racing – a sport whose ethos he seems to enjoy .
" it 's irrelevant whether you 're second or fifth .
the only important thing is being no. 1 . "
with 10 pole positions , five wins , and now a world championship in 2010 , vettel has achieved that goal .

one year after his death , human rights activists are calling attention to magnitsky 's death because the 37-year-old russian lawyer was never convicted of a crime , and spent a year in prison waiting to face charges of tax evasion .

the socialists won mayoral races in the capital athens as well as in greece 's second-largest city , thessaloniki , for the first time in over two decades .
voter turnout in athens was 33 percent , with a national average of 50 percent .
the results were an encouraging sign for greek prime minister george papandreou , after drastic wage and pension cuts and consumer tax increases prompted widespread protest in recent months .
" today the nation has indicated to us that we should proceed with our course , " papandreou said .
the poll results come ahead of a monday visit by officials from the european union and the international monetary fund to assess greece 's implementation of a bailout worth 110 billion euros -lrb- $ 150 billion -rrb- .
the eu 's statistics agency , eurostat , said in statement that greece 's 2009 budget deficit reached 15.4 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , almost two percent higher than projected .
analysts say the increase makes it unlikely that greece will reach its target of lowering the deficit to 8.1 percent of gdp by the end of the year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 15.11.2010 leverkusen midfielder rolfes hopes injury nightmare is finally over großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolfes is a big physical player with a good passing eye a succession of knee injuries meant simon rolfes missed the 2010 world cup - a nearly worst-case scenario for any footballer .
he talked to deutsche welle about the ups and downs of trying to come back . before there was sami khedira , there was simon rolfes .
the 28-year-old midfielder was originally the one tipped to take over the stopper role from ageing veteran michael ballack .
but a meniscus injury in july 2009 ultimately stopped rolfes in his tracks just as he was reaching the peak of his career .
rolfes played through pain that fall .
after all , his club , bayer leverkusen , was topping the table , and he had established himself as a regular in the german national side .
but by october he had developed articular cartilage damage and had no option but to have an operation .
the problems did n't go away , and he was forced to go under the knife again in january and acknowledge that his dream of competing in south africa was over .
“ we were on a sensational run with leverkusen and topping the table at the winter break , ” rolfes told deutsche welle .
“ my plan was to come back in the second half of the season and be a full part of the team , since the games i had played that season had been the best of my career .
so , of course , the weeks following the january operation were really hard .
i realized i was n't going to play any role at all either in the bundesliga season or the world cup . ”
a slow but steady developer , rolfes had become an international caliber midfielder .
now he was forced to watch khedira take on a role in the german squad that he himself would have probably occupied , had he not been hurt .
khedira performed well in south africa and landed a deal with real madrid .
meanwhile , rolfes was just trying to regain his basic fitness .
daily drudgery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolfes had been getting regular starts for germany in one respect , rolfes has been lucky .
the injuries he suffered have ended many a footballer 's career .
but rehab work , to hear him describe it , is a total slog , and it is difficult for a top athlete to acknowledge that , through no fault of one 's own , one is not at the level one was just a few months before .
“ it takes time to accept and start looking forward again , ” rolfes said .
“ after the operation i was on crutches for eight weeks … and it hardly a lot of fun to lie around at home , exercising your leg or knee with a machine for six hours a day and watching your muscles virtually disappear . ”
rolfes also said that when he was able to work out with a football again , it was hard at first to commit to challenges .
overcoming fear , he said , came gradually as he got used to playing scrimmages in training sessions .
“ it 's such a long process , and in the beginning you ca n't imagine yourself being on the pitch again , ” rolfes remembered .
“ but step for step , they bring you along , and then at some point it 's over .
you get your confidence back in practice . ”
practice , in this case , does n't make perfect .
it gives a player the chance to regain what he 's lost .
positive outlook bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coming back from a knee injury takes lots of hard , boring work rolfes made his bundesliga comeback in late september , and so far , he 's been pretty good .
last month , he scored a pair of goals to help leverkusen beat wolfsburg , even though he only came on as a late substitute .
and perhaps more encouragingly , he 's played for a full 90 minutes in his last two games .
he also provided the assist for leverkusen 's lone goal in their win agaist st. pauli on the weekend , which took the team up to second in the bundesliga standings .
but will he ever be able to recapture the status he once had with germany head coach joachim loew ?
competition for spots in the midfield is fierce , with not even nominal team captain michael ballack being assured of making the squad .
rolfes draws hope from the very vagaries of football that put him out of commission for much of 2009 and 2010 .
“ a year ago , no one would have thought that bastian schweinsteiger and sami khedira would be the central midfielders at the world cup , ” rolfes said .
“ and likewise , no one knows what 's going to happen in two or three years ' time .
there 's always the possibility of injuries and other circumstances .
so you should n't concentrate on whether it 's difficult or not . ”
and rolfes does n't need to look far to find an example of hope .
his teammate at leverkusen , striker patrick helmes , was also knocked out of germany 's world cup squad by an injury , but has gotten a call-up to play in the nationalelf 's friendly against sweden this coming wednesday .
so even though rolfes has dropped off the radar screen of many casual germany fans , it would n't be all that surprising to find him on the plane when yogi and co. travel to euro 2012 in poland and ukraine , or even the 2014 world cup in brazil .
simon rolfes was interviewed by kamilla jarzina for dw-tv 's bundesliga kick off program .

the ministers are supporters of parliamentary speaker gianfranco fini , a berlusconi rival . political problems in italy continue to escalate as four ministers - europe minister andrea ronchi , deputy economic development minister adolfo urso and two junior ministers - resigned from their posts in the government on monday .
" we all agree today that we need to move to a new phase in the italian centre-right , " said urso on news channel skytg24 monday .
the resignations indicate waning support for prime minister silvio berlusconi .
the four ministers who resigned are all supporters of former berlusconi ally-turned-rival gianfranco fini , who is speaker of the parliament .
fini and his supports in the future and freedom movement hope to see berlusconi resign .
the demand follows the latest in a long-running series of sex-scandal allegations involving berlusconi .
earlier in the month , fini had threatened to start pulling ministers out of the government if berlusconi did n't step down .
monday 's resignations show fini made good on his promise .
budget comes first however , berlusconi has called for a vote of confidence in parliament and would be willing to face political rivals at the polls if snap elections are deemed necessary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fini would like to see berlusconi resign but such a vote is not likely to come before the italian government passes its 2011 budget in the coming weeks , a decision which is itself a thorny issue due to italy 's massive debt problem .
the political turmoil could play out in a number of different ways in italy .
should berlusconi lose a vote of confidence , it would be up to president giorgio napolitano to decide if the existing parliament could form a new government .
napolitano could also appoint an interim government until new elections can take place .
if no agreement can be reached on a new government , parliament would be dissolved and snap elections would take place within 70 days .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 15.11.2010 merkel reelected as head of christian democratic union party großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel needed a good election result chancellor angela merkel has won reelection as leader of the christian democratic union .
she gained widespread support at this week 's party conference , which comes ahead of several key state elections in 2011 . german chancellor angela merkel has been reelected as head of her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- party , a sign that the party stands behind merkel despite recent doubts of the effectiveness of merkel and the cdu in leading the government . merkel ran unopposed and garnered the support of just over 90 percent of her party colleagues .
two years ago she received 95 percent of the votes when she was elected party head .
observers believed a drastic drop in that number would have indicated discontent from within the cdu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stuttgart rail project has proven to be deeply divisive merkel 's cdu and its junior coalition partner , the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , have taken a beating in the opinion polls over the last year over an unpopular bailout for fellow eurozone member greece , the decision to extend the operating lives of nuclear power plants and an expensive rail infrastructure project in stuttgart that has inspired massive local protests . with elections to be held in six of germany 's 16 states , 2011 is set to be a key year for merkel 's government .
earlier this year , the center-right coalition already suffered a major blow when it lost power in the country 's most populous state north rhine-westphalia and control of the bundesrat , the country 's upper house of parliament , along with it . leadership renewal the cdu took another hit when president horst koehler stepped down in june after being criticized for suggesting the german military had a role in protecting the country 's economic interests .
several other big names have left the political stage and merkel is set to get a new team of leaders standing behind her . around 1,000 cdu delegates are gathered in karlsruhe , where the party also voted on merkel ’ s four deputy leaders .
education minister annette schavan was reelected to the post , while environment minister norbert roettgen , labor minister ursula von der leyen and hesse premier volker bouffier recieved their first nominations . schaeuble put to task ahead of the party conference , merkel reiterated her support for finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , whose suitability for the job has been questioned recently due to chronic health problems , which led the minister to a three-week hospitalization last month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble insists he 's fit enough to keep his post merkel maintained that schaeuble was a capable minister and that the party ’ s support for him was strong , telling zdf public television , " i enjoy being chancellor with schaeuble as my finance minister . " however , schaeuble ’ s health was not the only source of stress for the finance minister . merkel and schaeuble - who just returned from a g20 conference in seoul , where they defended germany ’ s trade surplus - have repelled demands for tax cuts , as politicians from both within and outside of the party have called for a strong reform to germany ’ s tax laws . cdu parliamentarian christian von stetten told the sunday newspaper bild am sonntag that an improvement to the current laws was needed : " if we don ’ t put through a tax simplification law that earns that name , then we aren ’ t taking our voters seriously , " he said . schaeuble , meanwhile , said that he was open to discussions on improving the tax law with government deputies in parliament . divisive issues also on monday , german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg is due to present delegates in karlsruhe with his plan for reforming germany ’ s military .
the delegates are expected to pass a resolution on ending military conscription in germany , despite the fact that the party has traditionally advocated maintaining compulsory military service for young men .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg advocates an ende to conscription another topic to be discussed is the question of preimplantation genetic diagnosis - the testing of artificially fertilized human eggs for congenital disorders prior to implantation . the issue has been hotly debated in recent weeks , with opponents of the practice claiming it to be a precursor to genetic engineering of human beings .
while the cdu remains divided over the matter , merkel has come out in favor of a ban , claiming it was impossible to differentiate between minor and major congenital disorders . merkel told zdf that she was , however , open to discussion on the topic .
" we will conduct this debate with great mutual respect , " she said .
she added that neither position in the debate was the " christian " one , as the issue divided even church authorities . author : david levitz , holly fox -lrb- afp , ap , dpa , -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the socialists won mayoral races in the capital athens as well as in greece 's second-largest city , thessaloniki , for the first time in over two decades .
voter turnout in athens was 33 percent , with a national average of 50 percent .
the results were an encouraging sign for greek prime minister george papandreou , after drastic wage and pension cuts and consumer tax increases prompted widespread protest in recent months .
" today the nation has indicated to us that we should proceed with our course , " papandreou said .
the poll results come ahead of a monday visit by officials from the european union and the international monetary fund to assess greece 's implementation of a bailout worth 110 billion euros -lrb- $ 150 billion -rrb- .
the eu 's statistics agency , eurostat , said in statement that greece 's 2009 budget deficit reached 15.4 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , almost two percent higher than projected .
analysts say the increase makes it unlikely that greece will reach its target of lowering the deficit to 8.1 percent of gdp by the end of the year .

" this is an exciting time for science - something like a revolution , " said jiri rathousky , the project 's leader , as he demonstrated a contraption called a dip coater in the lab of the newly-opened center .
the center – aided by funding from the european union – is the pride and joy of the heyrovsky institute of physical chemistry , a rather drab concrete tower block in the northern suburbs of prague .
hidden away on the sixth floor , rathousky and his colleagues in white overalls are doing some truly remarkable things with very small materials .
the magic of photocatalysts " for example here we coat sheets of glass with a thin layer of a nanostructure called titanium dioxide , " rathousky explained .
" titanium dioxide is a very efficient photocatalyst , and in this way , we obtain a photocatalytically active surface .
this type of photocatalytically active surface can be used for example in air-conditioning , for cleaning the air , and for removal of pollutants by the action of light . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the paint cleared a cube of cigarette smoke in one hour photocatalysts , substances that speed up a chemical reaction when light hits them , have tremendous practical uses like sterilization and air cleansing .
in a small , rather dilapidated factory on the outskirts of prague , a company called advanced materials is putting titanium dioxide to use in something called photocatalytic paint , an incredibly clever , virtually translucent paint that actually cleans the air in your living room of everything from bacteria to cigarette smoke .
" even in a concentration of one cigarette per cubic metre , you see very high degradation rate , " said jan prochazka , advanced materials ' co-owner .
in one hour , he said , a cubic meter box used to test the paint is clean of cigarette smoke .
" we say -lsb- the paint will oxidize -rsb- ninety percent of all contaminants in 24 hours , but it 's much faster .
it 's just to stay on the safe side , " prochazka added .
molecular reaction the tiny titanium dioxide molecules in the paint react to uv rays in sunlight or special lamps , oxidizing everything from carcinogens to allergens to dust mites .
that means that titanium oxide molecules react with smoke or bacteria , essentially consuming it .
that leaves a by-product of water and carbon dioxide , which are harmless .
photocatalytic paint has been around for a while , but he says that their new technique has been refined to be hundreds of times more powerful and efficient , and could revolutionize the way air is cleaned in homes and offices .
however , this technique is still relatively new , and a 2008 study from the lawrence berkeley national laboratory in the us found that photocatalytic oxidization may increase the presence of formaldehyde , a potentially dangerous chemical , in a real-life , indoor setting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one industry analyst called nanotech " the oil industry of the future " undeterred , advanced materials is already shipping their product to spain , south africa and new zealand , and licences to make it in other countries are already being drawn up . the success of advanced materials and the creation of the nanocentre in prague have led some in the czech media to speak of the czech republic as having the potential to become a major force in nanotechnology in europe .
huge growth ahead but perhaps all of this trumpeting should be taken with a pinch of salt .
" nanotech is the new oil industry , " said dean freeman , a nanotech industry analyst with gartner research .
" there are many opportunities in the nanotech space for research .
the key is making a product that can get traction and be sold commercially .
from a research perspective i have not seen a great deal on nanotech from the czech republic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de motor racing -pipe- 15.11.2010 forget ' baby schumi , ' now sebastian vettel is world champion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not just a champion , but the youngest in f1 history sebastian vettel has become the youngest world champion in the history of formula one .
if vettel appeared calm before the final race in abu dhabi , the 23-year-old german was overcome with emotion afterwards . sebastian vettel cried tears of joy after sunday 's race in abu dhabi , after his team radioed in to tell him he had clinched the world championship , seemingly against all the odds .
" unbelievable .
thank you lads .
i love you , " the 23-year-old german said with a quivering voice from the cockpit .
after that , all you could really make out on the transmission were loud cries of celebration from the man with the glittering helmet .
" baby schumi " was what the german tabloid press once called him , but it was michael schumacher himself who pointed out earlier this year that vettel had outgrown that nickname , and the youngster has now proved beyond any doubt that as world champion , he should stand in nobody 's shadow .
" i did n't know anything until i passed the checkered flag " this world championship is the high point of an already stellar career .
vettel was born in 1987 in the southwestern german town of heppenheim , and his father norbert ensured that sebastian was bitten by the motorsport bug very early .
aged four , vettel first thrashed a go-kart around his parents ' driveway , and his first successes - as with almost all modern racers - followed racing in go-karts in his youth .

if vettel appeared calm before the final race in abu dhabi , the 23-year-old german was overcome with emotion afterwards . sebastian vettel cried tears of joy after sunday 's race in abu dhabi , after his team radioed in to tell him he had clinched the world championship , seemingly against all the odds .
" unbelievable .
thank you lads .
i love you , " the 23-year-old german said with a quivering voice from the cockpit .
after that , all you could really make out on the transmission were loud cries of celebration from the man with the glittering helmet .
" baby schumi " was what the german tabloid press once called him , but it was michael schumacher himself who pointed out earlier this year that vettel had outgrown that nickname , and the youngster has now proved beyond any doubt that as world champion , he should stand in nobody 's shadow .
" i did n't know anything until i passed the checkered flag " this world championship is the high point of an already stellar career .
vettel was born in 1987 in the southwestern german town of heppenheim , and his father norbert ensured that sebastian was bitten by the motorsport bug very early .
aged four , vettel first thrashed a go-kart around his parents ' driveway , and his first successes - as with almost all modern racers - followed racing in go-karts in his youth .
eventually , the youngster was noticed , and promoted to the single-seater formula bmw racing series .
as a debutante , vettel was immediately runner-up , and the next year he came back and won an incredible 18 out of 20 races .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 15.11.2010 eu plans to loosen zero tolerance policy on gm crops großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genetically modified animal feed could soon be imported into europe leaked documents suggest the european union is planning to loosen its zero tolerance ban on genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- plants .
environmental campaigners are outraged , saying the crops are still potentially dangerous . according to environmental group friends of the earth europe -lrb- foee -rrb- , the european commission is planning to allow traces of non-approved gm crops in imports coming into europe -lrb- with a threshold of 0.1 percent -rrb- .
" europe would effectively open its borders for gm crops which are not authorized or assessed for their safety in any country of the world , " an foee statement said .
a number of european union governments on monday urged the bloc 's executive to allow tiny traces of gm material in food imports for human consumption as well as in animal feed , an eu source said .
however , it is not yet clear whether enough eu governments support the change to force the european commission to amend its proposal , and a final decision is unlikely before january at the earliest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers say the imports are necessary to keep prices down " the european commission is bowing to the scaremongering tactics of the biotech industry , and as a result , opening europe 's markets to unauthorized gm food and feed . "
mute schimpf , an foee food campaigner said .
" europe 's laws on genetically modified foods are there for a reason – to protect the public and the environment . "
biotech pressure environmentalists believe that the eu 's hand is being forced by the bio-technology industry , which is arguing that the eu 's total ban on gm crops could bring about a crisis in the feed sector , and farmers may be forced to slaughter animals rather than let them starve .
" this is based upon the false argument that international trade is severely disrupted when shipments of feed containing unauthorised gm feed are rejected , " the foee said .
the campaigners claimed that no shipment from any feed importing country -lrb- us , argentina or brazil -rrb- was rejected at a european port in 2010 .
" the right of the public to say no to gm foods and feeds must be respected , " schimpf demanded .
" member states should reject this proposal and maintain europe 's position on zero tolerance . "
farmers ' interests but european farmer organizations have shown little concern over the proposal .
amanda cheesley , spokeswoman for copa cogeca , the umbrella group of european farming organizations , told deutsche welle , " we are not averse to imports of gm feed coming in .
if it 's been approved under the commission 's authorization procedures , then we do n't have a problem with it . "
cheesley believes that the eu 's current zero tolerance policy is unsustainable .
" we want a solution to be found to that because in practise you ca n't have zero tolerance , " she said .
" it stops imports coming in , which means that feed prices go too high for livestock . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has criticized the eu 's gm assessment procedures cheesley says that europe 's farmers have other worries .
" we have concerns about the commission 's proposals to let member states have different policies on gm products , " she said .
the commission made legal proposals in july to allow national governments make their own decisions on the controversial crops , in a bid to break the longstanding eu deadlock on new gm product approvals .
but a new opinion from the eu council of ministers ' legal service could deal a fatal blow to the plans , after several eu governments already expressed fears that the draft law risks breaching world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- rules .
new guidelines the european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- has also set out new guidelines for biotech companies submitting gm crops for eu approval on friday , including on possible long-term effects of gm crops and their impacts on insects and other plants .
the new guidelines follow a request from eu governments in 2008 to strengthen efsa 's gm crop assessment procedures , and criticism from countries including france that efsa had failed to take full account of environmental concerns when approving new crops .
france has refused to discuss european commission proposals to let member states decide whether to grow or ban gm crops , until the eu 's assessment procedures have been strengthened .
in december , the commission is due to publish a report on the socio-economic risks and benefits of gm crops , and new rules on monitoring gm crops are due next year , as part of the wider overhaul of the bloc 's approval and assessment procedures .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 15.11.2010 ireland is still sidestepping what experts say is inevitable : a bailout großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plenty of irish voters are n't happy these days will ireland accept a bailout and help reverse a bond sell-off among the eurozone 's deficit-laden nations ?
the country is still refusing but so did greece before it bowed to pressure . speculation is rife about ireland 's course of action , as the country 's borrowing costs last week shot to record highs on concerns of a deficit set to hit 32 percent of gross domestic product this year .
monday kicked off with a report in the irish independent newspaper claiming that at a meeting of eurozone finance ministers this week , ireland plans to ask for money from the european union 's emergency fund to rescue its banks .
prompt denial an irish minister promptly fired off a denial about the country being in direct discussions about a bailout package from the european union .
while acknowledging that ireland is in " continuous talks " with the eu about its growing debt , dick roche , junior minister for european affairs , told newstalk radio that it is " frankly wrong and grossly irresponsible that this story is being said and that a frenzy is being created out there . "
the opposition claimed europe had already started moves to rescue the country , but the irish government denied it would need a bailout .
" ireland has made no application for external support .
ongoing contacts continue at official level with international colleagues in light of current market conditions , " a finance ministry spokesman said .
the rumor mill is almost certain to continue with every new day of uncertainty confronting irish banks .
at the end of last month , they owed 130 billion euros -lrb- $ 177 billion -rrb- of outstanding european central bank loans , up from 119 billion euros a month earlier .
numbers being floated around as part of a bailout deal range between 50 and 77 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment in ireland has soared to 13.2 percent the eu is reported to be keen for ireland to accept aid to avert a greek-style scenario in which budget problems in one country plunge the entire eurozone into crisis .
on monday , european central bank council member miguel angel fernandez ordonez prodded ireland to make a " final decision " on its fiscal crisis in a move to calm markets .
" the situation in the markets in recent weeks has been very negative due in some way to the lack of a final decision by ireland , " he told reporters in madrid .
" it 's not me who should take a decision about ireland ; it 's ireland that should take the right decision at the right moment . "
but the clock is ticking .
" i think ireland can hold out another three to four months maximum , and it should , hoping that some positive surprise on growth might calm the markets , " unicredit group chief economist marco annunziata told deutsche welle .
" but investors will remain nervous until the question is settled of whether or not eurozone sovereign debts might be restructured . "
stability program on track another european expert , who asked not to be identified , said the european finance ministers could reach a decision as early as this week to funnel funds to irish banks .
" these funds , which would help stabilize the banks , would be seen as a limited intervention , " the expert said .
there is no question about ireland 's sovereign debt , the expert added : the irish government has no immediate need for cash , being fully funded until mid-2011 , and its stability program is on track bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish banks owe billions to the european central bank germany has also pressed for ireland to accept aid , insiders say .
allaying investor concerns about irish finances would help advance chancellor angela merkel 's plan to require investors to help pay for future rescues .
european leaders , however , remain divided on merkel 's proposal , as they do on whether the ecb should keep buying bonds of debt-laden countries .
ireland 's debt problems stem largely from the country 's popped real estate bubble , when its local banks lent money too freely for construction projects .
on top of that was the irish government 's decision to provide a blanket guarantee to all bank creditors .
as a result , the country has experienced the worst recession of any major economy .
it has amassed debt of more than 100 billion euros and is struggling with an unemployment rate of 13.2 percent .
tough fiscal conditions a rescue plan would be deeply unpopular with irish voters , who value national independence and the low-tax regime that lured in foreign investment from u.s. and other non-european companies , fueling high growth rates over the past 20 years .
indeed , an eu bailout , with tough fiscal conditions attached , would be humiliating for a country once celebrated for its rags-to-riches transformation .
not unsurprisingly , critics of ireland 's action plan – or lack thereof – are wary of the country 's every move .
karel lannoo , chief executive officer of the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- in brussels , says the country should have acted long ago to steer clear of the financial challenges it now faces .
" ireland should never have given blanket coverage to banks in the first place , " lannoo told deutsche welle .
" and it should have let some of the banks fail . "
lannoo now questions the repercussions for europe .
" how many more of these financial disasters can we have ? " he asked .

meanwhile , others wondered how a problem of this magnitude could even happen . the death toll from haiti 's cholera epidemic has reached more than 900 and the disease is present in six of the 10 provinces of the earthquake-battered caribbean country , the health ministry said over the weekend .
more than 15,000 people have been infected since the epidemic 's outbreak in late october , the health ministry said sunday , and the epidemic showed no sign of abating .
there were 120 new deaths since friday 's toll .
according to the ministry on monday , 917 people have died of the disease so far .
worse expected to come according to un estimates , up to 200,000 people could fall ill with cholera .

efforts are centering on preventing the disease from spreading in crowded city slums and tent camps that house over 1.3 million homeless people who survived the cataclysmic earthquake , nearly a year ago .
but the facts of the epidemic raise the question of how such a preventable disease could break out in a country that has been flooded with hundreds of millions of euros in foreign assistance since the earthquake .
resource coordination is problem " huge sums in aid money have gone there , but the people in the north seem to have been left to their own devices , " sven stockrahm , a journalist with german newspaper die zeit who wrote about the earthquake , told deutsche welle .
stockrahm stressed that his critical remarks were not aimed at humanitarian aid workers , who by all accounts are doing vital work under very trying circumstances .
the key question is whether a better coordination of the resources in place could have prevented cholera from occurring in the first place .
bildunterschrift : aid workers are working ahrd to meet the needs of growing patient numbers but clear answers are difficult to come by where haiti is concerned .

poor sanitation , even pre-earthquake what is certain is that conditions in haiti even before the earthquake were far from adequate .
a study by the world health organization and unicef found that open defecation was prevalent among just under half of rural haitians and that 3.7 million of haiti 's total population of 9 million had no reliable source of clean drinking water .
moreover , from 1990 to 2008 , conditions deteriorated .
a similar study by the united nations in 2009 determined that 42 percent of haitians were not using an " improved water source . "
haiti ranks dead last among countries in south america and the caribbean in all major water and hygiene categories .
" cholera is a sickness of poverty that is common in refugee camps where there ’ s not enough drinking water , " ernst diekmann - a doctor with germany 's society for technical cooperation , or gtz - told deutsche welle .
" haiti was already an underprivileged country , and the situation was exacerbated by the natural catastrophe . "
problem exacerbated by refugees nonetheless , aid workers acknowledge that pre-existing deficiencies and the slow recovery process are two parts of the same overall problem that encouraged the cholera outbreak .
and the issue of earthquake refugees only exacerbates those problems .
bildunterschrift : as the disease spreads , burials are on the rise " the dramatic thing about haiti is that even before the earthquake the health infrastructure was fully inadequate , " said joost butenop , a medical adviser to the aid organization caritas .

off the record , many people who work in the aid and assistance sector say that shortcomings in coordination often prevent help from getting where it 's needed - or problems from being effectively anticipated .
that task falls to the united nations and the haitian government , and representatives of the former have openly admitted that the situation in haiti tests their limits .
the will to help is there .
germany 's ministry for economic cooperation and development , for instance , says that most of the 51.4 million euros -lrb- $ 72 million -rrb- it was allocated for haiti has already been distributed or earmarked for future projects .
yet merely distinguishing between emergency needs and long-term developmental requirements , and figuring out which government ministry is responsible , can be a complicated process .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 15.11.2010 eu plans to loosen zero tolerance policy on gm crops großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genetically modified animal feed could soon be imported into europe leaked documents suggest the european union is planning to loosen its zero tolerance ban on genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- plants .
environmental campaigners are outraged , saying the crops are still potentially dangerous . according to environmental group friends of the earth europe -lrb- foee -rrb- , the european commission is planning to allow traces of non-approved gm crops in imports coming into europe -lrb- with a threshold of 0.1 percent -rrb- .
" europe would effectively open its borders for gm crops which are not authorized or assessed for their safety in any country of the world , " an foee statement said .
a number of european union governments on monday urged the bloc 's executive to allow tiny traces of gm material in food imports for human consumption as well as in animal feed , an eu source said .
however , it is not yet clear whether enough eu governments support the change to force the european commission to amend its proposal , and a final decision is unlikely before january at the earliest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers say the imports are necessary to keep prices down " the european commission is bowing to the scaremongering tactics of the biotech industry , and as a result , opening europe 's markets to unauthorized gm food and feed . "
mute schimpf , an foee food campaigner said .
" europe 's laws on genetically modified foods are there for a reason – to protect the public and the environment . "
biotech pressure environmentalists believe that the eu 's hand is being forced by the bio-technology industry , which is arguing that the eu 's total ban on gm crops could bring about a crisis in the feed sector , and farmers may be forced to slaughter animals rather than let them starve .
" this is based upon the false argument that international trade is severely disrupted when shipments of feed containing unauthorised gm feed are rejected , " the foee said .
the campaigners claimed that no shipment from any feed importing country -lrb- us , argentina or brazil -rrb- was rejected at a european port in 2010 .
" the right of the public to say no to gm foods and feeds must be respected , " schimpf demanded .
" member states should reject this proposal and maintain europe 's position on zero tolerance . "
farmers ' interests but european farmer organizations have shown little concern over the proposal .
amanda cheesley , spokeswoman for copa cogeca , the umbrella group of european farming organizations , told deutsche welle , " we are not averse to imports of gm feed coming in .
if it 's been approved under the commission 's authorization procedures , then we do n't have a problem with it . "
cheesley believes that the eu 's current zero tolerance policy is unsustainable .
" we want a solution to be found to that because in practise you ca n't have zero tolerance , " she said .
" it stops imports coming in , which means that feed prices go too high for livestock . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has criticized the eu 's gm assessment procedures cheesley says that europe 's farmers have other worries .
" we have concerns about the commission 's proposals to let member states have different policies on gm products , " she said .
the commission made legal proposals in july to allow national governments make their own decisions on the controversial crops , in a bid to break the longstanding eu deadlock on new gm product approvals .
but a new opinion from the eu council of ministers ' legal service could deal a fatal blow to the plans , after several eu governments already expressed fears that the draft law risks breaching world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- rules .
new guidelines the european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- has also set out new guidelines for biotech companies submitting gm crops for eu approval on friday , including on possible long-term effects of gm crops and their impacts on insects and other plants .
the new guidelines follow a request from eu governments in 2008 to strengthen efsa 's gm crop assessment procedures , and criticism from countries including france that efsa had failed to take full account of environmental concerns when approving new crops .
france has refused to discuss european commission proposals to let member states decide whether to grow or ban gm crops , until the eu 's assessment procedures have been strengthened .
in december , the commission is due to publish a report on the socio-economic risks and benefits of gm crops , and new rules on monitoring gm crops are due next year , as part of the wider overhaul of the bloc 's approval and assessment procedures .

deutsche welle 's sports writer arnulf boettcher provides his take on germany 's new sports hero . germany has a new sports hero : sebastian vettel , the youngest world champion in formula one history .
born in the south-western german town of heppenheim , vettel wears the formula one crown at just 23 years old - and surely not for the last time .
germany 's other formula one world-champion , michael schumacher , was 25 when he won his first of a record seven titles .
like schumacher , vettel is known for his meticulousness and obsession over detail .
but unlike his role model schumacher , vettel does n't come across as so serious .
instead , vettel is seen as quick-witted , youthfully mischievous , and almost always smiling .
that 's what makes him so likeable on the formula one scene .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arnulf boettcher vettel almost become world champion last year .
he was held back by technical problems with his red bull car , but hasty mistakes were part of the problem , too .
he narrowly escaped meeting the same fate again this year .
but the setbacks only appear to have made him stronger .
in the decisive race , he took first place and made no mistakes in a dominating race where he was the best driver among his competitors .
ten pole positions and five victories make vettel a worthy and well-deserving champion .
fernando alonso is left pondering what might have been as his ferrari team implemented the wrong strategy in the final race in abu dhabi .
as for his title chances , alonso benefitted from an illegal team order : his ferrari teammate felipe massa was leading at the hockenheim race , but was ordered to let alonso through , securing an extra seven points for the spaniard .
red bull , on the other hand , did not issue team orders in the 2010 season and earned great respect from all sides .
vettel benefitted from the new points system that made formula one decidedly more exciting .
five drivers were in contention for the title heading into the second-to-last race , and for the final event four were still in the running .
in the end , vettel triumphed , after coming into the race in third place 15 points behind and without having even occupied top spot .
now germany can relish a world-title fairy tale and a youthful world champion .
but any expectations that vettel could someday overtake michael schumacher as the record world champion are misguided .
formula one has become much too fast-paced , and five different champions in the last five years speak for themselves .
arnulf boettcher writes for dw 's sports department -lrb- mz -rrb- editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de forget ' baby schumi , ' now sebastian vettel is world champion sebastian vettel has become the youngest world champion in the history of formula one .
if vettel appeared calm before the final race in abu dhabi , the 23-year-old german was overcome with emotion afterwards .
-lrb- 15.11.2010 -rrb- sebastian vettel races to formula one world championship german formula one driver sebastian vettel has become the sport 's youngest champion after winning the abu dhabi grand prix .
the perfectly executed race caps a successful season for vettel and his red bull team .
-lrb- 14.11.2010 -rrb- vettel remains dark horse in season that should have been his sebastian vettel is one of four drivers with a shot at the formula one drivers ' championship in abu dhabi .
but not even victory on sunday would guarantee success , in a season the young german might have dominated .

after an eventful journey , dw reporter ali almakhlafi has reached mecca , and started answering dw users ' questions .
but first - a sudden change of clothes . on sunday , nov .
14 , the moment had come : two million pilgrims from all around the world , and i was right there in the middle of them .
i visited the holy al-haram mosque , and saw the kaaba at its center .
i 've got to admit it : i was completely mesmerized .
there is really such a big difference between seeing it in pictures or reading about it in articles , and actually standing in front of it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 100,000 security forces are there to protect some 2 million pilgrims i 've been to cologne cathedral , the vatican , and the hagia sophia in istanbul before .
but the kaaba is special to me .
childhood memories of religion class in yemen come up - and somehow things seem to have come full circle .
originally , i arrived with a group of pilgrims , but i lost them in the crowd .
never mind , i say to myself ; it 's good to be alone , for i first need to digest this experience by myself .
despite the kaaba 's deep impact on me , i 'm still here as a journalist .
well , as a journalist that looks like a pilgrim .
and just how did that come about ?
let me tell you .
after facing some unexpected problems , i decided to change my polo shirt and jeans for the pilgrim 's robes .
i decided i do n't want to be recognized as a visitor anymore .
i 've had enough trouble with that already .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt airport : pilgrims , saudis , and foreigners heading to jeddah in saudi arabia you really feel misplaced among the masses of muslim pilgrims if you are smooth-shaven and casually-dressed .
in fact , i 've felt like this since i left frankfurt airport : the other passengers gave me startled looks .
and at the check-in counter of saudi airlines , none of the employees expected me to have the special hajj-visa in my passport .
pilgrims need to get special luggage stickers , so that their cases arrive on the separate hajj terminal at jeddah airport .
well , i got the stickers and my luggage arrived at the right terminal as well .
but i did n't .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american movies with arabic subtitles are shown on the airplane after my flight , i found myself at the terminal for non-pilgrims .
the employees at jeddah airport had sent me there because of my " civilian " getup .
there i was – surrounded by international tourists and business people .
after more than an hour of confusion , i finally got the last shuttle bus to the proper terminal at around midnight .
i was the only passenger … or , the only one who was late .
an american in mecca that could n't have happened to jack -lrb- name changed -rrb- .
jack is american .
he converted to islam a few years ago .
we first meet at frankfurt airport .
i ask him about his white hajj-clothes .
i want to know how he feels in this outfit .
after all , most people from the west would only wear clothes like that to a costume party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stewardess with a modern interpretation of a traditional headscarf " this probably looks funny to some of the people here , i guess , " says jack .
" i can tell by their looks . "
but jack does n't care .
" the hajj-outfit is meant to be simple and modest .
it reveals that religious beliefs do n't distinguish between rich and poor , black and white , etc . "
jack makes his comments as a muslim , but the way he says them , with his typical american accent , it almost sounds more like an american ideal .
flying , shopping , watching cnn aboard my plane to jeddah , i make some more interesting observations .
for example : most pilgrims watch cnn .
some of them even watch american movies .
however , the movies ' love scenes are carefully retouched , even though they are rather harmless from a western point of view .
the stewardesses wear headscarves and speak english – even with the arab passengers .
and many of the bearded men , who first appeared to be rather strict , conservative , and humorless , turn out to be very friendly family men .
they play happily with their kids and advise their loosely veiled wives on what makeup to buy from the choice of duty free products .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hajj terminal at jeddah airport : 2 million people arrive here - with their luggage before i finally put on my new pilgrim 's outfit , i first want to thank all the dw users for commenting on my first diary entries on the english , german , and arabic dw facebook pages - and for wishing me a safe trip .
i would like to reply to a question posted by hans youssef ernst from germany on the arabic page : " i 'm a christian and i would like to accompany my muslim friends to religious feasts in mecca some day .
do you think that this will be possible in the future ? "
dear hans youssef , i do n't dare to try and make a forecast .
as far as i know , the koran does n't explicitly state that non-muslims are n't allowed to visit mecca - but , as always , this is a matter of interpretation .
from a saudi perspective , non-muslims are definitely not allowed to visit the holy sites of mecca .
as an islamic scholar told me here in mecca : " that should be accepted , just like western constitutions need to be accepted by muslims living in europe .
by no means , however , you should mistake this as a sign of a lack respect or even contempt for non-muslims . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw reporter ali almakhlafi can move on after a short delay among islamic scholars , you can find different opinions about this topic .
there 's even a prominent politician who strongly criticizes the current prohibition : libya 's muammar al-gaddafi – who 's clearly not known to be a good friend of the western world .
five years ago , gaddafi asked for christians and jews to be allowed to visit mecca .
however , so far nothing changed … this monday , november 15 , i want to experience the pilgrim 's prayers at mount arafat and i will then attend the feast of sacrifice at mina .
i 've already collected quite a number of voices from other pilgrims .
i 'll tell you more about them in my next diary entry .

deutsche welle 's sports writer arnulf boettcher provides his take on germany 's new sports hero . germany has a new sports hero : sebastian vettel , the youngest world champion in formula one history .
born in the south-western german town of heppenheim , vettel wears the formula one crown at just 23 years old - and surely not for the last time .
germany 's other formula one world-champion , michael schumacher , was 25 when he won his first of a record seven titles .
like schumacher , vettel is known for his meticulousness and obsession over detail .
but unlike his role model schumacher , vettel does n't come across as so serious .
instead , vettel is seen as quick-witted , youthfully mischievous , and almost always smiling .
that 's what makes him so likeable on the formula one scene .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arnulf boettcher vettel almost become world champion last year .
he was held back by technical problems with his red bull car , but hasty mistakes were part of the problem , too .
he narrowly escaped meeting the same fate again this year .
but the setbacks only appear to have made him stronger .
in the decisive race , he took first place and made no mistakes in a dominating race where he was the best driver among his competitors .
ten pole positions and five victories make vettel a worthy and well-deserving champion .
fernando alonso is left pondering what might have been as his ferrari team implemented the wrong strategy in the final race in abu dhabi .
as for his title chances , alonso benefitted from an illegal team order : his ferrari teammate felipe massa was leading at the hockenheim race , but was ordered to let alonso through , securing an extra seven points for the spaniard .
red bull , on the other hand , did not issue team orders in the 2010 season and earned great respect from all sides .
vettel benefitted from the new points system that made formula one decidedly more exciting .
five drivers were in contention for the title heading into the second-to-last race , and for the final event four were still in the running .
in the end , vettel triumphed , after coming into the race in third place 15 points behind and without having even occupied top spot .
now germany can relish a world-title fairy tale and a youthful world champion .
but any expectations that vettel could someday overtake michael schumacher as the record world champion are misguided .
formula one has become much too fast-paced , and five different champions in the last five years speak for themselves .

" everything is at stake - if the euro fails , europe will fail , " she told delegates at the christian democrats ' party convention , where she was reelected as head of her party .
" we need a new culture of stability in europe , " she added .
she even went so far as to criticize her predecessor , social democrat gerhard schroeder , for giving his consent for greece to join the eurozone , calling it " irresponsible " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's push for a crisis prevention mechanism are controversial harsh words on both sides the comments came as eu figures showed that greece 's deficit in 2009 rose to 15.4 percent of gdp , a big jump from the initial estimate of 13.6 percent .
greek prime minister george papandreou promptly hit back , insisting that measures proposed by germany to avoid future crises were pushing up interest rates paid by highly indebted countries like greece for their bonds .
" this could create a self-fulfilling prophecy , " papandreou said during a visit in paris .
" this could break backs .
this could force some economies into bankruptcy , " he added .
he was referring to plans by germany , supported by france , to make bondholders pay at least some of the costs in case of a default .
germany is also reluctant to extend the eurozone 's bailout package beyond 2013 .
politicians may balk at merkel 's frank words , but some analysts believe tough talk is long-overdue .
" involving investors in the costs of defaults is a good idea , " eugen keller , head of financial markets research at metzler bank told deutsche welle .
" fighting fire with fire , i.e. bailing out mortgage companies like fannie mae or freddie mac or companies like gm , as happened in the us , and in europe as well , is not a long-term solution , " he said .
keller points out that the credit bubble has built up over the years , with the discrepancies between loans issued and actual economic growth widening over several decades , especially in the us , but also in europe .
bildunterschrift : exports are the driving force behind germany 's economic motor swings and roundabouts while germany benefits enormously from the single currency , as 40 percent of its exports go to other eurozone members , and having one currency eliminates fluctuations in exchange rates , the risks of having the euro were indeed underestimated , according to keller .
" germany can afford to pay for other countries as part of the bailout package for greece for example , but at the end of the day , the differences between say germany and greece or italy in efficiency , for example when it comes to managing wage costs , are extreme , " keller told deutsche welle .
" our own stress tests as well as those of ratings agencies in 2008 , for example , have shown that the former greek currency , the drachme , would have had to be valued at 30 to 40 percent less in 2008 than at the time greece joined the eurozone . "

after an eventful journey , dw reporter ali almakhlafi has reached mecca , and started answering dw users ' questions .
but first - a sudden change of clothes . on sunday , nov .
14 , the moment had come : two million pilgrims from all around the world , and i was right there in the middle of them .
i visited the holy al-haram mosque , and saw the kaaba at its center .
i 've got to admit it : i was completely mesmerized .
there is really such a big difference between seeing it in pictures or reading about it in articles , and actually standing in front of it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 100,000 security forces are there to protect some 2 million pilgrims i 've been to cologne cathedral , the vatican , and the hagia sophia in istanbul before .
but the kaaba is special to me .
childhood memories of religion class in yemen come up - and somehow things seem to have come full circle .
originally , i arrived with a group of pilgrims , but i lost them in the crowd .
never mind , i say to myself ; it 's good to be alone , for i first need to digest this experience by myself .
despite the kaaba 's deep impact on me , i 'm still here as a journalist .
well , as a journalist that looks like a pilgrim .
and just how did that come about ?
let me tell you .
after facing some unexpected problems , i decided to change my polo shirt and jeans for the pilgrim 's robes .
i decided i do n't want to be recognized as a visitor anymore .
i 've had enough trouble with that already .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt airport : pilgrims , saudis , and foreigners heading to jeddah in saudi arabia you really feel misplaced among the masses of muslim pilgrims if you are smooth-shaven and casually-dressed .
in fact , i 've felt like this since i left frankfurt airport : the other passengers gave me startled looks .
and at the check-in counter of saudi airlines , none of the employees expected me to have the special hajj-visa in my passport .
pilgrims need to get special luggage stickers , so that their cases arrive on the separate hajj terminal at jeddah airport .
well , i got the stickers and my luggage arrived at the right terminal as well .
but i did n't .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american movies with arabic subtitles are shown on the airplane after my flight , i found myself at the terminal for non-pilgrims .
the employees at jeddah airport had sent me there because of my " civilian " getup .
there i was – surrounded by international tourists and business people .
after more than an hour of confusion , i finally got the last shuttle bus to the proper terminal at around midnight .
i was the only passenger … or , the only one who was late .
an american in mecca that could n't have happened to jack -lrb- name changed -rrb- .
jack is american .
he converted to islam a few years ago .
we first meet at frankfurt airport .
i ask him about his white hajj-clothes .
i want to know how he feels in this outfit .
after all , most people from the west would only wear clothes like that to a costume party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stewardess with a modern interpretation of a traditional headscarf " this probably looks funny to some of the people here , i guess , " says jack .
" i can tell by their looks . "
but jack does n't care .
" the hajj-outfit is meant to be simple and modest .
it reveals that religious beliefs do n't distinguish between rich and poor , black and white , etc . "
jack makes his comments as a muslim , but the way he says them , with his typical american accent , it almost sounds more like an american ideal .
flying , shopping , watching cnn aboard my plane to jeddah , i make some more interesting observations .
for example : most pilgrims watch cnn .
some of them even watch american movies .
however , the movies ' love scenes are carefully retouched , even though they are rather harmless from a western point of view .
the stewardesses wear headscarves and speak english – even with the arab passengers .
and many of the bearded men , who first appeared to be rather strict , conservative , and humorless , turn out to be very friendly family men .
they play happily with their kids and advise their loosely veiled wives on what makeup to buy from the choice of duty free products .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hajj terminal at jeddah airport : 2 million people arrive here - with their luggage before i finally put on my new pilgrim 's outfit , i first want to thank all the dw users for commenting on my first diary entries on the english , german , and arabic dw facebook pages - and for wishing me a safe trip .
i would like to reply to a question posted by hans youssef ernst from germany on the arabic page : " i 'm a christian and i would like to accompany my muslim friends to religious feasts in mecca some day .
do you think that this will be possible in the future ? "
dear hans youssef , i do n't dare to try and make a forecast .
as far as i know , the koran does n't explicitly state that non-muslims are n't allowed to visit mecca - but , as always , this is a matter of interpretation .
from a saudi perspective , non-muslims are definitely not allowed to visit the holy sites of mecca .
as an islamic scholar told me here in mecca : " that should be accepted , just like western constitutions need to be accepted by muslims living in europe .
by no means , however , you should mistake this as a sign of a lack respect or even contempt for non-muslims . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw reporter ali almakhlafi can move on after a short delay among islamic scholars , you can find different opinions about this topic .
there 's even a prominent politician who strongly criticizes the current prohibition : libya 's muammar al-gaddafi – who 's clearly not known to be a good friend of the western world .
five years ago , gaddafi asked for christians and jews to be allowed to visit mecca .
however , so far nothing changed … this monday , november 15 , i want to experience the pilgrim 's prayers at mount arafat and i will then attend the feast of sacrifice at mina .
i 've already collected quite a number of voices from other pilgrims .
i 'll tell you more about them in my next diary entry .

the two rival sects of ultra-orthodox jews face off in a witty and bittersweet film titled " romeo and juliet in yiddish . "
a chance encounter between director eve annenberg and some members of new york 's hasidic community developed into a friendship and collaboration on the film .
it explores the rough-and-tumble existence of young jews who have left the ultra-orthodox world behind .
annenberg was fascinated by a younger generation speaking a language she thought was more or less consigned to the archives . " my grandmother who spoke yiddish and my mother who spoke yiddish are now both dead , and i wo n't hear it again .
and yet , the lure of speaking yiddish and being around people with this verbal vitality is so strong , " annenberg said .

the country is still refusing but so did greece before it bowed to pressure . speculation is rife about ireland 's course of action , as the country 's borrowing costs last week shot to record highs on concerns of a deficit set to hit 32 percent of gross domestic product this year .
monday kicked off with a report in the irish independent newspaper claiming that at a meeting of eurozone finance ministers this week , ireland plans to ask for money from the european union 's emergency fund to rescue its banks .
prompt denial an irish minister promptly fired off a denial about the country being in direct discussions about a bailout package from the european union .
while acknowledging that ireland is in " continuous talks " with the eu about its growing debt , dick roche , junior minister for european affairs , told newstalk radio that it is " frankly wrong and grossly irresponsible that this story is being said and that a frenzy is being created out there . "
the opposition claimed europe had already started moves to rescue the country , but the irish government denied it would need a bailout .
" ireland has made no application for external support , " a finance ministry spokesman said .
" ongoing contacts continue at official level with international colleagues in light of current market conditions . "
the rumor mill is almost certain to continue with every new day of uncertainty confronting irish banks .
at the end of last month , they owed 130 billion euros -lrb- $ 177 billion -rrb- of outstanding european central bank loans , up from 119 billion euros a month earlier .
numbers being floated around as part of a bailout deal range between 50 and 77 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment in ireland has soared to 13.2 percent the eu is reported to be keen for ireland to accept aid to avert a greek-style scenario in which budget problems in one country plunge the entire eurozone into crisis .
on monday , european central bank council member miguel angel fernandez ordonez prodded ireland to make a " final decision " on its fiscal crisis in a move to calm markets .
" the situation in the markets in recent weeks has been very negative due in some way to the lack of a final decision by ireland , " he told reporters in madrid .
" it 's not me who should take a decision about ireland ; it 's ireland that should take the right decision at the right moment . "
but the clock is ticking .
" i think ireland can hold out another three to four months maximum , and it should , hoping that some positive surprise on growth might calm the markets , " unicredit group chief economist marco annunziata told deutsche welle .
" but investors will remain nervous until the question is settled of whether or not eurozone sovereign debts might be restructured . "
stability program on track another european expert , who asked not to be identified , said the european finance ministers could reach a decision as early as this week to funnel funds to irish banks .
" these funds , which would help stabilize the banks , would be seen as a limited intervention , " the expert said .
there is no question about ireland 's sovereign debt , the expert added : the irish government has no immediate need for cash , being fully funded until mid-2011 , and its stability program is on track bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish banks owe billions to the european central bank germany has also pressed for ireland to accept aid , insiders say .
allaying investor concerns about irish finances would help advance chancellor angela merkel 's plan to require investors to help pay for future rescues .
european leaders , however , remain divided on merkel 's proposal , as they do on whether the ecb should keep buying bonds of debt-laden countries .
ireland 's debt problems stem largely from the country 's popped real estate bubble , when its local banks lent money too freely for construction projects .
on top of that was the irish government 's decision to provide a blanket guarantee to all bank creditors .
as a result , the country has experienced the worst recession of any major economy .
it has amassed debt of more than 100 billion euros and is struggling with an unemployment rate of 13.2 percent .
tough fiscal conditions a rescue plan would be deeply unpopular with irish voters , who value national independence and the low-tax regime that lured in foreign investment from u.s. and other non-european companies , fueling high growth rates over the past 20 years .
indeed , an eu bailout , with tough fiscal conditions attached , would be humiliating for a country once celebrated for its rags-to-riches transformation .
not unsurprisingly , critics of ireland 's action plan – or lack thereof – are wary of the country 's every move .
karel lannoo , chief executive officer of the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- in brussels , says the country should have acted long ago to steer clear of the financial challenges it now faces .
" ireland should never have given blanket coverage to banks in the first place , " lannoo told deutsche welle .
" and it should have let some of the banks fail . "
lannoo now questions the repercussions for europe .
" how many more of these financial disasters can we have ? " he asked .

but experts say a ban would cause unnecessary stress for couples . thanks to a recent ruling by the federal court of justice , german women having a ' test-tube baby ' have the option of letting the doctor check if the embryo which will be implanted in her womb is likely to suffer from any serious diseases .
if the chances are high , she can decide not to have it implanted and try again .
such pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- used to be illegal in germany , but the decision in july found that such a test was legal if it was intended to exclude a serious handicap .
this caused consternation among germany 's christians , not least those belonging to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
many argued that an embryo enjoys complete human rights from the moment a sperm fertilizes an egg , and after some deliberation , merkel came down on their side last month .
disunity among mainstream christians in her opening speech at this week 's party conference , the chancellor gave a brief but unambiguous reiteration of her position : " i 'm in favor of a ban , because we ca n't properly define the boundaries . "
she did however acknowledge that many party colleagues have a different opinion , and welcomed a frank debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the boundaries of pid were too difficult to define prominent cdu members – notably cabinet ministers ursula von der leyen and kristina schroeder - as well as merkel 's coalition partners the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , see it differently , and have proposed a controlled use of pgd .
the issue divides other parties too , and when the issue comes before german parliament , it has been decided that the question will be decided by a free ‘ conscience ' vote , independent of party lines .
the main argument in favor of pgd simply points out that german law allows women to have an abortion even in the ninth month , if a test of the fetus shows a serious health condition .
if more diagnoses could be carried out before implantation , many such traumatic abortions could be avoided .
" it 's quite a contradiction that we do n't allow the cells to be checked , " argued cdu parliamentary state secretary peter hintze .
" but we do allow the fetus to be checked in the womb .
we should get rid of this contradiction . "
defining the boundaries the particular ' boundary ' that merkel feels is so difficult to define is between screening out genes that might lead to illness , handicaps or birth defects and producing what is known as ' designer babies . '
from a scientific point of view , it 's important to point out that ' diagnosis ' is a slightly misleading description , since the process does not involve identifying an illness in an embryo .
instead , pgd is a test for certain genetic conditions that could lead to disease .
pgd was first developed in britain in the late 1980s , and was first used for sex determination on embryos with diseases linked to certain chromosomes .
not long after the first successful births , it was banned in germany under the 1990 embryo protection act .
its main application is for determining the presence of recessive genetic disorders like cystic fibrosis , beta-thalassemia , sickle cell disease and spinal muscular atrophy type 1 .
the most common dominant diseases that can be screened by pgd are myotonic dystrophy , huntington 's disease and charcot-marie-tooth disease .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an outright ban would likely send many germans abroad for treatment it is also used to test for chromosomal abnormalities , which if excluded can increase the chances of ivf treatment being successful , by reducing the rate of miscarriages .
broad consensus in europe pgd is allowed in britain , but only for determining the presence of serious hereditary diseases or chromosome disorders .
in france , the procedure is only allowed if an inherited disease has been identified in one of the parents , and only if both parents have been living together for two years .
a similarly limited application of pgd is also in place in belgium , the netherlands , belgium , italy , and greece .
meanwhile an outright ban is in place in austria , ireland and switzerland .
but there is a fairly ambiguous legal position on pgd in many countries , where it is not expressly banned , but is implicitly prohibited through regulations on embryo research – this is the case in many us states .
sascha rudat , spokesman for the berlin chamber of physicians , told deutsche welle , " the problem is that couples where hereditary diseases are present , could say , ' we 're going abroad to have it done there . '
and of course that is n't desirable .
that 's a lot of stress , so i think we should re-consider whether a total ban is a good idea . "
rudat says the risks and stress of travel to a foreign country only make a complex and emotionally-charged treatment even more difficult .
" some couples are already in a stressful situation , " he said .
" as i said , they are often couples who already have certain hereditary illnesses , who may already have had a handicapped child , and who only want to do everything right .
if they travel it just adds extra burdens . "
for this reason , rudat believes that a regulated application is the only fair solution .
" we do n't consider a total ban desirable , " says rudat .
" we think that pgd should be possible under very strict conditions .
they are of course important . "

he talked to deutsche welle about the ups and downs of trying to come back . before there was sami khedira , there was simon rolfes .
the 28-year-old midfielder was originally the one tipped to take over the stopper role from ageing veteran michael ballack .
but a meniscus injury in july 2009 ultimately stopped rolfes in his tracks just as he was reaching the peak of his career .
rolfes played through pain that fall .
after all , his club , bayer leverkusen , was topping the table , and he had established himself as a regular in the german national side .
but by october he had developed articular cartilage damage and had no option but to have an operation .
the problems did n't go away , and he was forced to go under the knife again in january and acknowledge that his dream of competing in south africa was over .
“ we were on a sensational run with leverkusen and topping the table at the winter break , ” rolfes told deutsche welle .
“ my plan was to come back in the second half of the season and be a full part of the team , since the games i had played that season had been the best of my career .
so , of course , the weeks following the january operation were really hard .
i realized i was n't going to play any role at all either in the bundesliga season or the world cup . ”
a slow but steady developer , rolfes had become an international caliber midfielder .
now he was forced to watch khedira take on a role in the german squad that he himself would have probably occupied , had he not been hurt .
khedira performed well in south africa and landed a deal with real madrid .
meanwhile , rolfes was just trying to regain his basic fitness .
daily drudgery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolfes had been getting regular starts for germany in one respect , rolfes has been lucky .
the injuries he suffered have ended many a footballer 's career .
but rehab work , to hear him describe it , is a total slog , and it is difficult for a top athlete to acknowledge that , through no fault of one 's own , one is not at the level one was just a few months before .
“ it takes time to accept and start looking forward again , ” rolfes said .
“ after the operation i was on crutches for eight weeks … and it hardly a lot of fun to lie around at home , exercising your leg or knee with a machine for six hours a day and watching your muscles virtually disappear . ”
rolfes also said that when he was able to work out with a football again , it was hard at first to commit to challenges .
overcoming fear , he said , came gradually as he got used to playing scrimmages in training sessions .
“ it 's such a long process , and in the beginning you ca n't imagine yourself being on the pitch again , ” rolfes remembered .
“ but step for step , they bring you along , and then at some point it 's over .
you get your confidence back in practice . ”
practice , in this case , does n't make perfect .
it gives a player the chance to regain what he 's lost .
positive outlook bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coming back from a knee injury takes lots of hard , boring work rolfes made his bundesliga comeback in late september , and so far , he 's been pretty good .
last month , he scored a pair of goals to help leverkusen beat wolfsburg , even though he only came on as a late substitute .
and perhaps more encouragingly , he 's played for a full 90 minutes in his last two games .
he also provided the assist for leverkusen 's lone goal in their win agaist st. pauli on the weekend , which took the team up to second in the bundesliga standings .
but will he ever be able to recapture the status he once had with germany head coach joachim loew ?
competition for spots in the midfield is fierce , with not even nominal team captain michael ballack being assured of making the squad .
rolfes draws hope from the very vagaries of football that put him out of commission for much of 2009 and 2010 .
“ a year ago , no one would have thought that bastian schweinsteiger and sami khedira would be the central midfielders at the world cup , ” rolfes said .
“ and likewise , no one knows what 's going to happen in two or three years ' time .
there 's always the possibility of injuries and other circumstances .
so you should n't concentrate on whether it 's difficult or not . ”
and rolfes does n't need to look far to find an example of hope .
his teammate at leverkusen , striker patrick helmes , was also knocked out of germany 's world cup squad by an injury , but has gotten a call-up to play in the nationalelf 's friendly against sweden this coming wednesday .
so even though rolfes has dropped off the radar screen of many casual germany fans , it would n't be all that surprising to find him on the plane when yogi and co. travel to euro 2012 in poland and ukraine , or even the 2014 world cup in brazil .

but experts say a ban would cause unnecessary stress for couples . thanks to a recent ruling by the federal court of justice , german women having a ' test-tube baby ' have the option of letting the doctor check if the embryo which will be implanted in her womb is likely to suffer from any serious diseases .
if the chances are high , she can decide not to have it implanted and try again .
such pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- used to be illegal in germany , but the decision in july found that such a test was legal if it was intended to exclude a serious handicap .
this caused consternation among germany 's christians , not least those belonging to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
many argued that an embryo enjoys complete human rights from the moment a sperm fertilizes an egg , and after some deliberation , merkel came down on their side last month .
disunity among mainstream christians in her opening speech at this week 's party conference , the chancellor gave a brief but unambiguous reiteration of her position : " i 'm in favor of a ban , because we ca n't properly define the boundaries . "
she did however acknowledge that many party colleagues have a different opinion , and welcomed a frank debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the boundaries of pid were too difficult to define prominent cdu members – notably cabinet ministers ursula von der leyen and kristina schroeder - as well as merkel 's coalition partners the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , see it differently , and have proposed a controlled use of pgd .
the issue divides other parties too , and when the issue comes before german parliament , it has been decided that the question will be decided by a free ‘ conscience ' vote , independent of party lines .
the main argument in favor of pgd simply points out that german law allows women to have an abortion even in the ninth month , if a test of the fetus shows a serious health condition .
if more diagnoses could be carried out before implantation , many such traumatic abortions could be avoided .
" it 's quite a contradiction that we do n't allow the cells to be checked , " argued cdu parliamentary state secretary peter hintze .
" but we do allow the fetus to be checked in the womb .
we should get rid of this contradiction . "
defining the boundaries the particular ' boundary ' that merkel feels is so difficult to define is between screening out genes that might lead to illness , handicaps or birth defects and producing what is known as ' designer babies . '
from a scientific point of view , it 's important to point out that ' diagnosis ' is a slightly misleading description , since the process does not involve identifying an illness in an embryo .
instead , pgd is a test for certain genetic conditions that could lead to disease .
pgd was first developed in britain in the late 1980s , and was first used for sex determination on embryos with diseases linked to certain chromosomes .
not long after the first successful births , it was banned in germany under the 1990 embryo protection act .
its main application is for determining the presence of recessive genetic disorders like cystic fibrosis , beta-thalassemia , sickle cell disease and spinal muscular atrophy type 1 .
the most common dominant diseases that can be screened by pgd are myotonic dystrophy , huntington 's disease and charcot-marie-tooth disease .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an outright ban would likely send many germans abroad for treatment it is also used to test for chromosomal abnormalities , which if excluded can increase the chances of ivf treatment being successful , by reducing the rate of miscarriages .
broad consensus in europe pgd is allowed in britain , but only for determining the presence of serious hereditary diseases or chromosome disorders .
in france , the procedure is only allowed if an inherited disease has been identified in one of the parents , and only if both parents have been living together for two years .
a similarly limited application of pgd is also in place in belgium , the netherlands , belgium , italy , and greece .
meanwhile an outright ban is in place in austria , ireland and switzerland .
but there is a fairly ambiguous legal position on pgd in many countries , where it is not expressly banned , but is implicitly prohibited through regulations on embryo research – this is the case in many us states .
sascha rudat , spokesman for the berlin chamber of physicians , told deutsche welle , " the problem is that couples where hereditary diseases are present , could say , ' we 're going abroad to have it done there . '
and of course that is n't desirable .
that 's a lot of stress , so i think we should re-consider whether a total ban is a good idea . "
rudat says the risks and stress of travel to a foreign country only make a complex and emotionally-charged treatment even more difficult .
" some couples are already in a stressful situation , " he said .
" as i said , they are often couples who already have certain hereditary illnesses , who may already have had a handicapped child , and who only want to do everything right .
if they travel it just adds extra burdens . "
for this reason , rudat believes that a regulated application is the only fair solution .
" we do n't consider a total ban desirable , " says rudat .
" we think that pgd should be possible under very strict conditions .
they are of course important . "

the ministers are supporters of parliamentary speaker gianfranco fini , a berlusconi rival . political problems in italy continue to escalate as four ministers - europe minister andrea ronchi , deputy economic development minister adolfo urso and two junior ministers - resigned from their posts in the government on monday .
" we all agree today that we need to move to a new phase in the italian centre-right , " said urso on news channel skytg24 monday .
the resignations indicate waning support for prime minister silvio berlusconi .
the four ministers who resigned are all supporters of former berlusconi ally-turned-rival gianfranco fini , who is speaker of the parliament .
fini and his supports in the future and freedom movement hope to see berlusconi resign .
the demand follows the latest in a long-running series of sex-scandal allegations involving berlusconi .
earlier in the month , fini had threatened to start pulling ministers out of the government if berlusconi did n't step down .
monday 's resignations show fini made good on his promise .
budget comes first however , berlusconi has called for a vote of confidence in parliament and would be willing to face political rivals at the polls if snap elections are deemed necessary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fini would like to see berlusconi resign but such a vote is not likely to come before the italian government passes its 2011 budget in the coming weeks , a decision which is itself a thorny issue due to italy 's massive debt problem .
the political turmoil could play out in a number of different ways in italy .
should berlusconi lose a vote of confidence , it would be up to president giorgio napolitano to decide if the existing parliament could form a new government .
napolitano could also appoint an interim government until new elections can take place .
if no agreement can be reached on a new government , parliament would be dissolved and snap elections would take place within 70 days .

the ministers are supporters of parliamentary speaker gianfranco fini , a berlusconi rival . political problems in italy continue to escalate as four ministers - europe minister andrea ronchi , deputy economic development minister adolfo urso and two junior ministers - resigned from their posts in the government on monday .
" we all agree today that we need to move to a new phase in the italian centre-right , " said urso on news channel skytg24 monday .
the resignations indicate waning support for prime minister silvio berlusconi .
the four ministers who resigned are all supporters of former berlusconi ally-turned-rival gianfranco fini , who is speaker of the parliament .
fini and his supports in the future and freedom movement hope to see berlusconi resign .
the demand follows the latest in a long-running series of sex-scandal allegations involving berlusconi .
earlier in the month , fini had threatened to start pulling ministers out of the government if berlusconi did n't step down .
monday 's resignations show fini made good on his promise .
budget comes first however , berlusconi has called for a vote of confidence in parliament and would be willing to face political rivals at the polls if snap elections are deemed necessary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fini would like to see berlusconi resign but such a vote is not likely to come before the italian government passes its 2011 budget in the coming weeks , a decision which is itself a thorny issue due to italy 's massive debt problem .
the political turmoil could play out in a number of different ways in italy .
should berlusconi lose a vote of confidence , it would be up to president giorgio napolitano to decide if the existing parliament could form a new government .
napolitano could also appoint an interim government until new elections can take place .
if no agreement can be reached on a new government , parliament would be dissolved and snap elections would take place within 70 days .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 15.11.2010 eu plans to loosen zero tolerance policy on gm crops großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genetically modified animal feed could soon be imported into europe leaked documents suggest the european union is planning to loosen its zero tolerance ban on genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- plants .
environmental campaigners are outraged , saying the crops are still potentially dangerous . according to environmental group friends of the earth europe -lrb- foee -rrb- , the european commission is planning to allow traces of non-approved gm crops in imports coming into europe -lrb- with a threshold of 0.1 percent -rrb- .
" europe would effectively open its borders for gm crops which are not authorized or assessed for their safety in any country of the world , " an foee statement said .
a number of european union governments on monday urged the bloc 's executive to allow tiny traces of gm material in food imports for human consumption as well as in animal feed , an eu source said .
however , it is not yet clear whether enough eu governments support the change to force the european commission to amend its proposal , and a final decision is unlikely before january at the earliest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers say the imports are necessary to keep prices down " the european commission is bowing to the scaremongering tactics of the biotech industry , and as a result , opening europe 's markets to unauthorized gm food and feed . "
mute schimpf , an foee food campaigner said .
" europe 's laws on genetically modified foods are there for a reason – to protect the public and the environment . "
biotech pressure environmentalists believe that the eu 's hand is being forced by the bio-technology industry , which is arguing that the eu 's total ban on gm crops could bring about a crisis in the feed sector , and farmers may be forced to slaughter animals rather than let them starve .
" this is based upon the false argument that international trade is severely disrupted when shipments of feed containing unauthorised gm feed are rejected , " the foee said .
the campaigners claimed that no shipment from any feed importing country -lrb- us , argentina or brazil -rrb- was rejected at a european port in 2010 .
" the right of the public to say no to gm foods and feeds must be respected , " schimpf demanded .
" member states should reject this proposal and maintain europe 's position on zero tolerance . "
farmers ' interests but european farmer organizations have shown little concern over the proposal .
amanda cheesley , spokeswoman for copa cogeca , the umbrella group of european farming organizations , told deutsche welle , " we are not averse to imports of gm feed coming in .
if it 's been approved under the commission 's authorization procedures , then we do n't have a problem with it . "
cheesley believes that the eu 's current zero tolerance policy is unsustainable .
" we want a solution to be found to that because in practise you ca n't have zero tolerance , " she said .
" it stops imports coming in , which means that feed prices go too high for livestock . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has criticized the eu 's gm assessment procedures cheesley says that europe 's farmers have other worries .
" we have concerns about the commission 's proposals to let member states have different policies on gm products , " she said .
the commission made legal proposals in july to allow national governments make their own decisions on the controversial crops , in a bid to break the longstanding eu deadlock on new gm product approvals .
but a new opinion from the eu council of ministers ' legal service could deal a fatal blow to the plans , after several eu governments already expressed fears that the draft law risks breaching world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- rules .
new guidelines the european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- has also set out new guidelines for biotech companies submitting gm crops for eu approval on friday , including on possible long-term effects of gm crops and their impacts on insects and other plants .
the new guidelines follow a request from eu governments in 2008 to strengthen efsa 's gm crop assessment procedures , and criticism from countries including france that efsa had failed to take full account of environmental concerns when approving new crops .
france has refused to discuss european commission proposals to let member states decide whether to grow or ban gm crops , until the eu 's assessment procedures have been strengthened .
in december , the commission is due to publish a report on the socio-economic risks and benefits of gm crops , and new rules on monitoring gm crops are due next year , as part of the wider overhaul of the bloc 's approval and assessment procedures .

environmental campaigners are outraged , saying the crops are still potentially dangerous . according to environmental group friends of the earth europe -lrb- foee -rrb- , the european commission is planning to allow traces of non-approved gm crops in imports coming into europe -lrb- with a threshold of 0.1 percent -rrb- .
" europe would effectively open its borders for gm crops which are not authorized or assessed for their safety in any country of the world , " an foee statement said .
a number of european union governments on monday urged the bloc 's executive to allow tiny traces of gm material in food imports for human consumption as well as in animal feed , an eu source said .
however , it is not yet clear whether enough eu governments support the change to force the european commission to amend its proposal , and a final decision is unlikely before january at the earliest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers say the imports are necessary to keep prices down " the european commission is bowing to the scaremongering tactics of the biotech industry , and as a result , opening europe 's markets to unauthorized gm food and feed . "
mute schimpf , an foee food campaigner said .
" europe 's laws on genetically modified foods are there for a reason – to protect the public and the environment . "
biotech pressure environmentalists believe that the eu 's hand is being forced by the bio-technology industry , which is arguing that the eu 's total ban on gm crops could bring about a crisis in the feed sector , and farmers may be forced to slaughter animals rather than let them starve .
" this is based upon the false argument that international trade is severely disrupted when shipments of feed containing unauthorised gm feed are rejected , " the foee said .
the campaigners claimed that no shipment from any feed importing country -lrb- us , argentina or brazil -rrb- was rejected at a european port in 2010 .
" the right of the public to say no to gm foods and feeds must be respected , " schimpf demanded .
" member states should reject this proposal and maintain europe 's position on zero tolerance . "
farmers ' interests but european farmer organizations have shown little concern over the proposal .
amanda cheesley , spokeswoman for copa cogeca , the umbrella group of european farming organizations , told deutsche welle , " we are not averse to imports of gm feed coming in .
if it 's been approved under the commission 's authorization procedures , then we do n't have a problem with it . "
cheesley believes that the eu 's current zero tolerance policy is unsustainable .
" we want a solution to be found to that because in practise you ca n't have zero tolerance , " she said .
" it stops imports coming in , which means that feed prices go too high for livestock . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has criticized the eu 's gm assessment procedures cheesley says that europe 's farmers have other worries .
" we have concerns about the commission 's proposals to let member states have different policies on gm products , " she said .
the commission made legal proposals in july to allow national governments make their own decisions on the controversial crops , in a bid to break the longstanding eu deadlock on new gm product approvals .
but a new opinion from the eu council of ministers ' legal service could deal a fatal blow to the plans , after several eu governments already expressed fears that the draft law risks breaching world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- rules .
new guidelines the european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- has also set out new guidelines for biotech companies submitting gm crops for eu approval on friday , including on possible long-term effects of gm crops and their impacts on insects and other plants .
the new guidelines follow a request from eu governments in 2008 to strengthen efsa 's gm crop assessment procedures , and criticism from countries including france that efsa had failed to take full account of environmental concerns when approving new crops .
france has refused to discuss european commission proposals to let member states decide whether to grow or ban gm crops , until the eu 's assessment procedures have been strengthened .
in december , the commission is due to publish a report on the socio-economic risks and benefits of gm crops , and new rules on monitoring gm crops are due next year , as part of the wider overhaul of the bloc 's approval and assessment procedures .

the ministers are supporters of parliamentary speaker gianfranco fini , a berlusconi rival . political problems in italy continue to escalate as four ministers - europe minister andrea ronchi , deputy economic development minister adolfo urso and two junior ministers - resigned from their posts in the government on monday .
" we all agree today that we need to move to a new phase in the italian centre-right , " said urso on news channel skytg24 monday .
the resignations indicate waning support for prime minister silvio berlusconi .
the four ministers who resigned are all supporters of former berlusconi ally-turned-rival gianfranco fini , who is speaker of the parliament .
fini and his supports in the future and freedom movement hope to see berlusconi resign .
the demand follows the latest in a long-running series of sex-scandal allegations involving berlusconi .
earlier in the month , fini had threatened to start pulling ministers out of the government if berlusconi did n't step down .
monday 's resignations show fini made good on his promise .
budget comes first however , berlusconi has called for a vote of confidence in parliament and would be willing to face political rivals at the polls if snap elections are deemed necessary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fini would like to see berlusconi resign but such a vote is not likely to come before the italian government passes its 2011 budget in the coming weeks , a decision which is itself a thorny issue due to italy 's massive debt problem .
the political turmoil could play out in a number of different ways in italy .
should berlusconi lose a vote of confidence , it would be up to president giorgio napolitano to decide if the existing parliament could form a new government .
napolitano could also appoint an interim government until new elections can take place .
if no agreement can be reached on a new government , parliament would be dissolved and snap elections would take place within 70 days .

deutsche welle 's sports writer arnulf boettcher provides his take on germany 's new sports hero . germany has a new sports hero : sebastian vettel , the youngest world champion in formula one history .
born in the south-western german town of heppenheim , vettel wears the formula one crown at just 23 years old - and surely not for the last time .
germany 's other formula one world-champion , michael schumacher , was 25 when he won his first of a record seven titles .
like schumacher , vettel is known for his meticulousness and obsession over detail .
but unlike his role model schumacher , vettel does n't come across as so serious .
instead , vettel is seen as quick-witted , youthfully mischievous , and almost always smiling .
that 's what makes him so likeable on the formula one scene .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arnulf boettcher vettel almost become world champion last year .
he was held back by technical problems with his red bull car , but hasty mistakes were part of the problem , too .
he narrowly escaped meeting the same fate again this year .
but the setbacks only appear to have made him stronger .
in the decisive race , he took first place and made no mistakes in a dominating race where he was the best driver among his competitors .
ten pole positions and five victories make vettel a worthy and well-deserving champion .
fernando alonso is left pondering what might have been as his ferrari team implemented the wrong strategy in the final race in abu dhabi .
as for his title chances , alonso benefitted from an illegal team order : his ferrari teammate felipe massa was leading at the hockenheim race , but was ordered to let alonso through , securing an extra seven points for the spaniard .
red bull , on the other hand , did not issue team orders in the 2010 season and earned great respect from all sides .
vettel benefitted from the new points system that made formula one decidedly more exciting .
five drivers were in contention for the title heading into the second-to-last race , and for the final event four were still in the running .
in the end , vettel triumphed , after coming into the race in third place 15 points behind and without having even occupied top spot .
now germany can relish a world-title fairy tale and a youthful world champion .
but any expectations that vettel could someday overtake michael schumacher as the record world champion are misguided .
formula one has become much too fast-paced , and five different champions in the last five years speak for themselves .

deutsche welle 's sports writer arnulf boettcher provides his take on germany 's new sports hero . germany has a new sports hero : sebastian vettel , the youngest world champion in formula one history .
born in the south-western german town of heppenheim , vettel wears the formula one crown at just 23 years old - and surely not for the last time .
germany 's other formula one world-champion , michael schumacher , was 25 when he won his first of a record seven titles .
like schumacher , vettel is known for his meticulousness and obsession over detail .
but unlike his role model schumacher , vettel does n't come across as so serious .
instead , vettel is seen as quick-witted , youthfully mischievous , and almost always smiling .
that 's what makes him so likeable on the formula one scene .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arnulf boettcher vettel almost become world champion last year .
he was held back by technical problems with his red bull car , but hasty mistakes were part of the problem , too .
he narrowly escaped meeting the same fate again this year .
but the setbacks only appear to have made him stronger .
in the decisive race , he took first place and made no mistakes in a dominating race where he was the best driver among his competitors .
ten pole positions and five victories make vettel a worthy and well-deserving champion .
fernando alonso is left pondering what might have been as his ferrari team implemented the wrong strategy in the final race in abu dhabi .
as for his title chances , alonso benefitted from an illegal team order : his ferrari teammate felipe massa was leading at the hockenheim race , but was ordered to let alonso through , securing an extra seven points for the spaniard .
red bull , on the other hand , did not issue team orders in the 2010 season and earned great respect from all sides .
vettel benefitted from the new points system that made formula one decidedly more exciting .
five drivers were in contention for the title heading into the second-to-last race , and for the final event four were still in the running .
in the end , vettel triumphed , after coming into the race in third place 15 points behind and without having even occupied top spot .
now germany can relish a world-title fairy tale and a youthful world champion .
but any expectations that vettel could someday overtake michael schumacher as the record world champion are misguided .
formula one has become much too fast-paced , and five different champions in the last five years speak for themselves .

" everything is at stake - if the euro fails , europe will fail , " she told delegates at the christian democrats ' party convention , where she was reelected as head of her party .
" we need a new culture of stability in europe , " she added .
she even went so far as to criticize her predecessor , social democrat gerhard schroeder , for giving his consent for greece to join the eurozone , calling it " irresponsible " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's push for a crisis prevention mechanism are controversial harsh words on both sides the comments came as eu figures showed that greece 's deficit in 2009 rose to 15.4 percent of gdp , a big jump from the initial estimate of 13.6 percent .
greek prime minister george papandreou promptly hit back , insisting that measures proposed by germany to avoid future crises were pushing up interest rates paid by highly indebted countries like greece for their bonds .
" this could create a self-fulfilling prophecy , " papandreou said during a visit in paris .
" this could break backs .
this could force some economies into bankruptcy , " he added .
he was referring to plans by germany , supported by france , to make bondholders pay at least some of the costs in case of a default .
germany is also reluctant to extend the eurozone 's bailout package beyond 2013 .
politicians may balk at merkel 's frank words , but some analysts believe tough talk is long-overdue .
" involving investors in the costs of defaults is a good idea , " eugen keller , head of financial markets research at metzler bank told deutsche welle .
" fighting fire with fire , i.e. bailing out mortgage companies like fannie mae or freddie mac or companies like gm , as happened in the us , and in europe as well , is not a long-term solution , " he said .
keller points out that the credit bubble has built up over the years , with the discrepancies between loans issued and actual economic growth widening over several decades , especially in the us , but also in europe .
bildunterschrift : exports are the driving force behind germany 's economic motor swings and roundabouts while germany benefits enormously from the single currency , as 40 percent of its exports go to other eurozone members , and having one currency eliminates fluctuations in exchange rates , the risks of having the euro were indeed underestimated , according to keller .
" germany can afford to pay for other countries as part of the bailout package for greece for example , but at the end of the day , the differences between say germany and greece or italy in efficiency , for example when it comes to managing wage costs , are extreme , " keller told deutsche welle .
" our own stress tests as well as those of ratings agencies in 2008 , for example , have shown that the former greek currency , the drachme , would have had to be valued at 30 to 40 percent less in 2008 than at the time greece joined the eurozone . "

" everything is at stake - if the euro fails , europe will fail , " she told delegates at the christian democrats ' party convention , where she was reelected as head of her party .
" we need a new culture of stability in europe , " she added .
she even went so far as to criticize her predecessor , social democrat gerhard schroeder , for giving his consent for greece to join the eurozone , calling it " irresponsible " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's push for a crisis prevention mechanism are controversial harsh words on both sides the comments came as eu figures showed that greece 's deficit in 2009 rose to 15.4 percent of gdp , a big jump from the initial estimate of 13.6 percent .
greek prime minister george papandreou promptly hit back , insisting that measures proposed by germany to avoid future crises were pushing up interest rates paid by highly indebted countries like greece for their bonds .
" this could create a self-fulfilling prophecy , " papandreou said during a visit in paris .
" this could break backs .
this could force some economies into bankruptcy , " he added .
he was referring to plans by germany , supported by france , to make bondholders pay at least some of the costs in case of a default .
germany is also reluctant to extend the eurozone 's bailout package beyond 2013 .
politicians may balk at merkel 's frank words , but some analysts believe tough talk is long-overdue .
" involving investors in the costs of defaults is a good idea , " eugen keller , head of financial markets research at metzler bank told deutsche welle .
" fighting fire with fire , i.e. bailing out mortgage companies like fannie mae or freddie mac or companies like gm , as happened in the us , and in europe as well , is not a long-term solution , " he said .
keller points out that the credit bubble has built up over the years , with the discrepancies between loans issued and actual economic growth widening over several decades , especially in the us , but also in europe .
bildunterschrift : exports are the driving force behind germany 's economic motor swings and roundabouts while germany benefits enormously from the single currency , as 40 percent of its exports go to other eurozone members , and having one currency eliminates fluctuations in exchange rates , the risks of having the euro were indeed underestimated , according to keller .
" germany can afford to pay for other countries as part of the bailout package for greece for example , but at the end of the day , the differences between say germany and greece or italy in efficiency , for example when it comes to managing wage costs , are extreme , " keller told deutsche welle .
" our own stress tests as well as those of ratings agencies in 2008 , for example , have shown that the former greek currency , the drachme , would have had to be valued at 30 to 40 percent less in 2008 than at the time greece joined the eurozone . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 15.11.2010 greek pm : german proposals put squeeze on debt-laden countries großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is determined to prevent future debt crises as german chancellor angela merkel warns that europe must adopt strict rules to avoid potential future debt crises , greek prime minister george papandreou accused germany of encouraging sovereign bankruptcies . as greece learned on monday that its massive budget deficit was even bigger than expected in 2009 , german chancellor angela merkel has renewed calls for a pan-european crisis mechanism that would help prevent future debt crises and protect the euro single currency .
" everything is at stake - if the euro fails , europe will fail , " she told delegates at the christian democrats ' party convention , where she was reelected as head of her party .
" we need a new culture of stability in europe , " she added .
she even went so far as to criticize her predecessor , social democrat gerhard schroeder , for giving his consent for greece to join the eurozone , calling it " irresponsible " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's push for a crisis prevention mechanism are controversial harsh words on both sides the comments came as eu figures showed that greece 's deficit in 2009 rose to 15.4 percent of gdp , a big jump from the initial estimate of 13.6 percent .
greek prime minister george papandreou promptly hit back , insisting that measures proposed by germany to avoid future crises were pushing up interest rates paid by highly indebted countries like greece for their bonds .
" this could create a self-fulfilling prophecy , " papandreou said during a visit in paris .
" this could break backs .
this could force some economies into bankruptcy , " he added .
he was referring to plans by germany , supported by france , to make bondholders pay at least some of the costs in case of a default .
germany is also reluctant to extend the eurozone 's bailout package beyond 2013 .
politicians may balk at merkel 's frank words , but some analysts believe tough talk is long-overdue .
" involving investors in the costs of defaults is a good idea , " eugen keller , head of financial markets research at metzler bank told deutsche welle .
" fighting fire with fire , i.e. bailing out mortgage companies like fannie mae or freddie mac or companies like gm , as happened in the us , and in europe as well , is not a long-term solution , " he said .
keller points out that the credit bubble has built up over the years , with the discrepancies between loans issued and actual economic growth widening over several decades , especially in the us , but also in europe .
bildunterschrift : exports are the driving force behind germany 's economic motor swings and roundabouts while germany benefits enormously from the single currency , as 40 percent of its exports go to other eurozone members , and having one currency eliminates fluctuations in exchange rates , the risks of having the euro were indeed underestimated , according to keller .
" germany can afford to pay for other countries as part of the bailout package for greece for example , but at the end of the day , the differences between say germany and greece or italy in efficiency , for example when it comes to managing wage costs , are extreme , " keller told deutsche welle .
" our own stress tests as well as those of ratings agencies in 2008 , for example , have shown that the former greek currency , the drachme , would have had to be valued at 30 to 40 percent less in 2008 than at the time greece joined the eurozone . "

i 've got to admit it : i was completely mesmerized .
there is really such a big difference between seeing it in pictures or reading about it in articles , and actually standing in front of it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 100,000 security forces are there to protect some 2 million pilgrims i 've been to cologne cathedral , the vatican , and the hagia sophia in istanbul before .
but the kaaba is special to me .
childhood memories of religion class in yemen come up - and somehow things seem to have come full circle .
originally , i arrived with a group of pilgrims , but i lost them in the crowd .
never mind , i say to myself ; it 's good to be alone , for i first need to digest this experience by myself .
despite the kaaba 's deep impact on me , i 'm still here as a journalist .
well , as a journalist that looks like a pilgrim .
and just how did that come about ?
let me tell you .
after facing some unexpected problems , i decided to change my polo shirt and jeans for the pilgrim 's robes .
i decided i do n't want to be recognized as a visitor anymore .
i 've had enough trouble with that already .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt airport : pilgrims , saudis , and foreigners heading to jeddah in saudi arabia you really feel misplaced among the masses of muslim pilgrims if you are smooth-shaven and casually-dressed .
in fact , i 've felt like this since i left frankfurt airport : the other passengers gave me startled looks .
and at the check-in counter of saudi airlines , none of the employees expected me to have the special hajj-visa in my passport .
pilgrims need to get special luggage stickers , so that their cases arrive on the separate hajj terminal at jeddah airport .
well , i got the stickers and my luggage arrived at the right terminal as well .
but i did n't .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american movies with arabic subtitles are shown on the airplane after my flight , i found myself at the terminal for non-pilgrims .
the employees at jeddah airport had sent me there because of my " civilian " getup .
there i was – surrounded by international tourists and business people .
after more than an hour of confusion , i finally got the last shuttle bus to the proper terminal at around midnight .
i was the only passenger … or , the only one who was late .
an american in mecca that could n't have happened to jack -lrb- name changed -rrb- .
jack is american .
he converted to islam a few years ago .
we first meet at frankfurt airport .
i ask him about his white hajj-clothes .
i want to know how he feels in this outfit .
after all , most people from the west would only wear clothes like that to a costume party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stewardess with a modern interpretation of a traditional headscarf " this probably looks funny to some of the people here , i guess , " says jack .
" i can tell by their looks . "
but jack does n't care .
" the hajj-outfit is meant to be simple and modest .
it reveals that religious beliefs do n't distinguish between rich and poor , black and white , etc . "
jack makes his comments as a muslim , but the way he says them , with his typical american accent , it almost sounds more like an american ideal .
flying , shopping , watching cnn aboard my plane to jeddah , i make some more interesting observations .
for example : most pilgrims watch cnn .
some of them even watch american movies .
however , the movies ' love scenes are carefully retouched , even though they are rather harmless from a western point of view .
the stewardesses wear headscarves and speak english – even with the arab passengers .
and many of the bearded men , who first appeared to be rather strict , conservative , and humorless , turn out to be very friendly family men .
they play happily with their kids and advise their loosely veiled wives on what makeup to buy from the choice of duty free products .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hajj terminal at jeddah airport : 2 million people arrive here - with their luggage before i finally put on my new pilgrim 's outfit , i first want to thank all the dw users for commenting on my first diary entries on the english , german , and arabic dw facebook pages - and for wishing me a safe trip .
i would like to reply to a question posted by hans youssef ernst from germany on the arabic page : " i 'm a christian and i would like to accompany my muslim friends to religious feasts in mecca some day .
do you think that this will be possible in the future ? "
dear hans youssef , i do n't dare to try and make a forecast .
as far as i know , the koran does n't explicitly state that non-muslims are n't allowed to visit mecca - but , as always , this is a matter of interpretation .
from a saudi perspective , non-muslims are definitely not allowed to visit the holy sites of mecca .
as an islamic scholar told me here in mecca : " that should be accepted , just like western constitutions need to be accepted by muslims living in europe .
by no means , however , you should mistake this as a sign of a lack respect or even contempt for non-muslims . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw reporter ali almakhlafi can move on after a short delay among islamic scholars , you can find different opinions about this topic .
there 's even a prominent politician who strongly criticizes the current prohibition : libya 's muammar al-gaddafi – who 's clearly not known to be a good friend of the western world .
five years ago , gaddafi asked for christians and jews to be allowed to visit mecca .
however , so far nothing changed … this monday , november 15 , i want to experience the pilgrim 's prayers at mount arafat and i will then attend the feast of sacrifice at mina .
i 've already collected quite a number of voices from other pilgrims .
i 'll tell you more about them in my next diary entry .

after an eventful journey , dw reporter ali almakhlafi has reached mecca , and started answering dw users ' questions .
but first - a sudden change of clothes . on sunday , nov .
14 , the moment had come : two million pilgrims from all around the world , and i was right there in the middle of them .
i visited the holy al-haram mosque , and saw the kaaba at its center .
i 've got to admit it : i was completely mesmerized .
there is really such a big difference between seeing it in pictures or reading about it in articles , and actually standing in front of it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 100,000 security forces are there to protect some 2 million pilgrims i 've been to cologne cathedral , the vatican , and the hagia sophia in istanbul before .
but the kaaba is special to me .
childhood memories of religion class in yemen come up - and somehow things seem to have come full circle .
originally , i arrived with a group of pilgrims , but i lost them in the crowd .
never mind , i say to myself ; it 's good to be alone , for i first need to digest this experience by myself .
despite the kaaba 's deep impact on me , i 'm still here as a journalist .
well , as a journalist that looks like a pilgrim .
and just how did that come about ?
let me tell you .
after facing some unexpected problems , i decided to change my polo shirt and jeans for the pilgrim 's robes .
i decided i do n't want to be recognized as a visitor anymore .
i 've had enough trouble with that already .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt airport : pilgrims , saudis , and foreigners heading to jeddah in saudi arabia you really feel misplaced among the masses of muslim pilgrims if you are smooth-shaven and casually-dressed .
in fact , i 've felt like this since i left frankfurt airport : the other passengers gave me startled looks .
and at the check-in counter of saudi airlines , none of the employees expected me to have the special hajj-visa in my passport .
pilgrims need to get special luggage stickers , so that their cases arrive on the separate hajj terminal at jeddah airport .
well , i got the stickers and my luggage arrived at the right terminal as well .
but i did n't .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american movies with arabic subtitles are shown on the airplane after my flight , i found myself at the terminal for non-pilgrims .
the employees at jeddah airport had sent me there because of my " civilian " getup .
there i was – surrounded by international tourists and business people .
after more than an hour of confusion , i finally got the last shuttle bus to the proper terminal at around midnight .
i was the only passenger … or , the only one who was late .
an american in mecca that could n't have happened to jack -lrb- name changed -rrb- .
jack is american .
he converted to islam a few years ago .
we first meet at frankfurt airport .
i ask him about his white hajj-clothes .
i want to know how he feels in this outfit .
after all , most people from the west would only wear clothes like that to a costume party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stewardess with a modern interpretation of a traditional headscarf " this probably looks funny to some of the people here , i guess , " says jack .
" i can tell by their looks . "
but jack does n't care .
" the hajj-outfit is meant to be simple and modest .
it reveals that religious beliefs do n't distinguish between rich and poor , black and white , etc . "
jack makes his comments as a muslim , but the way he says them , with his typical american accent , it almost sounds more like an american ideal .
flying , shopping , watching cnn aboard my plane to jeddah , i make some more interesting observations .
for example : most pilgrims watch cnn .
some of them even watch american movies .
however , the movies ' love scenes are carefully retouched , even though they are rather harmless from a western point of view .
the stewardesses wear headscarves and speak english – even with the arab passengers .
and many of the bearded men , who first appeared to be rather strict , conservative , and humorless , turn out to be very friendly family men .
they play happily with their kids and advise their loosely veiled wives on what makeup to buy from the choice of duty free products .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hajj terminal at jeddah airport : 2 million people arrive here - with their luggage before i finally put on my new pilgrim 's outfit , i first want to thank all the dw users for commenting on my first diary entries on the english , german , and arabic dw facebook pages - and for wishing me a safe trip .
i would like to reply to a question posted by hans youssef ernst from germany on the arabic page : " i 'm a christian and i would like to accompany my muslim friends to religious feasts in mecca some day .
do you think that this will be possible in the future ? "
dear hans youssef , i do n't dare to try and make a forecast .
as far as i know , the koran does n't explicitly state that non-muslims are n't allowed to visit mecca - but , as always , this is a matter of interpretation .
from a saudi perspective , non-muslims are definitely not allowed to visit the holy sites of mecca .
as an islamic scholar told me here in mecca : " that should be accepted , just like western constitutions need to be accepted by muslims living in europe .
by no means , however , you should mistake this as a sign of a lack respect or even contempt for non-muslims . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw reporter ali almakhlafi can move on after a short delay among islamic scholars , you can find different opinions about this topic .
there 's even a prominent politician who strongly criticizes the current prohibition : libya 's muammar al-gaddafi – who 's clearly not known to be a good friend of the western world .
five years ago , gaddafi asked for christians and jews to be allowed to visit mecca .
however , so far nothing changed … this monday , november 15 , i want to experience the pilgrim 's prayers at mount arafat and i will then attend the feast of sacrifice at mina .
i 've already collected quite a number of voices from other pilgrims .
i 'll tell you more about them in my next diary entry .

after an eventful journey , dw reporter ali almakhlafi has reached mecca , and started answering dw users ' questions .
but first - a sudden change of clothes . on sunday , nov .
14 , the moment had come : two million pilgrims from all around the world , and i was right there in the middle of them .
i visited the holy al-haram mosque , and saw the kaaba at its center .
i 've got to admit it : i was completely mesmerized .
there is really such a big difference between seeing it in pictures or reading about it in articles , and actually standing in front of it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 100,000 security forces are there to protect some 2 million pilgrims i 've been to cologne cathedral , the vatican , and the hagia sophia in istanbul before .
but the kaaba is special to me .
childhood memories of religion class in yemen come up - and somehow things seem to have come full circle .
originally , i arrived with a group of pilgrims , but i lost them in the crowd .
never mind , i say to myself ; it 's good to be alone , for i first need to digest this experience by myself .
despite the kaaba 's deep impact on me , i 'm still here as a journalist .
well , as a journalist that looks like a pilgrim .
and just how did that come about ?
let me tell you .
after facing some unexpected problems , i decided to change my polo shirt and jeans for the pilgrim 's robes .
i decided i do n't want to be recognized as a visitor anymore .
i 've had enough trouble with that already .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt airport : pilgrims , saudis , and foreigners heading to jeddah in saudi arabia you really feel misplaced among the masses of muslim pilgrims if you are smooth-shaven and casually-dressed .
in fact , i 've felt like this since i left frankfurt airport : the other passengers gave me startled looks .
and at the check-in counter of saudi airlines , none of the employees expected me to have the special hajj-visa in my passport .
pilgrims need to get special luggage stickers , so that their cases arrive on the separate hajj terminal at jeddah airport .
well , i got the stickers and my luggage arrived at the right terminal as well .
but i did n't .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american movies with arabic subtitles are shown on the airplane after my flight , i found myself at the terminal for non-pilgrims .
the employees at jeddah airport had sent me there because of my " civilian " getup .
there i was – surrounded by international tourists and business people .
after more than an hour of confusion , i finally got the last shuttle bus to the proper terminal at around midnight .
i was the only passenger … or , the only one who was late .
an american in mecca that could n't have happened to jack -lrb- name changed -rrb- .
jack is american .
he converted to islam a few years ago .
we first meet at frankfurt airport .
i ask him about his white hajj-clothes .
i want to know how he feels in this outfit .
after all , most people from the west would only wear clothes like that to a costume party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stewardess with a modern interpretation of a traditional headscarf " this probably looks funny to some of the people here , i guess , " says jack .
" i can tell by their looks . "
but jack does n't care .
" the hajj-outfit is meant to be simple and modest .
it reveals that religious beliefs do n't distinguish between rich and poor , black and white , etc . "
jack makes his comments as a muslim , but the way he says them , with his typical american accent , it almost sounds more like an american ideal .
flying , shopping , watching cnn aboard my plane to jeddah , i make some more interesting observations .
for example : most pilgrims watch cnn .
some of them even watch american movies .
however , the movies ' love scenes are carefully retouched , even though they are rather harmless from a western point of view .
the stewardesses wear headscarves and speak english – even with the arab passengers .
and many of the bearded men , who first appeared to be rather strict , conservative , and humorless , turn out to be very friendly family men .
they play happily with their kids and advise their loosely veiled wives on what makeup to buy from the choice of duty free products .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hajj terminal at jeddah airport : 2 million people arrive here - with their luggage before i finally put on my new pilgrim 's outfit , i first want to thank all the dw users for commenting on my first diary entries on the english , german , and arabic dw facebook pages - and for wishing me a safe trip .
i would like to reply to a question posted by hans youssef ernst from germany on the arabic page : " i 'm a christian and i would like to accompany my muslim friends to religious feasts in mecca some day .
do you think that this will be possible in the future ? "
dear hans youssef , i do n't dare to try and make a forecast .
as far as i know , the koran does n't explicitly state that non-muslims are n't allowed to visit mecca - but , as always , this is a matter of interpretation .
from a saudi perspective , non-muslims are definitely not allowed to visit the holy sites of mecca .
as an islamic scholar told me here in mecca : " that should be accepted , just like western constitutions need to be accepted by muslims living in europe .
by no means , however , you should mistake this as a sign of a lack respect or even contempt for non-muslims . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw reporter ali almakhlafi can move on after a short delay among islamic scholars , you can find different opinions about this topic .
there 's even a prominent politician who strongly criticizes the current prohibition : libya 's muammar al-gaddafi – who 's clearly not known to be a good friend of the western world .
five years ago , gaddafi asked for christians and jews to be allowed to visit mecca .
however , so far nothing changed … this monday , november 15 , i want to experience the pilgrim 's prayers at mount arafat and i will then attend the feast of sacrifice at mina .
i 've already collected quite a number of voices from other pilgrims .
i 'll tell you more about them in my next diary entry .

but experts say a ban would cause unnecessary stress for couples . thanks to a recent ruling by the federal court of justice , german women having a ' test-tube baby ' have the option of letting the doctor check if the embryo which will be implanted in her womb is likely to suffer from any serious diseases .
if the chances are high , she can decide not to have it implanted and try again .
such pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- used to be illegal in germany , but the decision in july found that such a test was legal if it was intended to exclude a serious handicap .
this caused consternation among germany 's christians , not least those belonging to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
many argued that an embryo enjoys complete human rights from the moment a sperm fertilizes an egg , and after some deliberation , merkel came down on their side last month .
disunity among mainstream christians in her opening speech at this week 's party conference , the chancellor gave a brief but unambiguous reiteration of her position : " i 'm in favor of a ban , because we ca n't properly define the boundaries . "
she did however acknowledge that many party colleagues have a different opinion , and welcomed a frank debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the boundaries of pid were too difficult to define prominent cdu members – notably cabinet ministers ursula von der leyen and kristina schroeder - as well as merkel 's coalition partners the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , see it differently , and have proposed a controlled use of pgd .
the issue divides other parties too , and when the issue comes before german parliament , it has been decided that the question will be decided by a free ‘ conscience ' vote , independent of party lines .
the main argument in favor of pgd simply points out that german law allows women to have an abortion even in the ninth month , if a test of the fetus shows a serious health condition .
if more diagnoses could be carried out before implantation , many such traumatic abortions could be avoided .
" it 's quite a contradiction that we do n't allow the cells to be checked , " argued cdu parliamentary state secretary peter hintze .
" but we do allow the fetus to be checked in the womb .
we should get rid of this contradiction . "
defining the boundaries the particular ' boundary ' that merkel feels is so difficult to define is between screening out genes that might lead to illness , handicaps or birth defects and producing what is known as ' designer babies . '
from a scientific point of view , it 's important to point out that ' diagnosis ' is a slightly misleading description , since the process does not involve identifying an illness in an embryo .
instead , pgd is a test for certain genetic conditions that could lead to disease .
pgd was first developed in britain in the late 1980s , and was first used for sex determination on embryos with diseases linked to certain chromosomes .
not long after the first successful births , it was banned in germany under the 1990 embryo protection act .
its main application is for determining the presence of recessive genetic disorders like cystic fibrosis , beta-thalassemia , sickle cell disease and spinal muscular atrophy type 1 .
the most common dominant diseases that can be screened by pgd are myotonic dystrophy , huntington 's disease and charcot-marie-tooth disease .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an outright ban would likely send many germans abroad for treatment it is also used to test for chromosomal abnormalities , which if excluded can increase the chances of ivf treatment being successful , by reducing the rate of miscarriages .
broad consensus in europe pgd is allowed in britain , but only for determining the presence of serious hereditary diseases or chromosome disorders .
in france , the procedure is only allowed if an inherited disease has been identified in one of the parents , and only if both parents have been living together for two years .
a similarly limited application of pgd is also in place in belgium , the netherlands , belgium , italy , and greece .
meanwhile an outright ban is in place in austria , ireland and switzerland .
but there is a fairly ambiguous legal position on pgd in many countries , where it is not expressly banned , but is implicitly prohibited through regulations on embryo research – this is the case in many us states .
sascha rudat , spokesman for the berlin chamber of physicians , told deutsche welle , " the problem is that couples where hereditary diseases are present , could say , ' we 're going abroad to have it done there . '
and of course that is n't desirable .
that 's a lot of stress , so i think we should re-consider whether a total ban is a good idea . "
rudat says the risks and stress of travel to a foreign country only make a complex and emotionally-charged treatment even more difficult .
" some couples are already in a stressful situation , " he said .
" as i said , they are often couples who already have certain hereditary illnesses , who may already have had a handicapped child , and who only want to do everything right .
if they travel it just adds extra burdens . "
for this reason , rudat believes that a regulated application is the only fair solution .
" we do n't consider a total ban desirable , " says rudat .
" we think that pgd should be possible under very strict conditions .
they are of course important . "

but experts say a ban would cause unnecessary stress for couples . thanks to a recent ruling by the federal court of justice , german women having a ' test-tube baby ' have the option of letting the doctor check if the embryo which will be implanted in her womb is likely to suffer from any serious diseases .
if the chances are high , she can decide not to have it implanted and try again .
such pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- used to be illegal in germany , but the decision in july found that such a test was legal if it was intended to exclude a serious handicap .
this caused consternation among germany 's christians , not least those belonging to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
many argued that an embryo enjoys complete human rights from the moment a sperm fertilizes an egg , and after some deliberation , merkel came down on their side last month .
disunity among mainstream christians in her opening speech at this week 's party conference , the chancellor gave a brief but unambiguous reiteration of her position : " i 'm in favor of a ban , because we ca n't properly define the boundaries . "
she did however acknowledge that many party colleagues have a different opinion , and welcomed a frank debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the boundaries of pid were too difficult to define prominent cdu members – notably cabinet ministers ursula von der leyen and kristina schroeder - as well as merkel 's coalition partners the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , see it differently , and have proposed a controlled use of pgd .
the issue divides other parties too , and when the issue comes before german parliament , it has been decided that the question will be decided by a free ‘ conscience ' vote , independent of party lines .
the main argument in favor of pgd simply points out that german law allows women to have an abortion even in the ninth month , if a test of the fetus shows a serious health condition .
if more diagnoses could be carried out before implantation , many such traumatic abortions could be avoided .
" it 's quite a contradiction that we do n't allow the cells to be checked , " argued cdu parliamentary state secretary peter hintze .
" but we do allow the fetus to be checked in the womb .
we should get rid of this contradiction . "
defining the boundaries the particular ' boundary ' that merkel feels is so difficult to define is between screening out genes that might lead to illness , handicaps or birth defects and producing what is known as ' designer babies . '
from a scientific point of view , it 's important to point out that ' diagnosis ' is a slightly misleading description , since the process does not involve identifying an illness in an embryo .
instead , pgd is a test for certain genetic conditions that could lead to disease .
pgd was first developed in britain in the late 1980s , and was first used for sex determination on embryos with diseases linked to certain chromosomes .
not long after the first successful births , it was banned in germany under the 1990 embryo protection act .

the issue divides other parties too , and when the issue comes before german parliament , it has been decided that the question will be decided by a free ‘ conscience ' vote , independent of party lines .
the main argument in favor of pgd simply points out that german law allows women to have an abortion even in the ninth month , if a test of the fetus shows a serious health condition .
if more diagnoses could be carried out before implantation , many such traumatic abortions could be avoided .
" it 's quite a contradiction that we do n't allow the cells to be checked , " argued cdu parliamentary state secretary peter hintze .
" but we do allow the fetus to be checked in the womb .
we should get rid of this contradiction . "
defining the boundaries the particular ' boundary ' that merkel feels is so difficult to define is between screening out genes that might lead to illness , handicaps or birth defects and producing what is known as ' designer babies . '
from a scientific point of view , it 's important to point out that ' diagnosis ' is a slightly misleading description , since the process does not involve identifying an illness in an embryo .
instead , pgd is a test for certain genetic conditions that could lead to disease .
pgd was first developed in britain in the late 1980s , and was first used for sex determination on embryos with diseases linked to certain chromosomes .
not long after the first successful births , it was banned in germany under the 1990 embryo protection act .
its main application is for determining the presence of recessive genetic disorders like cystic fibrosis , beta-thalassemia , sickle cell disease and spinal muscular atrophy type 1 .
the most common dominant diseases that can be screened by pgd are myotonic dystrophy , huntington 's disease and charcot-marie-tooth disease .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an outright ban would likely send many germans abroad for treatment it is also used to test for chromosomal abnormalities , which if excluded can increase the chances of ivf treatment being successful , by reducing the rate of miscarriages .
broad consensus in europe pgd is allowed in britain , but only for determining the presence of serious hereditary diseases or chromosome disorders .
in france , the procedure is only allowed if an inherited disease has been identified in one of the parents , and only if both parents have been living together for two years .
a similarly limited application of pgd is also in place in belgium , the netherlands , belgium , italy , and greece .
meanwhile an outright ban is in place in austria , ireland and switzerland .
but there is a fairly ambiguous legal position on pgd in many countries , where it is not expressly banned , but is implicitly prohibited through regulations on embryo research – this is the case in many us states .
sascha rudat , spokesman for the berlin chamber of physicians , told deutsche welle , " the problem is that couples where hereditary diseases are present , could say , ' we 're going abroad to have it done there . '
and of course that is n't desirable .
that 's a lot of stress , so i think we should re-consider whether a total ban is a good idea . "
rudat says the risks and stress of travel to a foreign country only make a complex and emotionally-charged treatment even more difficult .
" some couples are already in a stressful situation , " he said .
" as i said , they are often couples who already have certain hereditary illnesses , who may already have had a handicapped child , and who only want to do everything right .
if they travel it just adds extra burdens . "
for this reason , rudat believes that a regulated application is the only fair solution .
" we do n't consider a total ban desirable , " says rudat .
" we think that pgd should be possible under very strict conditions .
they are of course important . "

the ministers are supporters of parliamentary speaker gianfranco fini , a berlusconi rival . political problems in italy continue to escalate as four ministers - europe minister andrea ronchi , deputy economic development minister adolfo urso and two junior ministers - resigned from their posts in the government on monday .
" we all agree today that we need to move to a new phase in the italian centre-right , " said urso on news channel skytg24 monday .
the resignations indicate waning support for prime minister silvio berlusconi .
the four ministers who resigned are all supporters of former berlusconi ally-turned-rival gianfranco fini , who is speaker of the parliament .
fini and his supports in the future and freedom movement hope to see berlusconi resign .
the demand follows the latest in a long-running series of sex-scandal allegations involving berlusconi .
earlier in the month , fini had threatened to start pulling ministers out of the government if berlusconi did n't step down .
monday 's resignations show fini made good on his promise .
budget comes first however , berlusconi has called for a vote of confidence in parliament and would be willing to face political rivals at the polls if snap elections are deemed necessary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fini would like to see berlusconi resign but such a vote is not likely to come before the italian government passes its 2011 budget in the coming weeks , a decision which is itself a thorny issue due to italy 's massive debt problem .
the political turmoil could play out in a number of different ways in italy .
should berlusconi lose a vote of confidence , it would be up to president giorgio napolitano to decide if the existing parliament could form a new government .
napolitano could also appoint an interim government until new elections can take place .
if no agreement can be reached on a new government , parliament would be dissolved and snap elections would take place within 70 days .
