ever since jose mourinho took over the reins of the spanish giants there has been trepidation in the stands that his will be a stifling , grinding real madrid team , created in the same image of the portuguese coach 's previous champions league winners , the defensive-minded porto and inter milan .
jose is a winner - of that there is no doubt - but his teams often fail to get the heart racing .
winning has never been enough for real fans - they need to win with panache and ruthlessness .
there is no question that the madridistas now have a coach capable of returning silverware to the bernabeu 's trophy cabinet but now the massively-demanding army of white-shirted fanatics may have found a player of exquisite style to provide the other side of their eternal equation .
mesut oezil left the pitch last weekend to a standing ovation from the madrid supporters after producing a performance which bristled with urgency , creativity and passion .
" oezil has made an understated , but encouraging beginning to his career at the santiago bernabeu , " paul macdonald , the spanish correspondent for goal.com international , told deutsche welle .
" his displays have been generally regarded as a positive element of what were , in the main , sterile displays in the final third in real 's early games . "
" kaka 's long-term absence has instilled oezil as the first-choice attacking midfielder at the club , and with promising spanish prospect sergio canales suffering an early season spell on the sidelines , the former werder man looks likely to be the creative force from the centre of the pitch for the majority of the season . "
the germany midfielder may be struggling with the language of his new home but he appears to have understood exactly what his new fans desire .
it is very early in the young midfielder 's madrid story to say for sure but the former werder bremen man appears to have been taken to the hearts of the fickle madridistas who have christened him el búho – the owl .
time will tell if he stays there .
" the bernabeu audience appreciate his ability to select a pass and his attractive mentality , which is as necessary to many madridistas as any victory , " said macdonald .
" however , he 's not making front page news just yet but there are enough signs to suggest that his transfer will prove to be a rare piece of shrewd business from the spanish giants in their recent history . "
oezil 's style made to order for madrid faithful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mourinho knew exactly what he was getting when signing oezil of course , mourinho knew what he was getting when he paid 15 million euros for oezil after a summer spent terrorizing defences at the world cup .
however , despite witnessing oezil 's exploits with germany in south africa , the real fans needed longer to be convinced of the qualities of this slightly built 21-year-old german of turkish origin .
his early display hinted at what was to come .
against deportivo , oezil provided the final piece of evidence .
after a pinpoint corner found cristiano ronaldo 's head in the fourth minute , giving the portuguese star the perfect opportunity to open the scoring , oezil grew in stature and confidence .
he marauded through the shell-shocked deportivo team at will , driving madrid forward with a style missing from previous incarnations .
ponderous build-ups are a thing of the past now that oezil is in the real team ; the youngster now has the job of increasing the pace and scaring the living daylights out of defences more used to sedate afternoons .
his real team mates seem to respond to oezil 's desire to attack .
ronaldo looks happy to have a flair player playing off him again while argentinean winger angel di maria , another new signing , has also struck up an understanding with the german .
both players shone against deportivo as oezil continually brought them into play and provided them with opportunities .
" his dependency on his left foot bears a slight resemblance to revered playmaker guti , and the 4-2-3-1 formation that mourinho is currently operating sees him employed in his optimal position behind a main striker , gonzalo higuain , " said macdonald .
" a concern may be cristiano ronaldo 's tendency to cut across the pitch , stifling his space , and forcing oezil into unfamiliar areas of the pitch in order to collect the ball .
however , as ronaldo 's self-dependency erodes under the tutelage of mourinho , oezil should be allowed to flourish . "
mesut speaks the language of love to newly adoring fans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil will enjoy adoration if he can replicate his germany form the fact that oezil scored real 's second goal in the drubbing of deportivo – his first for his new team – was just rewards for a performance which saw him involved in everything that was good for his new club side .
the effort and commitment , sometimes lacking from real teams which became bloated with star value and weighed down by ego , did not go unnoticed by the bernabeu crowd .
" i was proud to hear the applause from the audience , really proud , " oezil told spanish daily newspaper , marca .
" the crowd is helping me a lot but also all the team .
i always want to give the best i can on the field and hope people will continue to be happy with my football , but most importantly because the team has won . "
oezil 's footwork has done much to endear him to the madrid supporters but his words also show that he is beginning to understand the language of real , even if his spanish is stuttering at best .
" we want to win everything , including the champions league , and i urge the fans to trust us , " he enthused .
" mourinho motivates us a lot but he also demands the utmost from his team .
i enjoy playing here and it shows on the field . "

after a pinpoint corner found cristiano ronaldo 's head in the fourth minute , giving the portuguese star the perfect opportunity to open the scoring , oezil grew in stature and confidence .
he marauded through the shell-shocked deportivo team at will , driving madrid forward with a style missing from previous incarnations .
ponderous build-ups are a thing of the past now that oezil is in the real team ; the youngster now has the job of increasing the pace and scaring the living daylights out of defences more used to sedate afternoons .
his real team mates seem to respond to oezil 's desire to attack .
ronaldo looks happy to have a flair player playing off him again while argentinean winger angel di maria , another new signing , has also struck up an understanding with the german .
both players shone against deportivo as oezil continually brought them into play and provided them with opportunities .
" his dependency on his left foot bears a slight resemblance to revered playmaker guti , and the 4-2-3-1 formation that mourinho is currently operating sees him employed in his optimal position behind a main striker , gonzalo higuain , " said macdonald .
" a concern may be cristiano ronaldo 's tendency to cut across the pitch , stifling his space , and forcing oezil into unfamiliar areas of the pitch in order to collect the ball .
however , as ronaldo 's self-dependency erodes under the tutelage of mourinho , oezil should be allowed to flourish . "
mesut speaks the language of love to newly adoring fans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil will enjoy adoration if he can replicate his germany form the fact that oezil scored real 's second goal in the drubbing of deportivo – his first for his new team – was just rewards for a performance which saw him involved in everything that was good for his new club side .
the effort and commitment , sometimes lacking from real teams which became bloated with star value and weighed down by ego , did not go unnoticed by the bernabeu crowd .
" i was proud to hear the applause from the audience , really proud , " oezil told spanish daily newspaper , marca .
" the crowd is helping me a lot but also all the team .
i always want to give the best i can on the field and hope people will continue to be happy with my football , but most importantly because the team has won . "
oezil 's footwork has done much to endear him to the madrid supporters but his words also show that he is beginning to understand the language of real , even if his spanish is stuttering at best .
" we want to win everything , including the champions league , and i urge the fans to trust us , " he enthused .
" mourinho motivates us a lot but he also demands the utmost from his team .
i enjoy playing here and it shows on the field . "

but a leading think tank has warned against giving raises too soon . germany 's foreign minister and deputy chancellor , guido westerwelle , has added his support to comments made by economics minster rainer bruederle about increased wages for german workers . " when the economy grows and this growth is substantial and sustainable , then the benefits of this upswing should be felt by the people who worked so hard for it , " westerwelle told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper in an interview .
westerwelle heads the free-market liberal fdp , which shares power with chancellor merkel 's christian coalition . earlier this week , bruederle , also an fdp member , said in light of germany 's currently growing economy , those economic gains should trickle down to employees in the form of higher wages .
merkel , who is also the head of the christian democratic union , supported bruederle 's idea . " that is something the chancellor sees the same way , letter for letter , " said merkel 's spokesman , steffen seibert . not so fast earlier this week , analysts predicted growth of 3.5 percent this year and 2 percent in 2011 .
germany 's five leading economic think tanks also predicted that the number of unemployed would fall below 3 million next year , the lowest level since 1992 . despite the current rosy outlook for the german economy , not everyone is convinced that a growing economy should inevitably lead to higher wages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimmermann says higher pay is good - for some branches the president of the german institute for economic research , klaus zimmermann , warned against reacting too quickly . " i ca n't support the idea of a general wage increase , i think it is too dangerous , " zimmermann said in an interview with the handelsblatt newspaper . zimmermann was n't opposed to the idea of raising wages , but said he was against across-the-board increases for all sectors and pointed out that not every industry is benefitting the same from the growing economy . " we ca n't forget that the german economy did not resort to mass lay-offs when it was n't going so well last year , " zimmermann said . raising wages in some branches could be a good idea , zimmermann said , as that would make those branches more attractive option to potential workers from outside of germany . author : matt zuvela -lrb- reuters / dapd / dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but helmand is likely to remain a place where many die and a few get rich . " we know that gifts are part of afghan culture but we can not accept them , nor issue a contract for simple friendship . "
us marines captain lambert is crystal clear about this .
in front of him , 200 pashtun businessmen applaud after listening to the regiment 's interpreter 's translation into dari .
" we want the reconstruction money to stay here so we count on you , businessmen and businesswomen from helmand , " adds the us soldier , despite the total absence of women in the room .
captain lambert 's martial silhouette blackens against the power point presentation .
" professionalism , " " mutual respect , " " honesty " ... can be read on the slide behind him - " essential " work parameters for the rcc -lrb- regional contracting center -rrb- , which is mainly lead by the usaid and the us army .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us business presentations appeal to afghan honesty and professionalism the presentation of helmand 's 4th business conference finishes with applause and an invite for lunch outside by the marines .
generous portions of rice with raisins and meat are distributed from a truck to all those who have gathered at the helmand governor 's assembly hall .
the locals eat on the floor around the silver round trays while the us soldiers line the benches .
but after the apple and banana for dessert both groups mix for the tête-à-tête with the marines who have set up in different stalls .
" buy local , build afghanistan , " extols the slogan above them . $ 22.5 million -lrb- 16 million euros -rrb- are waiting to be distributed among all those " committed to rebuild their country . "
pashtuns in shalwar kameez -lrb- the loose local outfit -rrb- and turbans swirl around the military , struggling to hand them their business cards .
serving in a shirt and camouflage pants a bit too tight for the conservative local standards , the only us marine female soldier is doubtless collecting the majority of them .
" the most important thing is that the reconstruction is made by and for helmandies , " she says .
" but they have to understand that it has to be done the american way : everything has to be transparent ! "
quality indicators bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans mix business with pleasure in the hope of establishing contacts at just 30 , wahid already has his own construction company .
today , he is attending his first business conference ever .
" i have the best team to build a good road to gereshk , " says the young entrepreneur .
he refers to that section funded only two years ago with 52 million euros -lrb- $ 73 million -rrb- by both the uk and denmark , but whose work has not yet begun .
" we 're already working on it , " is the helmand governor 's recurring answer .
having previously attended three of the four business conferences held in helmand , ismatullah is one of the seasoned veterans .

but helmand is likely to remain a place where many die and a few get rich . " we know that gifts are part of afghan culture but we can not accept them , nor issue a contract for simple friendship . "
us marines captain lambert is crystal clear about this .
in front of him , 200 pashtun businessmen applaud after listening to the regiment 's interpreter 's translation into dari .
" we want the reconstruction money to stay here so we count on you , businessmen and businesswomen from helmand , " adds the us soldier , despite the total absence of women in the room .
captain lambert 's martial silhouette blackens against the power point presentation .
" professionalism , " " mutual respect , " " honesty " ... can be read on the slide behind him - " essential " work parameters for the rcc -lrb- regional contracting center -rrb- , which is mainly lead by the usaid and the us army .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us business presentations appeal to afghan honesty and professionalism the presentation of helmand 's 4th business conference finishes with applause and an invite for lunch outside by the marines .
generous portions of rice with raisins and meat are distributed from a truck to all those who have gathered at the helmand governor 's assembly hall .
the locals eat on the floor around the silver round trays while the us soldiers line the benches .
but after the apple and banana for dessert both groups mix for the tête-à-tête with the marines who have set up in different stalls .
" buy local , build afghanistan , " extols the slogan above them . $ 22.5 million -lrb- 16 million euros -rrb- are waiting to be distributed among all those " committed to rebuild their country . "
pashtuns in shalwar kameez -lrb- the loose local outfit -rrb- and turbans swirl around the military , struggling to hand them their business cards .
serving in a shirt and camouflage pants a bit too tight for the conservative local standards , the only us marine female soldier is doubtless collecting the majority of them .
" the most important thing is that the reconstruction is made by and for helmandies , " she says .
" but they have to understand that it has to be done the american way : everything has to be transparent ! "

he refers to that section funded only two years ago with 52 million euros -lrb- $ 73 million -rrb- by both the uk and denmark , but whose work has not yet begun .
" we 're already working on it , " is the helmand governor 's recurring answer .
having previously attended three of the four business conferences held in helmand , ismatullah is one of the seasoned veterans .
he asked for permission to get to the stand during captain lambert 's presentation but was prevented from doing so .

fears that paris ' main airports would run out of fuel , however , eased as a pipeline reopened . at least 825,000 people across france took part in protest marches against the government 's proposed pension reform on saturday , according to the interior ministry , the lowest official total since protests began in september . unions , however , estimated the turnout at " around 3 million , " and labor leaders insisted the campaign would continue . " the movement is taking root and growing in terms of the number of companies hit by various forms of strike as in the number of employees taking part in the action , " the powerful cgt union said in a statement released saturday . labor minister eric woerth , however , insisted there had been a " significant drop-off " from the 1.2 million people who marched against the reforms on tuesday . " there were , nevertheless , still a lot of protesters .

only smaller airport were still be affected the strikes . service stations were also running low on fuel , though finance minister christine lagarde told rtl television that only 230 stations out of 3,000 had run dry .
she insisted that they had " several weeks of fuel stocks " and called on people not to panic about potential shortages . " i 'm sure that with intelligent social dialogue we will be able to free things up rather than block them , " she said . oil companies have been given permission by the government to tap into their own reserves , but officials have so far not allowed access to a strategic reserve , which is controlled by a government committee . meanwhile , the strikes have also affected france 's national rail system , sncf .
about half of the network 's scheduled trains were cancelled on saturday . truck drivers are expected to join the strike action on sunday evening , putting their ability to affect traffic behind the protest effort . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friday 's protests led to over 200 arrests more strikes planned the latest strikes against the proposed pension reform started tuesday , when around a million people marched in protests around the country . unions and the socialist opposition have vowed to defend the right to retire at 60 .
they accuse president nicolas sarkozy of making workers carry the burden for the failure of the financial sector , and have proposed increasing taxes on the rich . high school students have become increasingly involved , leading to some conflicts with police .
on friday , protests involving students escalated and police used tear gas to disperse the crowds .
over 200 arrests were made and several police officers were injured . raising the minimum retirement age has already been approved by france 's national assembly , and the motion is scheduled for a vote in the senate on wednesday . bernard thibault , head of cgt , one of france 's largest unions , said if the law is passed by the second house of parliament the protests may not end . " you know from experience that even a law that has been passed does n't end dissent , " he told europe 1 radio , referring to a law on youth employment that was passed but never applied . french labor unions hope to pressure the government into changing its plans for pension reform and have called for another nationwide strike on tuesday ahead of the senate vote .

but a leading think tank has warned against giving raises too soon . germany 's foreign minister and deputy chancellor , guido westerwelle , has added his support to comments made by economics minster rainer bruederle about increased wages for german workers . " when the economy grows and this growth is substantial and sustainable , then the benefits of this upswing should be felt by the people who worked so hard for it , " westerwelle told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper in an interview .
westerwelle heads the free-market liberal fdp , which shares power with chancellor merkel 's christian coalition . earlier this week , bruederle , also an fdp member , said in light of germany 's currently growing economy , those economic gains should trickle down to employees in the form of higher wages .
merkel , who is also the head of the christian democratic union , supported bruederle 's idea . " that is something the chancellor sees the same way , letter for letter , " said merkel 's spokesman , steffen seibert . not so fast earlier this week , analysts predicted growth of 3.5 percent this year and 2 percent in 2011 .
germany 's five leading economic think tanks also predicted that the number of unemployed would fall below 3 million next year , the lowest level since 1992 . despite the current rosy outlook for the german economy , not everyone is convinced that a growing economy should inevitably lead to higher wages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimmermann says higher pay is good - for some branches the president of the german institute for economic research , klaus zimmermann , warned against reacting too quickly . " i ca n't support the idea of a general wage increase , i think it is too dangerous , " zimmermann said in an interview with the handelsblatt newspaper . zimmermann was n't opposed to the idea of raising wages , but said he was against across-the-board increases for all sectors and pointed out that not every industry is benefitting the same from the growing economy . " we ca n't forget that the german economy did not resort to mass lay-offs when it was n't going so well last year , " zimmermann said . raising wages in some branches could be a good idea , zimmermann said , as that would make those branches more attractive option to potential workers from outside of germany . author : matt zuvela -lrb- reuters / dapd / dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we received the french documents , we will analyze them during the weekend , " european commission spokesman matthew newman said . newman would not give any details of the french reply , but french immigration minister eric besson had earlier signaled that president nicolas sarkozy 's government was prepared to adapt the immigration legislation " to comply with european law " and to have it drawn up to be presented to parliament by december . earlier friday , eu commission spokesman olivier bailly told reporters that if paris missed the deadline , " an infringement procedure would be opened by the end of october . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy was staunch in his calls for the deportations the french representative to the commission , michel barnier , said he was confident the eu executive would make " an impartial and objective " evaluation on whether france had done enough to escape eu sanctions . roma targets under the new legislation , france has repatriated more than 8,000 roma to romania and bulgaria since the beginning of the year . it justified this by referring to an eu directive from 2004 which stated that eu citizens had the right to remain in a member state longer than three months only if they could show they were working or if they had enough money to provide for themselves and their family . france also pointed out that many roma in the country were living in illegally established camps and were without the required health insurance . however , the policy came under fire from brussels when it appeared that police had been ordered to target roma camps as they went about tackling irregular migration . unfairly expelled eu justice commissioner viviane reding said in september that the policy reminded her of nazi-era deportations of jews and gypsies , a statement that ignited a fierce debate with french officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding heavily attacked the french bill the united nations and the roman catholic church also spoke out against the law , saying it unfairly singled out roma migrants for expulsion . the eu commission 's 27 members are set to debate the issue later this month and are required to reach a unanimous decision on how to proceed . a negative assessment of french efforts to revise its policy would trigger an eu infringement procedure , which could eventually see france having to defend itself before the european court of justice and risk incurring a hefty fine . author : darren mara , sarah harman -lrb- reuters , afp -rrb- editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a leading think tank has warned against giving raises too soon . germany 's foreign minister and deputy chancellor , guido westerwelle , has added his support to comments made by economics minster rainer bruederle about increased wages for german workers . " when the economy grows and this growth is substantial and sustainable , then the benefits of this upswing should be felt by the people who worked so hard for it , " westerwelle told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper in an interview .
westerwelle heads the free-market liberal fdp , which shares power with chancellor merkel 's christian coalition . earlier this week , bruederle , also an fdp member , said in light of germany 's currently growing economy , those economic gains should trickle down to employees in the form of higher wages .

" that is something the chancellor sees the same way , letter for letter , " said merkel 's spokesman , steffen seibert . not so fast earlier this week , analysts predicted growth of 3.5 percent this year and 2 percent in 2011 .

" we ca n't forget that the german economy did not resort to mass lay-offs when it was n't going so well last year , " zimmermann said . raising wages in some branches could be a good idea , zimmermann said , as that would make those branches more attractive option to potential workers from outside of germany . author : matt zuvela -lrb- reuters / dapd / dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but helmand is likely to remain a place where many die and a few get rich . " we know that gifts are part of afghan culture but we can not accept them , nor issue a contract for simple friendship . "
us marines captain lambert is crystal clear about this .
in front of him , 200 pashtun businessmen applaud after listening to the regiment 's interpreter 's translation into dari .
" we want the reconstruction money to stay here so we count on you , businessmen and businesswomen from helmand , " adds the us soldier , despite the total absence of women in the room .
captain lambert 's martial silhouette blackens against the power point presentation .
" professionalism , " " mutual respect , " " honesty " ... can be read on the slide behind him - " essential " work parameters for the rcc -lrb- regional contracting center -rrb- , which is mainly lead by the usaid and the us army .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us business presentations appeal to afghan honesty and professionalism the presentation of helmand 's 4th business conference finishes with applause and an invite for lunch outside by the marines .
generous portions of rice with raisins and meat are distributed from a truck to all those who have gathered at the helmand governor 's assembly hall .
the locals eat on the floor around the silver round trays while the us soldiers line the benches .
but after the apple and banana for dessert both groups mix for the tête-à-tête with the marines who have set up in different stalls .
" buy local , build afghanistan , " extols the slogan above them . $ 22.5 million -lrb- 16 million euros -rrb- are waiting to be distributed among all those " committed to rebuild their country . "
pashtuns in shalwar kameez -lrb- the loose local outfit -rrb- and turbans swirl around the military , struggling to hand them their business cards .
serving in a shirt and camouflage pants a bit too tight for the conservative local standards , the only us marine female soldier is doubtless collecting the majority of them .
" the most important thing is that the reconstruction is made by and for helmandies , " she says .
" but they have to understand that it has to be done the american way : everything has to be transparent ! "
quality indicators bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans mix business with pleasure in the hope of establishing contacts at just 30 , wahid already has his own construction company .
today , he is attending his first business conference ever .
" i have the best team to build a good road to gereshk , " says the young entrepreneur .
he refers to that section funded only two years ago with 52 million euros -lrb- $ 73 million -rrb- by both the uk and denmark , but whose work has not yet begun .
" we 're already working on it , " is the helmand governor 's recurring answer .
having previously attended three of the four business conferences held in helmand , ismatullah is one of the seasoned veterans .
he asked for permission to get to the stand during captain lambert 's presentation but was prevented from doing so .
" two years ago i got a subcontract from an american company .
they told me to buy equipment worth 1.8 million afghanis -lrb- 30,000 euros -rrb- but i never heard from them again , " says this pashtun from nad-e-ali , one of the many " no-go areas " in helmand .
saif has flown in from kabul today just for the conference .
this local from tora bora , on the pakistani border , works for roshan , the afghan main phone company , but he also has his own construction company .
nonetheless , he claims not to have won a single contract since he started up two years ago .
" all of these visiting cards the marines are collecting go directly to the trash , " says the disappointed pashtun in the perfect english he learned as a student in peshawar .
locals losing out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : locals want to help rebuild their country , but need the funds to do so " contracts are always taken by the people inside the military compound , starting with the translator .
he also has his own construction company , you just need $ 1,000 to establish one .
but there are also the close friends and the relatives of the soldiers themselves , many of whom have created their own business companies in afghanistan .
of every $ 100 that come into afghanistan , $ 80 go back to the states , " says saif flatly .
" i aspire to a subcontract , but i 'd be happy with just a sub-sub , or even sub-sub-subcontract , " abdul hamid , a native of lashkar gah , helmand province 's capital city , says somewhat wryly .
" the little they get to build simply collapses due to the substandard materials .
these marines are able to build a school with sandbags , " adds this pashtun just before heading toward the regiment 's translator .
" their bases are the only thing they build solid , " says ali reza , who just came " for the free food . "
" did you get to see the base they have in kandahar when you flew here from kabul ?
well , the one they have in logar province is even bigger ! , " adds this 40-year-old truck driver on his free day .
" you know how much they are paying for a one-room russian flat in kabul ? $ 100,000 .
russian is still the best quality in afghanistan , " says sharifullah , 55 , adding that " more and more people look back with nostalgia at najibullah 's times . "
-lrb- mohammad najibullah was afghanistan 's last president of the soviet-backed democratic republic of afghanistan - ed . -rrb-
" may allah bless his soul , " says the pashtun of the deceased former communist president of afghanistan .
behind him , a group of marines fold sawhorse tables and remove the banners hanging above them .

the young country now faces snap elections in as soon as 45 days . the junior partner in kosovo 's ruling coalition said saturday it was quitting the government of prime minister hashim thaci , a day after an early election was called for february .
" starting from monday , october 18 , the democratic league of kosovo -lrb- ldk -rrb- withdraws from the ruling coalition , in other words from the kosovo government , " the party said in a statement , without providing further details .
kosovo now has eight days to pull together a caretaker government or hold elections within 45 days after that .
the vote will mark the first general elections since kosovo proclaimed its independence from serbia in february 2008 .
the ldk , the party of former kosovo president fatmir sejdiu , held the post of deputy prime minister and five ministerial posts , including foreign minister , in the 12-member cabinet .
with the departure of the party , the government no longer has a parliamentary majority .
talks with serbia delayed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state hillary clinton -lrb- here with thaci -rrb- supports the talks with serbia the announcement came a day after kosovo 's interim president jakup krasniqi called an early election for february 13 , following the surprise resignation of sejdiu in late september after the constitutional court ruled he could not lead the ldk while in office .
thaci 's pdk party said the ldk 's decision could send the country into a political crisis .
" after this decision we have new circumstances and an institutional crisis , " deputy pdk leader enver hoxhaj said , reading a party statement .
" now , emergency constitutional and political solutions are needed for our country . "
the breakdown of the coalition will delay european union-sponsored talks with serbia , which refuses to recognize the independence of its former southern province .
the news also puts the privatization of several important state-owned companies on hold , including that of the state-owned telecoms firm , a move which the ldk opposes .
kosovo is one of the poorest countries in europe , with an unemployment rate of more than 45 percent .
the government was counting on the privatization to bring in some foreign investment .

" we received the french documents , we will analyze them during the weekend , " european commission spokesman matthew newman said . newman would not give any details of the french reply , but french immigration minister eric besson had earlier signaled that president nicolas sarkozy 's government was prepared to adapt the immigration legislation " to comply with european law " and to have it drawn up to be presented to parliament by december . earlier friday , eu commission spokesman olivier bailly told reporters that if paris missed the deadline , " an infringement procedure would be opened by the end of october . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy was staunch in his calls for the deportations the french representative to the commission , michel barnier , said he was confident the eu executive would make " an impartial and objective " evaluation on whether france had done enough to escape eu sanctions . roma targets under the new legislation , france has repatriated more than 8,000 roma to romania and bulgaria since the beginning of the year . it justified this by referring to an eu directive from 2004 which stated that eu citizens had the right to remain in a member state longer than three months only if they could show they were working or if they had enough money to provide for themselves and their family . france also pointed out that many roma in the country were living in illegally established camps and were without the required health insurance . however , the policy came under fire from brussels when it appeared that police had been ordered to target roma camps as they went about tackling irregular migration . unfairly expelled eu justice commissioner viviane reding said in september that the policy reminded her of nazi-era deportations of jews and gypsies , a statement that ignited a fierce debate with french officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding heavily attacked the french bill the united nations and the roman catholic church also spoke out against the law , saying it unfairly singled out roma migrants for expulsion . the eu commission 's 27 members are set to debate the issue later this month and are required to reach a unanimous decision on how to proceed . a negative assessment of french efforts to revise its policy would trigger an eu infringement procedure , which could eventually see france having to defend itself before the european court of justice and risk incurring a hefty fine . author : darren mara , sarah harman -lrb- reuters , afp -rrb- editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the first topic broached at the talks dealt with the service capabilities and intended use of the new railway hub , as well as with the laying of new rail tracks for the project .
veteran politician and chief mediator heiner geissler said after sixh hours of talks both sides " came to the conclusion that we want to resolve this dispute . "
" we believe we have made an important contribution to easing tensions over the last weeks and months , " he added .
geissler said a desire to keep the peace would underpin the conciliatory meetings and that construction work would not continue while the talks were ongoing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rail project will cost around seven billion euros the premier of baden-wuerttemberg state , stefan mappus , had earlier said no further demolition work or tree-clearing would take place until the next state election , scheduled for march 2011 .
groundwater works to continue geissler said friday , however , that groundwater management works in the stuttgart schlossgarten park would continue under a compromise deal : earthworks are to go ahead , but construction work , such as paving , would be put on hold .
matthias von herrmann , a spokesperson for the opposition to the project , said after the talks that " substantial construction work in the sclossgarten would be humiliating for the victims of the brutal and disproportionate police action " against protestors .
on september 30 , police used water cannons , tear gas and pepper spray against protestors they said had turned violent .

but a leading think tank has warned against giving raises too soon . germany 's foreign minister and deputy chancellor , guido westerwelle , has added his support to comments made by economics minster rainer bruederle about increased wages for german workers . " when the economy grows and this growth is substantial and sustainable , then the benefits of this upswing should be felt by the people who worked so hard for it , " westerwelle told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper in an interview .
westerwelle heads the free-market liberal fdp , which shares power with chancellor merkel 's christian coalition . earlier this week , bruederle , also an fdp member , said in light of germany 's currently growing economy , those economic gains should trickle down to employees in the form of higher wages .
merkel , who is also the head of the christian democratic union , supported bruederle 's idea . " that is something the chancellor sees the same way , letter for letter , " said merkel 's spokesman , steffen seibert . not so fast earlier this week , analysts predicted growth of 3.5 percent this year and 2 percent in 2011 .
germany 's five leading economic think tanks also predicted that the number of unemployed would fall below 3 million next year , the lowest level since 1992 . despite the current rosy outlook for the german economy , not everyone is convinced that a growing economy should inevitably lead to higher wages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimmermann says higher pay is good - for some branches the president of the german institute for economic research , klaus zimmermann , warned against reacting too quickly . " i ca n't support the idea of a general wage increase , i think it is too dangerous , " zimmermann said in an interview with the handelsblatt newspaper . zimmermann was n't opposed to the idea of raising wages , but said he was against across-the-board increases for all sectors and pointed out that not every industry is benefitting the same from the growing economy . " we ca n't forget that the german economy did not resort to mass lay-offs when it was n't going so well last year , " zimmermann said . raising wages in some branches could be a good idea , zimmermann said , as that would make those branches more attractive option to potential workers from outside of germany . author : matt zuvela -lrb- reuters / dapd / dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but helmand is likely to remain a place where many die and a few get rich . " we know that gifts are part of afghan culture but we can not accept them , nor issue a contract for simple friendship . "
us marines captain lambert is crystal clear about this .
in front of him , 200 pashtun businessmen applaud after listening to the regiment 's interpreter 's translation into dari .
" we want the reconstruction money to stay here so we count on you , businessmen and businesswomen from helmand , " adds the us soldier , despite the total absence of women in the room .
captain lambert 's martial silhouette blackens against the power point presentation .
" professionalism , " " mutual respect , " " honesty " ... can be read on the slide behind him - " essential " work parameters for the rcc -lrb- regional contracting center -rrb- , which is mainly lead by the usaid and the us army .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us business presentations appeal to afghan honesty and professionalism the presentation of helmand 's 4th business conference finishes with applause and an invite for lunch outside by the marines .
generous portions of rice with raisins and meat are distributed from a truck to all those who have gathered at the helmand governor 's assembly hall .
the locals eat on the floor around the silver round trays while the us soldiers line the benches .
but after the apple and banana for dessert both groups mix for the tête-à-tête with the marines who have set up in different stalls .
" buy local , build afghanistan , " extols the slogan above them . $ 22.5 million -lrb- 16 million euros -rrb- are waiting to be distributed among all those " committed to rebuild their country . "
pashtuns in shalwar kameez -lrb- the loose local outfit -rrb- and turbans swirl around the military , struggling to hand them their business cards .
serving in a shirt and camouflage pants a bit too tight for the conservative local standards , the only us marine female soldier is doubtless collecting the majority of them .
" the most important thing is that the reconstruction is made by and for helmandies , " she says .
" but they have to understand that it has to be done the american way : everything has to be transparent ! "
quality indicators bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans mix business with pleasure in the hope of establishing contacts at just 30 , wahid already has his own construction company .
today , he is attending his first business conference ever .
" i have the best team to build a good road to gereshk , " says the young entrepreneur .
he refers to that section funded only two years ago with 52 million euros -lrb- $ 73 million -rrb- by both the uk and denmark , but whose work has not yet begun .
" we 're already working on it , " is the helmand governor 's recurring answer .
having previously attended three of the four business conferences held in helmand , ismatullah is one of the seasoned veterans .
he asked for permission to get to the stand during captain lambert 's presentation but was prevented from doing so .
" two years ago i got a subcontract from an american company .
they told me to buy equipment worth 1.8 million afghanis -lrb- 30,000 euros -rrb- but i never heard from them again , " says this pashtun from nad-e-ali , one of the many " no-go areas " in helmand .
saif has flown in from kabul today just for the conference .
this local from tora bora , on the pakistani border , works for roshan , the afghan main phone company , but he also has his own construction company .
nonetheless , he claims not to have won a single contract since he started up two years ago .
" all of these visiting cards the marines are collecting go directly to the trash , " says the disappointed pashtun in the perfect english he learned as a student in peshawar .
locals losing out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : locals want to help rebuild their country , but need the funds to do so " contracts are always taken by the people inside the military compound , starting with the translator .
he also has his own construction company , you just need $ 1,000 to establish one .
but there are also the close friends and the relatives of the soldiers themselves , many of whom have created their own business companies in afghanistan .
of every $ 100 that come into afghanistan , $ 80 go back to the states , " says saif flatly .
" i aspire to a subcontract , but i 'd be happy with just a sub-sub , or even sub-sub-subcontract , " abdul hamid , a native of lashkar gah , helmand province 's capital city , says somewhat wryly .
" the little they get to build simply collapses due to the substandard materials .
these marines are able to build a school with sandbags , " adds this pashtun just before heading toward the regiment 's translator .
" their bases are the only thing they build solid , " says ali reza , who just came " for the free food . "
" did you get to see the base they have in kandahar when you flew here from kabul ?
well , the one they have in logar province is even bigger ! , " adds this 40-year-old truck driver on his free day .
" you know how much they are paying for a one-room russian flat in kabul ? $ 100,000 .
russian is still the best quality in afghanistan , " says sharifullah , 55 , adding that " more and more people look back with nostalgia at najibullah 's times . "
-lrb- mohammad najibullah was afghanistan 's last president of the soviet-backed democratic republic of afghanistan - ed . -rrb-
" may allah bless his soul , " says the pashtun of the deceased former communist president of afghanistan .
behind him , a group of marines fold sawhorse tables and remove the banners hanging above them .

but a leading think tank has warned against giving raises too soon . germany 's foreign minister and deputy chancellor , guido westerwelle , has added his support to comments made by economics minster rainer bruederle about increased wages for german workers . " when the economy grows and this growth is substantial and sustainable , then the benefits of this upswing should be felt by the people who worked so hard for it , " westerwelle told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper in an interview .
westerwelle heads the free-market liberal fdp , which shares power with chancellor merkel 's christian coalition . earlier this week , bruederle , also an fdp member , said in light of germany 's currently growing economy , those economic gains should trickle down to employees in the form of higher wages .
merkel , who is also the head of the christian democratic union , supported bruederle 's idea .

" we received the french documents , we will analyze them during the weekend , " european commission spokesman matthew newman said . newman would not give any details of the french reply , but french immigration minister eric besson had earlier signaled that president nicolas sarkozy 's government was prepared to adapt the immigration legislation " to comply with european law " and to have it drawn up to be presented to parliament by december . earlier friday , eu commission spokesman olivier bailly told reporters that if paris missed the deadline , " an infringement procedure would be opened by the end of october . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy was staunch in his calls for the deportations the french representative to the commission , michel barnier , said he was confident the eu executive would make " an impartial and objective " evaluation on whether france had done enough to escape eu sanctions . roma targets under the new legislation , france has repatriated more than 8,000 roma to romania and bulgaria since the beginning of the year . it justified this by referring to an eu directive from 2004 which stated that eu citizens had the right to remain in a member state longer than three months only if they could show they were working or if they had enough money to provide for themselves and their family . france also pointed out that many roma in the country were living in illegally established camps and were without the required health insurance . however , the policy came under fire from brussels when it appeared that police had been ordered to target roma camps as they went about tackling irregular migration . unfairly expelled eu justice commissioner viviane reding said in september that the policy reminded her of nazi-era deportations of jews and gypsies , a statement that ignited a fierce debate with french officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding heavily attacked the french bill the united nations and the roman catholic church also spoke out against the law , saying it unfairly singled out roma migrants for expulsion . the eu commission 's 27 members are set to debate the issue later this month and are required to reach a unanimous decision on how to proceed . a negative assessment of french efforts to revise its policy would trigger an eu infringement procedure , which could eventually see france having to defend itself before the european court of justice and risk incurring a hefty fine . author : darren mara , sarah harman -lrb- reuters , afp -rrb- editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fears that paris ' main airports would run out of fuel , however , eased as a pipeline reopened . at least 825,000 people across france took part in protest marches against the government 's proposed pension reform on saturday , according to the interior ministry , the lowest official total since protests began in september . unions , however , estimated the turnout at " around 3 million , " and labor leaders insisted the campaign would continue . " the movement is taking root and growing in terms of the number of companies hit by various forms of strike as in the number of employees taking part in the action , " the powerful cgt union said in a statement released saturday . labor minister eric woerth , however , insisted there had been a " significant drop-off " from the 1.2 million people who marched against the reforms on tuesday . " there were , nevertheless , still a lot of protesters .
that underlines the government 's duty to explain this reform better , " he said .
the proposed reforms would raise the minimum retirement age in france from 60 to 62 and the age for a full pension from 65 to 67 . fuel shortage eased bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jet fuel is once again flowing to charles de gaulle airport meanwhile , concerns about the fuel supply at france 's airports from work stoppages at 10 of the country 's 12 oil refineries have been eased . the two main airports in paris , orly and roissy-charles de gaulle , had seen service of their main fuel line intermittently interrupted .

she insisted that they had " several weeks of fuel stocks " and called on people not to panic about potential shortages . " i 'm sure that with intelligent social dialogue we will be able to free things up rather than block them , " she said . oil companies have been given permission by the government to tap into their own reserves , but officials have so far not allowed access to a strategic reserve , which is controlled by a government committee . meanwhile , the strikes have also affected france 's national rail system , sncf .
about half of the network 's scheduled trains were cancelled on saturday . truck drivers are expected to join the strike action on sunday evening , putting their ability to affect traffic behind the protest effort . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friday 's protests led to over 200 arrests more strikes planned the latest strikes against the proposed pension reform started tuesday , when around a million people marched in protests around the country . unions and the socialist opposition have vowed to defend the right to retire at 60 .
they accuse president nicolas sarkozy of making workers carry the burden for the failure of the financial sector , and have proposed increasing taxes on the rich . high school students have become increasingly involved , leading to some conflicts with police .
on friday , protests involving students escalated and police used tear gas to disperse the crowds .
over 200 arrests were made and several police officers were injured . raising the minimum retirement age has already been approved by france 's national assembly , and the motion is scheduled for a vote in the senate on wednesday . bernard thibault , head of cgt , one of france 's largest unions , said if the law is passed by the second house of parliament the protests may not end . " you know from experience that even a law that has been passed does n't end dissent , " he told europe 1 radio , referring to a law on youth employment that was passed but never applied . french labor unions hope to pressure the government into changing its plans for pension reform and have called for another nationwide strike on tuesday ahead of the senate vote .

fears that paris ' main airports would run out of fuel , however , eased as a pipeline reopened . at least 825,000 people across france took part in protest marches against the government 's proposed pension reform on saturday , according to the interior ministry , the lowest official total since protests began in september . unions , however , estimated the turnout at " around 3 million , " and labor leaders insisted the campaign would continue . " the movement is taking root and growing in terms of the number of companies hit by various forms of strike as in the number of employees taking part in the action , " the powerful cgt union said in a statement released saturday . labor minister eric woerth , however , insisted there had been a " significant drop-off " from the 1.2 million people who marched against the reforms on tuesday . " there were , nevertheless , still a lot of protesters .
that underlines the government 's duty to explain this reform better , " he said .
the proposed reforms would raise the minimum retirement age in france from 60 to 62 and the age for a full pension from 65 to 67 . fuel shortage eased bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jet fuel is once again flowing to charles de gaulle airport meanwhile , concerns about the fuel supply at france 's airports from work stoppages at 10 of the country 's 12 oil refineries have been eased . the two main airports in paris , orly and roissy-charles de gaulle , had seen service of their main fuel line intermittently interrupted .
service been restored for the time being , but the continuing strikes could mean additional interruptions . " there are no longer any problems at all , " dominique bussereau , france 's deputy minister for transportation , told europe 1 radio on sunday .
only smaller airport were still be affected the strikes . service stations were also running low on fuel , though finance minister christine lagarde told rtl television that only 230 stations out of 3,000 had run dry .
she insisted that they had " several weeks of fuel stocks " and called on people not to panic about potential shortages . " i 'm sure that with intelligent social dialogue we will be able to free things up rather than block them , " she said . oil companies have been given permission by the government to tap into their own reserves , but officials have so far not allowed access to a strategic reserve , which is controlled by a government committee . meanwhile , the strikes have also affected france 's national rail system , sncf .
about half of the network 's scheduled trains were cancelled on saturday . truck drivers are expected to join the strike action on sunday evening , putting their ability to affect traffic behind the protest effort . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friday 's protests led to over 200 arrests more strikes planned the latest strikes against the proposed pension reform started tuesday , when around a million people marched in protests around the country . unions and the socialist opposition have vowed to defend the right to retire at 60 .
they accuse president nicolas sarkozy of making workers carry the burden for the failure of the financial sector , and have proposed increasing taxes on the rich . high school students have become increasingly involved , leading to some conflicts with police .
on friday , protests involving students escalated and police used tear gas to disperse the crowds .
over 200 arrests were made and several police officers were injured . raising the minimum retirement age has already been approved by france 's national assembly , and the motion is scheduled for a vote in the senate on wednesday . bernard thibault , head of cgt , one of france 's largest unions , said if the law is passed by the second house of parliament the protests may not end . " you know from experience that even a law that has been passed does n't end dissent , " he told europe 1 radio , referring to a law on youth employment that was passed but never applied . french labor unions hope to pressure the government into changing its plans for pension reform and have called for another nationwide strike on tuesday ahead of the senate vote .

but a leading think tank has warned against giving raises too soon . germany 's foreign minister and deputy chancellor , guido westerwelle , has added his support to comments made by economics minster rainer bruederle about increased wages for german workers . " when the economy grows and this growth is substantial and sustainable , then the benefits of this upswing should be felt by the people who worked so hard for it , " westerwelle told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper in an interview .
westerwelle heads the free-market liberal fdp , which shares power with chancellor merkel 's christian coalition . earlier this week , bruederle , also an fdp member , said in light of germany 's currently growing economy , those economic gains should trickle down to employees in the form of higher wages .

" that is something the chancellor sees the same way , letter for letter , " said merkel 's spokesman , steffen seibert . not so fast earlier this week , analysts predicted growth of 3.5 percent this year and 2 percent in 2011 .

" we ca n't forget that the german economy did not resort to mass lay-offs when it was n't going so well last year , " zimmermann said . raising wages in some branches could be a good idea , zimmermann said , as that would make those branches more attractive option to potential workers from outside of germany . author : matt zuvela -lrb- reuters / dapd / dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the young country now faces snap elections in as soon as 45 days . the junior partner in kosovo 's ruling coalition said saturday it was quitting the government of prime minister hashim thaci , a day after an early election was called for february .
" starting from monday , october 18 , the democratic league of kosovo -lrb- ldk -rrb- withdraws from the ruling coalition , in other words from the kosovo government , " the party said in a statement , without providing further details .
kosovo now has eight days to pull together a caretaker government or hold elections within 45 days after that .
the vote will mark the first general elections since kosovo proclaimed its independence from serbia in february 2008 .
the ldk , the party of former kosovo president fatmir sejdiu , held the post of deputy prime minister and five ministerial posts , including foreign minister , in the 12-member cabinet .
with the departure of the party , the government no longer has a parliamentary majority .
talks with serbia delayed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state hillary clinton -lrb- here with thaci -rrb- supports the talks with serbia the announcement came a day after kosovo 's interim president jakup krasniqi called an early election for february 13 , following the surprise resignation of sejdiu in late september after the constitutional court ruled he could not lead the ldk while in office .
thaci 's pdk party said the ldk 's decision could send the country into a political crisis .
" after this decision we have new circumstances and an institutional crisis , " deputy pdk leader enver hoxhaj said , reading a party statement .
" now , emergency constitutional and political solutions are needed for our country . "
the breakdown of the coalition will delay european union-sponsored talks with serbia , which refuses to recognize the independence of its former southern province .
the news also puts the privatization of several important state-owned companies on hold , including that of the state-owned telecoms firm , a move which the ldk opposes .
kosovo is one of the poorest countries in europe , with an unemployment rate of more than 45 percent .
the government was counting on the privatization to bring in some foreign investment .

but helmand is likely to remain a place where many die and a few get rich . " we know that gifts are part of afghan culture but we can not accept them , nor issue a contract for simple friendship . "
us marines captain lambert is crystal clear about this .
in front of him , 200 pashtun businessmen applaud after listening to the regiment 's interpreter 's translation into dari .
" we want the reconstruction money to stay here so we count on you , businessmen and businesswomen from helmand , " adds the us soldier , despite the total absence of women in the room .
captain lambert 's martial silhouette blackens against the power point presentation .
" professionalism , " " mutual respect , " " honesty " ... can be read on the slide behind him - " essential " work parameters for the rcc -lrb- regional contracting center -rrb- , which is mainly lead by the usaid and the us army .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us business presentations appeal to afghan honesty and professionalism the presentation of helmand 's 4th business conference finishes with applause and an invite for lunch outside by the marines .
generous portions of rice with raisins and meat are distributed from a truck to all those who have gathered at the helmand governor 's assembly hall .
the locals eat on the floor around the silver round trays while the us soldiers line the benches .
but after the apple and banana for dessert both groups mix for the tête-à-tête with the marines who have set up in different stalls .
" buy local , build afghanistan , " extols the slogan above them . $ 22.5 million -lrb- 16 million euros -rrb- are waiting to be distributed among all those " committed to rebuild their country . "
pashtuns in shalwar kameez -lrb- the loose local outfit -rrb- and turbans swirl around the military , struggling to hand them their business cards .
serving in a shirt and camouflage pants a bit too tight for the conservative local standards , the only us marine female soldier is doubtless collecting the majority of them .
" the most important thing is that the reconstruction is made by and for helmandies , " she says .
" but they have to understand that it has to be done the american way : everything has to be transparent ! "
quality indicators bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans mix business with pleasure in the hope of establishing contacts at just 30 , wahid already has his own construction company .
today , he is attending his first business conference ever .
" i have the best team to build a good road to gereshk , " says the young entrepreneur .
he refers to that section funded only two years ago with 52 million euros -lrb- $ 73 million -rrb- by both the uk and denmark , but whose work has not yet begun .
" we 're already working on it , " is the helmand governor 's recurring answer .
having previously attended three of the four business conferences held in helmand , ismatullah is one of the seasoned veterans .
he asked for permission to get to the stand during captain lambert 's presentation but was prevented from doing so .
" two years ago i got a subcontract from an american company .
they told me to buy equipment worth 1.8 million afghanis -lrb- 30,000 euros -rrb- but i never heard from them again , " says this pashtun from nad-e-ali , one of the many " no-go areas " in helmand .
saif has flown in from kabul today just for the conference .
this local from tora bora , on the pakistani border , works for roshan , the afghan main phone company , but he also has his own construction company .
nonetheless , he claims not to have won a single contract since he started up two years ago .
" all of these visiting cards the marines are collecting go directly to the trash , " says the disappointed pashtun in the perfect english he learned as a student in peshawar .
locals losing out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : locals want to help rebuild their country , but need the funds to do so " contracts are always taken by the people inside the military compound , starting with the translator .
he also has his own construction company , you just need $ 1,000 to establish one .
but there are also the close friends and the relatives of the soldiers themselves , many of whom have created their own business companies in afghanistan .
of every $ 100 that come into afghanistan , $ 80 go back to the states , " says saif flatly .
" i aspire to a subcontract , but i 'd be happy with just a sub-sub , or even sub-sub-subcontract , " abdul hamid , a native of lashkar gah , helmand province 's capital city , says somewhat wryly .
" the little they get to build simply collapses due to the substandard materials .
these marines are able to build a school with sandbags , " adds this pashtun just before heading toward the regiment 's translator .
" their bases are the only thing they build solid , " says ali reza , who just came " for the free food . "
" did you get to see the base they have in kandahar when you flew here from kabul ?
well , the one they have in logar province is even bigger ! , " adds this 40-year-old truck driver on his free day .
" you know how much they are paying for a one-room russian flat in kabul ? $ 100,000 .
russian is still the best quality in afghanistan , " says sharifullah , 55 , adding that " more and more people look back with nostalgia at najibullah 's times . "
-lrb- mohammad najibullah was afghanistan 's last president of the soviet-backed democratic republic of afghanistan - ed . -rrb-
" may allah bless his soul , " says the pashtun of the deceased former communist president of afghanistan .
behind him , a group of marines fold sawhorse tables and remove the banners hanging above them .

but helmand is likely to remain a place where many die and a few get rich . " we know that gifts are part of afghan culture but we can not accept them , nor issue a contract for simple friendship . "
us marines captain lambert is crystal clear about this .
in front of him , 200 pashtun businessmen applaud after listening to the regiment 's interpreter 's translation into dari .
" we want the reconstruction money to stay here so we count on you , businessmen and businesswomen from helmand , " adds the us soldier , despite the total absence of women in the room .
captain lambert 's martial silhouette blackens against the power point presentation .
" professionalism , " " mutual respect , " " honesty " ... can be read on the slide behind him - " essential " work parameters for the rcc -lrb- regional contracting center -rrb- , which is mainly lead by the usaid and the us army .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us business presentations appeal to afghan honesty and professionalism the presentation of helmand 's 4th business conference finishes with applause and an invite for lunch outside by the marines .
generous portions of rice with raisins and meat are distributed from a truck to all those who have gathered at the helmand governor 's assembly hall .
the locals eat on the floor around the silver round trays while the us soldiers line the benches .
but after the apple and banana for dessert both groups mix for the tête-à-tête with the marines who have set up in different stalls .
" buy local , build afghanistan , " extols the slogan above them . $ 22.5 million -lrb- 16 million euros -rrb- are waiting to be distributed among all those " committed to rebuild their country . "
pashtuns in shalwar kameez -lrb- the loose local outfit -rrb- and turbans swirl around the military , struggling to hand them their business cards .
serving in a shirt and camouflage pants a bit too tight for the conservative local standards , the only us marine female soldier is doubtless collecting the majority of them .
" the most important thing is that the reconstruction is made by and for helmandies , " she says .
" but they have to understand that it has to be done the american way : everything has to be transparent ! "
quality indicators bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans mix business with pleasure in the hope of establishing contacts at just 30 , wahid already has his own construction company .
today , he is attending his first business conference ever .
" i have the best team to build a good road to gereshk , " says the young entrepreneur .
he refers to that section funded only two years ago with 52 million euros -lrb- $ 73 million -rrb- by both the uk and denmark , but whose work has not yet begun .
" we 're already working on it , " is the helmand governor 's recurring answer .
having previously attended three of the four business conferences held in helmand , ismatullah is one of the seasoned veterans .
he asked for permission to get to the stand during captain lambert 's presentation but was prevented from doing so .
" two years ago i got a subcontract from an american company .
they told me to buy equipment worth 1.8 million afghanis -lrb- 30,000 euros -rrb- but i never heard from them again , " says this pashtun from nad-e-ali , one of the many " no-go areas " in helmand .
saif has flown in from kabul today just for the conference .
this local from tora bora , on the pakistani border , works for roshan , the afghan main phone company , but he also has his own construction company .
nonetheless , he claims not to have won a single contract since he started up two years ago .
" all of these visiting cards the marines are collecting go directly to the trash , " says the disappointed pashtun in the perfect english he learned as a student in peshawar .
locals losing out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : locals want to help rebuild their country , but need the funds to do so " contracts are always taken by the people inside the military compound , starting with the translator .
he also has his own construction company , you just need $ 1,000 to establish one .
but there are also the close friends and the relatives of the soldiers themselves , many of whom have created their own business companies in afghanistan .
of every $ 100 that come into afghanistan , $ 80 go back to the states , " says saif flatly .
" i aspire to a subcontract , but i 'd be happy with just a sub-sub , or even sub-sub-subcontract , " abdul hamid , a native of lashkar gah , helmand province 's capital city , says somewhat wryly .
" the little they get to build simply collapses due to the substandard materials .
these marines are able to build a school with sandbags , " adds this pashtun just before heading toward the regiment 's translator .
" their bases are the only thing they build solid , " says ali reza , who just came " for the free food . "
" did you get to see the base they have in kandahar when you flew here from kabul ?
well , the one they have in logar province is even bigger ! , " adds this 40-year-old truck driver on his free day .
" you know how much they are paying for a one-room russian flat in kabul ? $ 100,000 .
russian is still the best quality in afghanistan , " says sharifullah , 55 , adding that " more and more people look back with nostalgia at najibullah 's times . "
-lrb- mohammad najibullah was afghanistan 's last president of the soviet-backed democratic republic of afghanistan - ed . -rrb-
" may allah bless his soul , " says the pashtun of the deceased former communist president of afghanistan .
behind him , a group of marines fold sawhorse tables and remove the banners hanging above them .

this local from tora bora , on the pakistani border , works for roshan , the afghan main phone company , but he also has his own construction company .
nonetheless , he claims not to have won a single contract since he started up two years ago .
" all of these visiting cards the marines are collecting go directly to the trash , " says the disappointed pashtun in the perfect english he learned as a student in peshawar .
locals losing out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : locals want to help rebuild their country , but need the funds to do so " contracts are always taken by the people inside the military compound , starting with the translator .
he also has his own construction company , you just need $ 1,000 to establish one .
but there are also the close friends and the relatives of the soldiers themselves , many of whom have created their own business companies in afghanistan .
of every $ 100 that come into afghanistan , $ 80 go back to the states , " says saif flatly .
" i aspire to a subcontract , but i 'd be happy with just a sub-sub , or even sub-sub-subcontract , " abdul hamid , a native of lashkar gah , helmand province 's capital city , says somewhat wryly .
" the little they get to build simply collapses due to the substandard materials .
these marines are able to build a school with sandbags , " adds this pashtun just before heading toward the regiment 's translator .
" their bases are the only thing they build solid , " says ali reza , who just came " for the free food . "
" did you get to see the base they have in kandahar when you flew here from kabul ?
well , the one they have in logar province is even bigger ! , " adds this 40-year-old truck driver on his free day .
" you know how much they are paying for a one-room russian flat in kabul ? $ 100,000 .
russian is still the best quality in afghanistan , " says sharifullah , 55 , adding that " more and more people look back with nostalgia at najibullah 's times . "
-lrb- mohammad najibullah was afghanistan 's last president of the soviet-backed democratic republic of afghanistan - ed . -rrb-
" may allah bless his soul , " says the pashtun of the deceased former communist president of afghanistan .
behind him , a group of marines fold sawhorse tables and remove the banners hanging above them .

the young country now faces snap elections in as soon as 45 days . the junior partner in kosovo 's ruling coalition said saturday it was quitting the government of prime minister hashim thaci , a day after an early election was called for february .
" starting from monday , october 18 , the democratic league of kosovo -lrb- ldk -rrb- withdraws from the ruling coalition , in other words from the kosovo government , " the party said in a statement , without providing further details .
kosovo now has eight days to pull together a caretaker government or hold elections within 45 days after that .
the vote will mark the first general elections since kosovo proclaimed its independence from serbia in february 2008 .
the ldk , the party of former kosovo president fatmir sejdiu , held the post of deputy prime minister and five ministerial posts , including foreign minister , in the 12-member cabinet .
with the departure of the party , the government no longer has a parliamentary majority .
talks with serbia delayed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state hillary clinton -lrb- here with thaci -rrb- supports the talks with serbia the announcement came a day after kosovo 's interim president jakup krasniqi called an early election for february 13 , following the surprise resignation of sejdiu in late september after the constitutional court ruled he could not lead the ldk while in office .
thaci 's pdk party said the ldk 's decision could send the country into a political crisis .
" after this decision we have new circumstances and an institutional crisis , " deputy pdk leader enver hoxhaj said , reading a party statement .
" now , emergency constitutional and political solutions are needed for our country . "
the breakdown of the coalition will delay european union-sponsored talks with serbia , which refuses to recognize the independence of its former southern province .
the news also puts the privatization of several important state-owned companies on hold , including that of the state-owned telecoms firm , a move which the ldk opposes .
kosovo is one of the poorest countries in europe , with an unemployment rate of more than 45 percent .
the government was counting on the privatization to bring in some foreign investment .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy was staunch in his calls for the deportations the french representative to the commission , michel barnier , said he was confident the eu executive would make " an impartial and objective " evaluation on whether france had done enough to escape eu sanctions . roma targets under the new legislation , france has repatriated more than 8,000 roma to romania and bulgaria since the beginning of the year . it justified this by referring to an eu directive from 2004 which stated that eu citizens had the right to remain in a member state longer than three months only if they could show they were working or if they had enough money to provide for themselves and their family . france also pointed out that many roma in the country were living in illegally established camps and were without the required health insurance . however , the policy came under fire from brussels when it appeared that police had been ordered to target roma camps as they went about tackling irregular migration . unfairly expelled eu justice commissioner viviane reding said in september that the policy reminded her of nazi-era deportations of jews and gypsies , a statement that ignited a fierce debate with french officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding heavily attacked the french bill the united nations and the roman catholic church also spoke out against the law , saying it unfairly singled out roma migrants for expulsion . the eu commission 's 27 members are set to debate the issue later this month and are required to reach a unanimous decision on how to proceed . a negative assessment of french efforts to revise its policy would trigger an eu infringement procedure , which could eventually see france having to defend itself before the european court of justice and risk incurring a hefty fine . author : darren mara , sarah harman -lrb- reuters , afp -rrb- editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a leading think tank has warned against giving raises too soon . germany 's foreign minister and deputy chancellor , guido westerwelle , has added his support to comments made by economics minster rainer bruederle about increased wages for german workers . " when the economy grows and this growth is substantial and sustainable , then the benefits of this upswing should be felt by the people who worked so hard for it , " westerwelle told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper in an interview .
westerwelle heads the free-market liberal fdp , which shares power with chancellor merkel 's christian coalition . earlier this week , bruederle , also an fdp member , said in light of germany 's currently growing economy , those economic gains should trickle down to employees in the form of higher wages .
merkel , who is also the head of the christian democratic union , supported bruederle 's idea . " that is something the chancellor sees the same way , letter for letter , " said merkel 's spokesman , steffen seibert . not so fast earlier this week , analysts predicted growth of 3.5 percent this year and 2 percent in 2011 .
germany 's five leading economic think tanks also predicted that the number of unemployed would fall below 3 million next year , the lowest level since 1992 . despite the current rosy outlook for the german economy , not everyone is convinced that a growing economy should inevitably lead to higher wages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimmermann says higher pay is good - for some branches the president of the german institute for economic research , klaus zimmermann , warned against reacting too quickly . " i ca n't support the idea of a general wage increase , i think it is too dangerous , " zimmermann said in an interview with the handelsblatt newspaper . zimmermann was n't opposed to the idea of raising wages , but said he was against across-the-board increases for all sectors and pointed out that not every industry is benefitting the same from the growing economy . " we ca n't forget that the german economy did not resort to mass lay-offs when it was n't going so well last year , " zimmermann said . raising wages in some branches could be a good idea , zimmermann said , as that would make those branches more attractive option to potential workers from outside of germany . author : matt zuvela -lrb- reuters / dapd / dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

veteran politician and chief mediator heiner geissler said after sixh hours of talks both sides " came to the conclusion that we want to resolve this dispute . "

opponents have said the money required for the project , an estimated 7 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.5 billion -rrb- , would be better spent on updating the existing rail network .
despite the ongoing negotiations , hannes rockenbauch , another opposition spokesperson , said demonstrations against the project would go ahead as planned on the weekend .
parties to the negotiations are to reconvene next friday to continue their talks .

" we received the french documents , we will analyze them during the weekend , " european commission spokesman matthew newman said . newman would not give any details of the french reply , but french immigration minister eric besson had earlier signaled that president nicolas sarkozy 's government was prepared to adapt the immigration legislation " to comply with european law " and to have it drawn up to be presented to parliament by december . earlier friday , eu commission spokesman olivier bailly told reporters that if paris missed the deadline , " an infringement procedure would be opened by the end of october . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy was staunch in his calls for the deportations the french representative to the commission , michel barnier , said he was confident the eu executive would make " an impartial and objective " evaluation on whether france had done enough to escape eu sanctions . roma targets under the new legislation , france has repatriated more than 8,000 roma to romania and bulgaria since the beginning of the year . it justified this by referring to an eu directive from 2004 which stated that eu citizens had the right to remain in a member state longer than three months only if they could show they were working or if they had enough money to provide for themselves and their family . france also pointed out that many roma in the country were living in illegally established camps and were without the required health insurance . however , the policy came under fire from brussels when it appeared that police had been ordered to target roma camps as they went about tackling irregular migration . unfairly expelled eu justice commissioner viviane reding said in september that the policy reminded her of nazi-era deportations of jews and gypsies , a statement that ignited a fierce debate with french officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding heavily attacked the french bill the united nations and the roman catholic church also spoke out against the law , saying it unfairly singled out roma migrants for expulsion . the eu commission 's 27 members are set to debate the issue later this month and are required to reach a unanimous decision on how to proceed . a negative assessment of french efforts to revise its policy would trigger an eu infringement procedure , which could eventually see france having to defend itself before the european court of justice and risk incurring a hefty fine . author : darren mara , sarah harman -lrb- reuters , afp -rrb- editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fears that paris ' main airports would run out of fuel , however , eased as a pipeline reopened . at least 825,000 people across france took part in protest marches against the government 's proposed pension reform on saturday , according to the interior ministry , the lowest official total since protests began in september . unions , however , estimated the turnout at " around 3 million , " and labor leaders insisted the campaign would continue . " the movement is taking root and growing in terms of the number of companies hit by various forms of strike as in the number of employees taking part in the action , " the powerful cgt union said in a statement released saturday . labor minister eric woerth , however , insisted there had been a " significant drop-off " from the 1.2 million people who marched against the reforms on tuesday . " there were , nevertheless , still a lot of protesters .
that underlines the government 's duty to explain this reform better , " he said .
the proposed reforms would raise the minimum retirement age in france from 60 to 62 and the age for a full pension from 65 to 67 . fuel shortage eased bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jet fuel is once again flowing to charles de gaulle airport meanwhile , concerns about the fuel supply at france 's airports from work stoppages at 10 of the country 's 12 oil refineries have been eased . the two main airports in paris , orly and roissy-charles de gaulle , had seen service of their main fuel line intermittently interrupted .
service been restored for the time being , but the continuing strikes could mean additional interruptions . " there are no longer any problems at all , " dominique bussereau , france 's deputy minister for transportation , told europe 1 radio on sunday .
only smaller airport were still be affected the strikes . service stations were also running low on fuel , though finance minister christine lagarde told rtl television that only 230 stations out of 3,000 had run dry .
she insisted that they had " several weeks of fuel stocks " and called on people not to panic about potential shortages . " i 'm sure that with intelligent social dialogue we will be able to free things up rather than block them , " she said . oil companies have been given permission by the government to tap into their own reserves , but officials have so far not allowed access to a strategic reserve , which is controlled by a government committee . meanwhile , the strikes have also affected france 's national rail system , sncf .
about half of the network 's scheduled trains were cancelled on saturday . truck drivers are expected to join the strike action on sunday evening , putting their ability to affect traffic behind the protest effort . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friday 's protests led to over 200 arrests more strikes planned the latest strikes against the proposed pension reform started tuesday , when around a million people marched in protests around the country . unions and the socialist opposition have vowed to defend the right to retire at 60 .
they accuse president nicolas sarkozy of making workers carry the burden for the failure of the financial sector , and have proposed increasing taxes on the rich . high school students have become increasingly involved , leading to some conflicts with police .
on friday , protests involving students escalated and police used tear gas to disperse the crowds .
over 200 arrests were made and several police officers were injured . raising the minimum retirement age has already been approved by france 's national assembly , and the motion is scheduled for a vote in the senate on wednesday . bernard thibault , head of cgt , one of france 's largest unions , said if the law is passed by the second house of parliament the protests may not end . " you know from experience that even a law that has been passed does n't end dissent , " he told europe 1 radio , referring to a law on youth employment that was passed but never applied . french labor unions hope to pressure the government into changing its plans for pension reform and have called for another nationwide strike on tuesday ahead of the senate vote .
so far , the government has shown no signs of yielding on pension reform . author : matt zuvela , martin kuebler -lrb- reuters , dpa , afp -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we received the french documents , we will analyze them during the weekend , " european commission spokesman matthew newman said . newman would not give any details of the french reply , but french immigration minister eric besson had earlier signaled that president nicolas sarkozy 's government was prepared to adapt the immigration legislation " to comply with european law " and to have it drawn up to be presented to parliament by december . earlier friday , eu commission spokesman olivier bailly told reporters that if paris missed the deadline , " an infringement procedure would be opened by the end of october . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy was staunch in his calls for the deportations the french representative to the commission , michel barnier , said he was confident the eu executive would make " an impartial and objective " evaluation on whether france had done enough to escape eu sanctions . roma targets under the new legislation , france has repatriated more than 8,000 roma to romania and bulgaria since the beginning of the year . it justified this by referring to an eu directive from 2004 which stated that eu citizens had the right to remain in a member state longer than three months only if they could show they were working or if they had enough money to provide for themselves and their family . france also pointed out that many roma in the country were living in illegally established camps and were without the required health insurance . however , the policy came under fire from brussels when it appeared that police had been ordered to target roma camps as they went about tackling irregular migration . unfairly expelled eu justice commissioner viviane reding said in september that the policy reminded her of nazi-era deportations of jews and gypsies , a statement that ignited a fierce debate with french officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding heavily attacked the french bill the united nations and the roman catholic church also spoke out against the law , saying it unfairly singled out roma migrants for expulsion . the eu commission 's 27 members are set to debate the issue later this month and are required to reach a unanimous decision on how to proceed . a negative assessment of french efforts to revise its policy would trigger an eu infringement procedure , which could eventually see france having to defend itself before the european court of justice and risk incurring a hefty fine . author : darren mara , sarah harman -lrb- reuters , afp -rrb- editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but helmand is likely to remain a place where many die and a few get rich . " we know that gifts are part of afghan culture but we can not accept them , nor issue a contract for simple friendship . "
us marines captain lambert is crystal clear about this .
in front of him , 200 pashtun businessmen applaud after listening to the regiment 's interpreter 's translation into dari .
" we want the reconstruction money to stay here so we count on you , businessmen and businesswomen from helmand , " adds the us soldier , despite the total absence of women in the room .
captain lambert 's martial silhouette blackens against the power point presentation .
" professionalism , " " mutual respect , " " honesty " ... can be read on the slide behind him - " essential " work parameters for the rcc -lrb- regional contracting center -rrb- , which is mainly lead by the usaid and the us army .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us business presentations appeal to afghan honesty and professionalism the presentation of helmand 's 4th business conference finishes with applause and an invite for lunch outside by the marines .
generous portions of rice with raisins and meat are distributed from a truck to all those who have gathered at the helmand governor 's assembly hall .
the locals eat on the floor around the silver round trays while the us soldiers line the benches .
but after the apple and banana for dessert both groups mix for the tête-à-tête with the marines who have set up in different stalls .
" buy local , build afghanistan , " extols the slogan above them . $ 22.5 million -lrb- 16 million euros -rrb- are waiting to be distributed among all those " committed to rebuild their country . "
pashtuns in shalwar kameez -lrb- the loose local outfit -rrb- and turbans swirl around the military , struggling to hand them their business cards .
serving in a shirt and camouflage pants a bit too tight for the conservative local standards , the only us marine female soldier is doubtless collecting the majority of them .
" the most important thing is that the reconstruction is made by and for helmandies , " she says .
" but they have to understand that it has to be done the american way : everything has to be transparent ! "
quality indicators bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans mix business with pleasure in the hope of establishing contacts at just 30 , wahid already has his own construction company .
today , he is attending his first business conference ever .
" i have the best team to build a good road to gereshk , " says the young entrepreneur .
he refers to that section funded only two years ago with 52 million euros -lrb- $ 73 million -rrb- by both the uk and denmark , but whose work has not yet begun .
" we 're already working on it , " is the helmand governor 's recurring answer .
having previously attended three of the four business conferences held in helmand , ismatullah is one of the seasoned veterans .
he asked for permission to get to the stand during captain lambert 's presentation but was prevented from doing so .
" two years ago i got a subcontract from an american company .
they told me to buy equipment worth 1.8 million afghanis -lrb- 30,000 euros -rrb- but i never heard from them again , " says this pashtun from nad-e-ali , one of the many " no-go areas " in helmand .
saif has flown in from kabul today just for the conference .
this local from tora bora , on the pakistani border , works for roshan , the afghan main phone company , but he also has his own construction company .
nonetheless , he claims not to have won a single contract since he started up two years ago .
" all of these visiting cards the marines are collecting go directly to the trash , " says the disappointed pashtun in the perfect english he learned as a student in peshawar .
locals losing out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : locals want to help rebuild their country , but need the funds to do so " contracts are always taken by the people inside the military compound , starting with the translator .
he also has his own construction company , you just need $ 1,000 to establish one .
but there are also the close friends and the relatives of the soldiers themselves , many of whom have created their own business companies in afghanistan .
of every $ 100 that come into afghanistan , $ 80 go back to the states , " says saif flatly .
" i aspire to a subcontract , but i 'd be happy with just a sub-sub , or even sub-sub-subcontract , " abdul hamid , a native of lashkar gah , helmand province 's capital city , says somewhat wryly .
" the little they get to build simply collapses due to the substandard materials .
these marines are able to build a school with sandbags , " adds this pashtun just before heading toward the regiment 's translator .
" their bases are the only thing they build solid , " says ali reza , who just came " for the free food . "
" did you get to see the base they have in kandahar when you flew here from kabul ?
well , the one they have in logar province is even bigger ! , " adds this 40-year-old truck driver on his free day .
" you know how much they are paying for a one-room russian flat in kabul ? $ 100,000 .
russian is still the best quality in afghanistan , " says sharifullah , 55 , adding that " more and more people look back with nostalgia at najibullah 's times . "
-lrb- mohammad najibullah was afghanistan 's last president of the soviet-backed democratic republic of afghanistan - ed . -rrb-
" may allah bless his soul , " says the pashtun of the deceased former communist president of afghanistan .
behind him , a group of marines fold sawhorse tables and remove the banners hanging above them .

the first topic broached at the talks dealt with the service capabilities and intended use of the new railway hub , as well as with the laying of new rail tracks for the project .
veteran politician and chief mediator heiner geissler said after sixh hours of talks both sides " came to the conclusion that we want to resolve this dispute . "
