" from my own and a police point of view , i urge and support a ban , " police union head bernhard witthaut told deutsche welle .
" i think it 's terrible how they mock foreigners living in germany , i think their concept of a state is terrible . "
witthaut was not alone in his comments .
the president of the central council of jews in germany , dieter graumann , said in an interview over the weekend that the npd , which currently has an estimated 7,000 members , had clearly set itself the goal of destroying democracy in germany .
the country must resist such attempts , he said , if necessary by issuing a ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernhard witthaut said a new court case must be well prepared the head of the turkish community in germany , kenan kolat , urged a more consistent prosecution of xenophobic attacks in germany .
banning the npd , he told the news agency dapd , could also " have a positive effect in the fight against right-wing extremism and racism . " the german government attempted to ban the npd in a case heard by the country 's highest court , the constitutional court , in 2001 .
but the case was thrown out two years later after it was disclosed that several people in the npd 's inner circle were german secret service undercover agents or informants .
signal in the fight against far-right extremism the police union 's witthaut said that some people in law enforcement believed it would be easier to deal with the far-right party if you knew how it operated and where it was active , whereas if the party were to go underground , it would be much more difficult to keep an eye on its activities . but he said he was convinced that outlawing a party listed as racist , anti-semitic and revisionist by germany 's domestic intelligence agency would be " an important signal in the fight against right-wing extremism . "
" many might view the risk of a renewed failure before germany 's highest court as such a grave aspect that they might dismiss steps in that direction , " bavaria 's interior minister joachim herrmann said on monday .
but he added that banning the npd was desirable , and he would continue to lobby for a ban of the party .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de piracy -pipe- 27.12.2010 swiss file-sharing website hires us lobbying firm großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapidshare is one of three european sites lobbying dc after being named as one of the most infringing websites , rapidshare is headed to the us capital to convince american lawmakers that it is not liable for illegal file-sharing . rapidshare , an online file-sharing site based in cham , switzerland , is under increased international scrutiny for enabling copyright infringement , as earlier this year members of the us congress named rapidshare one of the top six most infringing websites in the world .
" as you can imagine , we 're not very happy about that , " said daniel raimer , a german attorney and spokesman for rapidshare , in an interview with deutsche welle .
following the us government 's crackdown on infringing websites earlier this fall , seizing the domain names of more than 80 websites , rapidshare has found a way to reinvent itself in the american capital .
just last month , the company hired the washington , dc-based lobbying firm dutko to protect its interests abroad .
this likely makes it the first such european file-sharing company to lobby american lawmakers .
the company says its has more appointments coming up on capitol hill , and remains confident that it will get off the list by early 2011 , long before next year 's list is published .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss company only says about five percent of what is uploaded to its site is illegal only a small percentage of its files are illegal rapidshare estimates that copyrighted music and movies make up roughly five percent , or 10,000 of the 400,000 files uploaded every day .
although the site accepts and hosts every type of file , because the company takes many steps to filter out infringing files before they are posted , raimer argued that rapidshare is not the type of site the us should be going after .
" we believe that it 's unfair that we 're being put on the list , " he added .
" you ca n't just take a look at the number of infringing material that you can find on the server .
google has probably millions and millions of links to illegal files .
most people would probably agree that google is not a bad company . "
by international law rapidshare is not liable for what users upload and download , and recent german and american legal cases have upheld this notion .
the only thing that is required of rapidshare is to take down infringing files once the copyright holder tells it to .
while lobbying on behalf of foreign companies is nothing new in washington , it is new for foreign web companies to do so .
an online database of lobbying disclosures reveals that the only other european websites lobbying the us congress right now are two online gaming sites , pokerstars.net and partygaming.com.
us can exert limited power over foreign sites a new anti-piracy bill making its way through the us senate could clear the way for the government to seize more infringing domains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to most international law , rapidshare is not liable for what its users upload to the site and then download to their music players if the law passes , according to bob brauneis , professor of copyright law at george washington university in washington , dc , it could certainly impact rapidshare , despite the fact that it is not based in the united states . " dot-com companies operate around the world , but the company that controls the dot-com domain is in the united states , " he told deutsche welle .
" literally they have a computer in some room somewhere and if you flip a switch on that computer than domain name will disappear .
the information is still there in switzerland , but it 's not accessible at rapidshare.com because the link between rapidshare.com and the swiss computers has been cut . ”
the .com registry is maintained within the us and is subject to us law .
that means a court order could force the registry to freeze the domain name : rapidshare.com.
it does n't matter if rapidshare has its headquarters in switzerland or anywhere else .
while losing a domain name could temporarily impact the company 's business , changing to a new name is not a huge inconvenience .
rapidshare could just set up shop as rapidshare.ch , which is the most common suffix for swiss sites .
wikileaks , for example , used to have a .com suffix - now anyone can access that site at wikileaks.ch.
if seizing domains does n't stop copyright infringement , there is another step , brauneis added .
" the computers in switzerland are actually reached through a series of numbers called an internet protocol address , an ip address , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapidshare could avoid american law simply by changing to a swiss domain like rapidshare.ch " so everyone can spread around the world what the ip address is on those computers and they can continue to upload and download files , not a problem .
and if it turns out that after seizing a bunch of domain names , everyone is just turning to ip addresses - the ip addresses may be next . "
and it gets even more complicated from there .
data re-routing could drive up internet connection pricing " people are going to look for alternative ways of having those kind of sites available , " said peter eckersley , a digital rights advocate with the electronic frontier foundation , a non-profit organization based in san francisco .
however , he cautioned that if sites like this are forced to move offshore , then that may raise the actual cost of internet connections around the world .
" and the effect that will have is a significant increase in the amount of data that 's just moving over international fiber links , " he added .
" that will mean we 'll need to build more fiberlinks . and it 's going to make the cost of running the internet higher . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de piracy -pipe- 27.12.2010 swiss file-sharing website hires us lobbying firm großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapidshare is one of three european sites lobbying dc after being named as one of the most infringing websites , rapidshare is headed to the us capital to convince american lawmakers that it is not liable for illegal file-sharing . rapidshare , an online file-sharing site based in cham , switzerland , is under increased international scrutiny for enabling copyright infringement , as earlier this year members of the us congress named rapidshare one of the top six most infringing websites in the world .
" as you can imagine , we 're not very happy about that , " said daniel raimer , a german attorney and spokesman for rapidshare , in an interview with deutsche welle .
following the us government 's crackdown on infringing websites earlier this fall , seizing the domain names of more than 80 websites , rapidshare has found a way to reinvent itself in the american capital .
just last month , the company hired the washington , dc-based lobbying firm dutko to protect its interests abroad .
this likely makes it the first such european file-sharing company to lobby american lawmakers .
the company says its has more appointments coming up on capitol hill , and remains confident that it will get off the list by early 2011 , long before next year 's list is published .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss company only says about five percent of what is uploaded to its site is illegal only a small percentage of its files are illegal rapidshare estimates that copyrighted music and movies make up roughly five percent , or 10,000 of the 400,000 files uploaded every day .
although the site accepts and hosts every type of file , because the company takes many steps to filter out infringing files before they are posted , raimer argued that rapidshare is not the type of site the us should be going after .
" we believe that it 's unfair that we 're being put on the list , " he added .
" you ca n't just take a look at the number of infringing material that you can find on the server .
google has probably millions and millions of links to illegal files .
most people would probably agree that google is not a bad company . "
by international law rapidshare is not liable for what users upload and download , and recent german and american legal cases have upheld this notion .
the only thing that is required of rapidshare is to take down infringing files once the copyright holder tells it to .
while lobbying on behalf of foreign companies is nothing new in washington , it is new for foreign web companies to do so .
an online database of lobbying disclosures reveals that the only other european websites lobbying the us congress right now are two online gaming sites , pokerstars.net and partygaming.com.
us can exert limited power over foreign sites a new anti-piracy bill making its way through the us senate could clear the way for the government to seize more infringing domains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to most international law , rapidshare is not liable for what its users upload to the site and then download to their music players if the law passes , according to bob brauneis , professor of copyright law at george washington university in washington , dc , it could certainly impact rapidshare , despite the fact that it is not based in the united states . " dot-com companies operate around the world , but the company that controls the dot-com domain is in the united states , " he told deutsche welle .
" literally they have a computer in some room somewhere and if you flip a switch on that computer than domain name will disappear .
the information is still there in switzerland , but it 's not accessible at rapidshare.com because the link between rapidshare.com and the swiss computers has been cut . ”
the .com registry is maintained within the us and is subject to us law .
that means a court order could force the registry to freeze the domain name : rapidshare.com.
it does n't matter if rapidshare has its headquarters in switzerland or anywhere else .
while losing a domain name could temporarily impact the company 's business , changing to a new name is not a huge inconvenience .
rapidshare could just set up shop as rapidshare.ch , which is the most common suffix for swiss sites .
wikileaks , for example , used to have a .com suffix - now anyone can access that site at wikileaks.ch.
if seizing domains does n't stop copyright infringement , there is another step , brauneis added .
" the computers in switzerland are actually reached through a series of numbers called an internet protocol address , an ip address , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapidshare could avoid american law simply by changing to a swiss domain like rapidshare.ch " so everyone can spread around the world what the ip address is on those computers and they can continue to upload and download files , not a problem .
and if it turns out that after seizing a bunch of domain names , everyone is just turning to ip addresses - the ip addresses may be next . "
and it gets even more complicated from there .
data re-routing could drive up internet connection pricing " people are going to look for alternative ways of having those kind of sites available , " said peter eckersley , a digital rights advocate with the electronic frontier foundation , a non-profit organization based in san francisco .
however , he cautioned that if sites like this are forced to move offshore , then that may raise the actual cost of internet connections around the world .
" and the effect that will have is a significant increase in the amount of data that 's just moving over international fiber links , " he added .
" that will mean we 'll need to build more fiberlinks . and it 's going to make the cost of running the internet higher . "

the verdict in khodorkovsky 's second trial could keep him behind bars for several more years . mikhail khodorkovsky has been found guilty of embezzlement for stealing and reselling over 200 tons of oil from wells he previously owned as head of the yukos oil company .
the judge in the case , viktor danilkin , read the verdict in a moscow courtroom on monday .
khodorkovsky 's business partner and co-defendant platon lebedev was also found guilty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khodorkovsky supporters gathered outside the court monday khodorkovsky is currently serving an eight-year prison sentence for tax evasion .
sentencing in the current case is expected in the next few days .
the prosecution is seeking a six-year sentence .
the russian news agency interfax reported that journalists present in the courtroom were asked to leave by danilkin just after the guilty decision was read .
the entire verdict could take several days to read .
observers have speculated that a date change in the verdict reading , originally scheduled for december 15 , was an attempt to reduce media attention .
shortly after the verdict was read , khodorkovsky 's defense lawyers said they would appeal the decision .
khodorkovsky had previously said he would take the case to the european court of human rights if he was found guilty .
high-profile trial the second trial of russia 's former richest man has garnered international attention .
germany is one of several western nations that have criticized the trial .
in a visit with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov in moscow in early november , german foreign minister guido westerwelle expressed " very serious concern about the conditions of the trial proceedings . "
westerwelle added it was in russia 's best interest to take such concerns seriously .
lavrov replied that it was a matter for the court to decide .
political rivals if khodorkovsky remains behind bars through 2012 , it would keep the outspoken political opponent of prime minister vladimir putin from wielding his influence ahead of the election .
due to his stance against putin and the kremlin , khodorkovsky has become a symbol for the russian opposition and human right activists who decry his imprisonment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin called for a guilty verdict last week khodorkovsky 's original trial in 2003 was widely seen as a politically motivated event , with putin - who was president at the time - pulling the strings .
khodorkovsky had openly funded opposition parties ahead of the 2003 parliamentary elections , which did not sit well with the kremlin .
putin was in the spotlight again leading up to monday 's verdict , making an appeal on live television last week that " the thief must remain in jail . "
the verdict and sentencing in the current case are being seen as a test of the independence of the russian justice system .

the verdict in khodorkovsky 's second trial could keep him behind bars for several more years . mikhail khodorkovsky has been found guilty of embezzlement for stealing and reselling over 200 tons of oil from wells he previously owned as head of the yukos oil company .
the judge in the case , viktor danilkin , read the verdict in a moscow courtroom on monday .
khodorkovsky 's business partner and co-defendant platon lebedev was also found guilty .

sentencing in the current case is expected in the next few days .
the prosecution is seeking a six-year sentence .
the russian news agency interfax reported that journalists present in the courtroom were asked to leave by danilkin just after the guilty decision was read .

its repercussions could be widespread , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . the guilty verdict in the trial of the former yukos owner mikhail khodorkovsky and his business partner , platon lebedev , comes as no surprise .
this was far from a free and fair trial , instead it was politically motivated .
sentencing has not yet been handed down but it 's expected that the two men will be jailed until at least 2012 - the year of the presidential elections - if not until 2017 .
many observers say that the former president and current prime minister , vladimir putin , was the driving force behind the guilty verdict . khodorkovsky was first jailed on tax evasion charges in 2003 and many believe that putin wanted to punish khodorkovsky for his perceived meddling in russian politics and his anti-putin stance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel , head of dw 's russian service in the run-up to the current verdict , putin publicly called for a guilty verdict , describing khodorkovsky as a thief .
politically , not the best of moves , considering that moscow was so keen to give the impression of a fair and independent trial .
president dmitry medevedev 's remarks were more circumspect when he said that no one - not even a president or any other high-ranking official , like putin - should comment on the current legal proceedings .
no doubt medvedev was already thinking of the political implications of a guilty verdict .
the questionable legal proceedings have dealt his reform and modernization efforts a heavy blow , and beyond that they could affect relations with the west .
the russian leadership is seemingly unaware that any reform can only be accomplished with the necessary legal and constitutional framework , fancy pr campaigns and speeches wo n't do the trick .
indeed , the trial has reinforced the perception in the west that russia lacks many basic and constitutional rights .
however much germany , europe and the us are interested in having good ties with moscow , there is a growing feeling that a russia shaped and formed by putin can not be trusted .
no doubt us president barack obama , who managed to push through the start arms reduction treaty with russia last week , will be on the receiving end of such criticism .
the west may have readily embraced khodorkovsky and lebedev as symbols for a free , democratic and just russia .
their current treatment and the clearly politically motivated nature of their trial has now led many russians to look up to them as heros in a battle against a corrupt and arbitrary regime .

westerwelle said that the way the trial was conducted was " very dubious " and called on russia to " stand up for the rule of law , democracy and human rights . "
german human rights commissioner markus loening found even stronger words to condemn the verdict , telling the dpa news agency that he was " outraged . "
" the judgment throws no good light on circumstances in russia , " he said .
loening described the verdict as " a crass misinterpretation of what happened in court . "
' russia must respect human rights commitments ' chief european union diplomat catherine ashton called on russia " to respect its international commitments in the field of human rights and the rule of law . "
she said the eu would " continue to follow developments very closely , including the forthcoming announcement of the sentence . "
across the atlantic , united states secretary of state hillary clinton said the verdict raised " serious questions about selective prosecution - and about the rule of law being overshadowed by political considerations . "
clinton also warned in a statement that " this and similar cases have a negative impact on russia 's reputation for fulfilling its international human rights obligations and improving its investment climate . "
embezzlement charges khodorkovsky was found guilty of embezzlement for stealing and reselling over 200 tons of oil from wells he previously owned as head of the yukos oil company .
his business partner and co-defendant platon lebedev was also found guilty .

his release was scheduled for 2011 .
sentencing in the current case is expected in the next few days .
the prosecution is seeking a six-year jail term .
shortly after the verdict was read , khodorkovsky 's defense lawyers said they would appeal the decision .
khodorkovsky had previously said he would take the case to the european court of human rights if he was found guilty .
orchestrated by putin ?
khodorkovsky and his lawyers say the charges against him are politically motivated .
the tycoon has been an outspoken opponent of former president and current prime minister vladimir putin , openly funding opposition parties ahead of 2003 parliamentary elections .
khodorkovsky 's original trial in 2003 was widely seen as having been orchestrated by putin .
if khodorkovsky remains in jail through 2012 , it will prevent him from wielding his influence ahead of the election scheduled in that year .
the current case has been seen as a test of the independence of the russian justice system .

west african bloc threatens intervention in ivory coast ecowas lacks adequate logistics and cohesion for a quick and decisive strike to remove the dictator who is trying to thwart the will of the ivoirians .
military force should be used if laurent gbagbo refuses to quit as it has been shown from the election result that the majority of the people does not want him to continue in power .
he should never underestimate a determined ecowas with a very strong nigerian influence and the support of the au , un , us and eu . - agholor , nigeria my opinion is that gbagbo should hand over power peacefully , but if that is not the case then ecowas will have to send in the military .
he can not just gain power by force .
a lot of resources were spent for the election to take place , so the people of ivory coast deserve to be heard . - james , kenya i think it 's high time we put an end to all of this military adventurism on the african continent so the ordinary people can be saved from these selfish individuals , and hopefully have some chance for some real development .
though there is a risk of abuse in intervening in the internal affairs of independent member states , this time around ecowas is right to use full force to oust gbagbo .
that would send a useful signal to all intending adventurists on the continent !
ecowas may even need to clearly define the circumstances under which it might routinely consider this form of intervention in future .
enough is enough ! - anthony , nigeria i am happy that ecowas has given a warning to laurent gbagbo that should he decide not to stand down , the bloc would use legitimate force to oust him from power .
for a long time now , the african union and the world have watched dictators cling to power even when they lost elections .
the peoples ' will , expressed through elections or the ballot box , has meant nothing . - malama , zambia while i am thankful that we have the presence of the un in our world , however , it would be a mistake to send un peacekeepers .
i believe ecowas is more in touch with what 's happening in ivory coast and it 's time we give credence and support to local initiatives of this magnitude .
the un should work with ecowas and give necessary guidance if need be .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 27.12.2010 berlin plans undercover checks on financial advisors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : financial advisors need to think carefully about what they say financial advisors in german banks could receive an unpleasant visit from undercover investigators under a government plan aimed at protecting consumers against inadequate investment advice . german consumer protection minister ilse aigner plans to tighten controls on financial advisors selling shares and other investment products .
" in the future , undercover investigators will be deployed by the government – and they wo n't only be checking general terms and conditions , " aigner said in an interview with the german business newspaper handelsblatt .
rather than simply inspecting the fine print of contracts , investigators posing as potential customers would be able to assess whether financial advisors provide transparent explanations of the products they are selling .
risk management many private investors in germany who lost a chunk of their personal wealth in the financial crisis complain they were insufficiently warned of the risks attached to their investments .
financial advisors , they charge , like to sell high-risk investments not only because of the high commissions they collect but also because of the healthy margins they generate for their bank employers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many private investors saw their savings go down the drain in the financial crisis aigner envisions a state-run control program to complement " mystery shopper " tests already conducted by the independent german consumer research foundation , stiftung warentest .
the foundation conducts spot checks of products and services - including investment advice provided by banks and other financial institutions - and publishes the results .
in july , it released the results of a test of financial advice offered by 21 banks .
six banks failed and not one received the rating " good " or " very good . "
but the problem with the stiftung warentest 's program , aigner said , is that because informants ca n't be identified , banks frequently question the validity of its findings .
penalties still unknown by launching a state-run program , the minister hopes to keep financial advisors on their best behavior .
" laws only help when someone ensures that they are enforced , " she said .
aigner said she would like germany 's federal financial supervisory authority -lrb- bafin -rrb- to administer the undercover checks .
the minister gave no details about the penalties banks providing poor advice could face .

consumer affairs minister aigner has called the new devices a privacy threat . they fly , take pictures , can be operated remotely and even come with an auto-pilot feature to land safely in case their owner gets distracted . the flying miniature drones are marketed as the ar.drone by wireless device manufacturer parrot and have been available in german electronics stores since summer 2010 . but some german politicians are concerned about privacy issues relating to the toys priced at 299 euros -lrb- $ 393 -rrb- and steered by devices like the iphone and ipad . " even just by using the small , helicopter-like hobby models , people can quickly go beyond the limits of the law , " said ilse aigner , germany 's consumer affairs minister , in an interview with the deutsche presse agentur . for example , if hobbyists or children fly the ar.drone onto neighbors ' property and capture images of them in their home without their permission , the photographs could already stand in violation of data privacy laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilse aigner believes in caution as drones become more widespread among civilians legal grey zone laws currently exist that require clearance for launching unmanned flying objects similar to the ar.drone , but they do not address devices of its size .
currently , objects that weigh less than five kilograms -lrb- 11 pounds -rrb- , do not reach an altitude of more than 30 meters and are not used commercially are not in need of clearance . " exactly where the line is between illegal and legal uses of these cameras remains a question of legal interpretation , " a spokesman from the federal ministry of food , agriculture and consumer protection told deutsche welle . " there is no law that states in clear terms how these devices are permitted to be used , so it 's a new legal issue , " he added . while everyday street-level photographs generated by the objects are likely unproblematic , the question remains open as to exactly which uses are prohibited under current laws . bildunterschrift : german police have used pricier , more sophisticated drones to get evidence and manage deployment smaller and cheaper politicians from the left party in germany have called for legal limits on using the drone cameras , citing concerns about the future as similar devices become smaller , cheaper and more available . " as the technology becomes cheaper , it 's also going to be used more broadly , " said jan korte , a data protection expert within the party , in an interview with the deutsche presse agentur . " people should not be able to use the drones to pry into the private sphere of others . " but there is not yet widespread discussion about changing federal laws to deal more clearly with the legal issues raised by cameras like the ar.drone , said a representative of the federal commission for data protection and freedom of information , which advises the parliament on privacy issues . author : greg wiser editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

efforts to reconcile competing political groups remain the main challenge . thailand ’ s anti-government protest rallies led by the united front for democracy against dictatorship or udd led to a major political confrontation lasting two months between march and may .
the udd , also known as red shirts , supports former prime minister thaksin shinawatra , who was deposed in a 2006 coup and forced to live overseas .
udd leaders hoped to topple prime minister abhisit vejjajiva ’ s government and refused government offers of early elections .
after the military cleared the protest site at the commercial area of rajaprasong in central bangkok , 92 people had died and almost 2,000 had been injured – both civilians and soldiers – in the worst political violence in 20 years .
up to 400 people remain in jail , including udd leaders charged with terrorism offenses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thai soldiers were a constant presence in bangkok in 2010 change has started , but not finished yet chris baker , an author and commentator on thai politics says 2010 marked a shift in thailand ’ s political landscape .
he says it has been a very tumultous year and , " it ’ s been a year that in retrospect i think will be seen as the year of great change – but of change that has started but not really finished yet .
the politics have really changed quite a lot – the mass of people who came into bangkok were something really very , very new and quite surprising . "
the protests highlighted deep divisions in thai society .
many analysts say they first came to the fore with thaksin , who has relied on the poor , rural voters .
many of them supported him for his populist policies as prime minister .
bildunterschrift : former thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra baker says more people now feel they have a stake in national politics .
but he also warns that many in the governing class and elite feel the situation has returned to normal .
this view , he says , is set to lead to problems in the future .
reconciliation efforts the government established several committees investigating the violence .
human rights lawyer somchai homla-or is a member of the truth for reconciliation commission and is optimistic .
" we have found that the prime minister himself always responds positively to what we recommend and what we ask for .
now we get more support from udd leaders and udd members too .
i believe the majority of them do not want to use violence and they have the same position to strengthen our democracy . "
in a nationally televised address on christmas eve , prime minister abhisit vejjajiva set the ground for national elections highlighting the government ’ s achievements since 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thai prime minister abhisit vejjajiva is ready to call a new election he spoke of rising economic growth , expanded trade , higher agriculture prices and education and social reforms .
government spokesman panitan wattanayagorn sees an election coming and says , " the prime minister is very clear .
he is sending out a signal to the thai people to be ready . "
wattanayagorn says the remaining factor will be how to guarantee a peaceful and stable election .
" if we can do that – if we go to the polls without having a bloody election , a very confrontational election – the prime minister said he is ready to call a new election . "
red shirt leaders say they will press ahead with protests but they will remain peaceful .
for its part , the government recently lifted the state of emergency in bangkok and surrounding provinces .

ever since the incident , there has been an escalation in tensions and warnings issued by both countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newly appointed south korean defense minister kim kwan-jin lee has called on his country to be united in the current confrontation with the north .
in a national radio address on monday , he said as south korea faces a national security threat , " our country can not afford internal divisions , because what is at stake is our very lives and the survival of this nation . "
lessons learned the president affirmed that south korea still wanted peaceful reunification with the north .
but he also cautioned citizens not to be afraid of a military conflict : " if we are afraid of war , we wo n't be able to prevent it .
only if we are determined to bravely confront any risk , will we be able to ward off all dangers . "
south korea 's president also emphasized that he had learned important lessons from the north korean shelling of yeonpyeong island , which killed four people last month .
" so far , the south has been showing a lot of patience to maintain peace .
but we know that war can only be prevented and peace can only be ensured if we meet the north 's provocations with zero tolerance . "
bildunterschrift : smoke billows from yeonpyeong after the north shelled the island zero tolerance with this , the president repeated last week 's warnings that seoul would strike back from now on .
lee myung-bak and the army had been attacked by critics for reacting too passively to the yeonpyeong attack .
the defense minister resigned as a consequence .
in his speech , the conservative president indirectly also targeted the liberal opposition .
the discussions within south korea after the sinking of the naval ship cheonan in march had encouraged north korea and prepared the ground for the attack on yeonpyeong , lee argued .
south korean politicians , scientists and journalists had cast doubts on the results of an international investigation that had blamed a north korean torpedo for the sinking of the cheonan , in which 46 south korean sailors were killed .
pyongyang has rejected all accusations over the sinking of the cheonan .
moreover , north korea has justified its attack on the south korean island as a retaliatory measure , arguing that south korea attacked north korean territory first by holding a naval exercise in the disputed waters surrounding yeonpyeong island , which is very close to the north korean mainland .
north korea does not recognize the naval border which was fixed by the united nations after the end of the korean war in 1953 .
pyongyang calls for a border further to the south .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korea has vowed zero tolerance toward the north south korea has staged a series of military exercises since the yeonpyeong shelling , including one with the united states .
despite issuing threats of a " sacred war " , the north has not reacted with more attacks , leading many observers to believe that pyongyang wants to avoid all-out war .
seoul has announced more drills for this week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 27.12.2010 new elections may be ahead as a tumultuous year ends in thailand großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations and violence marked the year 2010 in thailand 's capital city thailand has faced its most turbulent year in politics in over two decades as mass anti-government rallies gripped the capital .
efforts to reconcile competing political groups remain the main challenge . thailand ’ s anti-government protest rallies led by the united front for democracy against dictatorship or udd led to a major political confrontation lasting two months between march and may .
the udd , also known as red shirts , supports former prime minister thaksin shinawatra , who was deposed in a 2006 coup and forced to live overseas .
udd leaders hoped to topple prime minister abhisit vejjajiva ’ s government and refused government offers of early elections .
after the military cleared the protest site at the commercial area of rajaprasong in central bangkok , 92 people had died and almost 2,000 had been injured – both civilians and soldiers – in the worst political violence in 20 years .
up to 400 people remain in jail , including udd leaders charged with terrorism offenses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thai soldiers were a constant presence in bangkok in 2010 change has started , but not finished yet chris baker , an author and commentator on thai politics says 2010 marked a shift in thailand ’ s political landscape .
he says it has been a very tumultous year and , " it ’ s been a year that in retrospect i think will be seen as the year of great change – but of change that has started but not really finished yet .
the politics have really changed quite a lot – the mass of people who came into bangkok were something really very , very new and quite surprising . "
the protests highlighted deep divisions in thai society .
many analysts say they first came to the fore with thaksin , who has relied on the poor , rural voters .
many of them supported him for his populist policies as prime minister .
bildunterschrift : former thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra baker says more people now feel they have a stake in national politics .
but he also warns that many in the governing class and elite feel the situation has returned to normal .
this view , he says , is set to lead to problems in the future .
reconciliation efforts the government established several committees investigating the violence .
human rights lawyer somchai homla-or is a member of the truth for reconciliation commission and is optimistic .
" we have found that the prime minister himself always responds positively to what we recommend and what we ask for .
now we get more support from udd leaders and udd members too .
i believe the majority of them do not want to use violence and they have the same position to strengthen our democracy . "
in a nationally televised address on christmas eve , prime minister abhisit vejjajiva set the ground for national elections highlighting the government ’ s achievements since 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thai prime minister abhisit vejjajiva is ready to call a new election he spoke of rising economic growth , expanded trade , higher agriculture prices and education and social reforms .
government spokesman panitan wattanayagorn sees an election coming and says , " the prime minister is very clear .
he is sending out a signal to the thai people to be ready . "
wattanayagorn says the remaining factor will be how to guarantee a peaceful and stable election .
" if we can do that – if we go to the polls without having a bloody election , a very confrontational election – the prime minister said he is ready to call a new election . "
red shirt leaders say they will press ahead with protests but they will remain peaceful .
for its part , the government recently lifted the state of emergency in bangkok and surrounding provinces .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 27.12.2010 khodorkovsky verdict was politically motivated , say observers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khodorkovsky 's trial and verdict was politically motivated , critics say observers had already predicted a " guilty " verdict in the moscow trial of jailed russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky .
many believe the lawsuit against the kremlin critic is purely politically motivated . khodorkovsky has been found guilty of stealing 218 tons of oil he owned as head of the yukos oil company and of embezzling the proceeds .
the oil magnate , a vocal critic of the policies of then-russian president vladimir putin , was first tried for tax evasion in 2003 .
since then , he has been in a siberian prison , and the trial led to the breakup of his multimillion-euro oil concern .
the eu has called on russia to respect international rights in its sentencing which is expected in the next few days .
the moscow prosecutor 's office is seeking a further six-year sentence - which observers note would keep the putin political rival locked up beyond the next presidential elections , in 2012 .
a number of human-rights activists say the real reason khodorkovsky was tried a second time is because he dared to openly criticize putin , as well as actively support opposition candidates .
constant media presence khodorkovsky 's lawyer , juri schmidt , says the trial was the kremlin 's way of dealing with its fear of the public response to a vocal critic .
" khodorkovsky … is more present in the press than ever .
i think this fear is one of the main reasons that the trial against khodorkovsky and -lrb- platon -rrb- lebedev is even being held , " schmidt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regular marches to free khodorkovsky are held in moscow his omnipresence in the media has made khodorkovsky a symbolic hero for the russian opposition , as well as for human-rights activists , schmidt added .
" the government did n't expect such an enormous resonance among the public .
the apparently restrained reaction to the first verdict made them think that it would be the same in a second trial .
but they made an error , " schmidt said .
" opinion polls show that society is increasingly looking up to khodorkovsky .
this only serves to make the government more afraid . "
khodorkovsky overstepped limits , kremlin supporters say political scientist vyacheslav nikonov , known for his close ties to the kremlin , disputes the notion that moscow is afraid of khodorkovsky .
" the russian government is n't afraid of any oligarch , whether he is banned or active .
the state has many more ways to pressure an oligarch than the other way around , " nikonov said .
" the kremlin 's image wo n't suffer measurably from the khodorkovsky trial , and khodorkovsky has little influence on political power at the moment . "
according to nikonov , moscow pursued this trial for the nation 's best interest alone .
the oil magnate was arrested not because he started any election campaigns , but because he had " bought the control of meaningful committees " in russia 's parliament .
" without his say-so , even the finance ministry could n't complete certain operations .
and when a person like that starts to attack the state , by not paying taxes - that goes well beyond the limits of what is allowed , " nikonov said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khodorkovsky could spend six more years behind bars but the president of the moscow-based research institute panorama says he thinks other motivations are in play in moscow 's decision to prosecute khodorkovsky a second time .
" if he 's free , khodorkovsky could start legal proceedings against those who stripped him of his business - namely , putin and his then-deputy igor sechin , " said vladimir pribilovsky .
" besides , they are afraid that a free khodorkovsky would unite and lead an opposition . "
another khodorkovsky lawyer , vadim klyuvgant , said the government did everything it could to see that a " guilty " verdict was handed down .
the trial was anything but fair , he said : " it is all fabrication - simply fabrication from start to finish .
from the first word to the last , written or spoken .
it is all just made up with a single goal : vengeance . "
westerwelle weighs in western leaders , including german foreign minister guido westerwelle , have been keeping an intense eye on the trial .
the german minister made known his concerns about the conditions of the trial when he visited moscow in early november .
he told his russian counterpart sergei lavrov that russia needs to take the west 's concerns seriously .
lavrov replied by stressing the independent nature of russia 's justice system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle -lrb- left -rrb- let russia 's lavrov know the west is watching in fact , a russian court can freely decide on a verdict - but it needs to have the right information to decide with , said oleg orlov , chairman of the board of memorial , a center for human rights .
he and other trial watchers believe the court was putting too much pressure on the judges to deliver a fair verdict .
" the judge ... is in a very difficult position .
i ca n't imagine how a justice with any self respect can give a guilty verdict under these conditions .
but in today 's russia , everything is possible , " orlov said .
the defense started hearing closing arguments on 27 october .
khodorkovsky took the chance to speak , and he talked for three hours .
in the end he did n't ask the court for mercy , but he asked them to keep an open mind .
likely outcome : six more years speaking with irony , he asked the court to honor the prosecutor 's enormous efforts at fabricating a case against him , saying : " honorable court , i agree that a not-guilty verdict would be almost a utopian outcome . … the prosecution has done everything in its power to see that the court has no legitimate chance to declare me not guilty .
you should respect these efforts , because next time , the prosecution can just spit on an empty sheet of paper , put a rubber stamp on it , and demand 14 years of prison .
it would amount to the same thing . "
observers say that khodorkovsky will likely be sentenced to six more years in a siberian prison camp - in which case he would n't see freedom until 2017 .
khodorkovsky 's father , 78 year old boris khodorkovsky , said he fears he will never see his son again .
" i 'm old , and am afraid that after this trial , i wo n't see him again , if he is sent to siberia .
i ca n't fly anymore , because i have bad eyesight .
i do n't know what i would do , " the elder khodorkovsky said .
if he is convicted , khodorkovsky said he would take the case to the european court of human rights in strasbourg .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 27.12.2010 khodorkovsky verdict was politically motivated , say observers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khodorkovsky 's trial and verdict was politically motivated , critics say observers had already predicted a " guilty " verdict in the moscow trial of jailed russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky .
many believe the lawsuit against the kremlin critic is purely politically motivated . khodorkovsky has been found guilty of stealing 218 tons of oil he owned as head of the yukos oil company and of embezzling the proceeds .
the oil magnate , a vocal critic of the policies of then-russian president vladimir putin , was first tried for tax evasion in 2003 .
since then , he has been in a siberian prison , and the trial led to the breakup of his multimillion-euro oil concern .
the eu has called on russia to respect international rights in its sentencing which is expected in the next few days .
the moscow prosecutor 's office is seeking a further six-year sentence - which observers note would keep the putin political rival locked up beyond the next presidential elections , in 2012 .
a number of human-rights activists say the real reason khodorkovsky was tried a second time is because he dared to openly criticize putin , as well as actively support opposition candidates .
constant media presence khodorkovsky 's lawyer , juri schmidt , says the trial was the kremlin 's way of dealing with its fear of the public response to a vocal critic .
" khodorkovsky … is more present in the press than ever .
i think this fear is one of the main reasons that the trial against khodorkovsky and -lrb- platon -rrb- lebedev is even being held , " schmidt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regular marches to free khodorkovsky are held in moscow his omnipresence in the media has made khodorkovsky a symbolic hero for the russian opposition , as well as for human-rights activists , schmidt added .
" the government did n't expect such an enormous resonance among the public .
the apparently restrained reaction to the first verdict made them think that it would be the same in a second trial .
but they made an error , " schmidt said .
" opinion polls show that society is increasingly looking up to khodorkovsky .
this only serves to make the government more afraid . "
khodorkovsky overstepped limits , kremlin supporters say political scientist vyacheslav nikonov , known for his close ties to the kremlin , disputes the notion that moscow is afraid of khodorkovsky .
" the russian government is n't afraid of any oligarch , whether he is banned or active .
the state has many more ways to pressure an oligarch than the other way around , " nikonov said .
" the kremlin 's image wo n't suffer measurably from the khodorkovsky trial , and khodorkovsky has little influence on political power at the moment . "
according to nikonov , moscow pursued this trial for the nation 's best interest alone .
the oil magnate was arrested not because he started any election campaigns , but because he had " bought the control of meaningful committees " in russia 's parliament .
" without his say-so , even the finance ministry could n't complete certain operations .
and when a person like that starts to attack the state , by not paying taxes - that goes well beyond the limits of what is allowed , " nikonov said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khodorkovsky could spend six more years behind bars but the president of the moscow-based research institute panorama says he thinks other motivations are in play in moscow 's decision to prosecute khodorkovsky a second time .
" if he 's free , khodorkovsky could start legal proceedings against those who stripped him of his business - namely , putin and his then-deputy igor sechin , " said vladimir pribilovsky .
" besides , they are afraid that a free khodorkovsky would unite and lead an opposition . "
another khodorkovsky lawyer , vadim klyuvgant , said the government did everything it could to see that a " guilty " verdict was handed down .
the trial was anything but fair , he said : " it is all fabrication - simply fabrication from start to finish .
from the first word to the last , written or spoken .
it is all just made up with a single goal : vengeance . "
westerwelle weighs in western leaders , including german foreign minister guido westerwelle , have been keeping an intense eye on the trial .
the german minister made known his concerns about the conditions of the trial when he visited moscow in early november .
he told his russian counterpart sergei lavrov that russia needs to take the west 's concerns seriously .
lavrov replied by stressing the independent nature of russia 's justice system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle -lrb- left -rrb- let russia 's lavrov know the west is watching in fact , a russian court can freely decide on a verdict - but it needs to have the right information to decide with , said oleg orlov , chairman of the board of memorial , a center for human rights .
he and other trial watchers believe the court was putting too much pressure on the judges to deliver a fair verdict .
" the judge ... is in a very difficult position .
i ca n't imagine how a justice with any self respect can give a guilty verdict under these conditions .
but in today 's russia , everything is possible , " orlov said .
the defense started hearing closing arguments on 27 october .
khodorkovsky took the chance to speak , and he talked for three hours .
in the end he did n't ask the court for mercy , but he asked them to keep an open mind .
likely outcome : six more years speaking with irony , he asked the court to honor the prosecutor 's enormous efforts at fabricating a case against him , saying : " honorable court , i agree that a not-guilty verdict would be almost a utopian outcome . … the prosecution has done everything in its power to see that the court has no legitimate chance to declare me not guilty .
you should respect these efforts , because next time , the prosecution can just spit on an empty sheet of paper , put a rubber stamp on it , and demand 14 years of prison .
it would amount to the same thing . "
observers say that khodorkovsky will likely be sentenced to six more years in a siberian prison camp - in which case he would n't see freedom until 2017 .
khodorkovsky 's father , 78 year old boris khodorkovsky , said he fears he will never see his son again .
" i 'm old , and am afraid that after this trial , i wo n't see him again , if he is sent to siberia .
i ca n't fly anymore , because i have bad eyesight .
i do n't know what i would do , " the elder khodorkovsky said .
if he is convicted , khodorkovsky said he would take the case to the european court of human rights in strasbourg .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 27.12.2010 south korean president calls for national unity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korean president lee myung-bak calling for national unity , south korea 's president lee myung-bak has affirmed his resolve to counter any further provocation by north korea . about a month after an attack on a south korean island by north korean artillery , south korean president lee myung-bak warned against attempts to split the south korean population .
ever since the incident , there has been an escalation in tensions and warnings issued by both countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newly appointed south korean defense minister kim kwan-jin lee has called on his country to be united in the current confrontation with the north .
in a national radio address on monday , he said as south korea faces a national security threat , " our country can not afford internal divisions , because what is at stake is our very lives and the survival of this nation . "
lessons learned the president affirmed that south korea still wanted peaceful reunification with the north .
but he also cautioned citizens not to be afraid of a military conflict : " if we are afraid of war , we wo n't be able to prevent it .
only if we are determined to bravely confront any risk , will we be able to ward off all dangers . "
south korea 's president also emphasized that he had learned important lessons from the north korean shelling of yeonpyeong island , which killed four people last month .
" so far , the south has been showing a lot of patience to maintain peace .
but we know that war can only be prevented and peace can only be ensured if we meet the north 's provocations with zero tolerance . "
bildunterschrift : smoke billows from yeonpyeong after the north shelled the island zero tolerance with this , the president repeated last week 's warnings that seoul would strike back from now on .
lee myung-bak and the army had been attacked by critics for reacting too passively to the yeonpyeong attack .
the defense minister resigned as a consequence .
in his speech , the conservative president indirectly also targeted the liberal opposition .
the discussions within south korea after the sinking of the naval ship cheonan in march had encouraged north korea and prepared the ground for the attack on yeonpyeong , lee argued .
south korean politicians , scientists and journalists had cast doubts on the results of an international investigation that had blamed a north korean torpedo for the sinking of the cheonan , in which 46 south korean sailors were killed .
pyongyang has rejected all accusations over the sinking of the cheonan .
moreover , north korea has justified its attack on the south korean island as a retaliatory measure , arguing that south korea attacked north korean territory first by holding a naval exercise in the disputed waters surrounding yeonpyeong island , which is very close to the north korean mainland .
north korea does not recognize the naval border which was fixed by the united nations after the end of the korean war in 1953 .
pyongyang calls for a border further to the south .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korea has vowed zero tolerance toward the north south korea has staged a series of military exercises since the yeonpyeong shelling , including one with the united states .
despite issuing threats of a " sacred war " , the north has not reacted with more attacks , leading many observers to believe that pyongyang wants to avoid all-out war .
seoul has announced more drills for this week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 27.12.2010 khodorkovsky verdict was politically motivated , say observers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khodorkovsky 's trial and verdict was politically motivated , critics say observers had already predicted a " guilty " verdict in the moscow trial of jailed russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky .
many believe the lawsuit against the kremlin critic is purely politically motivated . khodorkovsky has been found guilty of stealing 218 tons of oil he owned as head of the yukos oil company and of embezzling the proceeds .
the oil magnate , a vocal critic of the policies of then-russian president vladimir putin , was first tried for tax evasion in 2003 .
since then , he has been in a siberian prison , and the trial led to the breakup of his multimillion-euro oil concern .
the eu has called on russia to respect international rights in its sentencing which is expected in the next few days .
the moscow prosecutor 's office is seeking a further six-year sentence - which observers note would keep the putin political rival locked up beyond the next presidential elections , in 2012 .
a number of human-rights activists say the real reason khodorkovsky was tried a second time is because he dared to openly criticize putin , as well as actively support opposition candidates .
constant media presence khodorkovsky 's lawyer , juri schmidt , says the trial was the kremlin 's way of dealing with its fear of the public response to a vocal critic .
" khodorkovsky … is more present in the press than ever .
i think this fear is one of the main reasons that the trial against khodorkovsky and -lrb- platon -rrb- lebedev is even being held , " schmidt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regular marches to free khodorkovsky are held in moscow his omnipresence in the media has made khodorkovsky a symbolic hero for the russian opposition , as well as for human-rights activists , schmidt added .
" the government did n't expect such an enormous resonance among the public .
the apparently restrained reaction to the first verdict made them think that it would be the same in a second trial .
but they made an error , " schmidt said .
" opinion polls show that society is increasingly looking up to khodorkovsky .
this only serves to make the government more afraid . "
khodorkovsky overstepped limits , kremlin supporters say political scientist vyacheslav nikonov , known for his close ties to the kremlin , disputes the notion that moscow is afraid of khodorkovsky .
" the russian government is n't afraid of any oligarch , whether he is banned or active .
the state has many more ways to pressure an oligarch than the other way around , " nikonov said .
" the kremlin 's image wo n't suffer measurably from the khodorkovsky trial , and khodorkovsky has little influence on political power at the moment . "
according to nikonov , moscow pursued this trial for the nation 's best interest alone .
the oil magnate was arrested not because he started any election campaigns , but because he had " bought the control of meaningful committees " in russia 's parliament .
" without his say-so , even the finance ministry could n't complete certain operations .
and when a person like that starts to attack the state , by not paying taxes - that goes well beyond the limits of what is allowed , " nikonov said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khodorkovsky could spend six more years behind bars but the president of the moscow-based research institute panorama says he thinks other motivations are in play in moscow 's decision to prosecute khodorkovsky a second time .
" if he 's free , khodorkovsky could start legal proceedings against those who stripped him of his business - namely , putin and his then-deputy igor sechin , " said vladimir pribilovsky .
" besides , they are afraid that a free khodorkovsky would unite and lead an opposition . "
another khodorkovsky lawyer , vadim klyuvgant , said the government did everything it could to see that a " guilty " verdict was handed down .
the trial was anything but fair , he said : " it is all fabrication - simply fabrication from start to finish .
from the first word to the last , written or spoken .
it is all just made up with a single goal : vengeance . "
westerwelle weighs in western leaders , including german foreign minister guido westerwelle , have been keeping an intense eye on the trial .
the german minister made known his concerns about the conditions of the trial when he visited moscow in early november .
he told his russian counterpart sergei lavrov that russia needs to take the west 's concerns seriously .
lavrov replied by stressing the independent nature of russia 's justice system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle -lrb- left -rrb- let russia 's lavrov know the west is watching in fact , a russian court can freely decide on a verdict - but it needs to have the right information to decide with , said oleg orlov , chairman of the board of memorial , a center for human rights .
he and other trial watchers believe the court was putting too much pressure on the judges to deliver a fair verdict .
" the judge ... is in a very difficult position .
i ca n't imagine how a justice with any self respect can give a guilty verdict under these conditions .
but in today 's russia , everything is possible , " orlov said .
the defense started hearing closing arguments on 27 october .
khodorkovsky took the chance to speak , and he talked for three hours .
in the end he did n't ask the court for mercy , but he asked them to keep an open mind .
likely outcome : six more years speaking with irony , he asked the court to honor the prosecutor 's enormous efforts at fabricating a case against him , saying : " honorable court , i agree that a not-guilty verdict would be almost a utopian outcome . … the prosecution has done everything in its power to see that the court has no legitimate chance to declare me not guilty .
you should respect these efforts , because next time , the prosecution can just spit on an empty sheet of paper , put a rubber stamp on it , and demand 14 years of prison .
it would amount to the same thing . "
observers say that khodorkovsky will likely be sentenced to six more years in a siberian prison camp - in which case he would n't see freedom until 2017 .
khodorkovsky 's father , 78 year old boris khodorkovsky , said he fears he will never see his son again .
" i 'm old , and am afraid that after this trial , i wo n't see him again , if he is sent to siberia .
i ca n't fly anymore , because i have bad eyesight .
i do n't know what i would do , " the elder khodorkovsky said .
if he is convicted , khodorkovsky said he would take the case to the european court of human rights in strasbourg .

berlin-based erfinderhaus helps inventors develop new products ; the erfinderladen sells them . at berlin 's erfinderladen , or inventor 's shop , things are n't always what they seem : the cans ofdog food , batteries and soft drinks on display are actually clever stash safes designed by local inventor stefan neser .
neser picks up what looks and feels like a full can of cola .

together they advise would-be inventors on how to file patent applications , where to find development money , and how to deal with manufacturers .
muthenthaler says they wanted to both raise public awareness about erfinderhaus ' mostly invisible services and provide a launch pad for the new items they 've helped develop . " at the erfinderladen we can show what we do , show the products , and give inventors a chance so that when they only have 100 pieces handmade , they can also enter the market , " muthenthaler explains .
another advantage : it 's a test market situation .
when clients respond positively , muthenthaler and jordan take the product to big retailers and tell them about it . muthenthaler and jordan started their consulting business in 1997 in salzburg , austria , but found more fertile ground in the lively german capital .
the two learned firsthand how tough life can be for novice inventors . their first invention was an idea for a watch that could allow its wearer to identify and connect with people sharing the same likes and interests - a kind of a social network website on your wrist . when they tried to get the idea developed , the experience pushed them in a new direction .
" our first business meeting was with swatch , the biggest swiss company for watches .

the duo drove home and started searching for a company that offered advice to inventors .
they found a few in the united states , but none in germany .
so they decided to invent their own .
crazy men in basements ?
the german market needs the support even though its inventors generate a similar number of patents to japan , which is only outperformed by the united states .
german business culture , with its rigid processes and conservative attitudes , is wary of entrepreneurs .
adding to that , muthenthaler says , inventors now mostly work in teams for big companies like apple and siemens , and are n't identified as individuals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muthenthaler -lrb- right -rrb- and jordan founded erfinderhaus to help to inventors muthenthaler says the bias is inherent in the germany language itself , starting with the word erfinder .

but ' inventor ' in the anglo-american context would be an entrepreneur in the beginning , a visionary .
and here , it 's kind of the crazy guy who works in his basement on some stupid inventions .
that 's the public conception of the word , " he says .
erfinderhaus has been on a battle to rebrand the word erfinder as a respectable descriptor and profession . it actively in promotes " inventor 's day " in germany -lrb- november 9 -rrb- , while its founders regularly participate in panel discussions and blog about new ideas . muthenthaler admits he has a soft spot for odd designs and products that some might find a little crazy - or at least unusual - but erfinderhaus has also worked on practical technological advances like streetlight dimming system autolux , as well as novel energy-saving devices and construction materials . " as an inventor you always solve a problem " , says muthenthaler . " if it 's -lsb- just -rsb- your problem , it 's your problem . but if it 's a problem someone else also has , it 's a product .

" we are like gold diggers " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crazy or visionary ?
gyro gearloose 's profession is often misunderstood deciding which of these solutions should be realized is the real art of the business . as technology makes information easier to access and patents simpler to file , muthenthaler says more inventions are being created than ever before .
erfinderhaus receives 1,000 ideas a year .
some come as rough plans , some as finished designs .
but not all ideas are good or new .
many designs have already been patented or already exist on the market somewhere in the world . some 80 percent of proposals sent to erfinderhaus do n't make it past the first meeting , and only a few are fully developed .
" we are like gold diggers , " says muthenthaler .
" they have to get dirty and search the mud for the gold nuggets .
and that 's pretty much what we are doing .
we search for the nuggets . "
muthenthaler 's search is taking him beyond germany , austria and switzerland . erfinderhaus has launched a new website named inpama , aimed at american inventors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 27.12.2010 khodorkovsky verdict was politically motivated , say observers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khodorkovsky 's trial and verdict was politically motivated , critics say observers had already predicted a " guilty " verdict in the moscow trial of jailed russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky .
many believe the lawsuit against the kremlin critic is purely politically motivated . khodorkovsky has been found guilty of stealing 218 tons of oil he owned as head of the yukos oil company and of embezzling the proceeds .
the oil magnate , a vocal critic of the policies of then-russian president vladimir putin , was first tried for tax evasion in 2003 .
since then , he has been in a siberian prison , and the trial led to the breakup of his multimillion-euro oil concern .
the eu has called on russia to respect international rights in its sentencing which is expected in the next few days .
the moscow prosecutor 's office is seeking a further six-year sentence - which observers note would keep the putin political rival locked up beyond the next presidential elections , in 2012 .
a number of human-rights activists say the real reason khodorkovsky was tried a second time is because he dared to openly criticize putin , as well as actively support opposition candidates .
constant media presence khodorkovsky 's lawyer , juri schmidt , says the trial was the kremlin 's way of dealing with its fear of the public response to a vocal critic .
" khodorkovsky … is more present in the press than ever .
i think this fear is one of the main reasons that the trial against khodorkovsky and -lrb- platon -rrb- lebedev is even being held , " schmidt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regular marches to free khodorkovsky are held in moscow his omnipresence in the media has made khodorkovsky a symbolic hero for the russian opposition , as well as for human-rights activists , schmidt added .
" the government did n't expect such an enormous resonance among the public .
the apparently restrained reaction to the first verdict made them think that it would be the same in a second trial .
but they made an error , " schmidt said .
" opinion polls show that society is increasingly looking up to khodorkovsky .
this only serves to make the government more afraid . "
khodorkovsky overstepped limits , kremlin supporters say political scientist vyacheslav nikonov , known for his close ties to the kremlin , disputes the notion that moscow is afraid of khodorkovsky .
" the russian government is n't afraid of any oligarch , whether he is banned or active .
the state has many more ways to pressure an oligarch than the other way around , " nikonov said .
" the kremlin 's image wo n't suffer measurably from the khodorkovsky trial , and khodorkovsky has little influence on political power at the moment . "
according to nikonov , moscow pursued this trial for the nation 's best interest alone .
the oil magnate was arrested not because he started any election campaigns , but because he had " bought the control of meaningful committees " in russia 's parliament .
" without his say-so , even the finance ministry could n't complete certain operations .
and when a person like that starts to attack the state , by not paying taxes - that goes well beyond the limits of what is allowed , " nikonov said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khodorkovsky could spend six more years behind bars but the president of the moscow-based research institute panorama says he thinks other motivations are in play in moscow 's decision to prosecute khodorkovsky a second time .
" if he 's free , khodorkovsky could start legal proceedings against those who stripped him of his business - namely , putin and his then-deputy igor sechin , " said vladimir pribilovsky .
" besides , they are afraid that a free khodorkovsky would unite and lead an opposition . "
another khodorkovsky lawyer , vadim klyuvgant , said the government did everything it could to see that a " guilty " verdict was handed down .
the trial was anything but fair , he said : " it is all fabrication - simply fabrication from start to finish .
from the first word to the last , written or spoken .
it is all just made up with a single goal : vengeance . "
westerwelle weighs in western leaders , including german foreign minister guido westerwelle , have been keeping an intense eye on the trial .
the german minister made known his concerns about the conditions of the trial when he visited moscow in early november .
he told his russian counterpart sergei lavrov that russia needs to take the west 's concerns seriously .
lavrov replied by stressing the independent nature of russia 's justice system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle -lrb- left -rrb- let russia 's lavrov know the west is watching in fact , a russian court can freely decide on a verdict - but it needs to have the right information to decide with , said oleg orlov , chairman of the board of memorial , a center for human rights .
he and other trial watchers believe the court was putting too much pressure on the judges to deliver a fair verdict .
" the judge ... is in a very difficult position .
i ca n't imagine how a justice with any self respect can give a guilty verdict under these conditions .
but in today 's russia , everything is possible , " orlov said .
the defense started hearing closing arguments on 27 october .
khodorkovsky took the chance to speak , and he talked for three hours .
in the end he did n't ask the court for mercy , but he asked them to keep an open mind .
likely outcome : six more years speaking with irony , he asked the court to honor the prosecutor 's enormous efforts at fabricating a case against him , saying : " honorable court , i agree that a not-guilty verdict would be almost a utopian outcome . … the prosecution has done everything in its power to see that the court has no legitimate chance to declare me not guilty .
you should respect these efforts , because next time , the prosecution can just spit on an empty sheet of paper , put a rubber stamp on it , and demand 14 years of prison .
it would amount to the same thing . "
observers say that khodorkovsky will likely be sentenced to six more years in a siberian prison camp - in which case he would n't see freedom until 2017 .
khodorkovsky 's father , 78 year old boris khodorkovsky , said he fears he will never see his son again .
" i 'm old , and am afraid that after this trial , i wo n't see him again , if he is sent to siberia .
i ca n't fly anymore , because i have bad eyesight .
i do n't know what i would do , " the elder khodorkovsky said .
if he is convicted , khodorkovsky said he would take the case to the european court of human rights in strasbourg .

west african bloc threatens intervention in ivory coast ecowas lacks adequate logistics and cohesion for a quick and decisive strike to remove the dictator who is trying to thwart the will of the ivoirians .
military force should be used if laurent gbagbo refuses to quit as it has been shown from the election result that the majority of the people does not want him to continue in power .
he should never underestimate a determined ecowas with a very strong nigerian influence and the support of the au , un , us and eu . - agholor , nigeria my opinion is that gbagbo should hand over power peacefully , but if that is not the case then ecowas will have to send in the military .
he can not just gain power by force .
a lot of resources were spent for the election to take place , so the people of ivory coast deserve to be heard . - james , kenya i think it 's high time we put an end to all of this military adventurism on the african continent so the ordinary people can be saved from these selfish individuals , and hopefully have some chance for some real development .
though there is a risk of abuse in intervening in the internal affairs of independent member states , this time around ecowas is right to use full force to oust gbagbo .
that would send a useful signal to all intending adventurists on the continent !
ecowas may even need to clearly define the circumstances under which it might routinely consider this form of intervention in future .
enough is enough ! - anthony , nigeria i am happy that ecowas has given a warning to laurent gbagbo that should he decide not to stand down , the bloc would use legitimate force to oust him from power .
for a long time now , the african union and the world have watched dictators cling to power even when they lost elections .
the peoples ' will , expressed through elections or the ballot box , has meant nothing . - malama , zambia while i am thankful that we have the presence of the un in our world , however , it would be a mistake to send un peacekeepers .

it was hoped the strike would help convince incumbent president gbagbo to step down . a call for a general strike in ivory coast to pressure incumbent president laurent gbagbo into conceding power have failed to take hold .
in the country 's biggest city , abidjan , business largely went on as usual . the general strike was called for on sunday by supporters of alassane ouattara , the internationally recognized winner of ivory coast 's november presidential election . despite the united nations , the european union , the african union and the economic community of west african states -lrb- ecowas -rrb- all recognizing ouattara as the winner of the november 28 election , gbagbo continues to refuse to step down .
he says the election was rigged and was part of a plot against him orchestrated by france and the united states . the failed strike comes a day ahead of a trip to ivory coast by three ecowas leaders - the presidents of benin , sierra leone and cape verde - to try and personally convince gbagbo to step down .
should their bid fail , ecowas has threatened to take military action . threat of renewed civil war the standoff between the two presidential candidates has led to increased tension in the country , and around 200 people have already been killed in the election aftermath , according to the un human rights council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gbagbo has refused to relinquish power the unhrc also says at least 14,000 ivorians have fled to neighboring liberia , fearful of a return to the 2002-2003 civil war in ivory coast . " with their numbers growing , the humanitarian needs are increasing for the mostly women and children refugees as well as for the villagers hosting them , " the unhrc said in a statement on its website over the weekend . gbagbo 's interior minister , emile guirieoulou , on sunday rejected un allegations of widespread human rights violations in the election aftermath by gbagbo 's security forces , saying the world body was being partisan .
international pressure in addition to the threat of military intervention from ecowas , international pressure on gbagbo increased over the weekend as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ouattara has called for a nationwide general strike on sunday , airport authorities in the swiss city of basel grounded a plane belonging to gbagbo at the request of " the legitimate authorities " of ivory coast , a spokesman for the french foreign ministry said .
the aircraft is parked at the basel-mulhouse airport , which is jointly run by french and swiss authorities .
the us and european union previously imposed travel sanctions on gbagbo and his inner circle , while the world bank and the west african regional central bank have cut off his finances .

it has found some unusual ways of doing this . tallinn is preparing for its moment in the spotlight as the european capital of culture 2011 . over 250 different events and festivals have been planned for the coming year that center on the motto , " stories of the seashore , " which hints at estonian history and reflects tallinn ’ s location next to the sea . according to maris hellrand , spokeswoman for the tallinn 2011 organizational committee , the relationship between tallinn and the sea is of particular importance .
until the end of the soviet union 's reign over estonia , which ended in 1991 , the city 's shores were a restricted military zone .
the soldiers are no longer there today , but access to the sea is still largely obstructed .
this is set to change in 2011 . " at the moment , there 's still an old jail at the seashore , " said hellrand .
" we want to transform the seaside promenade in front of it into a ' culture kilometer . " ' the culture kilometer is the planned heart for the year 's celebrations , with most of the tallinn 2011 events taking place there . unusual attractions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the event planners have many unusual ideas estonia , which is due to join the euro currency zone on january 1 , wants to present itself as a modern european country in 2011 .
this image allows for some breaks with tradition , such as the film project " 60 seconds of solitude in the year zero . "
according to its initiator indrek kasela , it is " a declaration of love to the cinema . " " we asked film directors from around the world to produce one-minute clips on the topic of solitude , " said kasela .
" they will be put together into a one-hour film . " the film is due to be screened in august - not at a movie theater but on a large screen mounted in the sea .
the audience will be able to see it from the shore and watch as it bursts into flames together with the film reel at the end of the screening .
as only one copy of the film reel will be produced , the event will be unique in the truest sense of the word . another project offers more long-term entertainment .
planned for may , " mim goes sustainable " is a mixture of performance and theater - but with a twist .
it involves audience members producing electricity for the stage lighting by pedaling on indoor bikes .
in this way , they help create a stage show that does not depend on fossil fuels . a look into the estonian soul the creators of tallinn 2011 hope to combine the future with tradition .
the youth song and dance celebration festival aims to exemplify that combination and will serve as one of the main capital of culture events . choral singing is an important tradition in estonia 's history , having played a key role in the singing revolution - a series of spontaneous mass-singing demonstrations that took place between 1987 and 1991 to help bring about estonia 's independence from the soviet union . in 2011 , thousands are expected to gather at the tallinn song festival grounds for several days in a special commemoration the 20th anniversary of independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many will sing again at the city 's song festival grounds " this festival is an opportunity to get a glimpse into the estonian soul within one weekend , " said hellrand .
" this is what we are .
this is why we are . " another highlight will be the tallinn maritime days , july 15 to 17 , hailed as the largest free family event in estonia .
a new exhibition will open at the estonian maritime museum in the renovated hangars of the former seaplane port .
walkers will also be able to enjoy the newly opened seaside promenade . in late december , a closing ceremony will be held in the center of the city .

the verdict in khodorkovsky 's second trial could keep him behind bars for several more years . mikhail khodorkovsky has been found guilty of embezzlement for stealing and reselling over 200 tons of oil from wells he previously owned as head of the yukos oil company .
the judge in the case , viktor danilkin , read the verdict in a moscow courtroom on monday .
khodorkovsky 's business partner and co-defendant platon lebedev was also found guilty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khodorkovsky supporters gathered outside the court monday khodorkovsky is currently serving an eight-year prison sentence for tax evasion .
sentencing in the current case is expected in the next few days .
the prosecution is seeking a six-year sentence .
the russian news agency interfax reported that journalists present in the courtroom were asked to leave by danilkin just after the guilty decision was read .
the entire verdict could take several days to read .
observers have speculated that a date change in the verdict reading , originally scheduled for december 15 , was an attempt to reduce media attention .
shortly after the verdict was read , khodorkovsky 's defense lawyers said they would appeal the decision .
khodorkovsky had previously said he would take the case to the european court of human rights if he was found guilty .
high-profile trial the second trial of russia 's former richest man has garnered international attention .
germany is one of several western nations that have criticized the trial .
in a visit with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov in moscow in early november , german foreign minister guido westerwelle expressed " very serious concern about the conditions of the trial proceedings . "
westerwelle added it was in russia 's best interest to take such concerns seriously .
lavrov replied that it was a matter for the court to decide .
political rivals if khodorkovsky remains behind bars through 2012 , it would keep the outspoken political opponent of prime minister vladimir putin from wielding his influence ahead of the election .
due to his stance against putin and the kremlin , khodorkovsky has become a symbol for the russian opposition and human right activists who decry his imprisonment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin called for a guilty verdict last week khodorkovsky 's original trial in 2003 was widely seen as a politically motivated event , with putin - who was president at the time - pulling the strings .
khodorkovsky had openly funded opposition parties ahead of the 2003 parliamentary elections , which did not sit well with the kremlin .
putin was in the spotlight again leading up to monday 's verdict , making an appeal on live television last week that " the thief must remain in jail . "
the verdict and sentencing in the current case are being seen as a test of the independence of the russian justice system .

they see the verdict as casting doubt on president dmitry medvedev 's pledges to modernize russia . germany and other western countries have condemned the guilty verdict pronounced by a russian court against jailed tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky on new fraud charges .
in a statement , german foreign minister guido westerwelle called the verdict " a step backward " for russia .
westerwelle said that the way the trial was conducted was " very dubious " and called on russia to " stand up for the rule of law , democracy and human rights . "
german human rights commissioner markus loening found even stronger words to condemn the verdict , telling the dpa news agency that he was " outraged . "
" the judgment throws no good light on circumstances in russia , " he said .
loening described the verdict as " a crass misinterpretation of what happened in court . "
' russia must respect human rights commitments ' chief european union diplomat catherine ashton called on russia " to respect its international commitments in the field of human rights and the rule of law . "
she said the eu would " continue to follow developments very closely , including the forthcoming announcement of the sentence . "
across the atlantic , united states secretary of state hillary clinton said the verdict raised " serious questions about selective prosecution - and about the rule of law being overshadowed by political considerations . "
clinton also warned in a statement that " this and similar cases have a negative impact on russia 's reputation for fulfilling its international human rights obligations and improving its investment climate . "

the tycoon has been an outspoken opponent of former president and current prime minister vladimir putin , openly funding opposition parties ahead of 2003 parliamentary elections .
khodorkovsky 's original trial in 2003 was widely seen as having been orchestrated by putin .
if khodorkovsky remains in jail through 2012 , it will prevent him from wielding his influence ahead of the election scheduled in that year .
the current case has been seen as a test of the independence of the russian justice system .
but monday 's conviction sheds grave doubts on president dmitry medvedev 's vows to modernize russia and take it out of putin 's shadow .

it was hoped the strike would help convince incumbent president gbagbo to step down . a call for a general strike in ivory coast to pressure incumbent president laurent gbagbo into conceding power have failed to take hold .
in the country 's biggest city , abidjan , business largely went on as usual . the general strike was called for on sunday by supporters of alassane ouattara , the internationally recognized winner of ivory coast 's november presidential election . despite the united nations , the european union , the african union and the economic community of west african states -lrb- ecowas -rrb- all recognizing ouattara as the winner of the november 28 election , gbagbo continues to refuse to step down .
he says the election was rigged and was part of a plot against him orchestrated by france and the united states . the failed strike comes a day ahead of a trip to ivory coast by three ecowas leaders - the presidents of benin , sierra leone and cape verde - to try and personally convince gbagbo to step down .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 27.12.2010 german police union urges ban of far-right npd großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banning the npd has proved to be tricky seven years after the german government failed in an attempt to ban a far-right party , calls have become louder for renewed efforts to outlaw a party that is under observation of the federal intelligence agency . germany 's police union gdp and the central council of jews in germany have appealed for renewed efforts to ban the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , a fringe group with no federal-level representation , but with seats in two of germany 's 16 state parliaments .
" from my own and a police point of view , i urge and support a ban , " police union head bernhard witthaut told deutsche welle .
" i think it 's terrible how they mock foreigners living in germany , i think their concept of a state is terrible . "
witthaut was not alone in his comments .
the president of the central council of jews in germany , dieter graumann , said in an interview over the weekend that the npd , which currently has an estimated 7,000 members , had clearly set itself the goal of destroying democracy in germany .
the country must resist such attempts , he said , if necessary by issuing a ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernhard witthaut said a new court case must be well prepared the head of the turkish community in germany , kenan kolat , urged a more consistent prosecution of xenophobic attacks in germany .
banning the npd , he told the news agency dapd , could also " have a positive effect in the fight against right-wing extremism and racism . " the german government attempted to ban the npd in a case heard by the country 's highest court , the constitutional court , in 2001 .
but the case was thrown out two years later after it was disclosed that several people in the npd 's inner circle were german secret service undercover agents or informants .
signal in the fight against far-right extremism the police union 's witthaut said that some people in law enforcement believed it would be easier to deal with the far-right party if you knew how it operated and where it was active , whereas if the party were to go underground , it would be much more difficult to keep an eye on its activities . but he said he was convinced that outlawing a party listed as racist , anti-semitic and revisionist by germany 's domestic intelligence agency would be " an important signal in the fight against right-wing extremism . "
" many might view the risk of a renewed failure before germany 's highest court as such a grave aspect that they might dismiss steps in that direction , " bavaria 's interior minister joachim herrmann said on monday .
but he added that banning the npd was desirable , and he would continue to lobby for a ban of the party .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 27.12.2010 german government advisor backs eurobonds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians hope to stabilize the euro in 2011 a leading german economist has said that the euro can be stabilized by issuing loans at a set interest rate for the whole eurozone .
but the german government continues to oppose the idea . the debate about issuing so called eurobonds , or e-bonds , - loans with common interest rates across the eurozone - was ignited again on monday when professor peter bofinger , a member of the german government 's panel of independent economic advisors , said that the bonds would stabilize the eurozone .
" issuing eurobonds would make it clear that the countries in europe will remain solvent , and that it 's just no longer possible to push some countries into a corner and burden these countries with extremely high interest , " bofinger said in an interview with german broadcaster deutschland radio .
eurobonds would be issued to all eurozone countries with the same interest rate , allowing those in financial difficulties to benefit from the collective strength of the bloc .
germany and france , countries which enjoy relatively good reputations as debtors , oppose e-bonds .
in a speech to the german parliament last week , chancellor angela merkel laid out her criticism of the idea .
" it 's really important that we do n't make the mistake of collectivizing risks , which would happen with eurobonds , " she said .
" this is absolutely not a solution .
the solution is more harmony and more competitiveness in the eu member states and especially in the eurozone . "
disagreement over costs at the moment , germany borrows at a rate of 1.73 percent , but the average borrowing rate across the eurozone is slightly above 3 percent .
some economists say that if eurobonds were introduced , germany would end up paying more interest .
" there will be a substantial loss of reputation for germany , and germany will have to pay more debt for -lsb- its -rsb- interest , " markus kerber , a professor of economics at berlin 's technical university , told deutsche welle .
a eurozone bond could cost germany 17 billion euros -lrb- $ 22 billion -rrb- more each year , the german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bofinger thinks eurobonds will bring stability but bofinger thinks the assumption is flawed that the eurobonds ' interest rate would reflect the average national interest rates of individual states .
" the interest is so high in some countries because the risk of default is seen as being so high , " bofinger said .
" with a eurobond , the likelihood of a country defaulting is highly unlikely , and so i think it would have much lower interest rates than the average . "
bofinger also said that issuing eurobonds would be a good way of recognizing the austerity measures that are being implemented .
" one has to acknowledge what is being done in greece , portugal , ireland and spain .
these countries , which have really implemented very tough measures to try to stabilize the situation , they would be rewarded by allowing them access to financing with low interest rates , " bofinger said .
opponents say a collective eurozone debt pool would weaken economic competitiveness , because countries like germany , which has a very good reputation as a debtor , would share a credit rating with countries that , according kerber , do n't deserve the same rating .
tarnishing reputations " reputation is the result of challenging the markets .
if we abolish that system , we make it an anti-market system .
we make it an anti-meritocratic system and we give reputation and advantages in terms of interest to countries that do n't deserve it , " said kerber .
distorting competition in this way would destabilize the eurozone in the long term , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel does n't believe in collectivizing risk " i can not understand professor bofinger 's reasoning .
why should non-market conditions for raising funds for fragile countries stabilize the euro ? "
kerber said .
" in the long run , if you distort competition , the system will break down .
there will be a collapse and that collapse will bring down the euro . "
german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble has n't been as vehement in his opposition to eurobonds as merkel , but he has said that there should to be more political and fiscal integration before they are introduced .
this would mean harmonizing national sacred cows like taxes , retirement policy and labor market legislation .
with a string of important state elections coming up in germany in 2011 , it seems unlikely that merkel will do an about-turn on the issue of eurobonds , which could be unpopular with the german electorate .

but the german government continues to oppose the idea . the debate about issuing so called eurobonds , or e-bonds , - loans with common interest rates across the eurozone - was ignited again on monday when professor peter bofinger , a member of the german government 's panel of independent economic advisors , said that the bonds would stabilize the eurozone .
" issuing eurobonds would make it clear that the countries in europe will remain solvent , and that it 's just no longer possible to push some countries into a corner and burden these countries with extremely high interest , " bofinger said in an interview with german broadcaster deutschland radio .
eurobonds would be issued to all eurozone countries with the same interest rate , allowing those in financial difficulties to benefit from the collective strength of the bloc .
germany and france , countries which enjoy relatively good reputations as debtors , oppose e-bonds .
in a speech to the german parliament last week , chancellor angela merkel laid out her criticism of the idea .
" it 's really important that we do n't make the mistake of collectivizing risks , which would happen with eurobonds , " she said .
" this is absolutely not a solution .
the solution is more harmony and more competitiveness in the eu member states and especially in the eurozone . "
disagreement over costs at the moment , germany borrows at a rate of 1.73 percent , but the average borrowing rate across the eurozone is slightly above 3 percent .
some economists say that if eurobonds were introduced , germany would end up paying more interest .
" there will be a substantial loss of reputation for germany , and germany will have to pay more debt for -lsb- its -rsb- interest , " markus kerber , a professor of economics at berlin 's technical university , told deutsche welle .
a eurozone bond could cost germany 17 billion euros -lrb- $ 22 billion -rrb- more each year , the german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bofinger thinks eurobonds will bring stability but bofinger thinks the assumption is flawed that the eurobonds ' interest rate would reflect the average national interest rates of individual states .
" the interest is so high in some countries because the risk of default is seen as being so high , " bofinger said .
" with a eurobond , the likelihood of a country defaulting is highly unlikely , and so i think it would have much lower interest rates than the average . "
bofinger also said that issuing eurobonds would be a good way of recognizing the austerity measures that are being implemented .
" one has to acknowledge what is being done in greece , portugal , ireland and spain .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 27.12.2010 german police union urges ban of far-right npd großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banning the npd has proved to be tricky seven years after the german government failed in an attempt to ban a far-right party , calls have become louder for renewed efforts to outlaw a party that is under observation of the federal intelligence agency . germany 's police union gdp and the central council of jews in germany have appealed for renewed efforts to ban the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , a fringe group with no federal-level representation , but with seats in two of germany 's 16 state parliaments .
" from my own and a police point of view , i urge and support a ban , " police union head bernhard witthaut told deutsche welle .
" i think it 's terrible how they mock foreigners living in germany , i think their concept of a state is terrible . "
witthaut was not alone in his comments .
the president of the central council of jews in germany , dieter graumann , said in an interview over the weekend that the npd , which currently has an estimated 7,000 members , had clearly set itself the goal of destroying democracy in germany .
the country must resist such attempts , he said , if necessary by issuing a ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernhard witthaut said a new court case must be well prepared the head of the turkish community in germany , kenan kolat , urged a more consistent prosecution of xenophobic attacks in germany .
banning the npd , he told the news agency dapd , could also " have a positive effect in the fight against right-wing extremism and racism . " the german government attempted to ban the npd in a case heard by the country 's highest court , the constitutional court , in 2001 .
but the case was thrown out two years later after it was disclosed that several people in the npd 's inner circle were german secret service undercover agents or informants .
signal in the fight against far-right extremism the police union 's witthaut said that some people in law enforcement believed it would be easier to deal with the far-right party if you knew how it operated and where it was active , whereas if the party were to go underground , it would be much more difficult to keep an eye on its activities . but he said he was convinced that outlawing a party listed as racist , anti-semitic and revisionist by germany 's domestic intelligence agency would be " an important signal in the fight against right-wing extremism . "
" many might view the risk of a renewed failure before germany 's highest court as such a grave aspect that they might dismiss steps in that direction , " bavaria 's interior minister joachim herrmann said on monday .
but he added that banning the npd was desirable , and he would continue to lobby for a ban of the party .

they see the verdict as casting doubt on president dmitry medvedev 's pledges to modernize russia . germany and other western countries have condemned the guilty verdict pronounced by a russian court against jailed tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky on new fraud charges .
in a statement , german foreign minister guido westerwelle called the verdict " a step backward " for russia .
westerwelle said that the way the trial was conducted was " very dubious " and called on russia to " stand up for the rule of law , democracy and human rights . "
german human rights commissioner markus loening found even stronger words to condemn the verdict , telling the dpa news agency that he was " outraged . "
" the judgment throws no good light on circumstances in russia , " he said .
loening described the verdict as " a crass misinterpretation of what happened in court . "
' russia must respect human rights commitments ' chief european union diplomat catherine ashton called on russia " to respect its international commitments in the field of human rights and the rule of law . "
she said the eu would " continue to follow developments very closely , including the forthcoming announcement of the sentence . "
across the atlantic , united states secretary of state hillary clinton said the verdict raised " serious questions about selective prosecution - and about the rule of law being overshadowed by political considerations . "
clinton also warned in a statement that " this and similar cases have a negative impact on russia 's reputation for fulfilling its international human rights obligations and improving its investment climate . "
embezzlement charges khodorkovsky was found guilty of embezzlement for stealing and reselling over 200 tons of oil from wells he previously owned as head of the yukos oil company .
his business partner and co-defendant platon lebedev was also found guilty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khodorkovsky 's supporters see him as a symbol for democratic struggle khodorkovsky is currently serving an eight-year prison sentence for tax evasion .
his release was scheduled for 2011 .
sentencing in the current case is expected in the next few days .
the prosecution is seeking a six-year jail term .
shortly after the verdict was read , khodorkovsky 's defense lawyers said they would appeal the decision .
khodorkovsky had previously said he would take the case to the european court of human rights if he was found guilty .
orchestrated by putin ?
khodorkovsky and his lawyers say the charges against him are politically motivated .
the tycoon has been an outspoken opponent of former president and current prime minister vladimir putin , openly funding opposition parties ahead of 2003 parliamentary elections .
khodorkovsky 's original trial in 2003 was widely seen as having been orchestrated by putin .
if khodorkovsky remains in jail through 2012 , it will prevent him from wielding his influence ahead of the election scheduled in that year .
the current case has been seen as a test of the independence of the russian justice system .
but monday 's conviction sheds grave doubts on president dmitry medvedev 's vows to modernize russia and take it out of putin 's shadow .

it has found some unusual ways of doing this . tallinn is preparing for its moment in the spotlight as the european capital of culture 2011 . over 250 different events and festivals have been planned for the coming year that center on the motto , " stories of the seashore , " which hints at estonian history and reflects tallinn ’ s location next to the sea . according to maris hellrand , spokeswoman for the tallinn 2011 organizational committee , the relationship between tallinn and the sea is of particular importance .
until the end of the soviet union 's reign over estonia , which ended in 1991 , the city 's shores were a restricted military zone .
the soldiers are no longer there today , but access to the sea is still largely obstructed .
this is set to change in 2011 . " at the moment , there 's still an old jail at the seashore , " said hellrand .
" we want to transform the seaside promenade in front of it into a ' culture kilometer . " ' the culture kilometer is the planned heart for the year 's celebrations , with most of the tallinn 2011 events taking place there . unusual attractions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the event planners have many unusual ideas estonia , which is due to join the euro currency zone on january 1 , wants to present itself as a modern european country in 2011 .
this image allows for some breaks with tradition , such as the film project " 60 seconds of solitude in the year zero . "
according to its initiator indrek kasela , it is " a declaration of love to the cinema . " " we asked film directors from around the world to produce one-minute clips on the topic of solitude , " said kasela .
" they will be put together into a one-hour film . " the film is due to be screened in august - not at a movie theater but on a large screen mounted in the sea .
the audience will be able to see it from the shore and watch as it bursts into flames together with the film reel at the end of the screening .
as only one copy of the film reel will be produced , the event will be unique in the truest sense of the word . another project offers more long-term entertainment .
planned for may , " mim goes sustainable " is a mixture of performance and theater - but with a twist .
it involves audience members producing electricity for the stage lighting by pedaling on indoor bikes .
in this way , they help create a stage show that does not depend on fossil fuels . a look into the estonian soul the creators of tallinn 2011 hope to combine the future with tradition .
the youth song and dance celebration festival aims to exemplify that combination and will serve as one of the main capital of culture events . choral singing is an important tradition in estonia 's history , having played a key role in the singing revolution - a series of spontaneous mass-singing demonstrations that took place between 1987 and 1991 to help bring about estonia 's independence from the soviet union . in 2011 , thousands are expected to gather at the tallinn song festival grounds for several days in a special commemoration the 20th anniversary of independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many will sing again at the city 's song festival grounds " this festival is an opportunity to get a glimpse into the estonian soul within one weekend , " said hellrand .
" this is what we are .
this is why we are . " another highlight will be the tallinn maritime days , july 15 to 17 , hailed as the largest free family event in estonia .
a new exhibition will open at the estonian maritime museum in the renovated hangars of the former seaplane port .
walkers will also be able to enjoy the newly opened seaside promenade . in late december , a closing ceremony will be held in the center of the city .
combining tradition and modern technology , church tower bells will ring out over the old town , playing a tune composed especially for the occasion .
they will remind all those who hear them of tallinn 's cultural treasures , while at the same time allowing the city to take a final bow as the european capital of culture . author : friedel taube -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : greg wiser send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the british-made satellite will have a throughput of 70 gigabits per second . on monday , a british-made satellite was launched in kazakhstan , becoming the second european spacecraft devoted to beaming down high-speed internet connectivity .
the ka-sat is designed to provide tens of millions of europeans , especially those living in rural areas , with faster access to the internet .
ka-sat has a total throughput of some 70 gigabits per second , however typically satellite internet access costs much more than dsl or cable modem service .
the new satellite will cover a large swath of europe , ranging from north africa to southern scandinavia , and touching into the edges of the middle east .
" ka-sat will be the cornerstone of a breakthrough infrastructure deployed by eutelsat for users across europe and the mediterranean basin , " said michel de rosen , the chief executive of eutelsat , in a statement .
eutelsat is the company that will operate the satellite .
" by combining a satellite equipped with more than 80 spotbeams and a network of ground stations , this new program will deliver more capacity than any other satellite program deployed worldwide . "
the company also said that commercial internet service will begin in may 2011 .

the verdict in khodorkovsky 's second trial could keep him behind bars for several more years . mikhail khodorkovsky has been found guilty of embezzlement for stealing and reselling over 200 tons of oil from wells he previously owned as head of the yukos oil company .
the judge in the case , viktor danilkin , read the verdict in a moscow courtroom on monday .
khodorkovsky 's business partner and co-defendant platon lebedev was also found guilty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khodorkovsky supporters gathered outside the court monday khodorkovsky is currently serving an eight-year prison sentence for tax evasion .
sentencing in the current case is expected in the next few days .
the prosecution is seeking a six-year sentence .
the russian news agency interfax reported that journalists present in the courtroom were asked to leave by danilkin just after the guilty decision was read .
the entire verdict could take several days to read .
observers have speculated that a date change in the verdict reading , originally scheduled for december 15 , was an attempt to reduce media attention .
shortly after the verdict was read , khodorkovsky 's defense lawyers said they would appeal the decision .
khodorkovsky had previously said he would take the case to the european court of human rights if he was found guilty .
high-profile trial the second trial of russia 's former richest man has garnered international attention .
germany is one of several western nations that have criticized the trial .
in a visit with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov in moscow in early november , german foreign minister guido westerwelle expressed " very serious concern about the conditions of the trial proceedings . "
westerwelle added it was in russia 's best interest to take such concerns seriously .
lavrov replied that it was a matter for the court to decide .
political rivals if khodorkovsky remains behind bars through 2012 , it would keep the outspoken political opponent of prime minister vladimir putin from wielding his influence ahead of the election .
due to his stance against putin and the kremlin , khodorkovsky has become a symbol for the russian opposition and human right activists who decry his imprisonment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin called for a guilty verdict last week khodorkovsky 's original trial in 2003 was widely seen as a politically motivated event , with putin - who was president at the time - pulling the strings .
khodorkovsky had openly funded opposition parties ahead of the 2003 parliamentary elections , which did not sit well with the kremlin .
putin was in the spotlight again leading up to monday 's verdict , making an appeal on live television last week that " the thief must remain in jail . "
the verdict and sentencing in the current case are being seen as a test of the independence of the russian justice system .

it has found some unusual ways of doing this . tallinn is preparing for its moment in the spotlight as the european capital of culture 2011 . over 250 different events and festivals have been planned for the coming year that center on the motto , " stories of the seashore , " which hints at estonian history and reflects tallinn ’ s location next to the sea . according to maris hellrand , spokeswoman for the tallinn 2011 organizational committee , the relationship between tallinn and the sea is of particular importance .
until the end of the soviet union 's reign over estonia , which ended in 1991 , the city 's shores were a restricted military zone .
the soldiers are no longer there today , but access to the sea is still largely obstructed .
this is set to change in 2011 . " at the moment , there 's still an old jail at the seashore , " said hellrand .
" we want to transform the seaside promenade in front of it into a ' culture kilometer . " ' the culture kilometer is the planned heart for the year 's celebrations , with most of the tallinn 2011 events taking place there . unusual attractions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the event planners have many unusual ideas estonia , which is due to join the euro currency zone on january 1 , wants to present itself as a modern european country in 2011 .
this image allows for some breaks with tradition , such as the film project " 60 seconds of solitude in the year zero . "
according to its initiator indrek kasela , it is " a declaration of love to the cinema . " " we asked film directors from around the world to produce one-minute clips on the topic of solitude , " said kasela .
" they will be put together into a one-hour film . " the film is due to be screened in august - not at a movie theater but on a large screen mounted in the sea .
the audience will be able to see it from the shore and watch as it bursts into flames together with the film reel at the end of the screening .
as only one copy of the film reel will be produced , the event will be unique in the truest sense of the word . another project offers more long-term entertainment .
planned for may , " mim goes sustainable " is a mixture of performance and theater - but with a twist .
it involves audience members producing electricity for the stage lighting by pedaling on indoor bikes .
in this way , they help create a stage show that does not depend on fossil fuels . a look into the estonian soul the creators of tallinn 2011 hope to combine the future with tradition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 27.12.2010 new elections may be ahead as a tumultuous year ends in thailand großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations and violence marked the year 2010 in thailand 's capital city thailand has faced its most turbulent year in politics in over two decades as mass anti-government rallies gripped the capital .
efforts to reconcile competing political groups remain the main challenge . thailand ’ s anti-government protest rallies led by the united front for democracy against dictatorship or udd led to a major political confrontation lasting two months between march and may .
the udd , also known as red shirts , supports former prime minister thaksin shinawatra , who was deposed in a 2006 coup and forced to live overseas .
udd leaders hoped to topple prime minister abhisit vejjajiva ’ s government and refused government offers of early elections .
after the military cleared the protest site at the commercial area of rajaprasong in central bangkok , 92 people had died and almost 2,000 had been injured – both civilians and soldiers – in the worst political violence in 20 years .
up to 400 people remain in jail , including udd leaders charged with terrorism offenses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thai soldiers were a constant presence in bangkok in 2010 change has started , but not finished yet chris baker , an author and commentator on thai politics says 2010 marked a shift in thailand ’ s political landscape .
he says it has been a very tumultous year and , " it ’ s been a year that in retrospect i think will be seen as the year of great change – but of change that has started but not really finished yet .
the politics have really changed quite a lot – the mass of people who came into bangkok were something really very , very new and quite surprising . "
the protests highlighted deep divisions in thai society .
many analysts say they first came to the fore with thaksin , who has relied on the poor , rural voters .
many of them supported him for his populist policies as prime minister .
bildunterschrift : former thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra baker says more people now feel they have a stake in national politics .
but he also warns that many in the governing class and elite feel the situation has returned to normal .
this view , he says , is set to lead to problems in the future .
reconciliation efforts the government established several committees investigating the violence .
human rights lawyer somchai homla-or is a member of the truth for reconciliation commission and is optimistic .
" we have found that the prime minister himself always responds positively to what we recommend and what we ask for .
now we get more support from udd leaders and udd members too .
i believe the majority of them do not want to use violence and they have the same position to strengthen our democracy . "
in a nationally televised address on christmas eve , prime minister abhisit vejjajiva set the ground for national elections highlighting the government ’ s achievements since 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thai prime minister abhisit vejjajiva is ready to call a new election he spoke of rising economic growth , expanded trade , higher agriculture prices and education and social reforms .
government spokesman panitan wattanayagorn sees an election coming and says , " the prime minister is very clear .
he is sending out a signal to the thai people to be ready . "
wattanayagorn says the remaining factor will be how to guarantee a peaceful and stable election .
" if we can do that – if we go to the polls without having a bloody election , a very confrontational election – the prime minister said he is ready to call a new election . "
red shirt leaders say they will press ahead with protests but they will remain peaceful .
for its part , the government recently lifted the state of emergency in bangkok and surrounding provinces .

consumer affairs minister aigner has called the new devices a privacy threat . they fly , take pictures , can be operated remotely and even come with an auto-pilot feature to land safely in case their owner gets distracted . the flying miniature drones are marketed as the ar.drone by wireless device manufacturer parrot and have been available in german electronics stores since summer 2010 . but some german politicians are concerned about privacy issues relating to the toys priced at 299 euros -lrb- $ 393 -rrb- and steered by devices like the iphone and ipad . " even just by using the small , helicopter-like hobby models , people can quickly go beyond the limits of the law , " said ilse aigner , germany 's consumer affairs minister , in an interview with the deutsche presse agentur . for example , if hobbyists or children fly the ar.drone onto neighbors ' property and capture images of them in their home without their permission , the photographs could already stand in violation of data privacy laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilse aigner believes in caution as drones become more widespread among civilians legal grey zone laws currently exist that require clearance for launching unmanned flying objects similar to the ar.drone , but they do not address devices of its size .
currently , objects that weigh less than five kilograms -lrb- 11 pounds -rrb- , do not reach an altitude of more than 30 meters and are not used commercially are not in need of clearance . " exactly where the line is between illegal and legal uses of these cameras remains a question of legal interpretation , " a spokesman from the federal ministry of food , agriculture and consumer protection told deutsche welle . " there is no law that states in clear terms how these devices are permitted to be used , so it 's a new legal issue , " he added . while everyday street-level photographs generated by the objects are likely unproblematic , the question remains open as to exactly which uses are prohibited under current laws . bildunterschrift : german police have used pricier , more sophisticated drones to get evidence and manage deployment smaller and cheaper politicians from the left party in germany have called for legal limits on using the drone cameras , citing concerns about the future as similar devices become smaller , cheaper and more available . " as the technology becomes cheaper , it 's also going to be used more broadly , " said jan korte , a data protection expert within the party , in an interview with the deutsche presse agentur . " people should not be able to use the drones to pry into the private sphere of others . " but there is not yet widespread discussion about changing federal laws to deal more clearly with the legal issues raised by cameras like the ar.drone , said a representative of the federal commission for data protection and freedom of information , which advises the parliament on privacy issues . author : greg wiser editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : 2011 european capitals of culture culture capital turku highlights links between art and health ruhr2010 boasts successful culture capital program cities -pipe- 27.12.2010 tallinn to unveil its treasures as european capital of culture 2011 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rich in history , tallinn 's old town is a unesco world heritage site with its " stories of the sea , " estonia 's capital is preparing to reveal various aspects of its history and culture to the world .
it has found some unusual ways of doing this . tallinn is preparing for its moment in the spotlight as the european capital of culture 2011 . over 250 different events and festivals have been planned for the coming year that center on the motto , " stories of the seashore , " which hints at estonian history and reflects tallinn ’ s location next to the sea . according to maris hellrand , spokeswoman for the tallinn 2011 organizational committee , the relationship between tallinn and the sea is of particular importance .
until the end of the soviet union 's reign over estonia , which ended in 1991 , the city 's shores were a restricted military zone .
the soldiers are no longer there today , but access to the sea is still largely obstructed .
this is set to change in 2011 . " at the moment , there 's still an old jail at the seashore , " said hellrand .
" we want to transform the seaside promenade in front of it into a ' culture kilometer . " ' the culture kilometer is the planned heart for the year 's celebrations , with most of the tallinn 2011 events taking place there . unusual attractions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the event planners have many unusual ideas estonia , which is due to join the euro currency zone on january 1 , wants to present itself as a modern european country in 2011 .
this image allows for some breaks with tradition , such as the film project " 60 seconds of solitude in the year zero . "
according to its initiator indrek kasela , it is " a declaration of love to the cinema . " " we asked film directors from around the world to produce one-minute clips on the topic of solitude , " said kasela .
" they will be put together into a one-hour film . " the film is due to be screened in august - not at a movie theater but on a large screen mounted in the sea .
the audience will be able to see it from the shore and watch as it bursts into flames together with the film reel at the end of the screening .
as only one copy of the film reel will be produced , the event will be unique in the truest sense of the word . another project offers more long-term entertainment .
planned for may , " mim goes sustainable " is a mixture of performance and theater - but with a twist .
it involves audience members producing electricity for the stage lighting by pedaling on indoor bikes .
in this way , they help create a stage show that does not depend on fossil fuels . a look into the estonian soul the creators of tallinn 2011 hope to combine the future with tradition .
the youth song and dance celebration festival aims to exemplify that combination and will serve as one of the main capital of culture events . choral singing is an important tradition in estonia 's history , having played a key role in the singing revolution - a series of spontaneous mass-singing demonstrations that took place between 1987 and 1991 to help bring about estonia 's independence from the soviet union . in 2011 , thousands are expected to gather at the tallinn song festival grounds for several days in a special commemoration the 20th anniversary of independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many will sing again at the city 's song festival grounds " this festival is an opportunity to get a glimpse into the estonian soul within one weekend , " said hellrand .
" this is what we are .
this is why we are . " another highlight will be the tallinn maritime days , july 15 to 17 , hailed as the largest free family event in estonia .
a new exhibition will open at the estonian maritime museum in the renovated hangars of the former seaplane port .
walkers will also be able to enjoy the newly opened seaside promenade . in late december , a closing ceremony will be held in the center of the city .
combining tradition and modern technology , church tower bells will ring out over the old town , playing a tune composed especially for the occasion .
they will remind all those who hear them of tallinn 's cultural treasures , while at the same time allowing the city to take a final bow as the european capital of culture . author : friedel taube -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : greg wiser send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it has found some unusual ways of doing this . tallinn is preparing for its moment in the spotlight as the european capital of culture 2011 . over 250 different events and festivals have been planned for the coming year that center on the motto , " stories of the seashore , " which hints at estonian history and reflects tallinn ’ s location next to the sea . according to maris hellrand , spokeswoman for the tallinn 2011 organizational committee , the relationship between tallinn and the sea is of particular importance .
until the end of the soviet union 's reign over estonia , which ended in 1991 , the city 's shores were a restricted military zone .
the soldiers are no longer there today , but access to the sea is still largely obstructed .
this is set to change in 2011 . " at the moment , there 's still an old jail at the seashore , " said hellrand .
" we want to transform the seaside promenade in front of it into a ' culture kilometer . " ' the culture kilometer is the planned heart for the year 's celebrations , with most of the tallinn 2011 events taking place there . unusual attractions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the event planners have many unusual ideas estonia , which is due to join the euro currency zone on january 1 , wants to present itself as a modern european country in 2011 .
this image allows for some breaks with tradition , such as the film project " 60 seconds of solitude in the year zero . "
according to its initiator indrek kasela , it is " a declaration of love to the cinema . " " we asked film directors from around the world to produce one-minute clips on the topic of solitude , " said kasela .
" they will be put together into a one-hour film . " the film is due to be screened in august - not at a movie theater but on a large screen mounted in the sea .
the audience will be able to see it from the shore and watch as it bursts into flames together with the film reel at the end of the screening .
as only one copy of the film reel will be produced , the event will be unique in the truest sense of the word . another project offers more long-term entertainment .
planned for may , " mim goes sustainable " is a mixture of performance and theater - but with a twist .
it involves audience members producing electricity for the stage lighting by pedaling on indoor bikes .
in this way , they help create a stage show that does not depend on fossil fuels . a look into the estonian soul the creators of tallinn 2011 hope to combine the future with tradition .
the youth song and dance celebration festival aims to exemplify that combination and will serve as one of the main capital of culture events . choral singing is an important tradition in estonia 's history , having played a key role in the singing revolution - a series of spontaneous mass-singing demonstrations that took place between 1987 and 1991 to help bring about estonia 's independence from the soviet union . in 2011 , thousands are expected to gather at the tallinn song festival grounds for several days in a special commemoration the 20th anniversary of independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many will sing again at the city 's song festival grounds " this festival is an opportunity to get a glimpse into the estonian soul within one weekend , " said hellrand .
" this is what we are .
this is why we are . " another highlight will be the tallinn maritime days , july 15 to 17 , hailed as the largest free family event in estonia .
a new exhibition will open at the estonian maritime museum in the renovated hangars of the former seaplane port .
walkers will also be able to enjoy the newly opened seaside promenade . in late december , a closing ceremony will be held in the center of the city .
combining tradition and modern technology , church tower bells will ring out over the old town , playing a tune composed especially for the occasion .
they will remind all those who hear them of tallinn 's cultural treasures , while at the same time allowing the city to take a final bow as the european capital of culture . author : friedel taube -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : greg wiser send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 27.12.2010 south korean president calls for national unity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korean president lee myung-bak calling for national unity , south korea 's president lee myung-bak has affirmed his resolve to counter any further provocation by north korea . about a month after an attack on a south korean island by north korean artillery , south korean president lee myung-bak warned against attempts to split the south korean population .
ever since the incident , there has been an escalation in tensions and warnings issued by both countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newly appointed south korean defense minister kim kwan-jin lee has called on his country to be united in the current confrontation with the north .
in a national radio address on monday , he said as south korea faces a national security threat , " our country can not afford internal divisions , because what is at stake is our very lives and the survival of this nation . "
lessons learned the president affirmed that south korea still wanted peaceful reunification with the north .
but he also cautioned citizens not to be afraid of a military conflict : " if we are afraid of war , we wo n't be able to prevent it .
only if we are determined to bravely confront any risk , will we be able to ward off all dangers . "
south korea 's president also emphasized that he had learned important lessons from the north korean shelling of yeonpyeong island , which killed four people last month .
" so far , the south has been showing a lot of patience to maintain peace .
but we know that war can only be prevented and peace can only be ensured if we meet the north 's provocations with zero tolerance . "
bildunterschrift : smoke billows from yeonpyeong after the north shelled the island zero tolerance with this , the president repeated last week 's warnings that seoul would strike back from now on .
lee myung-bak and the army had been attacked by critics for reacting too passively to the yeonpyeong attack .
the defense minister resigned as a consequence .
in his speech , the conservative president indirectly also targeted the liberal opposition .
the discussions within south korea after the sinking of the naval ship cheonan in march had encouraged north korea and prepared the ground for the attack on yeonpyeong , lee argued .
south korean politicians , scientists and journalists had cast doubts on the results of an international investigation that had blamed a north korean torpedo for the sinking of the cheonan , in which 46 south korean sailors were killed .
pyongyang has rejected all accusations over the sinking of the cheonan .
moreover , north korea has justified its attack on the south korean island as a retaliatory measure , arguing that south korea attacked north korean territory first by holding a naval exercise in the disputed waters surrounding yeonpyeong island , which is very close to the north korean mainland .
north korea does not recognize the naval border which was fixed by the united nations after the end of the korean war in 1953 .
pyongyang calls for a border further to the south .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korea has vowed zero tolerance toward the north south korea has staged a series of military exercises since the yeonpyeong shelling , including one with the united states .
despite issuing threats of a " sacred war " , the north has not reacted with more attacks , leading many observers to believe that pyongyang wants to avoid all-out war .
seoul has announced more drills for this week .

its repercussions could be widespread , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . the guilty verdict in the trial of the former yukos owner mikhail khodorkovsky and his business partner , platon lebedev , comes as no surprise .
this was far from a free and fair trial , instead it was politically motivated .
sentencing has not yet been handed down but it 's expected that the two men will be jailed until at least 2012 - the year of the presidential elections - if not until 2017 .
many observers say that the former president and current prime minister , vladimir putin , was the driving force behind the guilty verdict . khodorkovsky was first jailed on tax evasion charges in 2003 and many believe that putin wanted to punish khodorkovsky for his perceived meddling in russian politics and his anti-putin stance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel , head of dw 's russian service in the run-up to the current verdict , putin publicly called for a guilty verdict , describing khodorkovsky as a thief .
politically , not the best of moves , considering that moscow was so keen to give the impression of a fair and independent trial .
president dmitry medevedev 's remarks were more circumspect when he said that no one - not even a president or any other high-ranking official , like putin - should comment on the current legal proceedings .
no doubt medvedev was already thinking of the political implications of a guilty verdict .
the questionable legal proceedings have dealt his reform and modernization efforts a heavy blow , and beyond that they could affect relations with the west .
the russian leadership is seemingly unaware that any reform can only be accomplished with the necessary legal and constitutional framework , fancy pr campaigns and speeches wo n't do the trick .
indeed , the trial has reinforced the perception in the west that russia lacks many basic and constitutional rights .
however much germany , europe and the us are interested in having good ties with moscow , there is a growing feeling that a russia shaped and formed by putin can not be trusted .
no doubt us president barack obama , who managed to push through the start arms reduction treaty with russia last week , will be on the receiving end of such criticism .
the west may have readily embraced khodorkovsky and lebedev as symbols for a free , democratic and just russia .
their current treatment and the clearly politically motivated nature of their trial has now led many russians to look up to them as heros in a battle against a corrupt and arbitrary regime .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de piracy -pipe- 27.12.2010 swiss file-sharing website hires us lobbying firm großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapidshare is one of three european sites lobbying dc after being named as one of the most infringing websites , rapidshare is headed to the us capital to convince american lawmakers that it is not liable for illegal file-sharing . rapidshare , an online file-sharing site based in cham , switzerland , is under increased international scrutiny for enabling copyright infringement , as earlier this year members of the us congress named rapidshare one of the top six most infringing websites in the world .
" as you can imagine , we 're not very happy about that , " said daniel raimer , a german attorney and spokesman for rapidshare , in an interview with deutsche welle .
following the us government 's crackdown on infringing websites earlier this fall , seizing the domain names of more than 80 websites , rapidshare has found a way to reinvent itself in the american capital .
just last month , the company hired the washington , dc-based lobbying firm dutko to protect its interests abroad .
this likely makes it the first such european file-sharing company to lobby american lawmakers .
the company says its has more appointments coming up on capitol hill , and remains confident that it will get off the list by early 2011 , long before next year 's list is published .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss company only says about five percent of what is uploaded to its site is illegal only a small percentage of its files are illegal rapidshare estimates that copyrighted music and movies make up roughly five percent , or 10,000 of the 400,000 files uploaded every day .
although the site accepts and hosts every type of file , because the company takes many steps to filter out infringing files before they are posted , raimer argued that rapidshare is not the type of site the us should be going after .
" we believe that it 's unfair that we 're being put on the list , " he added .
" you ca n't just take a look at the number of infringing material that you can find on the server .
google has probably millions and millions of links to illegal files .
most people would probably agree that google is not a bad company . "
by international law rapidshare is not liable for what users upload and download , and recent german and american legal cases have upheld this notion .
the only thing that is required of rapidshare is to take down infringing files once the copyright holder tells it to .
while lobbying on behalf of foreign companies is nothing new in washington , it is new for foreign web companies to do so .
an online database of lobbying disclosures reveals that the only other european websites lobbying the us congress right now are two online gaming sites , pokerstars.net and partygaming.com.
us can exert limited power over foreign sites a new anti-piracy bill making its way through the us senate could clear the way for the government to seize more infringing domains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to most international law , rapidshare is not liable for what its users upload to the site and then download to their music players if the law passes , according to bob brauneis , professor of copyright law at george washington university in washington , dc , it could certainly impact rapidshare , despite the fact that it is not based in the united states . " dot-com companies operate around the world , but the company that controls the dot-com domain is in the united states , " he told deutsche welle .
" literally they have a computer in some room somewhere and if you flip a switch on that computer than domain name will disappear .
the information is still there in switzerland , but it 's not accessible at rapidshare.com because the link between rapidshare.com and the swiss computers has been cut . ”
the .com registry is maintained within the us and is subject to us law .
that means a court order could force the registry to freeze the domain name : rapidshare.com.
it does n't matter if rapidshare has its headquarters in switzerland or anywhere else .
while losing a domain name could temporarily impact the company 's business , changing to a new name is not a huge inconvenience .
rapidshare could just set up shop as rapidshare.ch , which is the most common suffix for swiss sites .
wikileaks , for example , used to have a .com suffix - now anyone can access that site at wikileaks.ch.
if seizing domains does n't stop copyright infringement , there is another step , brauneis added .
" the computers in switzerland are actually reached through a series of numbers called an internet protocol address , an ip address , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapidshare could avoid american law simply by changing to a swiss domain like rapidshare.ch " so everyone can spread around the world what the ip address is on those computers and they can continue to upload and download files , not a problem .
and if it turns out that after seizing a bunch of domain names , everyone is just turning to ip addresses - the ip addresses may be next . "
and it gets even more complicated from there .
data re-routing could drive up internet connection pricing " people are going to look for alternative ways of having those kind of sites available , " said peter eckersley , a digital rights advocate with the electronic frontier foundation , a non-profit organization based in san francisco .
however , he cautioned that if sites like this are forced to move offshore , then that may raise the actual cost of internet connections around the world .
" and the effect that will have is a significant increase in the amount of data that 's just moving over international fiber links , " he added .
" that will mean we 'll need to build more fiberlinks . and it 's going to make the cost of running the internet higher . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 27.12.2010 german government advisor backs eurobonds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians hope to stabilize the euro in 2011 a leading german economist has said that the euro can be stabilized by issuing loans at a set interest rate for the whole eurozone .
but the german government continues to oppose the idea . the debate about issuing so called eurobonds , or e-bonds , - loans with common interest rates across the eurozone - was ignited again on monday when professor peter bofinger , a member of the german government 's panel of independent economic advisors , said that the bonds would stabilize the eurozone .
" issuing eurobonds would make it clear that the countries in europe will remain solvent , and that it 's just no longer possible to push some countries into a corner and burden these countries with extremely high interest , " bofinger said in an interview with german broadcaster deutschland radio .
eurobonds would be issued to all eurozone countries with the same interest rate , allowing those in financial difficulties to benefit from the collective strength of the bloc .
germany and france , countries which enjoy relatively good reputations as debtors , oppose e-bonds .
in a speech to the german parliament last week , chancellor angela merkel laid out her criticism of the idea .
" it 's really important that we do n't make the mistake of collectivizing risks , which would happen with eurobonds , " she said .
" this is absolutely not a solution .
the solution is more harmony and more competitiveness in the eu member states and especially in the eurozone . "
disagreement over costs at the moment , germany borrows at a rate of 1.73 percent , but the average borrowing rate across the eurozone is slightly above 3 percent .
some economists say that if eurobonds were introduced , germany would end up paying more interest .
" there will be a substantial loss of reputation for germany , and germany will have to pay more debt for -lsb- its -rsb- interest , " markus kerber , a professor of economics at berlin 's technical university , told deutsche welle .
a eurozone bond could cost germany 17 billion euros -lrb- $ 22 billion -rrb- more each year , the german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bofinger thinks eurobonds will bring stability but bofinger thinks the assumption is flawed that the eurobonds ' interest rate would reflect the average national interest rates of individual states .
" the interest is so high in some countries because the risk of default is seen as being so high , " bofinger said .
" with a eurobond , the likelihood of a country defaulting is highly unlikely , and so i think it would have much lower interest rates than the average . "
bofinger also said that issuing eurobonds would be a good way of recognizing the austerity measures that are being implemented .
" one has to acknowledge what is being done in greece , portugal , ireland and spain .
these countries , which have really implemented very tough measures to try to stabilize the situation , they would be rewarded by allowing them access to financing with low interest rates , " bofinger said .
opponents say a collective eurozone debt pool would weaken economic competitiveness , because countries like germany , which has a very good reputation as a debtor , would share a credit rating with countries that , according kerber , do n't deserve the same rating .
tarnishing reputations " reputation is the result of challenging the markets .
if we abolish that system , we make it an anti-market system .
we make it an anti-meritocratic system and we give reputation and advantages in terms of interest to countries that do n't deserve it , " said kerber .
distorting competition in this way would destabilize the eurozone in the long term , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel does n't believe in collectivizing risk " i can not understand professor bofinger 's reasoning .
why should non-market conditions for raising funds for fragile countries stabilize the euro ? "
kerber said .
" in the long run , if you distort competition , the system will break down .
there will be a collapse and that collapse will bring down the euro . "
german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble has n't been as vehement in his opposition to eurobonds as merkel , but he has said that there should to be more political and fiscal integration before they are introduced .
this would mean harmonizing national sacred cows like taxes , retirement policy and labor market legislation .
with a string of important state elections coming up in germany in 2011 , it seems unlikely that merkel will do an about-turn on the issue of eurobonds , which could be unpopular with the german electorate .

dw-world.de opinion : heading in the right direction , but eurozone stability wo n't be easy as angela merkel tries to harmonize european economic policy , one should expect a lot more discord , according to christoph hasselbach , deutsche welle 's brussels correspondent .
a prime example is the euro bonds dispute .
-lrb- 17.12.2010 -rrb- agreement at eu summit fails to reassure markets european leaders have agreed on a permanent rescue fund to cover countries in need of financial assistance .
german chancellor merkel hailed the summit as a success , but the measure has failed to reassure the markets .
-lrb- 17.12.2010 -rrb- eurobond proposals wo n't go away chancellor merkel has dismissed calls for the eurozone to pool sovereign debt due to the high costs it would impose on germany .
but some leaders still like the idea and plan to bring it up again at this week 's eu summit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 27.12.2010 german government advisor backs eurobonds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians hope to stabilize the euro in 2011 a leading german economist has said that the euro can be stabilized by issuing loans at a set interest rate for the whole eurozone .
but the german government continues to oppose the idea . the debate about issuing so called eurobonds , or e-bonds , - loans with common interest rates across the eurozone - was ignited again on monday when professor peter bofinger , a member of the german government 's panel of independent economic advisors , said that the bonds would stabilize the eurozone .
" issuing eurobonds would make it clear that the countries in europe will remain solvent , and that it 's just no longer possible to push some countries into a corner and burden these countries with extremely high interest , " bofinger said in an interview with german broadcaster deutschland radio .
eurobonds would be issued to all eurozone countries with the same interest rate , allowing those in financial difficulties to benefit from the collective strength of the bloc .
germany and france , countries which enjoy relatively good reputations as debtors , oppose e-bonds .
in a speech to the german parliament last week , chancellor angela merkel laid out her criticism of the idea .
" it 's really important that we do n't make the mistake of collectivizing risks , which would happen with eurobonds , " she said .
" this is absolutely not a solution .
the solution is more harmony and more competitiveness in the eu member states and especially in the eurozone . "
disagreement over costs at the moment , germany borrows at a rate of 1.73 percent , but the average borrowing rate across the eurozone is slightly above 3 percent .
some economists say that if eurobonds were introduced , germany would end up paying more interest .
" there will be a substantial loss of reputation for germany , and germany will have to pay more debt for -lsb- its -rsb- interest , " markus kerber , a professor of economics at berlin 's technical university , told deutsche welle .
a eurozone bond could cost germany 17 billion euros -lrb- $ 22 billion -rrb- more each year , the german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bofinger thinks eurobonds will bring stability but bofinger thinks the assumption is flawed that the eurobonds ' interest rate would reflect the average national interest rates of individual states .
" the interest is so high in some countries because the risk of default is seen as being so high , " bofinger said .
" with a eurobond , the likelihood of a country defaulting is highly unlikely , and so i think it would have much lower interest rates than the average . "
bofinger also said that issuing eurobonds would be a good way of recognizing the austerity measures that are being implemented .
" one has to acknowledge what is being done in greece , portugal , ireland and spain .
these countries , which have really implemented very tough measures to try to stabilize the situation , they would be rewarded by allowing them access to financing with low interest rates , " bofinger said .
opponents say a collective eurozone debt pool would weaken economic competitiveness , because countries like germany , which has a very good reputation as a debtor , would share a credit rating with countries that , according kerber , do n't deserve the same rating .
tarnishing reputations " reputation is the result of challenging the markets .
if we abolish that system , we make it an anti-market system .
we make it an anti-meritocratic system and we give reputation and advantages in terms of interest to countries that do n't deserve it , " said kerber .
distorting competition in this way would destabilize the eurozone in the long term , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel does n't believe in collectivizing risk " i can not understand professor bofinger 's reasoning .
why should non-market conditions for raising funds for fragile countries stabilize the euro ? "
kerber said .
" in the long run , if you distort competition , the system will break down .
there will be a collapse and that collapse will bring down the euro . "
german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble has n't been as vehement in his opposition to eurobonds as merkel , but he has said that there should to be more political and fiscal integration before they are introduced .
this would mean harmonizing national sacred cows like taxes , retirement policy and labor market legislation .
with a string of important state elections coming up in germany in 2011 , it seems unlikely that merkel will do an about-turn on the issue of eurobonds , which could be unpopular with the german electorate .

dw-world.de opinion : heading in the right direction , but eurozone stability wo n't be easy as angela merkel tries to harmonize european economic policy , one should expect a lot more discord , according to christoph hasselbach , deutsche welle 's brussels correspondent .

the british-made satellite will have a throughput of 70 gigabits per second . on monday , a british-made satellite was launched in kazakhstan , becoming the second european spacecraft devoted to beaming down high-speed internet connectivity .
the ka-sat is designed to provide tens of millions of europeans , especially those living in rural areas , with faster access to the internet .
ka-sat has a total throughput of some 70 gigabits per second , however typically satellite internet access costs much more than dsl or cable modem service .
the new satellite will cover a large swath of europe , ranging from north africa to southern scandinavia , and touching into the edges of the middle east .
" ka-sat will be the cornerstone of a breakthrough infrastructure deployed by eutelsat for users across europe and the mediterranean basin , " said michel de rosen , the chief executive of eutelsat , in a statement .
eutelsat is the company that will operate the satellite .
" by combining a satellite equipped with more than 80 spotbeams and a network of ground stations , this new program will deliver more capacity than any other satellite program deployed worldwide . "
the company also said that commercial internet service will begin in may 2011 .

the british-made satellite will have a throughput of 70 gigabits per second . on monday , a british-made satellite was launched in kazakhstan , becoming the second european spacecraft devoted to beaming down high-speed internet connectivity .
the ka-sat is designed to provide tens of millions of europeans , especially those living in rural areas , with faster access to the internet .
ka-sat has a total throughput of some 70 gigabits per second , however typically satellite internet access costs much more than dsl or cable modem service .
the new satellite will cover a large swath of europe , ranging from north africa to southern scandinavia , and touching into the edges of the middle east .
" ka-sat will be the cornerstone of a breakthrough infrastructure deployed by eutelsat for users across europe and the mediterranean basin , " said michel de rosen , the chief executive of eutelsat , in a statement .
eutelsat is the company that will operate the satellite .
" by combining a satellite equipped with more than 80 spotbeams and a network of ground stations , this new program will deliver more capacity than any other satellite program deployed worldwide . "
the company also said that commercial internet service will begin in may 2011 .

" from my own and a police point of view , i urge and support a ban , " police union head bernhard witthaut told deutsche welle .
" i think it 's terrible how they mock foreigners living in germany , i think their concept of a state is terrible . "
witthaut was not alone in his comments .
the president of the central council of jews in germany , dieter graumann , said in an interview over the weekend that the npd , which currently has an estimated 7,000 members , had clearly set itself the goal of destroying democracy in germany .
the country must resist such attempts , he said , if necessary by issuing a ban .

but the case was thrown out two years later after it was disclosed that several people in the npd 's inner circle were german secret service undercover agents or informants .
signal in the fight against far-right extremism the police union 's witthaut said that some people in law enforcement believed it would be easier to deal with the far-right party if you knew how it operated and where it was active , whereas if the party were to go underground , it would be much more difficult to keep an eye on its activities . but he said he was convinced that outlawing a party listed as racist , anti-semitic and revisionist by germany 's domestic intelligence agency would be " an important signal in the fight against right-wing extremism . "
" many might view the risk of a renewed failure before germany 's highest court as such a grave aspect that they might dismiss steps in that direction , " bavaria 's interior minister joachim herrmann said on monday .
but he added that banning the npd was desirable , and he would continue to lobby for a ban of the party .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de piracy -pipe- 27.12.2010 swiss file-sharing website hires us lobbying firm großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapidshare is one of three european sites lobbying dc after being named as one of the most infringing websites , rapidshare is headed to the us capital to convince american lawmakers that it is not liable for illegal file-sharing . rapidshare , an online file-sharing site based in cham , switzerland , is under increased international scrutiny for enabling copyright infringement , as earlier this year members of the us congress named rapidshare one of the top six most infringing websites in the world .
" as you can imagine , we 're not very happy about that , " said daniel raimer , a german attorney and spokesman for rapidshare , in an interview with deutsche welle .
following the us government 's crackdown on infringing websites earlier this fall , seizing the domain names of more than 80 websites , rapidshare has found a way to reinvent itself in the american capital .
just last month , the company hired the washington , dc-based lobbying firm dutko to protect its interests abroad .
this likely makes it the first such european file-sharing company to lobby american lawmakers .
the company says its has more appointments coming up on capitol hill , and remains confident that it will get off the list by early 2011 , long before next year 's list is published .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss company only says about five percent of what is uploaded to its site is illegal only a small percentage of its files are illegal rapidshare estimates that copyrighted music and movies make up roughly five percent , or 10,000 of the 400,000 files uploaded every day .
although the site accepts and hosts every type of file , because the company takes many steps to filter out infringing files before they are posted , raimer argued that rapidshare is not the type of site the us should be going after .
" we believe that it 's unfair that we 're being put on the list , " he added .
" you ca n't just take a look at the number of infringing material that you can find on the server .
google has probably millions and millions of links to illegal files .
most people would probably agree that google is not a bad company . "
by international law rapidshare is not liable for what users upload and download , and recent german and american legal cases have upheld this notion .
the only thing that is required of rapidshare is to take down infringing files once the copyright holder tells it to .
while lobbying on behalf of foreign companies is nothing new in washington , it is new for foreign web companies to do so .
an online database of lobbying disclosures reveals that the only other european websites lobbying the us congress right now are two online gaming sites , pokerstars.net and partygaming.com.
us can exert limited power over foreign sites a new anti-piracy bill making its way through the us senate could clear the way for the government to seize more infringing domains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to most international law , rapidshare is not liable for what its users upload to the site and then download to their music players if the law passes , according to bob brauneis , professor of copyright law at george washington university in washington , dc , it could certainly impact rapidshare , despite the fact that it is not based in the united states . " dot-com companies operate around the world , but the company that controls the dot-com domain is in the united states , " he told deutsche welle .
" literally they have a computer in some room somewhere and if you flip a switch on that computer than domain name will disappear .
the information is still there in switzerland , but it 's not accessible at rapidshare.com because the link between rapidshare.com and the swiss computers has been cut . ”
the .com registry is maintained within the us and is subject to us law .
that means a court order could force the registry to freeze the domain name : rapidshare.com.
it does n't matter if rapidshare has its headquarters in switzerland or anywhere else .
while losing a domain name could temporarily impact the company 's business , changing to a new name is not a huge inconvenience .
rapidshare could just set up shop as rapidshare.ch , which is the most common suffix for swiss sites .
wikileaks , for example , used to have a .com suffix - now anyone can access that site at wikileaks.ch.
if seizing domains does n't stop copyright infringement , there is another step , brauneis added .
" the computers in switzerland are actually reached through a series of numbers called an internet protocol address , an ip address , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapidshare could avoid american law simply by changing to a swiss domain like rapidshare.ch " so everyone can spread around the world what the ip address is on those computers and they can continue to upload and download files , not a problem .
and if it turns out that after seizing a bunch of domain names , everyone is just turning to ip addresses - the ip addresses may be next . "
and it gets even more complicated from there .
data re-routing could drive up internet connection pricing " people are going to look for alternative ways of having those kind of sites available , " said peter eckersley , a digital rights advocate with the electronic frontier foundation , a non-profit organization based in san francisco .
however , he cautioned that if sites like this are forced to move offshore , then that may raise the actual cost of internet connections around the world .
" and the effect that will have is a significant increase in the amount of data that 's just moving over international fiber links , " he added .
" that will mean we 'll need to build more fiberlinks . and it 's going to make the cost of running the internet higher . "

" as you can imagine , we 're not very happy about that , " said daniel raimer , a german attorney and spokesman for rapidshare , in an interview with deutsche welle .
following the us government 's crackdown on infringing websites earlier this fall , seizing the domain names of more than 80 websites , rapidshare has found a way to reinvent itself in the american capital .
just last month , the company hired the washington , dc-based lobbying firm dutko to protect its interests abroad .
this likely makes it the first such european file-sharing company to lobby american lawmakers .
the company says its has more appointments coming up on capitol hill , and remains confident that it will get off the list by early 2011 , long before next year 's list is published .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss company only says about five percent of what is uploaded to its site is illegal only a small percentage of its files are illegal rapidshare estimates that copyrighted music and movies make up roughly five percent , or 10,000 of the 400,000 files uploaded every day .
although the site accepts and hosts every type of file , because the company takes many steps to filter out infringing files before they are posted , raimer argued that rapidshare is not the type of site the us should be going after .
" we believe that it 's unfair that we 're being put on the list , " he added .
" you ca n't just take a look at the number of infringing material that you can find on the server .
google has probably millions and millions of links to illegal files .
most people would probably agree that google is not a bad company . "
by international law rapidshare is not liable for what users upload and download , and recent german and american legal cases have upheld this notion .
the only thing that is required of rapidshare is to take down infringing files once the copyright holder tells it to .
while lobbying on behalf of foreign companies is nothing new in washington , it is new for foreign web companies to do so .
an online database of lobbying disclosures reveals that the only other european websites lobbying the us congress right now are two online gaming sites , pokerstars.net and partygaming.com.
us can exert limited power over foreign sites a new anti-piracy bill making its way through the us senate could clear the way for the government to seize more infringing domains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to most international law , rapidshare is not liable for what its users upload to the site and then download to their music players if the law passes , according to bob brauneis , professor of copyright law at george washington university in washington , dc , it could certainly impact rapidshare , despite the fact that it is not based in the united states . " dot-com companies operate around the world , but the company that controls the dot-com domain is in the united states , " he told deutsche welle .
" literally they have a computer in some room somewhere and if you flip a switch on that computer than domain name will disappear .
the information is still there in switzerland , but it 's not accessible at rapidshare.com because the link between rapidshare.com and the swiss computers has been cut . ”
the .com registry is maintained within the us and is subject to us law .
that means a court order could force the registry to freeze the domain name : rapidshare.com.
it does n't matter if rapidshare has its headquarters in switzerland or anywhere else .
while losing a domain name could temporarily impact the company 's business , changing to a new name is not a huge inconvenience .
rapidshare could just set up shop as rapidshare.ch , which is the most common suffix for swiss sites .
wikileaks , for example , used to have a .com suffix - now anyone can access that site at wikileaks.ch.
if seizing domains does n't stop copyright infringement , there is another step , brauneis added .
" the computers in switzerland are actually reached through a series of numbers called an internet protocol address , an ip address , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapidshare could avoid american law simply by changing to a swiss domain like rapidshare.ch " so everyone can spread around the world what the ip address is on those computers and they can continue to upload and download files , not a problem .
and if it turns out that after seizing a bunch of domain names , everyone is just turning to ip addresses - the ip addresses may be next . "
and it gets even more complicated from there .
data re-routing could drive up internet connection pricing " people are going to look for alternative ways of having those kind of sites available , " said peter eckersley , a digital rights advocate with the electronic frontier foundation , a non-profit organization based in san francisco .
however , he cautioned that if sites like this are forced to move offshore , then that may raise the actual cost of internet connections around the world .
" and the effect that will have is a significant increase in the amount of data that 's just moving over international fiber links , " he added .
" that will mean we 'll need to build more fiberlinks . and it 's going to make the cost of running the internet higher . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 27.12.2010 german government advisor backs eurobonds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians hope to stabilize the euro in 2011 a leading german economist has said that the euro can be stabilized by issuing loans at a set interest rate for the whole eurozone .
but the german government continues to oppose the idea . the debate about issuing so called eurobonds , or e-bonds , - loans with common interest rates across the eurozone - was ignited again on monday when professor peter bofinger , a member of the german government 's panel of independent economic advisors , said that the bonds would stabilize the eurozone .
" issuing eurobonds would make it clear that the countries in europe will remain solvent , and that it 's just no longer possible to push some countries into a corner and burden these countries with extremely high interest , " bofinger said in an interview with german broadcaster deutschland radio .
eurobonds would be issued to all eurozone countries with the same interest rate , allowing those in financial difficulties to benefit from the collective strength of the bloc .
germany and france , countries which enjoy relatively good reputations as debtors , oppose e-bonds .
in a speech to the german parliament last week , chancellor angela merkel laid out her criticism of the idea .
" it 's really important that we do n't make the mistake of collectivizing risks , which would happen with eurobonds , " she said .
" this is absolutely not a solution .
the solution is more harmony and more competitiveness in the eu member states and especially in the eurozone . "
disagreement over costs at the moment , germany borrows at a rate of 1.73 percent , but the average borrowing rate across the eurozone is slightly above 3 percent .
some economists say that if eurobonds were introduced , germany would end up paying more interest .
" there will be a substantial loss of reputation for germany , and germany will have to pay more debt for -lsb- its -rsb- interest , " markus kerber , a professor of economics at berlin 's technical university , told deutsche welle .
a eurozone bond could cost germany 17 billion euros -lrb- $ 22 billion -rrb- more each year , the german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bofinger thinks eurobonds will bring stability but bofinger thinks the assumption is flawed that the eurobonds ' interest rate would reflect the average national interest rates of individual states .
" the interest is so high in some countries because the risk of default is seen as being so high , " bofinger said .
" with a eurobond , the likelihood of a country defaulting is highly unlikely , and so i think it would have much lower interest rates than the average . "
bofinger also said that issuing eurobonds would be a good way of recognizing the austerity measures that are being implemented .
" one has to acknowledge what is being done in greece , portugal , ireland and spain .
these countries , which have really implemented very tough measures to try to stabilize the situation , they would be rewarded by allowing them access to financing with low interest rates , " bofinger said .
opponents say a collective eurozone debt pool would weaken economic competitiveness , because countries like germany , which has a very good reputation as a debtor , would share a credit rating with countries that , according kerber , do n't deserve the same rating .
tarnishing reputations " reputation is the result of challenging the markets .
if we abolish that system , we make it an anti-market system .
we make it an anti-meritocratic system and we give reputation and advantages in terms of interest to countries that do n't deserve it , " said kerber .
distorting competition in this way would destabilize the eurozone in the long term , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel does n't believe in collectivizing risk " i can not understand professor bofinger 's reasoning .
why should non-market conditions for raising funds for fragile countries stabilize the euro ? "
kerber said .
" in the long run , if you distort competition , the system will break down .
there will be a collapse and that collapse will bring down the euro . "
german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble has n't been as vehement in his opposition to eurobonds as merkel , but he has said that there should to be more political and fiscal integration before they are introduced .
this would mean harmonizing national sacred cows like taxes , retirement policy and labor market legislation .
with a string of important state elections coming up in germany in 2011 , it seems unlikely that merkel will do an about-turn on the issue of eurobonds , which could be unpopular with the german electorate .

it has found some unusual ways of doing this . tallinn is preparing for its moment in the spotlight as the european capital of culture 2011 . over 250 different events and festivals have been planned for the coming year that center on the motto , " stories of the seashore , " which hints at estonian history and reflects tallinn ’ s location next to the sea . according to maris hellrand , spokeswoman for the tallinn 2011 organizational committee , the relationship between tallinn and the sea is of particular importance .
until the end of the soviet union 's reign over estonia , which ended in 1991 , the city 's shores were a restricted military zone .
the soldiers are no longer there today , but access to the sea is still largely obstructed .
this is set to change in 2011 . " at the moment , there 's still an old jail at the seashore , " said hellrand .
" we want to transform the seaside promenade in front of it into a ' culture kilometer . " ' the culture kilometer is the planned heart for the year 's celebrations , with most of the tallinn 2011 events taking place there . unusual attractions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the event planners have many unusual ideas estonia , which is due to join the euro currency zone on january 1 , wants to present itself as a modern european country in 2011 .
this image allows for some breaks with tradition , such as the film project " 60 seconds of solitude in the year zero . "
according to its initiator indrek kasela , it is " a declaration of love to the cinema . " " we asked film directors from around the world to produce one-minute clips on the topic of solitude , " said kasela .
" they will be put together into a one-hour film . " the film is due to be screened in august - not at a movie theater but on a large screen mounted in the sea .
the audience will be able to see it from the shore and watch as it bursts into flames together with the film reel at the end of the screening .
as only one copy of the film reel will be produced , the event will be unique in the truest sense of the word . another project offers more long-term entertainment .
planned for may , " mim goes sustainable " is a mixture of performance and theater - but with a twist .
it involves audience members producing electricity for the stage lighting by pedaling on indoor bikes .
in this way , they help create a stage show that does not depend on fossil fuels . a look into the estonian soul the creators of tallinn 2011 hope to combine the future with tradition .
the youth song and dance celebration festival aims to exemplify that combination and will serve as one of the main capital of culture events . choral singing is an important tradition in estonia 's history , having played a key role in the singing revolution - a series of spontaneous mass-singing demonstrations that took place between 1987 and 1991 to help bring about estonia 's independence from the soviet union . in 2011 , thousands are expected to gather at the tallinn song festival grounds for several days in a special commemoration the 20th anniversary of independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many will sing again at the city 's song festival grounds " this festival is an opportunity to get a glimpse into the estonian soul within one weekend , " said hellrand .
" this is what we are .
this is why we are . " another highlight will be the tallinn maritime days , july 15 to 17 , hailed as the largest free family event in estonia .
a new exhibition will open at the estonian maritime museum in the renovated hangars of the former seaplane port .
walkers will also be able to enjoy the newly opened seaside promenade . in late december , a closing ceremony will be held in the center of the city .
combining tradition and modern technology , church tower bells will ring out over the old town , playing a tune composed especially for the occasion .
they will remind all those who hear them of tallinn 's cultural treasures , while at the same time allowing the city to take a final bow as the european capital of culture . author : friedel taube -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : greg wiser send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they see the verdict as casting doubt on president dmitry medvedev 's pledges to modernize russia . germany and other western countries have condemned the guilty verdict pronounced by a russian court against jailed tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky on new fraud charges .
in a statement , german foreign minister guido westerwelle called the verdict " a step backward " for russia .
westerwelle said that the way the trial was conducted was " very dubious " and called on russia to " stand up for the rule of law , democracy and human rights . "
german human rights commissioner markus loening found even stronger words to condemn the verdict , telling the dpa news agency that he was " outraged . "
" the judgment throws no good light on circumstances in russia , " he said .
loening described the verdict as " a crass misinterpretation of what happened in court . "
' russia must respect human rights commitments ' chief european union diplomat catherine ashton called on russia " to respect its international commitments in the field of human rights and the rule of law . "
she said the eu would " continue to follow developments very closely , including the forthcoming announcement of the sentence . "
across the atlantic , united states secretary of state hillary clinton said the verdict raised " serious questions about selective prosecution - and about the rule of law being overshadowed by political considerations . "
clinton also warned in a statement that " this and similar cases have a negative impact on russia 's reputation for fulfilling its international human rights obligations and improving its investment climate . "
embezzlement charges khodorkovsky was found guilty of embezzlement for stealing and reselling over 200 tons of oil from wells he previously owned as head of the yukos oil company .
his business partner and co-defendant platon lebedev was also found guilty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khodorkovsky 's supporters see him as a symbol for democratic struggle khodorkovsky is currently serving an eight-year prison sentence for tax evasion .
his release was scheduled for 2011 .
sentencing in the current case is expected in the next few days .
the prosecution is seeking a six-year jail term .
shortly after the verdict was read , khodorkovsky 's defense lawyers said they would appeal the decision .
khodorkovsky had previously said he would take the case to the european court of human rights if he was found guilty .
orchestrated by putin ?
khodorkovsky and his lawyers say the charges against him are politically motivated .
the tycoon has been an outspoken opponent of former president and current prime minister vladimir putin , openly funding opposition parties ahead of 2003 parliamentary elections .
khodorkovsky 's original trial in 2003 was widely seen as having been orchestrated by putin .
if khodorkovsky remains in jail through 2012 , it will prevent him from wielding his influence ahead of the election scheduled in that year .
the current case has been seen as a test of the independence of the russian justice system .
but monday 's conviction sheds grave doubts on president dmitry medvedev 's vows to modernize russia and take it out of putin 's shadow .

it was hoped the strike would help convince incumbent president gbagbo to step down . a call for a general strike in ivory coast to pressure incumbent president laurent gbagbo into conceding power have failed to take hold .
in the country 's biggest city , abidjan , business largely went on as usual . the general strike was called for on sunday by supporters of alassane ouattara , the internationally recognized winner of ivory coast 's november presidential election . despite the united nations , the european union , the african union and the economic community of west african states -lrb- ecowas -rrb- all recognizing ouattara as the winner of the november 28 election , gbagbo continues to refuse to step down .
he says the election was rigged and was part of a plot against him orchestrated by france and the united states . the failed strike comes a day ahead of a trip to ivory coast by three ecowas leaders - the presidents of benin , sierra leone and cape verde - to try and personally convince gbagbo to step down .
should their bid fail , ecowas has threatened to take military action . threat of renewed civil war the standoff between the two presidential candidates has led to increased tension in the country , and around 200 people have already been killed in the election aftermath , according to the un human rights council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gbagbo has refused to relinquish power the unhrc also says at least 14,000 ivorians have fled to neighboring liberia , fearful of a return to the 2002-2003 civil war in ivory coast . " with their numbers growing , the humanitarian needs are increasing for the mostly women and children refugees as well as for the villagers hosting them , " the unhrc said in a statement on its website over the weekend . gbagbo 's interior minister , emile guirieoulou , on sunday rejected un allegations of widespread human rights violations in the election aftermath by gbagbo 's security forces , saying the world body was being partisan .
international pressure in addition to the threat of military intervention from ecowas , international pressure on gbagbo increased over the weekend as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ouattara has called for a nationwide general strike on sunday , airport authorities in the swiss city of basel grounded a plane belonging to gbagbo at the request of " the legitimate authorities " of ivory coast , a spokesman for the french foreign ministry said .
the aircraft is parked at the basel-mulhouse airport , which is jointly run by french and swiss authorities .
the us and european union previously imposed travel sanctions on gbagbo and his inner circle , while the world bank and the west african regional central bank have cut off his finances .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de piracy -pipe- 27.12.2010 swiss file-sharing website hires us lobbying firm großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapidshare is one of three european sites lobbying dc after being named as one of the most infringing websites , rapidshare is headed to the us capital to convince american lawmakers that it is not liable for illegal file-sharing . rapidshare , an online file-sharing site based in cham , switzerland , is under increased international scrutiny for enabling copyright infringement , as earlier this year members of the us congress named rapidshare one of the top six most infringing websites in the world .
" as you can imagine , we 're not very happy about that , " said daniel raimer , a german attorney and spokesman for rapidshare , in an interview with deutsche welle .
following the us government 's crackdown on infringing websites earlier this fall , seizing the domain names of more than 80 websites , rapidshare has found a way to reinvent itself in the american capital .
just last month , the company hired the washington , dc-based lobbying firm dutko to protect its interests abroad .
this likely makes it the first such european file-sharing company to lobby american lawmakers .
the company says its has more appointments coming up on capitol hill , and remains confident that it will get off the list by early 2011 , long before next year 's list is published .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss company only says about five percent of what is uploaded to its site is illegal only a small percentage of its files are illegal rapidshare estimates that copyrighted music and movies make up roughly five percent , or 10,000 of the 400,000 files uploaded every day .
although the site accepts and hosts every type of file , because the company takes many steps to filter out infringing files before they are posted , raimer argued that rapidshare is not the type of site the us should be going after .
" we believe that it 's unfair that we 're being put on the list , " he added .
" you ca n't just take a look at the number of infringing material that you can find on the server .
google has probably millions and millions of links to illegal files .
most people would probably agree that google is not a bad company . "
by international law rapidshare is not liable for what users upload and download , and recent german and american legal cases have upheld this notion .
the only thing that is required of rapidshare is to take down infringing files once the copyright holder tells it to .
while lobbying on behalf of foreign companies is nothing new in washington , it is new for foreign web companies to do so .
an online database of lobbying disclosures reveals that the only other european websites lobbying the us congress right now are two online gaming sites , pokerstars.net and partygaming.com.
us can exert limited power over foreign sites a new anti-piracy bill making its way through the us senate could clear the way for the government to seize more infringing domains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to most international law , rapidshare is not liable for what its users upload to the site and then download to their music players if the law passes , according to bob brauneis , professor of copyright law at george washington university in washington , dc , it could certainly impact rapidshare , despite the fact that it is not based in the united states . " dot-com companies operate around the world , but the company that controls the dot-com domain is in the united states , " he told deutsche welle .
" literally they have a computer in some room somewhere and if you flip a switch on that computer than domain name will disappear .
the information is still there in switzerland , but it 's not accessible at rapidshare.com because the link between rapidshare.com and the swiss computers has been cut . ”
the .com registry is maintained within the us and is subject to us law .
that means a court order could force the registry to freeze the domain name : rapidshare.com.
it does n't matter if rapidshare has its headquarters in switzerland or anywhere else .
while losing a domain name could temporarily impact the company 's business , changing to a new name is not a huge inconvenience .
rapidshare could just set up shop as rapidshare.ch , which is the most common suffix for swiss sites .
wikileaks , for example , used to have a .com suffix - now anyone can access that site at wikileaks.ch.
if seizing domains does n't stop copyright infringement , there is another step , brauneis added .
" the computers in switzerland are actually reached through a series of numbers called an internet protocol address , an ip address , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapidshare could avoid american law simply by changing to a swiss domain like rapidshare.ch " so everyone can spread around the world what the ip address is on those computers and they can continue to upload and download files , not a problem .
and if it turns out that after seizing a bunch of domain names , everyone is just turning to ip addresses - the ip addresses may be next . "
and it gets even more complicated from there .
data re-routing could drive up internet connection pricing " people are going to look for alternative ways of having those kind of sites available , " said peter eckersley , a digital rights advocate with the electronic frontier foundation , a non-profit organization based in san francisco .
however , he cautioned that if sites like this are forced to move offshore , then that may raise the actual cost of internet connections around the world .
" and the effect that will have is a significant increase in the amount of data that 's just moving over international fiber links , " he added .
" that will mean we 'll need to build more fiberlinks . and it 's going to make the cost of running the internet higher . "

consumer affairs minister aigner has called the new devices a privacy threat . they fly , take pictures , can be operated remotely and even come with an auto-pilot feature to land safely in case their owner gets distracted . the flying miniature drones are marketed as the ar.drone by wireless device manufacturer parrot and have been available in german electronics stores since summer 2010 . but some german politicians are concerned about privacy issues relating to the toys priced at 299 euros -lrb- $ 393 -rrb- and steered by devices like the iphone and ipad . " even just by using the small , helicopter-like hobby models , people can quickly go beyond the limits of the law , " said ilse aigner , germany 's consumer affairs minister , in an interview with the deutsche presse agentur . for example , if hobbyists or children fly the ar.drone onto neighbors ' property and capture images of them in their home without their permission , the photographs could already stand in violation of data privacy laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilse aigner believes in caution as drones become more widespread among civilians legal grey zone laws currently exist that require clearance for launching unmanned flying objects similar to the ar.drone , but they do not address devices of its size .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 27.12.2010 german government advisor backs eurobonds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians hope to stabilize the euro in 2011 a leading german economist has said that the euro can be stabilized by issuing loans at a set interest rate for the whole eurozone .
but the german government continues to oppose the idea . the debate about issuing so called eurobonds , or e-bonds , - loans with common interest rates across the eurozone - was ignited again on monday when professor peter bofinger , a member of the german government 's panel of independent economic advisors , said that the bonds would stabilize the eurozone .
" issuing eurobonds would make it clear that the countries in europe will remain solvent , and that it 's just no longer possible to push some countries into a corner and burden these countries with extremely high interest , " bofinger said in an interview with german broadcaster deutschland radio .
eurobonds would be issued to all eurozone countries with the same interest rate , allowing those in financial difficulties to benefit from the collective strength of the bloc .
germany and france , countries which enjoy relatively good reputations as debtors , oppose e-bonds .
in a speech to the german parliament last week , chancellor angela merkel laid out her criticism of the idea .
" it 's really important that we do n't make the mistake of collectivizing risks , which would happen with eurobonds , " she said .
" this is absolutely not a solution .
the solution is more harmony and more competitiveness in the eu member states and especially in the eurozone . "
disagreement over costs at the moment , germany borrows at a rate of 1.73 percent , but the average borrowing rate across the eurozone is slightly above 3 percent .
some economists say that if eurobonds were introduced , germany would end up paying more interest .
" there will be a substantial loss of reputation for germany , and germany will have to pay more debt for -lsb- its -rsb- interest , " markus kerber , a professor of economics at berlin 's technical university , told deutsche welle .
a eurozone bond could cost germany 17 billion euros -lrb- $ 22 billion -rrb- more each year , the german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bofinger thinks eurobonds will bring stability but bofinger thinks the assumption is flawed that the eurobonds ' interest rate would reflect the average national interest rates of individual states .
" the interest is so high in some countries because the risk of default is seen as being so high , " bofinger said .
" with a eurobond , the likelihood of a country defaulting is highly unlikely , and so i think it would have much lower interest rates than the average . "
bofinger also said that issuing eurobonds would be a good way of recognizing the austerity measures that are being implemented .
" one has to acknowledge what is being done in greece , portugal , ireland and spain .
these countries , which have really implemented very tough measures to try to stabilize the situation , they would be rewarded by allowing them access to financing with low interest rates , " bofinger said .
opponents say a collective eurozone debt pool would weaken economic competitiveness , because countries like germany , which has a very good reputation as a debtor , would share a credit rating with countries that , according kerber , do n't deserve the same rating .
tarnishing reputations " reputation is the result of challenging the markets .
if we abolish that system , we make it an anti-market system .
we make it an anti-meritocratic system and we give reputation and advantages in terms of interest to countries that do n't deserve it , " said kerber .
distorting competition in this way would destabilize the eurozone in the long term , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel does n't believe in collectivizing risk " i can not understand professor bofinger 's reasoning .
why should non-market conditions for raising funds for fragile countries stabilize the euro ? "
kerber said .
" in the long run , if you distort competition , the system will break down .
there will be a collapse and that collapse will bring down the euro . "
german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble has n't been as vehement in his opposition to eurobonds as merkel , but he has said that there should to be more political and fiscal integration before they are introduced .
this would mean harmonizing national sacred cows like taxes , retirement policy and labor market legislation .
with a string of important state elections coming up in germany in 2011 , it seems unlikely that merkel will do an about-turn on the issue of eurobonds , which could be unpopular with the german electorate .

the ka-sat is designed to provide tens of millions of europeans , especially those living in rural areas , with faster access to the internet .
ka-sat has a total throughput of some 70 gigabits per second , however typically satellite internet access costs much more than dsl or cable modem service .
the new satellite will cover a large swath of europe , ranging from north africa to southern scandinavia , and touching into the edges of the middle east .
" ka-sat will be the cornerstone of a breakthrough infrastructure deployed by eutelsat for users across europe and the mediterranean basin , " said michel de rosen , the chief executive of eutelsat , in a statement .
eutelsat is the company that will operate the satellite .
" by combining a satellite equipped with more than 80 spotbeams and a network of ground stations , this new program will deliver more capacity than any other satellite program deployed worldwide . "
the company also said that commercial internet service will begin in may 2011 .

its repercussions could be widespread , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . the guilty verdict in the trial of the former yukos owner mikhail khodorkovsky and his business partner , platon lebedev , comes as no surprise .
this was far from a free and fair trial , instead it was politically motivated .
sentencing has not yet been handed down but it 's expected that the two men will be jailed until at least 2012 - the year of the presidential elections - if not until 2017 .
many observers say that the former president and current prime minister , vladimir putin , was the driving force behind the guilty verdict . khodorkovsky was first jailed on tax evasion charges in 2003 and many believe that putin wanted to punish khodorkovsky for his perceived meddling in russian politics and his anti-putin stance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel , head of dw 's russian service in the run-up to the current verdict , putin publicly called for a guilty verdict , describing khodorkovsky as a thief .
politically , not the best of moves , considering that moscow was so keen to give the impression of a fair and independent trial .
president dmitry medevedev 's remarks were more circumspect when he said that no one - not even a president or any other high-ranking official , like putin - should comment on the current legal proceedings .
no doubt medvedev was already thinking of the political implications of a guilty verdict .
the questionable legal proceedings have dealt his reform and modernization efforts a heavy blow , and beyond that they could affect relations with the west .
the russian leadership is seemingly unaware that any reform can only be accomplished with the necessary legal and constitutional framework , fancy pr campaigns and speeches wo n't do the trick .
indeed , the trial has reinforced the perception in the west that russia lacks many basic and constitutional rights .
however much germany , europe and the us are interested in having good ties with moscow , there is a growing feeling that a russia shaped and formed by putin can not be trusted .
no doubt us president barack obama , who managed to push through the start arms reduction treaty with russia last week , will be on the receiving end of such criticism .
the west may have readily embraced khodorkovsky and lebedev as symbols for a free , democratic and just russia .
their current treatment and the clearly politically motivated nature of their trial has now led many russians to look up to them as heros in a battle against a corrupt and arbitrary regime .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 27.12.2010 german government advisor backs eurobonds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians hope to stabilize the euro in 2011 a leading german economist has said that the euro can be stabilized by issuing loans at a set interest rate for the whole eurozone .
but the german government continues to oppose the idea . the debate about issuing so called eurobonds , or e-bonds , - loans with common interest rates across the eurozone - was ignited again on monday when professor peter bofinger , a member of the german government 's panel of independent economic advisors , said that the bonds would stabilize the eurozone .
" issuing eurobonds would make it clear that the countries in europe will remain solvent , and that it 's just no longer possible to push some countries into a corner and burden these countries with extremely high interest , " bofinger said in an interview with german broadcaster deutschland radio .
eurobonds would be issued to all eurozone countries with the same interest rate , allowing those in financial difficulties to benefit from the collective strength of the bloc .
germany and france , countries which enjoy relatively good reputations as debtors , oppose e-bonds .
in a speech to the german parliament last week , chancellor angela merkel laid out her criticism of the idea .
" it 's really important that we do n't make the mistake of collectivizing risks , which would happen with eurobonds , " she said .
" this is absolutely not a solution .
the solution is more harmony and more competitiveness in the eu member states and especially in the eurozone . "
disagreement over costs at the moment , germany borrows at a rate of 1.73 percent , but the average borrowing rate across the eurozone is slightly above 3 percent .
some economists say that if eurobonds were introduced , germany would end up paying more interest .
" there will be a substantial loss of reputation for germany , and germany will have to pay more debt for -lsb- its -rsb- interest , " markus kerber , a professor of economics at berlin 's technical university , told deutsche welle .
a eurozone bond could cost germany 17 billion euros -lrb- $ 22 billion -rrb- more each year , the german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bofinger thinks eurobonds will bring stability but bofinger thinks the assumption is flawed that the eurobonds ' interest rate would reflect the average national interest rates of individual states .
" the interest is so high in some countries because the risk of default is seen as being so high , " bofinger said .
" with a eurobond , the likelihood of a country defaulting is highly unlikely , and so i think it would have much lower interest rates than the average . "
bofinger also said that issuing eurobonds would be a good way of recognizing the austerity measures that are being implemented .
" one has to acknowledge what is being done in greece , portugal , ireland and spain .
these countries , which have really implemented very tough measures to try to stabilize the situation , they would be rewarded by allowing them access to financing with low interest rates , " bofinger said .
opponents say a collective eurozone debt pool would weaken economic competitiveness , because countries like germany , which has a very good reputation as a debtor , would share a credit rating with countries that , according kerber , do n't deserve the same rating .
tarnishing reputations " reputation is the result of challenging the markets .
if we abolish that system , we make it an anti-market system .
we make it an anti-meritocratic system and we give reputation and advantages in terms of interest to countries that do n't deserve it , " said kerber .
distorting competition in this way would destabilize the eurozone in the long term , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel does n't believe in collectivizing risk " i can not understand professor bofinger 's reasoning .
why should non-market conditions for raising funds for fragile countries stabilize the euro ? "
kerber said .
" in the long run , if you distort competition , the system will break down .
there will be a collapse and that collapse will bring down the euro . "
german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble has n't been as vehement in his opposition to eurobonds as merkel , but he has said that there should to be more political and fiscal integration before they are introduced .
this would mean harmonizing national sacred cows like taxes , retirement policy and labor market legislation .
with a string of important state elections coming up in germany in 2011 , it seems unlikely that merkel will do an about-turn on the issue of eurobonds , which could be unpopular with the german electorate .

" from my own and a police point of view , i urge and support a ban , " police union head bernhard witthaut told deutsche welle .
" i think it 's terrible how they mock foreigners living in germany , i think their concept of a state is terrible . "
witthaut was not alone in his comments .
the president of the central council of jews in germany , dieter graumann , said in an interview over the weekend that the npd , which currently has an estimated 7,000 members , had clearly set itself the goal of destroying democracy in germany .
the country must resist such attempts , he said , if necessary by issuing a ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernhard witthaut said a new court case must be well prepared the head of the turkish community in germany , kenan kolat , urged a more consistent prosecution of xenophobic attacks in germany .
banning the npd , he told the news agency dapd , could also " have a positive effect in the fight against right-wing extremism and racism . " the german government attempted to ban the npd in a case heard by the country 's highest court , the constitutional court , in 2001 .
but the case was thrown out two years later after it was disclosed that several people in the npd 's inner circle were german secret service undercover agents or informants .
signal in the fight against far-right extremism the police union 's witthaut said that some people in law enforcement believed it would be easier to deal with the far-right party if you knew how it operated and where it was active , whereas if the party were to go underground , it would be much more difficult to keep an eye on its activities . but he said he was convinced that outlawing a party listed as racist , anti-semitic and revisionist by germany 's domestic intelligence agency would be " an important signal in the fight against right-wing extremism . "
" many might view the risk of a renewed failure before germany 's highest court as such a grave aspect that they might dismiss steps in that direction , " bavaria 's interior minister joachim herrmann said on monday .
but he added that banning the npd was desirable , and he would continue to lobby for a ban of the party .

they see the verdict as casting doubt on president dmitry medvedev 's pledges to modernize russia . germany and other western countries have condemned the guilty verdict pronounced by a russian court against jailed tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky on new fraud charges .
in a statement , german foreign minister guido westerwelle called the verdict " a step backward " for russia .
westerwelle said that the way the trial was conducted was " very dubious " and called on russia to " stand up for the rule of law , democracy and human rights . "
german human rights commissioner markus loening found even stronger words to condemn the verdict , telling the dpa news agency that he was " outraged . "
" the judgment throws no good light on circumstances in russia , " he said .
loening described the verdict as " a crass misinterpretation of what happened in court . "
' russia must respect human rights commitments ' chief european union diplomat catherine ashton called on russia " to respect its international commitments in the field of human rights and the rule of law . "
she said the eu would " continue to follow developments very closely , including the forthcoming announcement of the sentence . "
across the atlantic , united states secretary of state hillary clinton said the verdict raised " serious questions about selective prosecution - and about the rule of law being overshadowed by political considerations . "
clinton also warned in a statement that " this and similar cases have a negative impact on russia 's reputation for fulfilling its international human rights obligations and improving its investment climate . "
embezzlement charges khodorkovsky was found guilty of embezzlement for stealing and reselling over 200 tons of oil from wells he previously owned as head of the yukos oil company .
his business partner and co-defendant platon lebedev was also found guilty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khodorkovsky 's supporters see him as a symbol for democratic struggle khodorkovsky is currently serving an eight-year prison sentence for tax evasion .
his release was scheduled for 2011 .
sentencing in the current case is expected in the next few days .
the prosecution is seeking a six-year jail term .
shortly after the verdict was read , khodorkovsky 's defense lawyers said they would appeal the decision .
khodorkovsky had previously said he would take the case to the european court of human rights if he was found guilty .
orchestrated by putin ?
khodorkovsky and his lawyers say the charges against him are politically motivated .
the tycoon has been an outspoken opponent of former president and current prime minister vladimir putin , openly funding opposition parties ahead of 2003 parliamentary elections .
khodorkovsky 's original trial in 2003 was widely seen as having been orchestrated by putin .
if khodorkovsky remains in jail through 2012 , it will prevent him from wielding his influence ahead of the election scheduled in that year .
the current case has been seen as a test of the independence of the russian justice system .
but monday 's conviction sheds grave doubts on president dmitry medvedev 's vows to modernize russia and take it out of putin 's shadow .

the incumbent president laurent ghagbo refused to concede rule to internationally recognized election winner alassane ouattara . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
west african bloc threatens intervention in ivory coast ecowas lacks adequate logistics and cohesion for a quick and decisive strike to remove the dictator who is trying to thwart the will of the ivoirians .
military force should be used if laurent gbagbo refuses to quit as it has been shown from the election result that the majority of the people does not want him to continue in power .
he should never underestimate a determined ecowas with a very strong nigerian influence and the support of the au , un , us and eu . - agholor , nigeria my opinion is that gbagbo should hand over power peacefully , but if that is not the case then ecowas will have to send in the military .
he can not just gain power by force .
a lot of resources were spent for the election to take place , so the people of ivory coast deserve to be heard . - james , kenya i think it 's high time we put an end to all of this military adventurism on the african continent so the ordinary people can be saved from these selfish individuals , and hopefully have some chance for some real development .
though there is a risk of abuse in intervening in the internal affairs of independent member states , this time around ecowas is right to use full force to oust gbagbo .
that would send a useful signal to all intending adventurists on the continent !
ecowas may even need to clearly define the circumstances under which it might routinely consider this form of intervention in future .
enough is enough ! - anthony , nigeria i am happy that ecowas has given a warning to laurent gbagbo that should he decide not to stand down , the bloc would use legitimate force to oust him from power .
for a long time now , the african union and the world have watched dictators cling to power even when they lost elections .
the peoples ' will , expressed through elections or the ballot box , has meant nothing . - malama , zambia while i am thankful that we have the presence of the un in our world , however , it would be a mistake to send un peacekeepers .
i believe ecowas is more in touch with what 's happening in ivory coast and it 's time we give credence and support to local initiatives of this magnitude .
the un should work with ecowas and give necessary guidance if need be .

the british-made satellite will have a throughput of 70 gigabits per second . on monday , a british-made satellite was launched in kazakhstan , becoming the second european spacecraft devoted to beaming down high-speed internet connectivity .
the ka-sat is designed to provide tens of millions of europeans , especially those living in rural areas , with faster access to the internet .
ka-sat has a total throughput of some 70 gigabits per second , however typically satellite internet access costs much more than dsl or cable modem service .
the new satellite will cover a large swath of europe , ranging from north africa to southern scandinavia , and touching into the edges of the middle east .
" ka-sat will be the cornerstone of a breakthrough infrastructure deployed by eutelsat for users across europe and the mediterranean basin , " said michel de rosen , the chief executive of eutelsat , in a statement .
eutelsat is the company that will operate the satellite .
" by combining a satellite equipped with more than 80 spotbeams and a network of ground stations , this new program will deliver more capacity than any other satellite program deployed worldwide . "
the company also said that commercial internet service will begin in may 2011 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de piracy -pipe- 27.12.2010 swiss file-sharing website hires us lobbying firm großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapidshare is one of three european sites lobbying dc after being named as one of the most infringing websites , rapidshare is headed to the us capital to convince american lawmakers that it is not liable for illegal file-sharing . rapidshare , an online file-sharing site based in cham , switzerland , is under increased international scrutiny for enabling copyright infringement , as earlier this year members of the us congress named rapidshare one of the top six most infringing websites in the world .
" as you can imagine , we 're not very happy about that , " said daniel raimer , a german attorney and spokesman for rapidshare , in an interview with deutsche welle .
following the us government 's crackdown on infringing websites earlier this fall , seizing the domain names of more than 80 websites , rapidshare has found a way to reinvent itself in the american capital .
just last month , the company hired the washington , dc-based lobbying firm dutko to protect its interests abroad .
this likely makes it the first such european file-sharing company to lobby american lawmakers .
the company says its has more appointments coming up on capitol hill , and remains confident that it will get off the list by early 2011 , long before next year 's list is published .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss company only says about five percent of what is uploaded to its site is illegal only a small percentage of its files are illegal rapidshare estimates that copyrighted music and movies make up roughly five percent , or 10,000 of the 400,000 files uploaded every day .
although the site accepts and hosts every type of file , because the company takes many steps to filter out infringing files before they are posted , raimer argued that rapidshare is not the type of site the us should be going after .
" we believe that it 's unfair that we 're being put on the list , " he added .
" you ca n't just take a look at the number of infringing material that you can find on the server .
google has probably millions and millions of links to illegal files .
most people would probably agree that google is not a bad company . "
by international law rapidshare is not liable for what users upload and download , and recent german and american legal cases have upheld this notion .
the only thing that is required of rapidshare is to take down infringing files once the copyright holder tells it to .
while lobbying on behalf of foreign companies is nothing new in washington , it is new for foreign web companies to do so .
an online database of lobbying disclosures reveals that the only other european websites lobbying the us congress right now are two online gaming sites , pokerstars.net and partygaming.com.
us can exert limited power over foreign sites a new anti-piracy bill making its way through the us senate could clear the way for the government to seize more infringing domains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to most international law , rapidshare is not liable for what its users upload to the site and then download to their music players if the law passes , according to bob brauneis , professor of copyright law at george washington university in washington , dc , it could certainly impact rapidshare , despite the fact that it is not based in the united states . " dot-com companies operate around the world , but the company that controls the dot-com domain is in the united states , " he told deutsche welle .
" literally they have a computer in some room somewhere and if you flip a switch on that computer than domain name will disappear .
the information is still there in switzerland , but it 's not accessible at rapidshare.com because the link between rapidshare.com and the swiss computers has been cut . ”
the .com registry is maintained within the us and is subject to us law .
that means a court order could force the registry to freeze the domain name : rapidshare.com.
it does n't matter if rapidshare has its headquarters in switzerland or anywhere else .
while losing a domain name could temporarily impact the company 's business , changing to a new name is not a huge inconvenience .
rapidshare could just set up shop as rapidshare.ch , which is the most common suffix for swiss sites .
wikileaks , for example , used to have a .com suffix - now anyone can access that site at wikileaks.ch.
if seizing domains does n't stop copyright infringement , there is another step , brauneis added .
" the computers in switzerland are actually reached through a series of numbers called an internet protocol address , an ip address , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapidshare could avoid american law simply by changing to a swiss domain like rapidshare.ch " so everyone can spread around the world what the ip address is on those computers and they can continue to upload and download files , not a problem .
and if it turns out that after seizing a bunch of domain names , everyone is just turning to ip addresses - the ip addresses may be next . "
and it gets even more complicated from there .
data re-routing could drive up internet connection pricing " people are going to look for alternative ways of having those kind of sites available , " said peter eckersley , a digital rights advocate with the electronic frontier foundation , a non-profit organization based in san francisco .
however , he cautioned that if sites like this are forced to move offshore , then that may raise the actual cost of internet connections around the world .
" and the effect that will have is a significant increase in the amount of data that 's just moving over international fiber links , " he added .
" that will mean we 'll need to build more fiberlinks . and it 's going to make the cost of running the internet higher . "

military force should be used if laurent gbagbo refuses to quit as it has been shown from the election result that the majority of the people does not want him to continue in power .
he should never underestimate a determined ecowas with a very strong nigerian influence and the support of the au , un , us and eu . - agholor , nigeria my opinion is that gbagbo should hand over power peacefully , but if that is not the case then ecowas will have to send in the military .
he can not just gain power by force .
a lot of resources were spent for the election to take place , so the people of ivory coast deserve to be heard . - james , kenya i think it 's high time we put an end to all of this military adventurism on the african continent so the ordinary people can be saved from these selfish individuals , and hopefully have some chance for some real development .
though there is a risk of abuse in intervening in the internal affairs of independent member states , this time around ecowas is right to use full force to oust gbagbo .
that would send a useful signal to all intending adventurists on the continent !
ecowas may even need to clearly define the circumstances under which it might routinely consider this form of intervention in future .
enough is enough ! - anthony , nigeria i am happy that ecowas has given a warning to laurent gbagbo that should he decide not to stand down , the bloc would use legitimate force to oust him from power .
for a long time now , the african union and the world have watched dictators cling to power even when they lost elections .
the peoples ' will , expressed through elections or the ballot box , has meant nothing . - malama , zambia while i am thankful that we have the presence of the un in our world , however , it would be a mistake to send un peacekeepers .
i believe ecowas is more in touch with what 's happening in ivory coast and it 's time we give credence and support to local initiatives of this magnitude .
the un should work with ecowas and give necessary guidance if need be .
too many cooks here will spoil these welcome " winds of change " we are beginning to witness in some parts of africa . - gari , unknown compiled by stuart tiffen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" as you can imagine , we 're not very happy about that , " said daniel raimer , a german attorney and spokesman for rapidshare , in an interview with deutsche welle .
following the us government 's crackdown on infringing websites earlier this fall , seizing the domain names of more than 80 websites , rapidshare has found a way to reinvent itself in the american capital .
just last month , the company hired the washington , dc-based lobbying firm dutko to protect its interests abroad .
this likely makes it the first such european file-sharing company to lobby american lawmakers .
the company says its has more appointments coming up on capitol hill , and remains confident that it will get off the list by early 2011 , long before next year 's list is published .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss company only says about five percent of what is uploaded to its site is illegal only a small percentage of its files are illegal rapidshare estimates that copyrighted music and movies make up roughly five percent , or 10,000 of the 400,000 files uploaded every day .
although the site accepts and hosts every type of file , because the company takes many steps to filter out infringing files before they are posted , raimer argued that rapidshare is not the type of site the us should be going after .
" we believe that it 's unfair that we 're being put on the list , " he added .
" you ca n't just take a look at the number of infringing material that you can find on the server .
google has probably millions and millions of links to illegal files .
most people would probably agree that google is not a bad company . "
by international law rapidshare is not liable for what users upload and download , and recent german and american legal cases have upheld this notion .
the only thing that is required of rapidshare is to take down infringing files once the copyright holder tells it to .
while lobbying on behalf of foreign companies is nothing new in washington , it is new for foreign web companies to do so .
an online database of lobbying disclosures reveals that the only other european websites lobbying the us congress right now are two online gaming sites , pokerstars.net and partygaming.com.
us can exert limited power over foreign sites a new anti-piracy bill making its way through the us senate could clear the way for the government to seize more infringing domains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to most international law , rapidshare is not liable for what its users upload to the site and then download to their music players if the law passes , according to bob brauneis , professor of copyright law at george washington university in washington , dc , it could certainly impact rapidshare , despite the fact that it is not based in the united states . " dot-com companies operate around the world , but the company that controls the dot-com domain is in the united states , " he told deutsche welle .
" literally they have a computer in some room somewhere and if you flip a switch on that computer than domain name will disappear .
the information is still there in switzerland , but it 's not accessible at rapidshare.com because the link between rapidshare.com and the swiss computers has been cut . ”
the .com registry is maintained within the us and is subject to us law .
that means a court order could force the registry to freeze the domain name : rapidshare.com.
it does n't matter if rapidshare has its headquarters in switzerland or anywhere else .
while losing a domain name could temporarily impact the company 's business , changing to a new name is not a huge inconvenience .
rapidshare could just set up shop as rapidshare.ch , which is the most common suffix for swiss sites .
wikileaks , for example , used to have a .com suffix - now anyone can access that site at wikileaks.ch.
if seizing domains does n't stop copyright infringement , there is another step , brauneis added .
" the computers in switzerland are actually reached through a series of numbers called an internet protocol address , an ip address , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapidshare could avoid american law simply by changing to a swiss domain like rapidshare.ch " so everyone can spread around the world what the ip address is on those computers and they can continue to upload and download files , not a problem .
and if it turns out that after seizing a bunch of domain names , everyone is just turning to ip addresses - the ip addresses may be next . "
and it gets even more complicated from there .
data re-routing could drive up internet connection pricing " people are going to look for alternative ways of having those kind of sites available , " said peter eckersley , a digital rights advocate with the electronic frontier foundation , a non-profit organization based in san francisco .
however , he cautioned that if sites like this are forced to move offshore , then that may raise the actual cost of internet connections around the world .
" and the effect that will have is a significant increase in the amount of data that 's just moving over international fiber links , " he added .
" that will mean we 'll need to build more fiberlinks . and it 's going to make the cost of running the internet higher . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 27.12.2010 opinion : khodorkovsky verdict is poison for reform efforts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guilty verdict in the khodorkovsky trial comes as no surprise and was politically motivated .
its repercussions could be widespread , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . the guilty verdict in the trial of the former yukos owner mikhail khodorkovsky and his business partner , platon lebedev , comes as no surprise .
this was far from a free and fair trial , instead it was politically motivated .
sentencing has not yet been handed down but it 's expected that the two men will be jailed until at least 2012 - the year of the presidential elections - if not until 2017 .
many observers say that the former president and current prime minister , vladimir putin , was the driving force behind the guilty verdict . khodorkovsky was first jailed on tax evasion charges in 2003 and many believe that putin wanted to punish khodorkovsky for his perceived meddling in russian politics and his anti-putin stance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel , head of dw 's russian service in the run-up to the current verdict , putin publicly called for a guilty verdict , describing khodorkovsky as a thief .
politically , not the best of moves , considering that moscow was so keen to give the impression of a fair and independent trial .
president dmitry medevedev 's remarks were more circumspect when he said that no one - not even a president or any other high-ranking official , like putin - should comment on the current legal proceedings .
no doubt medvedev was already thinking of the political implications of a guilty verdict .
the questionable legal proceedings have dealt his reform and modernization efforts a heavy blow , and beyond that they could affect relations with the west .
the russian leadership is seemingly unaware that any reform can only be accomplished with the necessary legal and constitutional framework , fancy pr campaigns and speeches wo n't do the trick .
indeed , the trial has reinforced the perception in the west that russia lacks many basic and constitutional rights .
however much germany , europe and the us are interested in having good ties with moscow , there is a growing feeling that a russia shaped and formed by putin can not be trusted .
no doubt us president barack obama , who managed to push through the start arms reduction treaty with russia last week , will be on the receiving end of such criticism .
the west may have readily embraced khodorkovsky and lebedev as symbols for a free , democratic and just russia .
their current treatment and the clearly politically motivated nature of their trial has now led many russians to look up to them as heros in a battle against a corrupt and arbitrary regime .

the verdict in khodorkovsky 's second trial could keep him behind bars for several more years . mikhail khodorkovsky has been found guilty of embezzlement for stealing and reselling over 200 tons of oil from wells he previously owned as head of the yukos oil company .
the judge in the case , viktor danilkin , read the verdict in a moscow courtroom on monday .
khodorkovsky 's business partner and co-defendant platon lebedev was also found guilty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khodorkovsky supporters gathered outside the court monday khodorkovsky is currently serving an eight-year prison sentence for tax evasion .
sentencing in the current case is expected in the next few days .
the prosecution is seeking a six-year sentence .
the russian news agency interfax reported that journalists present in the courtroom were asked to leave by danilkin just after the guilty decision was read .
the entire verdict could take several days to read .
observers have speculated that a date change in the verdict reading , originally scheduled for december 15 , was an attempt to reduce media attention .
shortly after the verdict was read , khodorkovsky 's defense lawyers said they would appeal the decision .
khodorkovsky had previously said he would take the case to the european court of human rights if he was found guilty .
high-profile trial the second trial of russia 's former richest man has garnered international attention .
germany is one of several western nations that have criticized the trial .
in a visit with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov in moscow in early november , german foreign minister guido westerwelle expressed " very serious concern about the conditions of the trial proceedings . "
westerwelle added it was in russia 's best interest to take such concerns seriously .
lavrov replied that it was a matter for the court to decide .
political rivals if khodorkovsky remains behind bars through 2012 , it would keep the outspoken political opponent of prime minister vladimir putin from wielding his influence ahead of the election .
due to his stance against putin and the kremlin , khodorkovsky has become a symbol for the russian opposition and human right activists who decry his imprisonment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin called for a guilty verdict last week khodorkovsky 's original trial in 2003 was widely seen as a politically motivated event , with putin - who was president at the time - pulling the strings .
khodorkovsky had openly funded opposition parties ahead of the 2003 parliamentary elections , which did not sit well with the kremlin .
putin was in the spotlight again leading up to monday 's verdict , making an appeal on live television last week that " the thief must remain in jail . "
the verdict and sentencing in the current case are being seen as a test of the independence of the russian justice system .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 27.12.2010 berlin business capitalizes on inventors ' creativity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all bright ideas are commercial success stories inventors sometimes spend lifetimes working to perfect their inventions , but few know how to bring them to the market .
berlin-based erfinderhaus helps inventors develop new products ; the erfinderladen sells them . at berlin 's erfinderladen , or inventor 's shop , things are n't always what they seem : the cans ofdog food , batteries and soft drinks on display are actually clever stash safes designed by local inventor stefan neser .
neser picks up what looks and feels like a full can of cola .
then , he unscrews the top to reveal a small hiding place , with room for a wad of cash , some jewelry , or a small mobile phone . neser works with big name manufacturers like pepsico , duracell and bonduelle , swapping his safes for their labels , which come complete with multi-lingual eu ingredient lists and instructions for use . giving inventors a chance to enter the market the erfinderladen is packed with quirky and clever inventions . there 's a waterproof notepad for jotting down ideas in the shower , a device to hold up your book while you read in bed , felted boots for walking warmly in the snow , and a two-inch keychain that converts into what 's believed to be the world 's smallest corkscrew . roughly 95 percent of the items in the shop were developed by german inventors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inventor stefan neser swaps his safes for labels of big name manufacturers the collection is maintained by marijan jordan and gerhard muthenthaler , who opened the store as a spin-off from their main project , erfinderhaus .
together they advise would-be inventors on how to file patent applications , where to find development money , and how to deal with manufacturers .
muthenthaler says they wanted to both raise public awareness about erfinderhaus ' mostly invisible services and provide a launch pad for the new items they 've helped develop . " at the erfinderladen we can show what we do , show the products , and give inventors a chance so that when they only have 100 pieces handmade , they can also enter the market , " muthenthaler explains .
another advantage : it 's a test market situation .
when clients respond positively , muthenthaler and jordan take the product to big retailers and tell them about it . muthenthaler and jordan started their consulting business in 1997 in salzburg , austria , but found more fertile ground in the lively german capital .
the two learned firsthand how tough life can be for novice inventors . their first invention was an idea for a watch that could allow its wearer to identify and connect with people sharing the same likes and interests - a kind of a social network website on your wrist . when they tried to get the idea developed , the experience pushed them in a new direction .
" our first business meeting was with swatch , the biggest swiss company for watches .
we went to this meeting as students - we drove our mom 's car , " jordan recalls . that first meeting was informative but frustrating .
the duo drove home and started searching for a company that offered advice to inventors .
they found a few in the united states , but none in germany .
so they decided to invent their own .
crazy men in basements ?
the german market needs the support even though its inventors generate a similar number of patents to japan , which is only outperformed by the united states .
german business culture , with its rigid processes and conservative attitudes , is wary of entrepreneurs .
adding to that , muthenthaler says , inventors now mostly work in teams for big companies like apple and siemens , and are n't identified as individuals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muthenthaler -lrb- right -rrb- and jordan founded erfinderhaus to help to inventors muthenthaler says the bias is inherent in the germany language itself , starting with the word erfinder .
“ ' erfinder ' has the same meaning as ' inventor . '
but ' inventor ' in the anglo-american context would be an entrepreneur in the beginning , a visionary .
and here , it 's kind of the crazy guy who works in his basement on some stupid inventions .
that 's the public conception of the word , " he says .
erfinderhaus has been on a battle to rebrand the word erfinder as a respectable descriptor and profession . it actively in promotes " inventor 's day " in germany -lrb- november 9 -rrb- , while its founders regularly participate in panel discussions and blog about new ideas . muthenthaler admits he has a soft spot for odd designs and products that some might find a little crazy - or at least unusual - but erfinderhaus has also worked on practical technological advances like streetlight dimming system autolux , as well as novel energy-saving devices and construction materials . " as an inventor you always solve a problem " , says muthenthaler . " if it 's -lsb- just -rsb- your problem , it 's your problem . but if it 's a problem someone else also has , it 's a product .
that 's the difference . "
" we are like gold diggers " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crazy or visionary ?
gyro gearloose 's profession is often misunderstood deciding which of these solutions should be realized is the real art of the business . as technology makes information easier to access and patents simpler to file , muthenthaler says more inventions are being created than ever before .
erfinderhaus receives 1,000 ideas a year .
some come as rough plans , some as finished designs .
but not all ideas are good or new .
many designs have already been patented or already exist on the market somewhere in the world . some 80 percent of proposals sent to erfinderhaus do n't make it past the first meeting , and only a few are fully developed .
" we are like gold diggers , " says muthenthaler .
" they have to get dirty and search the mud for the gold nuggets .
and that 's pretty much what we are doing .
we search for the nuggets . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 27.12.2010 khodorkovsky verdict was politically motivated , say observers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khodorkovsky 's trial and verdict was politically motivated , critics say observers had already predicted a " guilty " verdict in the moscow trial of jailed russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky .
many believe the lawsuit against the kremlin critic is purely politically motivated . khodorkovsky has been found guilty of stealing 218 tons of oil he owned as head of the yukos oil company and of embezzling the proceeds .
the oil magnate , a vocal critic of the policies of then-russian president vladimir putin , was first tried for tax evasion in 2003 .
since then , he has been in a siberian prison , and the trial led to the breakup of his multimillion-euro oil concern .
the eu has called on russia to respect international rights in its sentencing which is expected in the next few days .
the moscow prosecutor 's office is seeking a further six-year sentence - which observers note would keep the putin political rival locked up beyond the next presidential elections , in 2012 .
a number of human-rights activists say the real reason khodorkovsky was tried a second time is because he dared to openly criticize putin , as well as actively support opposition candidates .
constant media presence khodorkovsky 's lawyer , juri schmidt , says the trial was the kremlin 's way of dealing with its fear of the public response to a vocal critic .
" khodorkovsky … is more present in the press than ever .
i think this fear is one of the main reasons that the trial against khodorkovsky and -lrb- platon -rrb- lebedev is even being held , " schmidt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regular marches to free khodorkovsky are held in moscow his omnipresence in the media has made khodorkovsky a symbolic hero for the russian opposition , as well as for human-rights activists , schmidt added .
" the government did n't expect such an enormous resonance among the public .
the apparently restrained reaction to the first verdict made them think that it would be the same in a second trial .
but they made an error , " schmidt said .
" opinion polls show that society is increasingly looking up to khodorkovsky .
this only serves to make the government more afraid . "
khodorkovsky overstepped limits , kremlin supporters say political scientist vyacheslav nikonov , known for his close ties to the kremlin , disputes the notion that moscow is afraid of khodorkovsky .
" the russian government is n't afraid of any oligarch , whether he is banned or active .
the state has many more ways to pressure an oligarch than the other way around , " nikonov said .
" the kremlin 's image wo n't suffer measurably from the khodorkovsky trial , and khodorkovsky has little influence on political power at the moment . "
according to nikonov , moscow pursued this trial for the nation 's best interest alone .
the oil magnate was arrested not because he started any election campaigns , but because he had " bought the control of meaningful committees " in russia 's parliament .
" without his say-so , even the finance ministry could n't complete certain operations .
and when a person like that starts to attack the state , by not paying taxes - that goes well beyond the limits of what is allowed , " nikonov said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khodorkovsky could spend six more years behind bars but the president of the moscow-based research institute panorama says he thinks other motivations are in play in moscow 's decision to prosecute khodorkovsky a second time .
" if he 's free , khodorkovsky could start legal proceedings against those who stripped him of his business - namely , putin and his then-deputy igor sechin , " said vladimir pribilovsky .
" besides , they are afraid that a free khodorkovsky would unite and lead an opposition . "
another khodorkovsky lawyer , vadim klyuvgant , said the government did everything it could to see that a " guilty " verdict was handed down .
the trial was anything but fair , he said : " it is all fabrication - simply fabrication from start to finish .
from the first word to the last , written or spoken .
it is all just made up with a single goal : vengeance . "
westerwelle weighs in western leaders , including german foreign minister guido westerwelle , have been keeping an intense eye on the trial .
the german minister made known his concerns about the conditions of the trial when he visited moscow in early november .
he told his russian counterpart sergei lavrov that russia needs to take the west 's concerns seriously .
lavrov replied by stressing the independent nature of russia 's justice system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle -lrb- left -rrb- let russia 's lavrov know the west is watching in fact , a russian court can freely decide on a verdict - but it needs to have the right information to decide with , said oleg orlov , chairman of the board of memorial , a center for human rights .
he and other trial watchers believe the court was putting too much pressure on the judges to deliver a fair verdict .
" the judge ... is in a very difficult position .
i ca n't imagine how a justice with any self respect can give a guilty verdict under these conditions .
but in today 's russia , everything is possible , " orlov said .
the defense started hearing closing arguments on 27 october .
khodorkovsky took the chance to speak , and he talked for three hours .
in the end he did n't ask the court for mercy , but he asked them to keep an open mind .
likely outcome : six more years speaking with irony , he asked the court to honor the prosecutor 's enormous efforts at fabricating a case against him , saying : " honorable court , i agree that a not-guilty verdict would be almost a utopian outcome . … the prosecution has done everything in its power to see that the court has no legitimate chance to declare me not guilty .
you should respect these efforts , because next time , the prosecution can just spit on an empty sheet of paper , put a rubber stamp on it , and demand 14 years of prison .
it would amount to the same thing . "
observers say that khodorkovsky will likely be sentenced to six more years in a siberian prison camp - in which case he would n't see freedom until 2017 .
khodorkovsky 's father , 78 year old boris khodorkovsky , said he fears he will never see his son again .
" i 'm old , and am afraid that after this trial , i wo n't see him again , if he is sent to siberia .
i ca n't fly anymore , because i have bad eyesight .
i do n't know what i would do , " the elder khodorkovsky said .
if he is convicted , khodorkovsky said he would take the case to the european court of human rights in strasbourg .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regular marches to free khodorkovsky are held in moscow his omnipresence in the media has made khodorkovsky a symbolic hero for the russian opposition , as well as for human-rights activists , schmidt added .
" the government did n't expect such an enormous resonance among the public .
the apparently restrained reaction to the first verdict made them think that it would be the same in a second trial .
but they made an error , " schmidt said .
" opinion polls show that society is increasingly looking up to khodorkovsky .
this only serves to make the government more afraid . "
khodorkovsky overstepped limits , kremlin supporters say political scientist vyacheslav nikonov , known for his close ties to the kremlin , disputes the notion that moscow is afraid of khodorkovsky .
" the russian government is n't afraid of any oligarch , whether he is banned or active .
the state has many more ways to pressure an oligarch than the other way around , " nikonov said .
" the kremlin 's image wo n't suffer measurably from the khodorkovsky trial , and khodorkovsky has little influence on political power at the moment . "
according to nikonov , moscow pursued this trial for the nation 's best interest alone .
the oil magnate was arrested not because he started any election campaigns , but because he had " bought the control of meaningful committees " in russia 's parliament .
" without his say-so , even the finance ministry could n't complete certain operations .
and when a person like that starts to attack the state , by not paying taxes - that goes well beyond the limits of what is allowed , " nikonov said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khodorkovsky could spend six more years behind bars but the president of the moscow-based research institute panorama says he thinks other motivations are in play in moscow 's decision to prosecute khodorkovsky a second time .
" if he 's free , khodorkovsky could start legal proceedings against those who stripped him of his business - namely , putin and his then-deputy igor sechin , " said vladimir pribilovsky .
" besides , they are afraid that a free khodorkovsky would unite and lead an opposition . "
another khodorkovsky lawyer , vadim klyuvgant , said the government did everything it could to see that a " guilty " verdict was handed down .
the trial was anything but fair , he said : " it is all fabrication - simply fabrication from start to finish .
from the first word to the last , written or spoken .
it is all just made up with a single goal : vengeance . "
westerwelle weighs in western leaders , including german foreign minister guido westerwelle , have been keeping an intense eye on the trial .
the german minister made known his concerns about the conditions of the trial when he visited moscow in early november .
he told his russian counterpart sergei lavrov that russia needs to take the west 's concerns seriously .
lavrov replied by stressing the independent nature of russia 's justice system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle -lrb- left -rrb- let russia 's lavrov know the west is watching in fact , a russian court can freely decide on a verdict - but it needs to have the right information to decide with , said oleg orlov , chairman of the board of memorial , a center for human rights .
he and other trial watchers believe the court was putting too much pressure on the judges to deliver a fair verdict .
" the judge ... is in a very difficult position .
i ca n't imagine how a justice with any self respect can give a guilty verdict under these conditions .
but in today 's russia , everything is possible , " orlov said .
the defense started hearing closing arguments on 27 october .
khodorkovsky took the chance to speak , and he talked for three hours .
in the end he did n't ask the court for mercy , but he asked them to keep an open mind .
likely outcome : six more years speaking with irony , he asked the court to honor the prosecutor 's enormous efforts at fabricating a case against him , saying : " honorable court , i agree that a not-guilty verdict would be almost a utopian outcome . … the prosecution has done everything in its power to see that the court has no legitimate chance to declare me not guilty .
you should respect these efforts , because next time , the prosecution can just spit on an empty sheet of paper , put a rubber stamp on it , and demand 14 years of prison .
it would amount to the same thing . "
observers say that khodorkovsky will likely be sentenced to six more years in a siberian prison camp - in which case he would n't see freedom until 2017 .
khodorkovsky 's father , 78 year old boris khodorkovsky , said he fears he will never see his son again .
" i 'm old , and am afraid that after this trial , i wo n't see him again , if he is sent to siberia .
i ca n't fly anymore , because i have bad eyesight .
i do n't know what i would do , " the elder khodorkovsky said .
if he is convicted , khodorkovsky said he would take the case to the european court of human rights in strasbourg .

berlin-based erfinderhaus helps inventors develop new products ; the erfinderladen sells them . at berlin 's erfinderladen , or inventor 's shop , things are n't always what they seem : the cans ofdog food , batteries and soft drinks on display are actually clever stash safes designed by local inventor stefan neser .
neser picks up what looks and feels like a full can of cola .
then , he unscrews the top to reveal a small hiding place , with room for a wad of cash , some jewelry , or a small mobile phone . neser works with big name manufacturers like pepsico , duracell and bonduelle , swapping his safes for their labels , which come complete with multi-lingual eu ingredient lists and instructions for use . giving inventors a chance to enter the market the erfinderladen is packed with quirky and clever inventions . there 's a waterproof notepad for jotting down ideas in the shower , a device to hold up your book while you read in bed , felted boots for walking warmly in the snow , and a two-inch keychain that converts into what 's believed to be the world 's smallest corkscrew . roughly 95 percent of the items in the shop were developed by german inventors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inventor stefan neser swaps his safes for labels of big name manufacturers the collection is maintained by marijan jordan and gerhard muthenthaler , who opened the store as a spin-off from their main project , erfinderhaus .
together they advise would-be inventors on how to file patent applications , where to find development money , and how to deal with manufacturers .
muthenthaler says they wanted to both raise public awareness about erfinderhaus ' mostly invisible services and provide a launch pad for the new items they 've helped develop . " at the erfinderladen we can show what we do , show the products , and give inventors a chance so that when they only have 100 pieces handmade , they can also enter the market , " muthenthaler explains .
another advantage : it 's a test market situation .
when clients respond positively , muthenthaler and jordan take the product to big retailers and tell them about it . muthenthaler and jordan started their consulting business in 1997 in salzburg , austria , but found more fertile ground in the lively german capital .
the two learned firsthand how tough life can be for novice inventors . their first invention was an idea for a watch that could allow its wearer to identify and connect with people sharing the same likes and interests - a kind of a social network website on your wrist . when they tried to get the idea developed , the experience pushed them in a new direction .
" our first business meeting was with swatch , the biggest swiss company for watches .
we went to this meeting as students - we drove our mom 's car , " jordan recalls . that first meeting was informative but frustrating .
the duo drove home and started searching for a company that offered advice to inventors .
they found a few in the united states , but none in germany .
so they decided to invent their own .
crazy men in basements ?
the german market needs the support even though its inventors generate a similar number of patents to japan , which is only outperformed by the united states .
german business culture , with its rigid processes and conservative attitudes , is wary of entrepreneurs .
adding to that , muthenthaler says , inventors now mostly work in teams for big companies like apple and siemens , and are n't identified as individuals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muthenthaler -lrb- right -rrb- and jordan founded erfinderhaus to help to inventors muthenthaler says the bias is inherent in the germany language itself , starting with the word erfinder .
“ ' erfinder ' has the same meaning as ' inventor . '
but ' inventor ' in the anglo-american context would be an entrepreneur in the beginning , a visionary .
and here , it 's kind of the crazy guy who works in his basement on some stupid inventions .
that 's the public conception of the word , " he says .
erfinderhaus has been on a battle to rebrand the word erfinder as a respectable descriptor and profession . it actively in promotes " inventor 's day " in germany -lrb- november 9 -rrb- , while its founders regularly participate in panel discussions and blog about new ideas . muthenthaler admits he has a soft spot for odd designs and products that some might find a little crazy - or at least unusual - but erfinderhaus has also worked on practical technological advances like streetlight dimming system autolux , as well as novel energy-saving devices and construction materials . " as an inventor you always solve a problem " , says muthenthaler . " if it 's -lsb- just -rsb- your problem , it 's your problem . but if it 's a problem someone else also has , it 's a product .
that 's the difference . "
" we are like gold diggers " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crazy or visionary ?
gyro gearloose 's profession is often misunderstood deciding which of these solutions should be realized is the real art of the business . as technology makes information easier to access and patents simpler to file , muthenthaler says more inventions are being created than ever before .
erfinderhaus receives 1,000 ideas a year .
some come as rough plans , some as finished designs .
but not all ideas are good or new .
many designs have already been patented or already exist on the market somewhere in the world . some 80 percent of proposals sent to erfinderhaus do n't make it past the first meeting , and only a few are fully developed .
" we are like gold diggers , " says muthenthaler .
" they have to get dirty and search the mud for the gold nuggets .
and that 's pretty much what we are doing .
we search for the nuggets . "
muthenthaler 's search is taking him beyond germany , austria and switzerland . erfinderhaus has launched a new website named inpama , aimed at american inventors .
the team also visited a recent international fair in seoul , south korea , to look for new products to sell at the erfinderladen .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 27.12.2010 khodorkovsky verdict was politically motivated , say observers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khodorkovsky 's trial and verdict was politically motivated , critics say observers had already predicted a " guilty " verdict in the moscow trial of jailed russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky .
many believe the lawsuit against the kremlin critic is purely politically motivated . khodorkovsky has been found guilty of stealing 218 tons of oil he owned as head of the yukos oil company and of embezzling the proceeds .
the oil magnate , a vocal critic of the policies of then-russian president vladimir putin , was first tried for tax evasion in 2003 .
since then , he has been in a siberian prison , and the trial led to the breakup of his multimillion-euro oil concern .
the eu has called on russia to respect international rights in its sentencing which is expected in the next few days .
the moscow prosecutor 's office is seeking a further six-year sentence - which observers note would keep the putin political rival locked up beyond the next presidential elections , in 2012 .
a number of human-rights activists say the real reason khodorkovsky was tried a second time is because he dared to openly criticize putin , as well as actively support opposition candidates .
constant media presence khodorkovsky 's lawyer , juri schmidt , says the trial was the kremlin 's way of dealing with its fear of the public response to a vocal critic .
" khodorkovsky … is more present in the press than ever .
i think this fear is one of the main reasons that the trial against khodorkovsky and -lrb- platon -rrb- lebedev is even being held , " schmidt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regular marches to free khodorkovsky are held in moscow his omnipresence in the media has made khodorkovsky a symbolic hero for the russian opposition , as well as for human-rights activists , schmidt added .
" the government did n't expect such an enormous resonance among the public .
the apparently restrained reaction to the first verdict made them think that it would be the same in a second trial .
but they made an error , " schmidt said .
" opinion polls show that society is increasingly looking up to khodorkovsky .
this only serves to make the government more afraid . "
khodorkovsky overstepped limits , kremlin supporters say political scientist vyacheslav nikonov , known for his close ties to the kremlin , disputes the notion that moscow is afraid of khodorkovsky .
" the russian government is n't afraid of any oligarch , whether he is banned or active .
the state has many more ways to pressure an oligarch than the other way around , " nikonov said .
" the kremlin 's image wo n't suffer measurably from the khodorkovsky trial , and khodorkovsky has little influence on political power at the moment . "
according to nikonov , moscow pursued this trial for the nation 's best interest alone .
the oil magnate was arrested not because he started any election campaigns , but because he had " bought the control of meaningful committees " in russia 's parliament .
" without his say-so , even the finance ministry could n't complete certain operations .
and when a person like that starts to attack the state , by not paying taxes - that goes well beyond the limits of what is allowed , " nikonov said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khodorkovsky could spend six more years behind bars but the president of the moscow-based research institute panorama says he thinks other motivations are in play in moscow 's decision to prosecute khodorkovsky a second time .
" if he 's free , khodorkovsky could start legal proceedings against those who stripped him of his business - namely , putin and his then-deputy igor sechin , " said vladimir pribilovsky .
" besides , they are afraid that a free khodorkovsky would unite and lead an opposition . "
another khodorkovsky lawyer , vadim klyuvgant , said the government did everything it could to see that a " guilty " verdict was handed down .
the trial was anything but fair , he said : " it is all fabrication - simply fabrication from start to finish .
from the first word to the last , written or spoken .
it is all just made up with a single goal : vengeance . "
westerwelle weighs in western leaders , including german foreign minister guido westerwelle , have been keeping an intense eye on the trial .
the german minister made known his concerns about the conditions of the trial when he visited moscow in early november .
he told his russian counterpart sergei lavrov that russia needs to take the west 's concerns seriously .
lavrov replied by stressing the independent nature of russia 's justice system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle -lrb- left -rrb- let russia 's lavrov know the west is watching in fact , a russian court can freely decide on a verdict - but it needs to have the right information to decide with , said oleg orlov , chairman of the board of memorial , a center for human rights .
he and other trial watchers believe the court was putting too much pressure on the judges to deliver a fair verdict .
" the judge ... is in a very difficult position .
i ca n't imagine how a justice with any self respect can give a guilty verdict under these conditions .
but in today 's russia , everything is possible , " orlov said .
the defense started hearing closing arguments on 27 october .
khodorkovsky took the chance to speak , and he talked for three hours .
in the end he did n't ask the court for mercy , but he asked them to keep an open mind .
likely outcome : six more years speaking with irony , he asked the court to honor the prosecutor 's enormous efforts at fabricating a case against him , saying : " honorable court , i agree that a not-guilty verdict would be almost a utopian outcome . … the prosecution has done everything in its power to see that the court has no legitimate chance to declare me not guilty .
you should respect these efforts , because next time , the prosecution can just spit on an empty sheet of paper , put a rubber stamp on it , and demand 14 years of prison .
it would amount to the same thing . "
observers say that khodorkovsky will likely be sentenced to six more years in a siberian prison camp - in which case he would n't see freedom until 2017 .
khodorkovsky 's father , 78 year old boris khodorkovsky , said he fears he will never see his son again .
" i 'm old , and am afraid that after this trial , i wo n't see him again , if he is sent to siberia .
i ca n't fly anymore , because i have bad eyesight .
i do n't know what i would do , " the elder khodorkovsky said .
if he is convicted , khodorkovsky said he would take the case to the european court of human rights in strasbourg .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 27.12.2010 khodorkovsky verdict was politically motivated , say observers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khodorkovsky 's trial and verdict was politically motivated , critics say observers had already predicted a " guilty " verdict in the moscow trial of jailed russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky .
many believe the lawsuit against the kremlin critic is purely politically motivated . khodorkovsky has been found guilty of stealing 218 tons of oil he owned as head of the yukos oil company and of embezzling the proceeds .
the oil magnate , a vocal critic of the policies of then-russian president vladimir putin , was first tried for tax evasion in 2003 .
since then , he has been in a siberian prison , and the trial led to the breakup of his multimillion-euro oil concern .
the eu has called on russia to respect international rights in its sentencing which is expected in the next few days .
the moscow prosecutor 's office is seeking a further six-year sentence - which observers note would keep the putin political rival locked up beyond the next presidential elections , in 2012 .
a number of human-rights activists say the real reason khodorkovsky was tried a second time is because he dared to openly criticize putin , as well as actively support opposition candidates .
constant media presence khodorkovsky 's lawyer , juri schmidt , says the trial was the kremlin 's way of dealing with its fear of the public response to a vocal critic .
" khodorkovsky … is more present in the press than ever .
i think this fear is one of the main reasons that the trial against khodorkovsky and -lrb- platon -rrb- lebedev is even being held , " schmidt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regular marches to free khodorkovsky are held in moscow his omnipresence in the media has made khodorkovsky a symbolic hero for the russian opposition , as well as for human-rights activists , schmidt added .
" the government did n't expect such an enormous resonance among the public .
the apparently restrained reaction to the first verdict made them think that it would be the same in a second trial .
but they made an error , " schmidt said .
" opinion polls show that society is increasingly looking up to khodorkovsky .
this only serves to make the government more afraid . "
khodorkovsky overstepped limits , kremlin supporters say political scientist vyacheslav nikonov , known for his close ties to the kremlin , disputes the notion that moscow is afraid of khodorkovsky .
" the russian government is n't afraid of any oligarch , whether he is banned or active .
the state has many more ways to pressure an oligarch than the other way around , " nikonov said .
" the kremlin 's image wo n't suffer measurably from the khodorkovsky trial , and khodorkovsky has little influence on political power at the moment . "
according to nikonov , moscow pursued this trial for the nation 's best interest alone .
the oil magnate was arrested not because he started any election campaigns , but because he had " bought the control of meaningful committees " in russia 's parliament .
" without his say-so , even the finance ministry could n't complete certain operations .
and when a person like that starts to attack the state , by not paying taxes - that goes well beyond the limits of what is allowed , " nikonov said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khodorkovsky could spend six more years behind bars but the president of the moscow-based research institute panorama says he thinks other motivations are in play in moscow 's decision to prosecute khodorkovsky a second time .
" if he 's free , khodorkovsky could start legal proceedings against those who stripped him of his business - namely , putin and his then-deputy igor sechin , " said vladimir pribilovsky .
" besides , they are afraid that a free khodorkovsky would unite and lead an opposition . "
another khodorkovsky lawyer , vadim klyuvgant , said the government did everything it could to see that a " guilty " verdict was handed down .
the trial was anything but fair , he said : " it is all fabrication - simply fabrication from start to finish .
from the first word to the last , written or spoken .
it is all just made up with a single goal : vengeance . "
westerwelle weighs in western leaders , including german foreign minister guido westerwelle , have been keeping an intense eye on the trial .
the german minister made known his concerns about the conditions of the trial when he visited moscow in early november .
he told his russian counterpart sergei lavrov that russia needs to take the west 's concerns seriously .
lavrov replied by stressing the independent nature of russia 's justice system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle -lrb- left -rrb- let russia 's lavrov know the west is watching in fact , a russian court can freely decide on a verdict - but it needs to have the right information to decide with , said oleg orlov , chairman of the board of memorial , a center for human rights .
he and other trial watchers believe the court was putting too much pressure on the judges to deliver a fair verdict .
" the judge ... is in a very difficult position .
i ca n't imagine how a justice with any self respect can give a guilty verdict under these conditions .
but in today 's russia , everything is possible , " orlov said .
the defense started hearing closing arguments on 27 october .
khodorkovsky took the chance to speak , and he talked for three hours .
in the end he did n't ask the court for mercy , but he asked them to keep an open mind .
likely outcome : six more years speaking with irony , he asked the court to honor the prosecutor 's enormous efforts at fabricating a case against him , saying : " honorable court , i agree that a not-guilty verdict would be almost a utopian outcome . … the prosecution has done everything in its power to see that the court has no legitimate chance to declare me not guilty .
you should respect these efforts , because next time , the prosecution can just spit on an empty sheet of paper , put a rubber stamp on it , and demand 14 years of prison .
it would amount to the same thing . "
observers say that khodorkovsky will likely be sentenced to six more years in a siberian prison camp - in which case he would n't see freedom until 2017 .

berlin-based erfinderhaus helps inventors develop new products ; the erfinderladen sells them . at berlin 's erfinderladen , or inventor 's shop , things are n't always what they seem : the cans ofdog food , batteries and soft drinks on display are actually clever stash safes designed by local inventor stefan neser .
neser picks up what looks and feels like a full can of cola .
then , he unscrews the top to reveal a small hiding place , with room for a wad of cash , some jewelry , or a small mobile phone . neser works with big name manufacturers like pepsico , duracell and bonduelle , swapping his safes for their labels , which come complete with multi-lingual eu ingredient lists and instructions for use . giving inventors a chance to enter the market the erfinderladen is packed with quirky and clever inventions . there 's a waterproof notepad for jotting down ideas in the shower , a device to hold up your book while you read in bed , felted boots for walking warmly in the snow , and a two-inch keychain that converts into what 's believed to be the world 's smallest corkscrew . roughly 95 percent of the items in the shop were developed by german inventors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inventor stefan neser swaps his safes for labels of big name manufacturers the collection is maintained by marijan jordan and gerhard muthenthaler , who opened the store as a spin-off from their main project , erfinderhaus .
together they advise would-be inventors on how to file patent applications , where to find development money , and how to deal with manufacturers .
muthenthaler says they wanted to both raise public awareness about erfinderhaus ' mostly invisible services and provide a launch pad for the new items they 've helped develop . " at the erfinderladen we can show what we do , show the products , and give inventors a chance so that when they only have 100 pieces handmade , they can also enter the market , " muthenthaler explains .
another advantage : it 's a test market situation .
when clients respond positively , muthenthaler and jordan take the product to big retailers and tell them about it . muthenthaler and jordan started their consulting business in 1997 in salzburg , austria , but found more fertile ground in the lively german capital .
the two learned firsthand how tough life can be for novice inventors . their first invention was an idea for a watch that could allow its wearer to identify and connect with people sharing the same likes and interests - a kind of a social network website on your wrist . when they tried to get the idea developed , the experience pushed them in a new direction .
" our first business meeting was with swatch , the biggest swiss company for watches .
we went to this meeting as students - we drove our mom 's car , " jordan recalls . that first meeting was informative but frustrating .
the duo drove home and started searching for a company that offered advice to inventors .
they found a few in the united states , but none in germany .
so they decided to invent their own .
crazy men in basements ?
the german market needs the support even though its inventors generate a similar number of patents to japan , which is only outperformed by the united states .
german business culture , with its rigid processes and conservative attitudes , is wary of entrepreneurs .
adding to that , muthenthaler says , inventors now mostly work in teams for big companies like apple and siemens , and are n't identified as individuals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muthenthaler -lrb- right -rrb- and jordan founded erfinderhaus to help to inventors muthenthaler says the bias is inherent in the germany language itself , starting with the word erfinder .
“ ' erfinder ' has the same meaning as ' inventor . '
but ' inventor ' in the anglo-american context would be an entrepreneur in the beginning , a visionary .
and here , it 's kind of the crazy guy who works in his basement on some stupid inventions .
that 's the public conception of the word , " he says .
erfinderhaus has been on a battle to rebrand the word erfinder as a respectable descriptor and profession . it actively in promotes " inventor 's day " in germany -lrb- november 9 -rrb- , while its founders regularly participate in panel discussions and blog about new ideas . muthenthaler admits he has a soft spot for odd designs and products that some might find a little crazy - or at least unusual - but erfinderhaus has also worked on practical technological advances like streetlight dimming system autolux , as well as novel energy-saving devices and construction materials . " as an inventor you always solve a problem " , says muthenthaler . " if it 's -lsb- just -rsb- your problem , it 's your problem . but if it 's a problem someone else also has , it 's a product .
that 's the difference . "
" we are like gold diggers " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crazy or visionary ?
gyro gearloose 's profession is often misunderstood deciding which of these solutions should be realized is the real art of the business . as technology makes information easier to access and patents simpler to file , muthenthaler says more inventions are being created than ever before .
erfinderhaus receives 1,000 ideas a year .
some come as rough plans , some as finished designs .
but not all ideas are good or new .
many designs have already been patented or already exist on the market somewhere in the world . some 80 percent of proposals sent to erfinderhaus do n't make it past the first meeting , and only a few are fully developed .
" we are like gold diggers , " says muthenthaler .
" they have to get dirty and search the mud for the gold nuggets .
and that 's pretty much what we are doing .
we search for the nuggets . "
muthenthaler 's search is taking him beyond germany , austria and switzerland . erfinderhaus has launched a new website named inpama , aimed at american inventors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 27.12.2010 khodorkovsky verdict was politically motivated , say observers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khodorkovsky 's trial and verdict was politically motivated , critics say observers had already predicted a " guilty " verdict in the moscow trial of jailed russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky .
many believe the lawsuit against the kremlin critic is purely politically motivated . khodorkovsky has been found guilty of stealing 218 tons of oil he owned as head of the yukos oil company and of embezzling the proceeds .
the oil magnate , a vocal critic of the policies of then-russian president vladimir putin , was first tried for tax evasion in 2003 .
since then , he has been in a siberian prison , and the trial led to the breakup of his multimillion-euro oil concern .
the eu has called on russia to respect international rights in its sentencing which is expected in the next few days .
the moscow prosecutor 's office is seeking a further six-year sentence - which observers note would keep the putin political rival locked up beyond the next presidential elections , in 2012 .
a number of human-rights activists say the real reason khodorkovsky was tried a second time is because he dared to openly criticize putin , as well as actively support opposition candidates .
constant media presence khodorkovsky 's lawyer , juri schmidt , says the trial was the kremlin 's way of dealing with its fear of the public response to a vocal critic .
" khodorkovsky … is more present in the press than ever .
i think this fear is one of the main reasons that the trial against khodorkovsky and -lrb- platon -rrb- lebedev is even being held , " schmidt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regular marches to free khodorkovsky are held in moscow his omnipresence in the media has made khodorkovsky a symbolic hero for the russian opposition , as well as for human-rights activists , schmidt added .
" the government did n't expect such an enormous resonance among the public .
the apparently restrained reaction to the first verdict made them think that it would be the same in a second trial .
but they made an error , " schmidt said .
" opinion polls show that society is increasingly looking up to khodorkovsky .
this only serves to make the government more afraid . "
khodorkovsky overstepped limits , kremlin supporters say political scientist vyacheslav nikonov , known for his close ties to the kremlin , disputes the notion that moscow is afraid of khodorkovsky .
" the russian government is n't afraid of any oligarch , whether he is banned or active .
the state has many more ways to pressure an oligarch than the other way around , " nikonov said .
" the kremlin 's image wo n't suffer measurably from the khodorkovsky trial , and khodorkovsky has little influence on political power at the moment . "
according to nikonov , moscow pursued this trial for the nation 's best interest alone .
the oil magnate was arrested not because he started any election campaigns , but because he had " bought the control of meaningful committees " in russia 's parliament .
" without his say-so , even the finance ministry could n't complete certain operations .
and when a person like that starts to attack the state , by not paying taxes - that goes well beyond the limits of what is allowed , " nikonov said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khodorkovsky could spend six more years behind bars but the president of the moscow-based research institute panorama says he thinks other motivations are in play in moscow 's decision to prosecute khodorkovsky a second time .
" if he 's free , khodorkovsky could start legal proceedings against those who stripped him of his business - namely , putin and his then-deputy igor sechin , " said vladimir pribilovsky .
" besides , they are afraid that a free khodorkovsky would unite and lead an opposition . "
another khodorkovsky lawyer , vadim klyuvgant , said the government did everything it could to see that a " guilty " verdict was handed down .
the trial was anything but fair , he said : " it is all fabrication - simply fabrication from start to finish .
from the first word to the last , written or spoken .
it is all just made up with a single goal : vengeance . "
westerwelle weighs in western leaders , including german foreign minister guido westerwelle , have been keeping an intense eye on the trial .
the german minister made known his concerns about the conditions of the trial when he visited moscow in early november .
he told his russian counterpart sergei lavrov that russia needs to take the west 's concerns seriously .
lavrov replied by stressing the independent nature of russia 's justice system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle -lrb- left -rrb- let russia 's lavrov know the west is watching in fact , a russian court can freely decide on a verdict - but it needs to have the right information to decide with , said oleg orlov , chairman of the board of memorial , a center for human rights .
he and other trial watchers believe the court was putting too much pressure on the judges to deliver a fair verdict .
" the judge ... is in a very difficult position .
i ca n't imagine how a justice with any self respect can give a guilty verdict under these conditions .
but in today 's russia , everything is possible , " orlov said .
the defense started hearing closing arguments on 27 october .
khodorkovsky took the chance to speak , and he talked for three hours .
in the end he did n't ask the court for mercy , but he asked them to keep an open mind .
likely outcome : six more years speaking with irony , he asked the court to honor the prosecutor 's enormous efforts at fabricating a case against him , saying : " honorable court , i agree that a not-guilty verdict would be almost a utopian outcome . … the prosecution has done everything in its power to see that the court has no legitimate chance to declare me not guilty .
you should respect these efforts , because next time , the prosecution can just spit on an empty sheet of paper , put a rubber stamp on it , and demand 14 years of prison .
it would amount to the same thing . "
observers say that khodorkovsky will likely be sentenced to six more years in a siberian prison camp - in which case he would n't see freedom until 2017 .
khodorkovsky 's father , 78 year old boris khodorkovsky , said he fears he will never see his son again .
" i 'm old , and am afraid that after this trial , i wo n't see him again , if he is sent to siberia .
i ca n't fly anymore , because i have bad eyesight .
i do n't know what i would do , " the elder khodorkovsky said .
if he is convicted , khodorkovsky said he would take the case to the european court of human rights in strasbourg .

it has found some unusual ways of doing this . tallinn is preparing for its moment in the spotlight as the european capital of culture 2011 . over 250 different events and festivals have been planned for the coming year that center on the motto , " stories of the seashore , " which hints at estonian history and reflects tallinn ’ s location next to the sea . according to maris hellrand , spokeswoman for the tallinn 2011 organizational committee , the relationship between tallinn and the sea is of particular importance .
until the end of the soviet union 's reign over estonia , which ended in 1991 , the city 's shores were a restricted military zone .
the soldiers are no longer there today , but access to the sea is still largely obstructed .
this is set to change in 2011 . " at the moment , there 's still an old jail at the seashore , " said hellrand .
" we want to transform the seaside promenade in front of it into a ' culture kilometer . " ' the culture kilometer is the planned heart for the year 's celebrations , with most of the tallinn 2011 events taking place there . unusual attractions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the event planners have many unusual ideas estonia , which is due to join the euro currency zone on january 1 , wants to present itself as a modern european country in 2011 .
this image allows for some breaks with tradition , such as the film project " 60 seconds of solitude in the year zero . "
according to its initiator indrek kasela , it is " a declaration of love to the cinema . " " we asked film directors from around the world to produce one-minute clips on the topic of solitude , " said kasela .
" they will be put together into a one-hour film . " the film is due to be screened in august - not at a movie theater but on a large screen mounted in the sea .
the audience will be able to see it from the shore and watch as it bursts into flames together with the film reel at the end of the screening .
as only one copy of the film reel will be produced , the event will be unique in the truest sense of the word . another project offers more long-term entertainment .
planned for may , " mim goes sustainable " is a mixture of performance and theater - but with a twist .
it involves audience members producing electricity for the stage lighting by pedaling on indoor bikes .
in this way , they help create a stage show that does not depend on fossil fuels . a look into the estonian soul the creators of tallinn 2011 hope to combine the future with tradition .
the youth song and dance celebration festival aims to exemplify that combination and will serve as one of the main capital of culture events . choral singing is an important tradition in estonia 's history , having played a key role in the singing revolution - a series of spontaneous mass-singing demonstrations that took place between 1987 and 1991 to help bring about estonia 's independence from the soviet union . in 2011 , thousands are expected to gather at the tallinn song festival grounds for several days in a special commemoration the 20th anniversary of independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many will sing again at the city 's song festival grounds " this festival is an opportunity to get a glimpse into the estonian soul within one weekend , " said hellrand .
" this is what we are .
this is why we are . " another highlight will be the tallinn maritime days , july 15 to 17 , hailed as the largest free family event in estonia .
a new exhibition will open at the estonian maritime museum in the renovated hangars of the former seaplane port .
walkers will also be able to enjoy the newly opened seaside promenade . in late december , a closing ceremony will be held in the center of the city .
combining tradition and modern technology , church tower bells will ring out over the old town , playing a tune composed especially for the occasion .
they will remind all those who hear them of tallinn 's cultural treasures , while at the same time allowing the city to take a final bow as the european capital of culture . author : friedel taube -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : greg wiser send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was hoped the strike would help convince incumbent president gbagbo to step down . a call for a general strike in ivory coast to pressure incumbent president laurent gbagbo into conceding power have failed to take hold .
in the country 's biggest city , abidjan , business largely went on as usual . the general strike was called for on sunday by supporters of alassane ouattara , the internationally recognized winner of ivory coast 's november presidential election . despite the united nations , the european union , the african union and the economic community of west african states -lrb- ecowas -rrb- all recognizing ouattara as the winner of the november 28 election , gbagbo continues to refuse to step down .
he says the election was rigged and was part of a plot against him orchestrated by france and the united states . the failed strike comes a day ahead of a trip to ivory coast by three ecowas leaders - the presidents of benin , sierra leone and cape verde - to try and personally convince gbagbo to step down .
should their bid fail , ecowas has threatened to take military action . threat of renewed civil war the standoff between the two presidential candidates has led to increased tension in the country , and around 200 people have already been killed in the election aftermath , according to the un human rights council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gbagbo has refused to relinquish power the unhrc also says at least 14,000 ivorians have fled to neighboring liberia , fearful of a return to the 2002-2003 civil war in ivory coast .

it has found some unusual ways of doing this . tallinn is preparing for its moment in the spotlight as the european capital of culture 2011 . over 250 different events and festivals have been planned for the coming year that center on the motto , " stories of the seashore , " which hints at estonian history and reflects tallinn ’ s location next to the sea . according to maris hellrand , spokeswoman for the tallinn 2011 organizational committee , the relationship between tallinn and the sea is of particular importance .
until the end of the soviet union 's reign over estonia , which ended in 1991 , the city 's shores were a restricted military zone .
the soldiers are no longer there today , but access to the sea is still largely obstructed .
this is set to change in 2011 . " at the moment , there 's still an old jail at the seashore , " said hellrand .
" we want to transform the seaside promenade in front of it into a ' culture kilometer . " ' the culture kilometer is the planned heart for the year 's celebrations , with most of the tallinn 2011 events taking place there . unusual attractions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the event planners have many unusual ideas estonia , which is due to join the euro currency zone on january 1 , wants to present itself as a modern european country in 2011 .
this image allows for some breaks with tradition , such as the film project " 60 seconds of solitude in the year zero . "
according to its initiator indrek kasela , it is " a declaration of love to the cinema . " " we asked film directors from around the world to produce one-minute clips on the topic of solitude , " said kasela .
" they will be put together into a one-hour film . " the film is due to be screened in august - not at a movie theater but on a large screen mounted in the sea .
the audience will be able to see it from the shore and watch as it bursts into flames together with the film reel at the end of the screening .
as only one copy of the film reel will be produced , the event will be unique in the truest sense of the word . another project offers more long-term entertainment .
planned for may , " mim goes sustainable " is a mixture of performance and theater - but with a twist .
it involves audience members producing electricity for the stage lighting by pedaling on indoor bikes .
in this way , they help create a stage show that does not depend on fossil fuels . a look into the estonian soul the creators of tallinn 2011 hope to combine the future with tradition .
the youth song and dance celebration festival aims to exemplify that combination and will serve as one of the main capital of culture events . choral singing is an important tradition in estonia 's history , having played a key role in the singing revolution - a series of spontaneous mass-singing demonstrations that took place between 1987 and 1991 to help bring about estonia 's independence from the soviet union . in 2011 , thousands are expected to gather at the tallinn song festival grounds for several days in a special commemoration the 20th anniversary of independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many will sing again at the city 's song festival grounds " this festival is an opportunity to get a glimpse into the estonian soul within one weekend , " said hellrand .
" this is what we are .
this is why we are . " another highlight will be the tallinn maritime days , july 15 to 17 , hailed as the largest free family event in estonia .
a new exhibition will open at the estonian maritime museum in the renovated hangars of the former seaplane port .
walkers will also be able to enjoy the newly opened seaside promenade . in late december , a closing ceremony will be held in the center of the city .
combining tradition and modern technology , church tower bells will ring out over the old town , playing a tune composed especially for the occasion .
they will remind all those who hear them of tallinn 's cultural treasures , while at the same time allowing the city to take a final bow as the european capital of culture . author : friedel taube -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : greg wiser send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 27.12.2010 khodorkovsky verdict was politically motivated , say observers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khodorkovsky 's trial and verdict was politically motivated , critics say observers had already predicted a " guilty " verdict in the moscow trial of jailed russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky .
many believe the lawsuit against the kremlin critic is purely politically motivated . khodorkovsky has been found guilty of stealing 218 tons of oil he owned as head of the yukos oil company and of embezzling the proceeds .
the oil magnate , a vocal critic of the policies of then-russian president vladimir putin , was first tried for tax evasion in 2003 .
since then , he has been in a siberian prison , and the trial led to the breakup of his multimillion-euro oil concern .
the eu has called on russia to respect international rights in its sentencing which is expected in the next few days .
the moscow prosecutor 's office is seeking a further six-year sentence - which observers note would keep the putin political rival locked up beyond the next presidential elections , in 2012 .
a number of human-rights activists say the real reason khodorkovsky was tried a second time is because he dared to openly criticize putin , as well as actively support opposition candidates .
constant media presence khodorkovsky 's lawyer , juri schmidt , says the trial was the kremlin 's way of dealing with its fear of the public response to a vocal critic .
" khodorkovsky … is more present in the press than ever .
i think this fear is one of the main reasons that the trial against khodorkovsky and -lrb- platon -rrb- lebedev is even being held , " schmidt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regular marches to free khodorkovsky are held in moscow his omnipresence in the media has made khodorkovsky a symbolic hero for the russian opposition , as well as for human-rights activists , schmidt added .
" the government did n't expect such an enormous resonance among the public .
the apparently restrained reaction to the first verdict made them think that it would be the same in a second trial .
but they made an error , " schmidt said .
" opinion polls show that society is increasingly looking up to khodorkovsky .
this only serves to make the government more afraid . "
khodorkovsky overstepped limits , kremlin supporters say political scientist vyacheslav nikonov , known for his close ties to the kremlin , disputes the notion that moscow is afraid of khodorkovsky .
" the russian government is n't afraid of any oligarch , whether he is banned or active .
the state has many more ways to pressure an oligarch than the other way around , " nikonov said .
" the kremlin 's image wo n't suffer measurably from the khodorkovsky trial , and khodorkovsky has little influence on political power at the moment . "
according to nikonov , moscow pursued this trial for the nation 's best interest alone .
the oil magnate was arrested not because he started any election campaigns , but because he had " bought the control of meaningful committees " in russia 's parliament .
" without his say-so , even the finance ministry could n't complete certain operations .
and when a person like that starts to attack the state , by not paying taxes - that goes well beyond the limits of what is allowed , " nikonov said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khodorkovsky could spend six more years behind bars but the president of the moscow-based research institute panorama says he thinks other motivations are in play in moscow 's decision to prosecute khodorkovsky a second time .
" if he 's free , khodorkovsky could start legal proceedings against those who stripped him of his business - namely , putin and his then-deputy igor sechin , " said vladimir pribilovsky .
" besides , they are afraid that a free khodorkovsky would unite and lead an opposition . "
another khodorkovsky lawyer , vadim klyuvgant , said the government did everything it could to see that a " guilty " verdict was handed down .
the trial was anything but fair , he said : " it is all fabrication - simply fabrication from start to finish .
from the first word to the last , written or spoken .
it is all just made up with a single goal : vengeance . "
westerwelle weighs in western leaders , including german foreign minister guido westerwelle , have been keeping an intense eye on the trial .
the german minister made known his concerns about the conditions of the trial when he visited moscow in early november .
he told his russian counterpart sergei lavrov that russia needs to take the west 's concerns seriously .
lavrov replied by stressing the independent nature of russia 's justice system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle -lrb- left -rrb- let russia 's lavrov know the west is watching in fact , a russian court can freely decide on a verdict - but it needs to have the right information to decide with , said oleg orlov , chairman of the board of memorial , a center for human rights .
he and other trial watchers believe the court was putting too much pressure on the judges to deliver a fair verdict .
" the judge ... is in a very difficult position .
i ca n't imagine how a justice with any self respect can give a guilty verdict under these conditions .
but in today 's russia , everything is possible , " orlov said .
the defense started hearing closing arguments on 27 october .
khodorkovsky took the chance to speak , and he talked for three hours .
in the end he did n't ask the court for mercy , but he asked them to keep an open mind .
likely outcome : six more years speaking with irony , he asked the court to honor the prosecutor 's enormous efforts at fabricating a case against him , saying : " honorable court , i agree that a not-guilty verdict would be almost a utopian outcome . … the prosecution has done everything in its power to see that the court has no legitimate chance to declare me not guilty .
you should respect these efforts , because next time , the prosecution can just spit on an empty sheet of paper , put a rubber stamp on it , and demand 14 years of prison .
it would amount to the same thing . "
observers say that khodorkovsky will likely be sentenced to six more years in a siberian prison camp - in which case he would n't see freedom until 2017 .
khodorkovsky 's father , 78 year old boris khodorkovsky , said he fears he will never see his son again .
" i 'm old , and am afraid that after this trial , i wo n't see him again , if he is sent to siberia .
i ca n't fly anymore , because i have bad eyesight .
i do n't know what i would do , " the elder khodorkovsky said .
if he is convicted , khodorkovsky said he would take the case to the european court of human rights in strasbourg .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 27.12.2010 khodorkovsky verdict was politically motivated , say observers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khodorkovsky 's trial and verdict was politically motivated , critics say observers had already predicted a " guilty " verdict in the moscow trial of jailed russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky .
many believe the lawsuit against the kremlin critic is purely politically motivated . khodorkovsky has been found guilty of stealing 218 tons of oil he owned as head of the yukos oil company and of embezzling the proceeds .
the oil magnate , a vocal critic of the policies of then-russian president vladimir putin , was first tried for tax evasion in 2003 .
since then , he has been in a siberian prison , and the trial led to the breakup of his multimillion-euro oil concern .
the eu has called on russia to respect international rights in its sentencing which is expected in the next few days .
the moscow prosecutor 's office is seeking a further six-year sentence - which observers note would keep the putin political rival locked up beyond the next presidential elections , in 2012 .
a number of human-rights activists say the real reason khodorkovsky was tried a second time is because he dared to openly criticize putin , as well as actively support opposition candidates .
constant media presence khodorkovsky 's lawyer , juri schmidt , says the trial was the kremlin 's way of dealing with its fear of the public response to a vocal critic .
" khodorkovsky … is more present in the press than ever .
i think this fear is one of the main reasons that the trial against khodorkovsky and -lrb- platon -rrb- lebedev is even being held , " schmidt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regular marches to free khodorkovsky are held in moscow his omnipresence in the media has made khodorkovsky a symbolic hero for the russian opposition , as well as for human-rights activists , schmidt added .
" the government did n't expect such an enormous resonance among the public .
the apparently restrained reaction to the first verdict made them think that it would be the same in a second trial .
but they made an error , " schmidt said .
" opinion polls show that society is increasingly looking up to khodorkovsky .
this only serves to make the government more afraid . "
khodorkovsky overstepped limits , kremlin supporters say political scientist vyacheslav nikonov , known for his close ties to the kremlin , disputes the notion that moscow is afraid of khodorkovsky .
" the russian government is n't afraid of any oligarch , whether he is banned or active .
the state has many more ways to pressure an oligarch than the other way around , " nikonov said .
" the kremlin 's image wo n't suffer measurably from the khodorkovsky trial , and khodorkovsky has little influence on political power at the moment . "
according to nikonov , moscow pursued this trial for the nation 's best interest alone .
the oil magnate was arrested not because he started any election campaigns , but because he had " bought the control of meaningful committees " in russia 's parliament .
" without his say-so , even the finance ministry could n't complete certain operations .
and when a person like that starts to attack the state , by not paying taxes - that goes well beyond the limits of what is allowed , " nikonov said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khodorkovsky could spend six more years behind bars but the president of the moscow-based research institute panorama says he thinks other motivations are in play in moscow 's decision to prosecute khodorkovsky a second time .
" if he 's free , khodorkovsky could start legal proceedings against those who stripped him of his business - namely , putin and his then-deputy igor sechin , " said vladimir pribilovsky .
" besides , they are afraid that a free khodorkovsky would unite and lead an opposition . "
another khodorkovsky lawyer , vadim klyuvgant , said the government did everything it could to see that a " guilty " verdict was handed down .
the trial was anything but fair , he said : " it is all fabrication - simply fabrication from start to finish .
from the first word to the last , written or spoken .
it is all just made up with a single goal : vengeance . "
westerwelle weighs in western leaders , including german foreign minister guido westerwelle , have been keeping an intense eye on the trial .
the german minister made known his concerns about the conditions of the trial when he visited moscow in early november .
he told his russian counterpart sergei lavrov that russia needs to take the west 's concerns seriously .
lavrov replied by stressing the independent nature of russia 's justice system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle -lrb- left -rrb- let russia 's lavrov know the west is watching in fact , a russian court can freely decide on a verdict - but it needs to have the right information to decide with , said oleg orlov , chairman of the board of memorial , a center for human rights .
he and other trial watchers believe the court was putting too much pressure on the judges to deliver a fair verdict .
" the judge ... is in a very difficult position .
i ca n't imagine how a justice with any self respect can give a guilty verdict under these conditions .
but in today 's russia , everything is possible , " orlov said .
the defense started hearing closing arguments on 27 october .
khodorkovsky took the chance to speak , and he talked for three hours .
in the end he did n't ask the court for mercy , but he asked them to keep an open mind .
likely outcome : six more years speaking with irony , he asked the court to honor the prosecutor 's enormous efforts at fabricating a case against him , saying : " honorable court , i agree that a not-guilty verdict would be almost a utopian outcome . … the prosecution has done everything in its power to see that the court has no legitimate chance to declare me not guilty .
you should respect these efforts , because next time , the prosecution can just spit on an empty sheet of paper , put a rubber stamp on it , and demand 14 years of prison .
it would amount to the same thing . "
observers say that khodorkovsky will likely be sentenced to six more years in a siberian prison camp - in which case he would n't see freedom until 2017 .
khodorkovsky 's father , 78 year old boris khodorkovsky , said he fears he will never see his son again .
" i 'm old , and am afraid that after this trial , i wo n't see him again , if he is sent to siberia .
i ca n't fly anymore , because i have bad eyesight .
i do n't know what i would do , " the elder khodorkovsky said .
if he is convicted , khodorkovsky said he would take the case to the european court of human rights in strasbourg .

berlin-based erfinderhaus helps inventors develop new products ; the erfinderladen sells them . at berlin 's erfinderladen , or inventor 's shop , things are n't always what they seem : the cans ofdog food , batteries and soft drinks on display are actually clever stash safes designed by local inventor stefan neser .
neser picks up what looks and feels like a full can of cola .
then , he unscrews the top to reveal a small hiding place , with room for a wad of cash , some jewelry , or a small mobile phone . neser works with big name manufacturers like pepsico , duracell and bonduelle , swapping his safes for their labels , which come complete with multi-lingual eu ingredient lists and instructions for use . giving inventors a chance to enter the market the erfinderladen is packed with quirky and clever inventions . there 's a waterproof notepad for jotting down ideas in the shower , a device to hold up your book while you read in bed , felted boots for walking warmly in the snow , and a two-inch keychain that converts into what 's believed to be the world 's smallest corkscrew . roughly 95 percent of the items in the shop were developed by german inventors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inventor stefan neser swaps his safes for labels of big name manufacturers the collection is maintained by marijan jordan and gerhard muthenthaler , who opened the store as a spin-off from their main project , erfinderhaus .
together they advise would-be inventors on how to file patent applications , where to find development money , and how to deal with manufacturers .
muthenthaler says they wanted to both raise public awareness about erfinderhaus ' mostly invisible services and provide a launch pad for the new items they 've helped develop . " at the erfinderladen we can show what we do , show the products , and give inventors a chance so that when they only have 100 pieces handmade , they can also enter the market , " muthenthaler explains .
another advantage : it 's a test market situation .
when clients respond positively , muthenthaler and jordan take the product to big retailers and tell them about it . muthenthaler and jordan started their consulting business in 1997 in salzburg , austria , but found more fertile ground in the lively german capital .
the two learned firsthand how tough life can be for novice inventors . their first invention was an idea for a watch that could allow its wearer to identify and connect with people sharing the same likes and interests - a kind of a social network website on your wrist . when they tried to get the idea developed , the experience pushed them in a new direction .
" our first business meeting was with swatch , the biggest swiss company for watches .
we went to this meeting as students - we drove our mom 's car , " jordan recalls . that first meeting was informative but frustrating .
the duo drove home and started searching for a company that offered advice to inventors .
they found a few in the united states , but none in germany .
so they decided to invent their own .
crazy men in basements ?
the german market needs the support even though its inventors generate a similar number of patents to japan , which is only outperformed by the united states .
german business culture , with its rigid processes and conservative attitudes , is wary of entrepreneurs .
adding to that , muthenthaler says , inventors now mostly work in teams for big companies like apple and siemens , and are n't identified as individuals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muthenthaler -lrb- right -rrb- and jordan founded erfinderhaus to help to inventors muthenthaler says the bias is inherent in the germany language itself , starting with the word erfinder .
“ ' erfinder ' has the same meaning as ' inventor . '
but ' inventor ' in the anglo-american context would be an entrepreneur in the beginning , a visionary .
and here , it 's kind of the crazy guy who works in his basement on some stupid inventions .
that 's the public conception of the word , " he says .
erfinderhaus has been on a battle to rebrand the word erfinder as a respectable descriptor and profession . it actively in promotes " inventor 's day " in germany -lrb- november 9 -rrb- , while its founders regularly participate in panel discussions and blog about new ideas . muthenthaler admits he has a soft spot for odd designs and products that some might find a little crazy - or at least unusual - but erfinderhaus has also worked on practical technological advances like streetlight dimming system autolux , as well as novel energy-saving devices and construction materials . " as an inventor you always solve a problem " , says muthenthaler . " if it 's -lsb- just -rsb- your problem , it 's your problem . but if it 's a problem someone else also has , it 's a product .
that 's the difference . "
" we are like gold diggers " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crazy or visionary ?
gyro gearloose 's profession is often misunderstood deciding which of these solutions should be realized is the real art of the business . as technology makes information easier to access and patents simpler to file , muthenthaler says more inventions are being created than ever before .
erfinderhaus receives 1,000 ideas a year .
some come as rough plans , some as finished designs .
but not all ideas are good or new .
many designs have already been patented or already exist on the market somewhere in the world . some 80 percent of proposals sent to erfinderhaus do n't make it past the first meeting , and only a few are fully developed .
" we are like gold diggers , " says muthenthaler .
" they have to get dirty and search the mud for the gold nuggets .
and that 's pretty much what we are doing .
we search for the nuggets . "
muthenthaler 's search is taking him beyond germany , austria and switzerland . erfinderhaus has launched a new website named inpama , aimed at american inventors .
the team also visited a recent international fair in seoul , south korea , to look for new products to sell at the erfinderladen .

many believe the lawsuit against the kremlin critic is purely politically motivated . khodorkovsky has been found guilty of stealing 218 tons of oil he owned as head of the yukos oil company and of embezzling the proceeds .
the oil magnate , a vocal critic of the policies of then-russian president vladimir putin , was first tried for tax evasion in 2003 .
since then , he has been in a siberian prison , and the trial led to the breakup of his multimillion-euro oil concern .
the eu has called on russia to respect international rights in its sentencing which is expected in the next few days .
the moscow prosecutor 's office is seeking a further six-year sentence - which observers note would keep the putin political rival locked up beyond the next presidential elections , in 2012 .
a number of human-rights activists say the real reason khodorkovsky was tried a second time is because he dared to openly criticize putin , as well as actively support opposition candidates .
constant media presence khodorkovsky 's lawyer , juri schmidt , says the trial was the kremlin 's way of dealing with its fear of the public response to a vocal critic .
" khodorkovsky … is more present in the press than ever .
i think this fear is one of the main reasons that the trial against khodorkovsky and -lrb- platon -rrb- lebedev is even being held , " schmidt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regular marches to free khodorkovsky are held in moscow his omnipresence in the media has made khodorkovsky a symbolic hero for the russian opposition , as well as for human-rights activists , schmidt added .
" the government did n't expect such an enormous resonance among the public .
the apparently restrained reaction to the first verdict made them think that it would be the same in a second trial .
but they made an error , " schmidt said .
" opinion polls show that society is increasingly looking up to khodorkovsky .
this only serves to make the government more afraid . "
khodorkovsky overstepped limits , kremlin supporters say political scientist vyacheslav nikonov , known for his close ties to the kremlin , disputes the notion that moscow is afraid of khodorkovsky .
" the russian government is n't afraid of any oligarch , whether he is banned or active .
the state has many more ways to pressure an oligarch than the other way around , " nikonov said .
" the kremlin 's image wo n't suffer measurably from the khodorkovsky trial , and khodorkovsky has little influence on political power at the moment . "
according to nikonov , moscow pursued this trial for the nation 's best interest alone .
the oil magnate was arrested not because he started any election campaigns , but because he had " bought the control of meaningful committees " in russia 's parliament .
" without his say-so , even the finance ministry could n't complete certain operations .
and when a person like that starts to attack the state , by not paying taxes - that goes well beyond the limits of what is allowed , " nikonov said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khodorkovsky could spend six more years behind bars but the president of the moscow-based research institute panorama says he thinks other motivations are in play in moscow 's decision to prosecute khodorkovsky a second time .
" if he 's free , khodorkovsky could start legal proceedings against those who stripped him of his business - namely , putin and his then-deputy igor sechin , " said vladimir pribilovsky .
" besides , they are afraid that a free khodorkovsky would unite and lead an opposition . "
another khodorkovsky lawyer , vadim klyuvgant , said the government did everything it could to see that a " guilty " verdict was handed down .
the trial was anything but fair , he said : " it is all fabrication - simply fabrication from start to finish .
from the first word to the last , written or spoken .
it is all just made up with a single goal : vengeance . "
westerwelle weighs in western leaders , including german foreign minister guido westerwelle , have been keeping an intense eye on the trial .
the german minister made known his concerns about the conditions of the trial when he visited moscow in early november .
he told his russian counterpart sergei lavrov that russia needs to take the west 's concerns seriously .
lavrov replied by stressing the independent nature of russia 's justice system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle -lrb- left -rrb- let russia 's lavrov know the west is watching in fact , a russian court can freely decide on a verdict - but it needs to have the right information to decide with , said oleg orlov , chairman of the board of memorial , a center for human rights .
he and other trial watchers believe the court was putting too much pressure on the judges to deliver a fair verdict .
" the judge ... is in a very difficult position .
i ca n't imagine how a justice with any self respect can give a guilty verdict under these conditions .
but in today 's russia , everything is possible , " orlov said .
the defense started hearing closing arguments on 27 october .
khodorkovsky took the chance to speak , and he talked for three hours .
in the end he did n't ask the court for mercy , but he asked them to keep an open mind .
likely outcome : six more years speaking with irony , he asked the court to honor the prosecutor 's enormous efforts at fabricating a case against him , saying : " honorable court , i agree that a not-guilty verdict would be almost a utopian outcome . … the prosecution has done everything in its power to see that the court has no legitimate chance to declare me not guilty .
you should respect these efforts , because next time , the prosecution can just spit on an empty sheet of paper , put a rubber stamp on it , and demand 14 years of prison .
it would amount to the same thing . "
observers say that khodorkovsky will likely be sentenced to six more years in a siberian prison camp - in which case he would n't see freedom until 2017 .
khodorkovsky 's father , 78 year old boris khodorkovsky , said he fears he will never see his son again .
" i 'm old , and am afraid that after this trial , i wo n't see him again , if he is sent to siberia .
i ca n't fly anymore , because i have bad eyesight .
i do n't know what i would do , " the elder khodorkovsky said .
if he is convicted , khodorkovsky said he would take the case to the european court of human rights in strasbourg .

but the german government continues to oppose the idea . the debate about issuing so called eurobonds , or e-bonds , - loans with common interest rates across the eurozone - was ignited again on monday when professor peter bofinger , a member of the german government 's panel of independent economic advisors , said that the bonds would stabilize the eurozone .
" issuing eurobonds would make it clear that the countries in europe will remain solvent , and that it 's just no longer possible to push some countries into a corner and burden these countries with extremely high interest , " bofinger said in an interview with german broadcaster deutschland radio .
eurobonds would be issued to all eurozone countries with the same interest rate , allowing those in financial difficulties to benefit from the collective strength of the bloc .
germany and france , countries which enjoy relatively good reputations as debtors , oppose e-bonds .
in a speech to the german parliament last week , chancellor angela merkel laid out her criticism of the idea .
" it 's really important that we do n't make the mistake of collectivizing risks , which would happen with eurobonds , " she said .
" this is absolutely not a solution .
the solution is more harmony and more competitiveness in the eu member states and especially in the eurozone . "
disagreement over costs at the moment , germany borrows at a rate of 1.73 percent , but the average borrowing rate across the eurozone is slightly above 3 percent .
some economists say that if eurobonds were introduced , germany would end up paying more interest .
" there will be a substantial loss of reputation for germany , and germany will have to pay more debt for -lsb- its -rsb- interest , " markus kerber , a professor of economics at berlin 's technical university , told deutsche welle .
a eurozone bond could cost germany 17 billion euros -lrb- $ 22 billion -rrb- more each year , the german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bofinger thinks eurobonds will bring stability but bofinger thinks the assumption is flawed that the eurobonds ' interest rate would reflect the average national interest rates of individual states .
" the interest is so high in some countries because the risk of default is seen as being so high , " bofinger said .
" with a eurobond , the likelihood of a country defaulting is highly unlikely , and so i think it would have much lower interest rates than the average . "
bofinger also said that issuing eurobonds would be a good way of recognizing the austerity measures that are being implemented .
" one has to acknowledge what is being done in greece , portugal , ireland and spain .
these countries , which have really implemented very tough measures to try to stabilize the situation , they would be rewarded by allowing them access to financing with low interest rates , " bofinger said .
opponents say a collective eurozone debt pool would weaken economic competitiveness , because countries like germany , which has a very good reputation as a debtor , would share a credit rating with countries that , according kerber , do n't deserve the same rating .
tarnishing reputations " reputation is the result of challenging the markets .
if we abolish that system , we make it an anti-market system .
we make it an anti-meritocratic system and we give reputation and advantages in terms of interest to countries that do n't deserve it , " said kerber .
distorting competition in this way would destabilize the eurozone in the long term , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel does n't believe in collectivizing risk " i can not understand professor bofinger 's reasoning .
why should non-market conditions for raising funds for fragile countries stabilize the euro ? "
kerber said .
" in the long run , if you distort competition , the system will break down .
there will be a collapse and that collapse will bring down the euro . "
german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble has n't been as vehement in his opposition to eurobonds as merkel , but he has said that there should to be more political and fiscal integration before they are introduced .
this would mean harmonizing national sacred cows like taxes , retirement policy and labor market legislation .
with a string of important state elections coming up in germany in 2011 , it seems unlikely that merkel will do an about-turn on the issue of eurobonds , which could be unpopular with the german electorate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de piracy -pipe- 27.12.2010 swiss file-sharing website hires us lobbying firm großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapidshare is one of three european sites lobbying dc after being named as one of the most infringing websites , rapidshare is headed to the us capital to convince american lawmakers that it is not liable for illegal file-sharing . rapidshare , an online file-sharing site based in cham , switzerland , is under increased international scrutiny for enabling copyright infringement , as earlier this year members of the us congress named rapidshare one of the top six most infringing websites in the world .
" as you can imagine , we 're not very happy about that , " said daniel raimer , a german attorney and spokesman for rapidshare , in an interview with deutsche welle .
following the us government 's crackdown on infringing websites earlier this fall , seizing the domain names of more than 80 websites , rapidshare has found a way to reinvent itself in the american capital .
just last month , the company hired the washington , dc-based lobbying firm dutko to protect its interests abroad .
this likely makes it the first such european file-sharing company to lobby american lawmakers .
the company says its has more appointments coming up on capitol hill , and remains confident that it will get off the list by early 2011 , long before next year 's list is published .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss company only says about five percent of what is uploaded to its site is illegal only a small percentage of its files are illegal rapidshare estimates that copyrighted music and movies make up roughly five percent , or 10,000 of the 400,000 files uploaded every day .
although the site accepts and hosts every type of file , because the company takes many steps to filter out infringing files before they are posted , raimer argued that rapidshare is not the type of site the us should be going after .
" we believe that it 's unfair that we 're being put on the list , " he added .
" you ca n't just take a look at the number of infringing material that you can find on the server .
google has probably millions and millions of links to illegal files .
most people would probably agree that google is not a bad company . "
by international law rapidshare is not liable for what users upload and download , and recent german and american legal cases have upheld this notion .
the only thing that is required of rapidshare is to take down infringing files once the copyright holder tells it to .
while lobbying on behalf of foreign companies is nothing new in washington , it is new for foreign web companies to do so .
an online database of lobbying disclosures reveals that the only other european websites lobbying the us congress right now are two online gaming sites , pokerstars.net and partygaming.com.
us can exert limited power over foreign sites a new anti-piracy bill making its way through the us senate could clear the way for the government to seize more infringing domains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to most international law , rapidshare is not liable for what its users upload to the site and then download to their music players if the law passes , according to bob brauneis , professor of copyright law at george washington university in washington , dc , it could certainly impact rapidshare , despite the fact that it is not based in the united states . " dot-com companies operate around the world , but the company that controls the dot-com domain is in the united states , " he told deutsche welle .
" literally they have a computer in some room somewhere and if you flip a switch on that computer than domain name will disappear .
the information is still there in switzerland , but it 's not accessible at rapidshare.com because the link between rapidshare.com and the swiss computers has been cut . ”
the .com registry is maintained within the us and is subject to us law .
that means a court order could force the registry to freeze the domain name : rapidshare.com.
it does n't matter if rapidshare has its headquarters in switzerland or anywhere else .
while losing a domain name could temporarily impact the company 's business , changing to a new name is not a huge inconvenience .
rapidshare could just set up shop as rapidshare.ch , which is the most common suffix for swiss sites .
wikileaks , for example , used to have a .com suffix - now anyone can access that site at wikileaks.ch.
if seizing domains does n't stop copyright infringement , there is another step , brauneis added .
" the computers in switzerland are actually reached through a series of numbers called an internet protocol address , an ip address , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapidshare could avoid american law simply by changing to a swiss domain like rapidshare.ch " so everyone can spread around the world what the ip address is on those computers and they can continue to upload and download files , not a problem .
and if it turns out that after seizing a bunch of domain names , everyone is just turning to ip addresses - the ip addresses may be next . "
and it gets even more complicated from there .
data re-routing could drive up internet connection pricing " people are going to look for alternative ways of having those kind of sites available , " said peter eckersley , a digital rights advocate with the electronic frontier foundation , a non-profit organization based in san francisco .
however , he cautioned that if sites like this are forced to move offshore , then that may raise the actual cost of internet connections around the world .
" and the effect that will have is a significant increase in the amount of data that 's just moving over international fiber links , " he added .
" that will mean we 'll need to build more fiberlinks . and it 's going to make the cost of running the internet higher . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss company only says about five percent of what is uploaded to its site is illegal only a small percentage of its files are illegal rapidshare estimates that copyrighted music and movies make up roughly five percent , or 10,000 of the 400,000 files uploaded every day .
although the site accepts and hosts every type of file , because the company takes many steps to filter out infringing files before they are posted , raimer argued that rapidshare is not the type of site the us should be going after .
" we believe that it 's unfair that we 're being put on the list , " he added .
" you ca n't just take a look at the number of infringing material that you can find on the server .
google has probably millions and millions of links to illegal files .
most people would probably agree that google is not a bad company . "
by international law rapidshare is not liable for what users upload and download , and recent german and american legal cases have upheld this notion .
the only thing that is required of rapidshare is to take down infringing files once the copyright holder tells it to .
while lobbying on behalf of foreign companies is nothing new in washington , it is new for foreign web companies to do so .
an online database of lobbying disclosures reveals that the only other european websites lobbying the us congress right now are two online gaming sites , pokerstars.net and partygaming.com.
us can exert limited power over foreign sites a new anti-piracy bill making its way through the us senate could clear the way for the government to seize more infringing domains .

the .com registry is maintained within the us and is subject to us law .
that means a court order could force the registry to freeze the domain name : rapidshare.com.
it does n't matter if rapidshare has its headquarters in switzerland or anywhere else .
while losing a domain name could temporarily impact the company 's business , changing to a new name is not a huge inconvenience .
rapidshare could just set up shop as rapidshare.ch , which is the most common suffix for swiss sites .
wikileaks , for example , used to have a .com suffix - now anyone can access that site at wikileaks.ch.
if seizing domains does n't stop copyright infringement , there is another step , brauneis added .
" the computers in switzerland are actually reached through a series of numbers called an internet protocol address , an ip address , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapidshare could avoid american law simply by changing to a swiss domain like rapidshare.ch " so everyone can spread around the world what the ip address is on those computers and they can continue to upload and download files , not a problem .

" from my own and a police point of view , i urge and support a ban , " police union head bernhard witthaut told deutsche welle .
" i think it 's terrible how they mock foreigners living in germany , i think their concept of a state is terrible . "
witthaut was not alone in his comments .
the president of the central council of jews in germany , dieter graumann , said in an interview over the weekend that the npd , which currently has an estimated 7,000 members , had clearly set itself the goal of destroying democracy in germany .
the country must resist such attempts , he said , if necessary by issuing a ban .

banning the npd , he told the news agency dapd , could also " have a positive effect in the fight against right-wing extremism and racism . " the german government attempted to ban the npd in a case heard by the country 's highest court , the constitutional court , in 2001 .
but the case was thrown out two years later after it was disclosed that several people in the npd 's inner circle were german secret service undercover agents or informants .
signal in the fight against far-right extremism the police union 's witthaut said that some people in law enforcement believed it would be easier to deal with the far-right party if you knew how it operated and where it was active , whereas if the party were to go underground , it would be much more difficult to keep an eye on its activities . but he said he was convinced that outlawing a party listed as racist , anti-semitic and revisionist by germany 's domestic intelligence agency would be " an important signal in the fight against right-wing extremism . "
" many might view the risk of a renewed failure before germany 's highest court as such a grave aspect that they might dismiss steps in that direction , " bavaria 's interior minister joachim herrmann said on monday .
but he added that banning the npd was desirable , and he would continue to lobby for a ban of the party .

the seven remaining suspects are still in custody . five of the 12 somali men arrested on suspicion of preparing a terrorist attack in the netherlands have been released , dutch prosecutors said on sunday .
the 12 men were arrested in the port of rotterdam late on friday following a tip from intelligence services that said an attack may have been imminent .
there was no information on the target or timeline of the alleged attack .
prosecutors said the men were no longer considered suspects , adding that two of the men were in possession of valid dutch residency permits .
" the police investigation did not show that they participated in punishable crimes , " prosecutors said .
the seven other suspects , aged between 19 and 48 , were to remain in detention until at least monday , when prosecutors were to decide whether to request an extension of their detentions .
men have ' nothing to do with terrorism ' earlier on sunday , relatives of the 12 detainees protested their innocence .
the men had " nothing to do with terrorism , " the brother of one of the men told the daily de telegraaf .
" we 're normal , hardworking people .
it must be a big misunderstanding , " the man told reporters in rotterdam .

the british-made satellite will have a throughput of 70 gigabits per second . on monday , a british-made satellite was launched in kazakhstan , becoming the second european spacecraft devoted to beaming down high-speed internet connectivity .
the ka-sat is designed to provide tens of millions of europeans , especially those living in rural areas , with faster access to the internet .
ka-sat has a total throughput of some 70 gigabits per second , however typically satellite internet access costs much more than dsl or cable modem service .
the new satellite will cover a large swath of europe , ranging from north africa to southern scandinavia , and touching into the edges of the middle east .
" ka-sat will be the cornerstone of a breakthrough infrastructure deployed by eutelsat for users across europe and the mediterranean basin , " said michel de rosen , the chief executive of eutelsat , in a statement .
eutelsat is the company that will operate the satellite .
" by combining a satellite equipped with more than 80 spotbeams and a network of ground stations , this new program will deliver more capacity than any other satellite program deployed worldwide . "
the company also said that commercial internet service will begin in may 2011 .

the new satellite will cover a large swath of europe , ranging from north africa to southern scandinavia , and touching into the edges of the middle east .
" ka-sat will be the cornerstone of a breakthrough infrastructure deployed by eutelsat for users across europe and the mediterranean basin , " said michel de rosen , the chief executive of eutelsat , in a statement .
eutelsat is the company that will operate the satellite .
" by combining a satellite equipped with more than 80 spotbeams and a network of ground stations , this new program will deliver more capacity than any other satellite program deployed worldwide . "
the company also said that commercial internet service will begin in may 2011 .

the incumbent president laurent ghagbo refused to concede rule to internationally recognized election winner alassane ouattara . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
west african bloc threatens intervention in ivory coast ecowas lacks adequate logistics and cohesion for a quick and decisive strike to remove the dictator who is trying to thwart the will of the ivoirians .
military force should be used if laurent gbagbo refuses to quit as it has been shown from the election result that the majority of the people does not want him to continue in power .
he should never underestimate a determined ecowas with a very strong nigerian influence and the support of the au , un , us and eu . - agholor , nigeria my opinion is that gbagbo should hand over power peacefully , but if that is not the case then ecowas will have to send in the military .
he can not just gain power by force .
a lot of resources were spent for the election to take place , so the people of ivory coast deserve to be heard . - james , kenya i think it 's high time we put an end to all of this military adventurism on the african continent so the ordinary people can be saved from these selfish individuals , and hopefully have some chance for some real development .
though there is a risk of abuse in intervening in the internal affairs of independent member states , this time around ecowas is right to use full force to oust gbagbo .
that would send a useful signal to all intending adventurists on the continent !
ecowas may even need to clearly define the circumstances under which it might routinely consider this form of intervention in future .
enough is enough ! - anthony , nigeria i am happy that ecowas has given a warning to laurent gbagbo that should he decide not to stand down , the bloc would use legitimate force to oust him from power .
for a long time now , the african union and the world have watched dictators cling to power even when they lost elections .
the peoples ' will , expressed through elections or the ballot box , has meant nothing . - malama , zambia while i am thankful that we have the presence of the un in our world , however , it would be a mistake to send un peacekeepers .
i believe ecowas is more in touch with what 's happening in ivory coast and it 's time we give credence and support to local initiatives of this magnitude .
the un should work with ecowas and give necessary guidance if need be .
too many cooks here will spoil these welcome " winds of change " we are beginning to witness in some parts of africa . - gari , unknown compiled by stuart tiffen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 27.12.2010 opinion : khodorkovsky verdict is poison for reform efforts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guilty verdict in the khodorkovsky trial comes as no surprise and was politically motivated .
its repercussions could be widespread , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . the guilty verdict in the trial of the former yukos owner mikhail khodorkovsky and his business partner , platon lebedev , comes as no surprise .
this was far from a free and fair trial , instead it was politically motivated .
sentencing has not yet been handed down but it 's expected that the two men will be jailed until at least 2012 - the year of the presidential elections - if not until 2017 .
many observers say that the former president and current prime minister , vladimir putin , was the driving force behind the guilty verdict . khodorkovsky was first jailed on tax evasion charges in 2003 and many believe that putin wanted to punish khodorkovsky for his perceived meddling in russian politics and his anti-putin stance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel , head of dw 's russian service in the run-up to the current verdict , putin publicly called for a guilty verdict , describing khodorkovsky as a thief .
politically , not the best of moves , considering that moscow was so keen to give the impression of a fair and independent trial .
president dmitry medevedev 's remarks were more circumspect when he said that no one - not even a president or any other high-ranking official , like putin - should comment on the current legal proceedings .
no doubt medvedev was already thinking of the political implications of a guilty verdict .
the questionable legal proceedings have dealt his reform and modernization efforts a heavy blow , and beyond that they could affect relations with the west .
the russian leadership is seemingly unaware that any reform can only be accomplished with the necessary legal and constitutional framework , fancy pr campaigns and speeches wo n't do the trick .
indeed , the trial has reinforced the perception in the west that russia lacks many basic and constitutional rights .
however much germany , europe and the us are interested in having good ties with moscow , there is a growing feeling that a russia shaped and formed by putin can not be trusted .
no doubt us president barack obama , who managed to push through the start arms reduction treaty with russia last week , will be on the receiving end of such criticism .
the west may have readily embraced khodorkovsky and lebedev as symbols for a free , democratic and just russia .
their current treatment and the clearly politically motivated nature of their trial has now led many russians to look up to them as heros in a battle against a corrupt and arbitrary regime .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 27.12.2010 opinion : khodorkovsky verdict is poison for reform efforts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guilty verdict in the khodorkovsky trial comes as no surprise and was politically motivated .
its repercussions could be widespread , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . the guilty verdict in the trial of the former yukos owner mikhail khodorkovsky and his business partner , platon lebedev , comes as no surprise .
this was far from a free and fair trial , instead it was politically motivated .
sentencing has not yet been handed down but it 's expected that the two men will be jailed until at least 2012 - the year of the presidential elections - if not until 2017 .
many observers say that the former president and current prime minister , vladimir putin , was the driving force behind the guilty verdict . khodorkovsky was first jailed on tax evasion charges in 2003 and many believe that putin wanted to punish khodorkovsky for his perceived meddling in russian politics and his anti-putin stance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel , head of dw 's russian service in the run-up to the current verdict , putin publicly called for a guilty verdict , describing khodorkovsky as a thief .
politically , not the best of moves , considering that moscow was so keen to give the impression of a fair and independent trial .
president dmitry medevedev 's remarks were more circumspect when he said that no one - not even a president or any other high-ranking official , like putin - should comment on the current legal proceedings .
no doubt medvedev was already thinking of the political implications of a guilty verdict .
the questionable legal proceedings have dealt his reform and modernization efforts a heavy blow , and beyond that they could affect relations with the west .
the russian leadership is seemingly unaware that any reform can only be accomplished with the necessary legal and constitutional framework , fancy pr campaigns and speeches wo n't do the trick .
indeed , the trial has reinforced the perception in the west that russia lacks many basic and constitutional rights .
however much germany , europe and the us are interested in having good ties with moscow , there is a growing feeling that a russia shaped and formed by putin can not be trusted .
no doubt us president barack obama , who managed to push through the start arms reduction treaty with russia last week , will be on the receiving end of such criticism .
the west may have readily embraced khodorkovsky and lebedev as symbols for a free , democratic and just russia .
their current treatment and the clearly politically motivated nature of their trial has now led many russians to look up to them as heros in a battle against a corrupt and arbitrary regime .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 27.12.2010 german government advisor backs eurobonds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians hope to stabilize the euro in 2011 a leading german economist has said that the euro can be stabilized by issuing loans at a set interest rate for the whole eurozone .
but the german government continues to oppose the idea . the debate about issuing so called eurobonds , or e-bonds , - loans with common interest rates across the eurozone - was ignited again on monday when professor peter bofinger , a member of the german government 's panel of independent economic advisors , said that the bonds would stabilize the eurozone .
" issuing eurobonds would make it clear that the countries in europe will remain solvent , and that it 's just no longer possible to push some countries into a corner and burden these countries with extremely high interest , " bofinger said in an interview with german broadcaster deutschland radio .
eurobonds would be issued to all eurozone countries with the same interest rate , allowing those in financial difficulties to benefit from the collective strength of the bloc .
germany and france , countries which enjoy relatively good reputations as debtors , oppose e-bonds .
in a speech to the german parliament last week , chancellor angela merkel laid out her criticism of the idea .
" it 's really important that we do n't make the mistake of collectivizing risks , which would happen with eurobonds , " she said .
" this is absolutely not a solution .
the solution is more harmony and more competitiveness in the eu member states and especially in the eurozone . "
disagreement over costs at the moment , germany borrows at a rate of 1.73 percent , but the average borrowing rate across the eurozone is slightly above 3 percent .
some economists say that if eurobonds were introduced , germany would end up paying more interest .
" there will be a substantial loss of reputation for germany , and germany will have to pay more debt for -lsb- its -rsb- interest , " markus kerber , a professor of economics at berlin 's technical university , told deutsche welle .
a eurozone bond could cost germany 17 billion euros -lrb- $ 22 billion -rrb- more each year , the german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bofinger thinks eurobonds will bring stability but bofinger thinks the assumption is flawed that the eurobonds ' interest rate would reflect the average national interest rates of individual states .
" the interest is so high in some countries because the risk of default is seen as being so high , " bofinger said .
" with a eurobond , the likelihood of a country defaulting is highly unlikely , and so i think it would have much lower interest rates than the average . "
bofinger also said that issuing eurobonds would be a good way of recognizing the austerity measures that are being implemented .
" one has to acknowledge what is being done in greece , portugal , ireland and spain .
these countries , which have really implemented very tough measures to try to stabilize the situation , they would be rewarded by allowing them access to financing with low interest rates , " bofinger said .
opponents say a collective eurozone debt pool would weaken economic competitiveness , because countries like germany , which has a very good reputation as a debtor , would share a credit rating with countries that , according kerber , do n't deserve the same rating .
tarnishing reputations " reputation is the result of challenging the markets .
if we abolish that system , we make it an anti-market system .
we make it an anti-meritocratic system and we give reputation and advantages in terms of interest to countries that do n't deserve it , " said kerber .
distorting competition in this way would destabilize the eurozone in the long term , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel does n't believe in collectivizing risk " i can not understand professor bofinger 's reasoning .
why should non-market conditions for raising funds for fragile countries stabilize the euro ? "
kerber said .
" in the long run , if you distort competition , the system will break down .
there will be a collapse and that collapse will bring down the euro . "
german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble has n't been as vehement in his opposition to eurobonds as merkel , but he has said that there should to be more political and fiscal integration before they are introduced .
this would mean harmonizing national sacred cows like taxes , retirement policy and labor market legislation .
with a string of important state elections coming up in germany in 2011 , it seems unlikely that merkel will do an about-turn on the issue of eurobonds , which could be unpopular with the german electorate .

the british-made satellite will have a throughput of 70 gigabits per second . on monday , a british-made satellite was launched in kazakhstan , becoming the second european spacecraft devoted to beaming down high-speed internet connectivity .
the ka-sat is designed to provide tens of millions of europeans , especially those living in rural areas , with faster access to the internet .
ka-sat has a total throughput of some 70 gigabits per second , however typically satellite internet access costs much more than dsl or cable modem service .
the new satellite will cover a large swath of europe , ranging from north africa to southern scandinavia , and touching into the edges of the middle east .
" ka-sat will be the cornerstone of a breakthrough infrastructure deployed by eutelsat for users across europe and the mediterranean basin , " said michel de rosen , the chief executive of eutelsat , in a statement .
eutelsat is the company that will operate the satellite .
" by combining a satellite equipped with more than 80 spotbeams and a network of ground stations , this new program will deliver more capacity than any other satellite program deployed worldwide . "
the company also said that commercial internet service will begin in may 2011 .

they see the verdict as casting doubt on president dmitry medvedev 's pledges to modernize russia . germany and other western countries have condemned the guilty verdict pronounced by a russian court against jailed tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky on new fraud charges .
in a statement , german foreign minister guido westerwelle called the verdict " a step backward " for russia .
westerwelle said that the way the trial was conducted was " very dubious " and called on russia to " stand up for the rule of law , democracy and human rights . "
german human rights commissioner markus loening found even stronger words to condemn the verdict , telling the dpa news agency that he was " outraged . "
" the judgment throws no good light on circumstances in russia , " he said .
loening described the verdict as " a crass misinterpretation of what happened in court . "
' russia must respect human rights commitments ' chief european union diplomat catherine ashton called on russia " to respect its international commitments in the field of human rights and the rule of law . "
she said the eu would " continue to follow developments very closely , including the forthcoming announcement of the sentence . "
across the atlantic , united states secretary of state hillary clinton said the verdict raised " serious questions about selective prosecution - and about the rule of law being overshadowed by political considerations . "
clinton also warned in a statement that " this and similar cases have a negative impact on russia 's reputation for fulfilling its international human rights obligations and improving its investment climate . "

the prosecution is seeking a six-year jail term .
shortly after the verdict was read , khodorkovsky 's defense lawyers said they would appeal the decision .
khodorkovsky had previously said he would take the case to the european court of human rights if he was found guilty .

khodorkovsky and his lawyers say the charges against him are politically motivated .
the tycoon has been an outspoken opponent of former president and current prime minister vladimir putin , openly funding opposition parties ahead of 2003 parliamentary elections .
khodorkovsky 's original trial in 2003 was widely seen as having been orchestrated by putin .
if khodorkovsky remains in jail through 2012 , it will prevent him from wielding his influence ahead of the election scheduled in that year .
the current case has been seen as a test of the independence of the russian justice system .

west african bloc threatens intervention in ivory coast ecowas lacks adequate logistics and cohesion for a quick and decisive strike to remove the dictator who is trying to thwart the will of the ivoirians .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 27.12.2010 german government advisor backs eurobonds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians hope to stabilize the euro in 2011 a leading german economist has said that the euro can be stabilized by issuing loans at a set interest rate for the whole eurozone .
but the german government continues to oppose the idea . the debate about issuing so called eurobonds , or e-bonds , - loans with common interest rates across the eurozone - was ignited again on monday when professor peter bofinger , a member of the german government 's panel of independent economic advisors , said that the bonds would stabilize the eurozone .
" issuing eurobonds would make it clear that the countries in europe will remain solvent , and that it 's just no longer possible to push some countries into a corner and burden these countries with extremely high interest , " bofinger said in an interview with german broadcaster deutschland radio .
eurobonds would be issued to all eurozone countries with the same interest rate , allowing those in financial difficulties to benefit from the collective strength of the bloc .
germany and france , countries which enjoy relatively good reputations as debtors , oppose e-bonds .
in a speech to the german parliament last week , chancellor angela merkel laid out her criticism of the idea .
" it 's really important that we do n't make the mistake of collectivizing risks , which would happen with eurobonds , " she said .

the solution is more harmony and more competitiveness in the eu member states and especially in the eurozone . "

some economists say that if eurobonds were introduced , germany would end up paying more interest .
" there will be a substantial loss of reputation for germany , and germany will have to pay more debt for -lsb- its -rsb- interest , " markus kerber , a professor of economics at berlin 's technical university , told deutsche welle .

" the interest is so high in some countries because the risk of default is seen as being so high , " bofinger said .
" with a eurobond , the likelihood of a country defaulting is highly unlikely , and so i think it would have much lower interest rates than the average . "
bofinger also said that issuing eurobonds would be a good way of recognizing the austerity measures that are being implemented .
" one has to acknowledge what is being done in greece , portugal , ireland and spain .
these countries , which have really implemented very tough measures to try to stabilize the situation , they would be rewarded by allowing them access to financing with low interest rates , " bofinger said .
opponents say a collective eurozone debt pool would weaken economic competitiveness , because countries like germany , which has a very good reputation as a debtor , would share a credit rating with countries that , according kerber , do n't deserve the same rating .
tarnishing reputations " reputation is the result of challenging the markets .
if we abolish that system , we make it an anti-market system .
we make it an anti-meritocratic system and we give reputation and advantages in terms of interest to countries that do n't deserve it , " said kerber .
distorting competition in this way would destabilize the eurozone in the long term , he added .

kerber said .
" in the long run , if you distort competition , the system will break down .
there will be a collapse and that collapse will bring down the euro . "
german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble has n't been as vehement in his opposition to eurobonds as merkel , but he has said that there should to be more political and fiscal integration before they are introduced .
this would mean harmonizing national sacred cows like taxes , retirement policy and labor market legislation .
with a string of important state elections coming up in germany in 2011 , it seems unlikely that merkel will do an about-turn on the issue of eurobonds , which could be unpopular with the german electorate .

but the german government continues to oppose the idea . the debate about issuing so called eurobonds , or e-bonds , - loans with common interest rates across the eurozone - was ignited again on monday when professor peter bofinger , a member of the german government 's panel of independent economic advisors , said that the bonds would stabilize the eurozone .
" issuing eurobonds would make it clear that the countries in europe will remain solvent , and that it 's just no longer possible to push some countries into a corner and burden these countries with extremely high interest , " bofinger said in an interview with german broadcaster deutschland radio .
eurobonds would be issued to all eurozone countries with the same interest rate , allowing those in financial difficulties to benefit from the collective strength of the bloc .
germany and france , countries which enjoy relatively good reputations as debtors , oppose e-bonds .
in a speech to the german parliament last week , chancellor angela merkel laid out her criticism of the idea .

they see the verdict as casting doubt on president dmitry medvedev 's pledges to modernize russia . germany and other western countries have condemned the guilty verdict pronounced by a russian court against jailed tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky on new fraud charges .
in a statement , german foreign minister guido westerwelle called the verdict " a step backward " for russia .
westerwelle said that the way the trial was conducted was " very dubious " and called on russia to " stand up for the rule of law , democracy and human rights . "
german human rights commissioner markus loening found even stronger words to condemn the verdict , telling the dpa news agency that he was " outraged . "
" the judgment throws no good light on circumstances in russia , " he said .
loening described the verdict as " a crass misinterpretation of what happened in court . "
' russia must respect human rights commitments ' chief european union diplomat catherine ashton called on russia " to respect its international commitments in the field of human rights and the rule of law . "
she said the eu would " continue to follow developments very closely , including the forthcoming announcement of the sentence . "
across the atlantic , united states secretary of state hillary clinton said the verdict raised " serious questions about selective prosecution - and about the rule of law being overshadowed by political considerations . "
clinton also warned in a statement that " this and similar cases have a negative impact on russia 's reputation for fulfilling its international human rights obligations and improving its investment climate . "
embezzlement charges khodorkovsky was found guilty of embezzlement for stealing and reselling over 200 tons of oil from wells he previously owned as head of the yukos oil company .
his business partner and co-defendant platon lebedev was also found guilty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khodorkovsky 's supporters see him as a symbol for democratic struggle khodorkovsky is currently serving an eight-year prison sentence for tax evasion .
his release was scheduled for 2011 .
sentencing in the current case is expected in the next few days .
the prosecution is seeking a six-year jail term .
shortly after the verdict was read , khodorkovsky 's defense lawyers said they would appeal the decision .
khodorkovsky had previously said he would take the case to the european court of human rights if he was found guilty .
orchestrated by putin ?
khodorkovsky and his lawyers say the charges against him are politically motivated .
the tycoon has been an outspoken opponent of former president and current prime minister vladimir putin , openly funding opposition parties ahead of 2003 parliamentary elections .
khodorkovsky 's original trial in 2003 was widely seen as having been orchestrated by putin .
if khodorkovsky remains in jail through 2012 , it will prevent him from wielding his influence ahead of the election scheduled in that year .
the current case has been seen as a test of the independence of the russian justice system .
but monday 's conviction sheds grave doubts on president dmitry medvedev 's vows to modernize russia and take it out of putin 's shadow .

the judge in the case , viktor danilkin , read the verdict in a moscow courtroom on monday .
khodorkovsky 's business partner and co-defendant platon lebedev was also found guilty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khodorkovsky supporters gathered outside the court monday khodorkovsky is currently serving an eight-year prison sentence for tax evasion .
sentencing in the current case is expected in the next few days .
the prosecution is seeking a six-year sentence .
the russian news agency interfax reported that journalists present in the courtroom were asked to leave by danilkin just after the guilty decision was read .
the entire verdict could take several days to read .
observers have speculated that a date change in the verdict reading , originally scheduled for december 15 , was an attempt to reduce media attention .
shortly after the verdict was read , khodorkovsky 's defense lawyers said they would appeal the decision .
khodorkovsky had previously said he would take the case to the european court of human rights if he was found guilty .
high-profile trial the second trial of russia 's former richest man has garnered international attention .
germany is one of several western nations that have criticized the trial .
in a visit with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov in moscow in early november , german foreign minister guido westerwelle expressed " very serious concern about the conditions of the trial proceedings . "
westerwelle added it was in russia 's best interest to take such concerns seriously .
lavrov replied that it was a matter for the court to decide .
political rivals if khodorkovsky remains behind bars through 2012 , it would keep the outspoken political opponent of prime minister vladimir putin from wielding his influence ahead of the election .
due to his stance against putin and the kremlin , khodorkovsky has become a symbol for the russian opposition and human right activists who decry his imprisonment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin called for a guilty verdict last week khodorkovsky 's original trial in 2003 was widely seen as a politically motivated event , with putin - who was president at the time - pulling the strings .
khodorkovsky had openly funded opposition parties ahead of the 2003 parliamentary elections , which did not sit well with the kremlin .
putin was in the spotlight again leading up to monday 's verdict , making an appeal on live television last week that " the thief must remain in jail . "
the verdict and sentencing in the current case are being seen as a test of the independence of the russian justice system .

the verdict in khodorkovsky 's second trial could keep him behind bars for several more years . mikhail khodorkovsky has been found guilty of embezzlement for stealing and reselling over 200 tons of oil from wells he previously owned as head of the yukos oil company .
the judge in the case , viktor danilkin , read the verdict in a moscow courtroom on monday .
khodorkovsky 's business partner and co-defendant platon lebedev was also found guilty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khodorkovsky supporters gathered outside the court monday khodorkovsky is currently serving an eight-year prison sentence for tax evasion .
sentencing in the current case is expected in the next few days .
the prosecution is seeking a six-year sentence .
the russian news agency interfax reported that journalists present in the courtroom were asked to leave by danilkin just after the guilty decision was read .
the entire verdict could take several days to read .
observers have speculated that a date change in the verdict reading , originally scheduled for december 15 , was an attempt to reduce media attention .
shortly after the verdict was read , khodorkovsky 's defense lawyers said they would appeal the decision .
khodorkovsky had previously said he would take the case to the european court of human rights if he was found guilty .
high-profile trial the second trial of russia 's former richest man has garnered international attention .
germany is one of several western nations that have criticized the trial .
in a visit with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov in moscow in early november , german foreign minister guido westerwelle expressed " very serious concern about the conditions of the trial proceedings . "
westerwelle added it was in russia 's best interest to take such concerns seriously .
lavrov replied that it was a matter for the court to decide .
political rivals if khodorkovsky remains behind bars through 2012 , it would keep the outspoken political opponent of prime minister vladimir putin from wielding his influence ahead of the election .
due to his stance against putin and the kremlin , khodorkovsky has become a symbol for the russian opposition and human right activists who decry his imprisonment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin called for a guilty verdict last week khodorkovsky 's original trial in 2003 was widely seen as a politically motivated event , with putin - who was president at the time - pulling the strings .
khodorkovsky had openly funded opposition parties ahead of the 2003 parliamentary elections , which did not sit well with the kremlin .
putin was in the spotlight again leading up to monday 's verdict , making an appeal on live television last week that " the thief must remain in jail . "
the verdict and sentencing in the current case are being seen as a test of the independence of the russian justice system .

west african bloc threatens intervention in ivory coast ecowas lacks adequate logistics and cohesion for a quick and decisive strike to remove the dictator who is trying to thwart the will of the ivoirians .
military force should be used if laurent gbagbo refuses to quit as it has been shown from the election result that the majority of the people does not want him to continue in power .
he should never underestimate a determined ecowas with a very strong nigerian influence and the support of the au , un , us and eu . - agholor , nigeria my opinion is that gbagbo should hand over power peacefully , but if that is not the case then ecowas will have to send in the military .
he can not just gain power by force .
a lot of resources were spent for the election to take place , so the people of ivory coast deserve to be heard . - james , kenya i think it 's high time we put an end to all of this military adventurism on the african continent so the ordinary people can be saved from these selfish individuals , and hopefully have some chance for some real development .
though there is a risk of abuse in intervening in the internal affairs of independent member states , this time around ecowas is right to use full force to oust gbagbo .
that would send a useful signal to all intending adventurists on the continent !
ecowas may even need to clearly define the circumstances under which it might routinely consider this form of intervention in future .
enough is enough ! - anthony , nigeria i am happy that ecowas has given a warning to laurent gbagbo that should he decide not to stand down , the bloc would use legitimate force to oust him from power .
for a long time now , the african union and the world have watched dictators cling to power even when they lost elections .
the peoples ' will , expressed through elections or the ballot box , has meant nothing . - malama , zambia while i am thankful that we have the presence of the un in our world , however , it would be a mistake to send un peacekeepers .
i believe ecowas is more in touch with what 's happening in ivory coast and it 's time we give credence and support to local initiatives of this magnitude .
the un should work with ecowas and give necessary guidance if need be .

enough is enough ! - anthony , nigeria i am happy that ecowas has given a warning to laurent gbagbo that should he decide not to stand down , the bloc would use legitimate force to oust him from power .
for a long time now , the african union and the world have watched dictators cling to power even when they lost elections .
the peoples ' will , expressed through elections or the ballot box , has meant nothing . - malama , zambia while i am thankful that we have the presence of the un in our world , however , it would be a mistake to send un peacekeepers .
i believe ecowas is more in touch with what 's happening in ivory coast and it 's time we give credence and support to local initiatives of this magnitude .
the un should work with ecowas and give necessary guidance if need be .
too many cooks here will spoil these welcome " winds of change " we are beginning to witness in some parts of africa . - gari , unknown compiled by stuart tiffen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its repercussions could be widespread , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . the guilty verdict in the trial of the former yukos owner mikhail khodorkovsky and his business partner , platon lebedev , comes as no surprise .
this was far from a free and fair trial , instead it was politically motivated .
sentencing has not yet been handed down but it 's expected that the two men will be jailed until at least 2012 - the year of the presidential elections - if not until 2017 .
many observers say that the former president and current prime minister , vladimir putin , was the driving force behind the guilty verdict . khodorkovsky was first jailed on tax evasion charges in 2003 and many believe that putin wanted to punish khodorkovsky for his perceived meddling in russian politics and his anti-putin stance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel , head of dw 's russian service in the run-up to the current verdict , putin publicly called for a guilty verdict , describing khodorkovsky as a thief .
politically , not the best of moves , considering that moscow was so keen to give the impression of a fair and independent trial .
president dmitry medevedev 's remarks were more circumspect when he said that no one - not even a president or any other high-ranking official , like putin - should comment on the current legal proceedings .
no doubt medvedev was already thinking of the political implications of a guilty verdict .
the questionable legal proceedings have dealt his reform and modernization efforts a heavy blow , and beyond that they could affect relations with the west .
the russian leadership is seemingly unaware that any reform can only be accomplished with the necessary legal and constitutional framework , fancy pr campaigns and speeches wo n't do the trick .
indeed , the trial has reinforced the perception in the west that russia lacks many basic and constitutional rights .
however much germany , europe and the us are interested in having good ties with moscow , there is a growing feeling that a russia shaped and formed by putin can not be trusted .
no doubt us president barack obama , who managed to push through the start arms reduction treaty with russia last week , will be on the receiving end of such criticism .
the west may have readily embraced khodorkovsky and lebedev as symbols for a free , democratic and just russia .
their current treatment and the clearly politically motivated nature of their trial has now led many russians to look up to them as heros in a battle against a corrupt and arbitrary regime .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 27.12.2010 opinion : khodorkovsky verdict is poison for reform efforts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guilty verdict in the khodorkovsky trial comes as no surprise and was politically motivated .
its repercussions could be widespread , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . the guilty verdict in the trial of the former yukos owner mikhail khodorkovsky and his business partner , platon lebedev , comes as no surprise .
this was far from a free and fair trial , instead it was politically motivated .
sentencing has not yet been handed down but it 's expected that the two men will be jailed until at least 2012 - the year of the presidential elections - if not until 2017 .
many observers say that the former president and current prime minister , vladimir putin , was the driving force behind the guilty verdict . khodorkovsky was first jailed on tax evasion charges in 2003 and many believe that putin wanted to punish khodorkovsky for his perceived meddling in russian politics and his anti-putin stance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel , head of dw 's russian service in the run-up to the current verdict , putin publicly called for a guilty verdict , describing khodorkovsky as a thief .
politically , not the best of moves , considering that moscow was so keen to give the impression of a fair and independent trial .
president dmitry medevedev 's remarks were more circumspect when he said that no one - not even a president or any other high-ranking official , like putin - should comment on the current legal proceedings .
no doubt medvedev was already thinking of the political implications of a guilty verdict .
the questionable legal proceedings have dealt his reform and modernization efforts a heavy blow , and beyond that they could affect relations with the west .
the russian leadership is seemingly unaware that any reform can only be accomplished with the necessary legal and constitutional framework , fancy pr campaigns and speeches wo n't do the trick .
indeed , the trial has reinforced the perception in the west that russia lacks many basic and constitutional rights .
however much germany , europe and the us are interested in having good ties with moscow , there is a growing feeling that a russia shaped and formed by putin can not be trusted .
no doubt us president barack obama , who managed to push through the start arms reduction treaty with russia last week , will be on the receiving end of such criticism .
the west may have readily embraced khodorkovsky and lebedev as symbols for a free , democratic and just russia .
their current treatment and the clearly politically motivated nature of their trial has now led many russians to look up to them as heros in a battle against a corrupt and arbitrary regime .

the verdict in khodorkovsky 's second trial could keep him behind bars for several more years . mikhail khodorkovsky has been found guilty of embezzlement for stealing and reselling over 200 tons of oil from wells he previously owned as head of the yukos oil company .
the judge in the case , viktor danilkin , read the verdict in a moscow courtroom on monday .
khodorkovsky 's business partner and co-defendant platon lebedev was also found guilty .

sentencing in the current case is expected in the next few days .
the prosecution is seeking a six-year sentence .
the russian news agency interfax reported that journalists present in the courtroom were asked to leave by danilkin just after the guilty decision was read .
the entire verdict could take several days to read .
observers have speculated that a date change in the verdict reading , originally scheduled for december 15 , was an attempt to reduce media attention .
shortly after the verdict was read , khodorkovsky 's defense lawyers said they would appeal the decision .
khodorkovsky had previously said he would take the case to the european court of human rights if he was found guilty .

germany is one of several western nations that have criticized the trial .
in a visit with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov in moscow in early november , german foreign minister guido westerwelle expressed " very serious concern about the conditions of the trial proceedings . "
westerwelle added it was in russia 's best interest to take such concerns seriously .
lavrov replied that it was a matter for the court to decide .

the verdict in khodorkovsky 's second trial could keep him behind bars for several more years . mikhail khodorkovsky has been found guilty of embezzlement for stealing and reselling over 200 tons of oil from wells he previously owned as head of the yukos oil company .
the judge in the case , viktor danilkin , read the verdict in a moscow courtroom on monday .
khodorkovsky 's business partner and co-defendant platon lebedev was also found guilty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khodorkovsky supporters gathered outside the court monday khodorkovsky is currently serving an eight-year prison sentence for tax evasion .
sentencing in the current case is expected in the next few days .
the prosecution is seeking a six-year sentence .
the russian news agency interfax reported that journalists present in the courtroom were asked to leave by danilkin just after the guilty decision was read .
the entire verdict could take several days to read .
observers have speculated that a date change in the verdict reading , originally scheduled for december 15 , was an attempt to reduce media attention .
shortly after the verdict was read , khodorkovsky 's defense lawyers said they would appeal the decision .
khodorkovsky had previously said he would take the case to the european court of human rights if he was found guilty .
high-profile trial the second trial of russia 's former richest man has garnered international attention .
germany is one of several western nations that have criticized the trial .
in a visit with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov in moscow in early november , german foreign minister guido westerwelle expressed " very serious concern about the conditions of the trial proceedings . "
westerwelle added it was in russia 's best interest to take such concerns seriously .
lavrov replied that it was a matter for the court to decide .
political rivals if khodorkovsky remains behind bars through 2012 , it would keep the outspoken political opponent of prime minister vladimir putin from wielding his influence ahead of the election .
due to his stance against putin and the kremlin , khodorkovsky has become a symbol for the russian opposition and human right activists who decry his imprisonment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin called for a guilty verdict last week khodorkovsky 's original trial in 2003 was widely seen as a politically motivated event , with putin - who was president at the time - pulling the strings .
khodorkovsky had openly funded opposition parties ahead of the 2003 parliamentary elections , which did not sit well with the kremlin .
putin was in the spotlight again leading up to monday 's verdict , making an appeal on live television last week that " the thief must remain in jail . "
the verdict and sentencing in the current case are being seen as a test of the independence of the russian justice system .

the us and european union previously imposed travel sanctions on gbagbo and his inner circle , while the world bank and the west african regional central bank have cut off his finances .

" in the future , undercover investigators will be deployed by the government – and they wo n't only be checking general terms and conditions , " aigner said in an interview with the german business newspaper handelsblatt .
rather than simply inspecting the fine print of contracts , investigators posing as potential customers would be able to assess whether financial advisors provide transparent explanations of the products they are selling .
risk management many private investors in germany who lost a chunk of their personal wealth in the financial crisis complain they were insufficiently warned of the risks attached to their investments .
financial advisors , they charge , like to sell high-risk investments not only because of the high commissions they collect but also because of the healthy margins they generate for their bank employers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many private investors saw their savings go down the drain in the financial crisis aigner envisions a state-run control program to complement " mystery shopper " tests already conducted by the independent german consumer research foundation , stiftung warentest .
the foundation conducts spot checks of products and services - including investment advice provided by banks and other financial institutions - and publishes the results .
in july , it released the results of a test of financial advice offered by 21 banks .
six banks failed and not one received the rating " good " or " very good . "
but the problem with the stiftung warentest 's program , aigner said , is that because informants ca n't be identified , banks frequently question the validity of its findings .
penalties still unknown by launching a state-run program , the minister hopes to keep financial advisors on their best behavior .
" laws only help when someone ensures that they are enforced , " she said .
aigner said she would like germany 's federal financial supervisory authority -lrb- bafin -rrb- to administer the undercover checks .
the minister gave no details about the penalties banks providing poor advice could face .

its repercussions could be widespread , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . the guilty verdict in the trial of the former yukos owner mikhail khodorkovsky and his business partner , platon lebedev , comes as no surprise .
this was far from a free and fair trial , instead it was politically motivated .
sentencing has not yet been handed down but it 's expected that the two men will be jailed until at least 2012 - the year of the presidential elections - if not until 2017 .
many observers say that the former president and current prime minister , vladimir putin , was the driving force behind the guilty verdict . khodorkovsky was first jailed on tax evasion charges in 2003 and many believe that putin wanted to punish khodorkovsky for his perceived meddling in russian politics and his anti-putin stance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel , head of dw 's russian service in the run-up to the current verdict , putin publicly called for a guilty verdict , describing khodorkovsky as a thief .
politically , not the best of moves , considering that moscow was so keen to give the impression of a fair and independent trial .
president dmitry medevedev 's remarks were more circumspect when he said that no one - not even a president or any other high-ranking official , like putin - should comment on the current legal proceedings .
no doubt medvedev was already thinking of the political implications of a guilty verdict .
the questionable legal proceedings have dealt his reform and modernization efforts a heavy blow , and beyond that they could affect relations with the west .
the russian leadership is seemingly unaware that any reform can only be accomplished with the necessary legal and constitutional framework , fancy pr campaigns and speeches wo n't do the trick .
indeed , the trial has reinforced the perception in the west that russia lacks many basic and constitutional rights .
however much germany , europe and the us are interested in having good ties with moscow , there is a growing feeling that a russia shaped and formed by putin can not be trusted .
no doubt us president barack obama , who managed to push through the start arms reduction treaty with russia last week , will be on the receiving end of such criticism .
the west may have readily embraced khodorkovsky and lebedev as symbols for a free , democratic and just russia .
their current treatment and the clearly politically motivated nature of their trial has now led many russians to look up to them as heros in a battle against a corrupt and arbitrary regime .

it was hoped the strike would help convince incumbent president gbagbo to step down . a call for a general strike in ivory coast to pressure incumbent president laurent gbagbo into conceding power have failed to take hold .
in the country 's biggest city , abidjan , business largely went on as usual . the general strike was called for on sunday by supporters of alassane ouattara , the internationally recognized winner of ivory coast 's november presidential election . despite the united nations , the european union , the african union and the economic community of west african states -lrb- ecowas -rrb- all recognizing ouattara as the winner of the november 28 election , gbagbo continues to refuse to step down .
he says the election was rigged and was part of a plot against him orchestrated by france and the united states . the failed strike comes a day ahead of a trip to ivory coast by three ecowas leaders - the presidents of benin , sierra leone and cape verde - to try and personally convince gbagbo to step down .
should their bid fail , ecowas has threatened to take military action . threat of renewed civil war the standoff between the two presidential candidates has led to increased tension in the country , and around 200 people have already been killed in the election aftermath , according to the un human rights council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gbagbo has refused to relinquish power the unhrc also says at least 14,000 ivorians have fled to neighboring liberia , fearful of a return to the 2002-2003 civil war in ivory coast . " with their numbers growing , the humanitarian needs are increasing for the mostly women and children refugees as well as for the villagers hosting them , " the unhrc said in a statement on its website over the weekend . gbagbo 's interior minister , emile guirieoulou , on sunday rejected un allegations of widespread human rights violations in the election aftermath by gbagbo 's security forces , saying the world body was being partisan .
international pressure in addition to the threat of military intervention from ecowas , international pressure on gbagbo increased over the weekend as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ouattara has called for a nationwide general strike on sunday , airport authorities in the swiss city of basel grounded a plane belonging to gbagbo at the request of " the legitimate authorities " of ivory coast , a spokesman for the french foreign ministry said .
the aircraft is parked at the basel-mulhouse airport , which is jointly run by french and swiss authorities .
the us and european union previously imposed travel sanctions on gbagbo and his inner circle , while the world bank and the west african regional central bank have cut off his finances .

the verdict in khodorkovsky 's second trial could keep him behind bars for several more years . mikhail khodorkovsky has been found guilty of embezzlement for stealing and reselling over 200 tons of oil from wells he previously owned as head of the yukos oil company .
the judge in the case , viktor danilkin , read the verdict in a moscow courtroom on monday .
khodorkovsky 's business partner and co-defendant platon lebedev was also found guilty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khodorkovsky supporters gathered outside the court monday khodorkovsky is currently serving an eight-year prison sentence for tax evasion .
sentencing in the current case is expected in the next few days .
the prosecution is seeking a six-year sentence .
the russian news agency interfax reported that journalists present in the courtroom were asked to leave by danilkin just after the guilty decision was read .
the entire verdict could take several days to read .
observers have speculated that a date change in the verdict reading , originally scheduled for december 15 , was an attempt to reduce media attention .
shortly after the verdict was read , khodorkovsky 's defense lawyers said they would appeal the decision .
khodorkovsky had previously said he would take the case to the european court of human rights if he was found guilty .
high-profile trial the second trial of russia 's former richest man has garnered international attention .
germany is one of several western nations that have criticized the trial .
in a visit with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov in moscow in early november , german foreign minister guido westerwelle expressed " very serious concern about the conditions of the trial proceedings . "
westerwelle added it was in russia 's best interest to take such concerns seriously .
lavrov replied that it was a matter for the court to decide .
political rivals if khodorkovsky remains behind bars through 2012 , it would keep the outspoken political opponent of prime minister vladimir putin from wielding his influence ahead of the election .
due to his stance against putin and the kremlin , khodorkovsky has become a symbol for the russian opposition and human right activists who decry his imprisonment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin called for a guilty verdict last week khodorkovsky 's original trial in 2003 was widely seen as a politically motivated event , with putin - who was president at the time - pulling the strings .
khodorkovsky had openly funded opposition parties ahead of the 2003 parliamentary elections , which did not sit well with the kremlin .
putin was in the spotlight again leading up to monday 's verdict , making an appeal on live television last week that " the thief must remain in jail . "
the verdict and sentencing in the current case are being seen as a test of the independence of the russian justice system .

west african bloc threatens intervention in ivory coast ecowas lacks adequate logistics and cohesion for a quick and decisive strike to remove the dictator who is trying to thwart the will of the ivoirians .
military force should be used if laurent gbagbo refuses to quit as it has been shown from the election result that the majority of the people does not want him to continue in power .
he should never underestimate a determined ecowas with a very strong nigerian influence and the support of the au , un , us and eu . - agholor , nigeria my opinion is that gbagbo should hand over power peacefully , but if that is not the case then ecowas will have to send in the military .
he can not just gain power by force .
a lot of resources were spent for the election to take place , so the people of ivory coast deserve to be heard . - james , kenya i think it 's high time we put an end to all of this military adventurism on the african continent so the ordinary people can be saved from these selfish individuals , and hopefully have some chance for some real development .
though there is a risk of abuse in intervening in the internal affairs of independent member states , this time around ecowas is right to use full force to oust gbagbo .
that would send a useful signal to all intending adventurists on the continent !
ecowas may even need to clearly define the circumstances under which it might routinely consider this form of intervention in future .
enough is enough ! - anthony , nigeria i am happy that ecowas has given a warning to laurent gbagbo that should he decide not to stand down , the bloc would use legitimate force to oust him from power .
for a long time now , the african union and the world have watched dictators cling to power even when they lost elections .
the peoples ' will , expressed through elections or the ballot box , has meant nothing . - malama , zambia while i am thankful that we have the presence of the un in our world , however , it would be a mistake to send un peacekeepers .
i believe ecowas is more in touch with what 's happening in ivory coast and it 's time we give credence and support to local initiatives of this magnitude .
the un should work with ecowas and give necessary guidance if need be .

it was hoped the strike would help convince incumbent president gbagbo to step down . a call for a general strike in ivory coast to pressure incumbent president laurent gbagbo into conceding power have failed to take hold .
in the country 's biggest city , abidjan , business largely went on as usual . the general strike was called for on sunday by supporters of alassane ouattara , the internationally recognized winner of ivory coast 's november presidential election . despite the united nations , the european union , the african union and the economic community of west african states -lrb- ecowas -rrb- all recognizing ouattara as the winner of the november 28 election , gbagbo continues to refuse to step down .
he says the election was rigged and was part of a plot against him orchestrated by france and the united states . the failed strike comes a day ahead of a trip to ivory coast by three ecowas leaders - the presidents of benin , sierra leone and cape verde - to try and personally convince gbagbo to step down .
should their bid fail , ecowas has threatened to take military action . threat of renewed civil war the standoff between the two presidential candidates has led to increased tension in the country , and around 200 people have already been killed in the election aftermath , according to the un human rights council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gbagbo has refused to relinquish power the unhrc also says at least 14,000 ivorians have fled to neighboring liberia , fearful of a return to the 2002-2003 civil war in ivory coast . " with their numbers growing , the humanitarian needs are increasing for the mostly women and children refugees as well as for the villagers hosting them , " the unhrc said in a statement on its website over the weekend . gbagbo 's interior minister , emile guirieoulou , on sunday rejected un allegations of widespread human rights violations in the election aftermath by gbagbo 's security forces , saying the world body was being partisan .
international pressure in addition to the threat of military intervention from ecowas , international pressure on gbagbo increased over the weekend as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ouattara has called for a nationwide general strike on sunday , airport authorities in the swiss city of basel grounded a plane belonging to gbagbo at the request of " the legitimate authorities " of ivory coast , a spokesman for the french foreign ministry said .
the aircraft is parked at the basel-mulhouse airport , which is jointly run by french and swiss authorities .
the us and european union previously imposed travel sanctions on gbagbo and his inner circle , while the world bank and the west african regional central bank have cut off his finances .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de piracy -pipe- 27.12.2010 swiss file-sharing website hires us lobbying firm großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapidshare is one of three european sites lobbying dc after being named as one of the most infringing websites , rapidshare is headed to the us capital to convince american lawmakers that it is not liable for illegal file-sharing . rapidshare , an online file-sharing site based in cham , switzerland , is under increased international scrutiny for enabling copyright infringement , as earlier this year members of the us congress named rapidshare one of the top six most infringing websites in the world .
" as you can imagine , we 're not very happy about that , " said daniel raimer , a german attorney and spokesman for rapidshare , in an interview with deutsche welle .
following the us government 's crackdown on infringing websites earlier this fall , seizing the domain names of more than 80 websites , rapidshare has found a way to reinvent itself in the american capital .
just last month , the company hired the washington , dc-based lobbying firm dutko to protect its interests abroad .
this likely makes it the first such european file-sharing company to lobby american lawmakers .
the company says its has more appointments coming up on capitol hill , and remains confident that it will get off the list by early 2011 , long before next year 's list is published .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss company only says about five percent of what is uploaded to its site is illegal only a small percentage of its files are illegal rapidshare estimates that copyrighted music and movies make up roughly five percent , or 10,000 of the 400,000 files uploaded every day .
although the site accepts and hosts every type of file , because the company takes many steps to filter out infringing files before they are posted , raimer argued that rapidshare is not the type of site the us should be going after .
" we believe that it 's unfair that we 're being put on the list , " he added .
" you ca n't just take a look at the number of infringing material that you can find on the server .
google has probably millions and millions of links to illegal files .
most people would probably agree that google is not a bad company . "
by international law rapidshare is not liable for what users upload and download , and recent german and american legal cases have upheld this notion .
the only thing that is required of rapidshare is to take down infringing files once the copyright holder tells it to .
while lobbying on behalf of foreign companies is nothing new in washington , it is new for foreign web companies to do so .
an online database of lobbying disclosures reveals that the only other european websites lobbying the us congress right now are two online gaming sites , pokerstars.net and partygaming.com.
us can exert limited power over foreign sites a new anti-piracy bill making its way through the us senate could clear the way for the government to seize more infringing domains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to most international law , rapidshare is not liable for what its users upload to the site and then download to their music players if the law passes , according to bob brauneis , professor of copyright law at george washington university in washington , dc , it could certainly impact rapidshare , despite the fact that it is not based in the united states . " dot-com companies operate around the world , but the company that controls the dot-com domain is in the united states , " he told deutsche welle .
" literally they have a computer in some room somewhere and if you flip a switch on that computer than domain name will disappear .
the information is still there in switzerland , but it 's not accessible at rapidshare.com because the link between rapidshare.com and the swiss computers has been cut . ”
the .com registry is maintained within the us and is subject to us law .
that means a court order could force the registry to freeze the domain name : rapidshare.com.
it does n't matter if rapidshare has its headquarters in switzerland or anywhere else .
while losing a domain name could temporarily impact the company 's business , changing to a new name is not a huge inconvenience .
rapidshare could just set up shop as rapidshare.ch , which is the most common suffix for swiss sites .
wikileaks , for example , used to have a .com suffix - now anyone can access that site at wikileaks.ch.
if seizing domains does n't stop copyright infringement , there is another step , brauneis added .
" the computers in switzerland are actually reached through a series of numbers called an internet protocol address , an ip address , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapidshare could avoid american law simply by changing to a swiss domain like rapidshare.ch " so everyone can spread around the world what the ip address is on those computers and they can continue to upload and download files , not a problem .
and if it turns out that after seizing a bunch of domain names , everyone is just turning to ip addresses - the ip addresses may be next . "
and it gets even more complicated from there .
data re-routing could drive up internet connection pricing " people are going to look for alternative ways of having those kind of sites available , " said peter eckersley , a digital rights advocate with the electronic frontier foundation , a non-profit organization based in san francisco .
however , he cautioned that if sites like this are forced to move offshore , then that may raise the actual cost of internet connections around the world .
" and the effect that will have is a significant increase in the amount of data that 's just moving over international fiber links , " he added .
" that will mean we 'll need to build more fiberlinks . and it 's going to make the cost of running the internet higher . "

" dot-com companies operate around the world , but the company that controls the dot-com domain is in the united states , " he told deutsche welle .
" literally they have a computer in some room somewhere and if you flip a switch on that computer than domain name will disappear .
the information is still there in switzerland , but it 's not accessible at rapidshare.com because the link between rapidshare.com and the swiss computers has been cut . ”
the .com registry is maintained within the us and is subject to us law .
that means a court order could force the registry to freeze the domain name : rapidshare.com.
it does n't matter if rapidshare has its headquarters in switzerland or anywhere else .
while losing a domain name could temporarily impact the company 's business , changing to a new name is not a huge inconvenience .
rapidshare could just set up shop as rapidshare.ch , which is the most common suffix for swiss sites .
wikileaks , for example , used to have a .com suffix - now anyone can access that site at wikileaks.ch.
if seizing domains does n't stop copyright infringement , there is another step , brauneis added .
" the computers in switzerland are actually reached through a series of numbers called an internet protocol address , an ip address , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapidshare could avoid american law simply by changing to a swiss domain like rapidshare.ch " so everyone can spread around the world what the ip address is on those computers and they can continue to upload and download files , not a problem .
and if it turns out that after seizing a bunch of domain names , everyone is just turning to ip addresses - the ip addresses may be next . "
and it gets even more complicated from there .
data re-routing could drive up internet connection pricing " people are going to look for alternative ways of having those kind of sites available , " said peter eckersley , a digital rights advocate with the electronic frontier foundation , a non-profit organization based in san francisco .
however , he cautioned that if sites like this are forced to move offshore , then that may raise the actual cost of internet connections around the world .
" and the effect that will have is a significant increase in the amount of data that 's just moving over international fiber links , " he added .
" that will mean we 'll need to build more fiberlinks . and it 's going to make the cost of running the internet higher . "

but the german government continues to oppose the idea . the debate about issuing so called eurobonds , or e-bonds , - loans with common interest rates across the eurozone - was ignited again on monday when professor peter bofinger , a member of the german government 's panel of independent economic advisors , said that the bonds would stabilize the eurozone .
" issuing eurobonds would make it clear that the countries in europe will remain solvent , and that it 's just no longer possible to push some countries into a corner and burden these countries with extremely high interest , " bofinger said in an interview with german broadcaster deutschland radio .
eurobonds would be issued to all eurozone countries with the same interest rate , allowing those in financial difficulties to benefit from the collective strength of the bloc .
germany and france , countries which enjoy relatively good reputations as debtors , oppose e-bonds .
in a speech to the german parliament last week , chancellor angela merkel laid out her criticism of the idea .
" it 's really important that we do n't make the mistake of collectivizing risks , which would happen with eurobonds , " she said .
" this is absolutely not a solution .
the solution is more harmony and more competitiveness in the eu member states and especially in the eurozone . "
disagreement over costs at the moment , germany borrows at a rate of 1.73 percent , but the average borrowing rate across the eurozone is slightly above 3 percent .
some economists say that if eurobonds were introduced , germany would end up paying more interest .
" there will be a substantial loss of reputation for germany , and germany will have to pay more debt for -lsb- its -rsb- interest , " markus kerber , a professor of economics at berlin 's technical university , told deutsche welle .
a eurozone bond could cost germany 17 billion euros -lrb- $ 22 billion -rrb- more each year , the german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bofinger thinks eurobonds will bring stability but bofinger thinks the assumption is flawed that the eurobonds ' interest rate would reflect the average national interest rates of individual states .
" the interest is so high in some countries because the risk of default is seen as being so high , " bofinger said .
" with a eurobond , the likelihood of a country defaulting is highly unlikely , and so i think it would have much lower interest rates than the average . "
bofinger also said that issuing eurobonds would be a good way of recognizing the austerity measures that are being implemented .
" one has to acknowledge what is being done in greece , portugal , ireland and spain .
these countries , which have really implemented very tough measures to try to stabilize the situation , they would be rewarded by allowing them access to financing with low interest rates , " bofinger said .
opponents say a collective eurozone debt pool would weaken economic competitiveness , because countries like germany , which has a very good reputation as a debtor , would share a credit rating with countries that , according kerber , do n't deserve the same rating .
tarnishing reputations " reputation is the result of challenging the markets .
if we abolish that system , we make it an anti-market system .
we make it an anti-meritocratic system and we give reputation and advantages in terms of interest to countries that do n't deserve it , " said kerber .
distorting competition in this way would destabilize the eurozone in the long term , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel does n't believe in collectivizing risk " i can not understand professor bofinger 's reasoning .
why should non-market conditions for raising funds for fragile countries stabilize the euro ? "
kerber said .
" in the long run , if you distort competition , the system will break down .
there will be a collapse and that collapse will bring down the euro . "
german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble has n't been as vehement in his opposition to eurobonds as merkel , but he has said that there should to be more political and fiscal integration before they are introduced .
this would mean harmonizing national sacred cows like taxes , retirement policy and labor market legislation .
with a string of important state elections coming up in germany in 2011 , it seems unlikely that merkel will do an about-turn on the issue of eurobonds , which could be unpopular with the german electorate .

it was hoped the strike would help convince incumbent president gbagbo to step down . a call for a general strike in ivory coast to pressure incumbent president laurent gbagbo into conceding power have failed to take hold .
in the country 's biggest city , abidjan , business largely went on as usual . the general strike was called for on sunday by supporters of alassane ouattara , the internationally recognized winner of ivory coast 's november presidential election . despite the united nations , the european union , the african union and the economic community of west african states -lrb- ecowas -rrb- all recognizing ouattara as the winner of the november 28 election , gbagbo continues to refuse to step down .
he says the election was rigged and was part of a plot against him orchestrated by france and the united states . the failed strike comes a day ahead of a trip to ivory coast by three ecowas leaders - the presidents of benin , sierra leone and cape verde - to try and personally convince gbagbo to step down .

the us and european union previously imposed travel sanctions on gbagbo and his inner circle , while the world bank and the west african regional central bank have cut off his finances .

the british-made satellite will have a throughput of 70 gigabits per second . on monday , a british-made satellite was launched in kazakhstan , becoming the second european spacecraft devoted to beaming down high-speed internet connectivity .
the ka-sat is designed to provide tens of millions of europeans , especially those living in rural areas , with faster access to the internet .
ka-sat has a total throughput of some 70 gigabits per second , however typically satellite internet access costs much more than dsl or cable modem service .
the new satellite will cover a large swath of europe , ranging from north africa to southern scandinavia , and touching into the edges of the middle east .
" ka-sat will be the cornerstone of a breakthrough infrastructure deployed by eutelsat for users across europe and the mediterranean basin , " said michel de rosen , the chief executive of eutelsat , in a statement .
eutelsat is the company that will operate the satellite .
" by combining a satellite equipped with more than 80 spotbeams and a network of ground stations , this new program will deliver more capacity than any other satellite program deployed worldwide . "
the company also said that commercial internet service will begin in may 2011 .

its repercussions could be widespread , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . the guilty verdict in the trial of the former yukos owner mikhail khodorkovsky and his business partner , platon lebedev , comes as no surprise .
this was far from a free and fair trial , instead it was politically motivated .
sentencing has not yet been handed down but it 's expected that the two men will be jailed until at least 2012 - the year of the presidential elections - if not until 2017 .
many observers say that the former president and current prime minister , vladimir putin , was the driving force behind the guilty verdict . khodorkovsky was first jailed on tax evasion charges in 2003 and many believe that putin wanted to punish khodorkovsky for his perceived meddling in russian politics and his anti-putin stance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel , head of dw 's russian service in the run-up to the current verdict , putin publicly called for a guilty verdict , describing khodorkovsky as a thief .
politically , not the best of moves , considering that moscow was so keen to give the impression of a fair and independent trial .
president dmitry medevedev 's remarks were more circumspect when he said that no one - not even a president or any other high-ranking official , like putin - should comment on the current legal proceedings .
no doubt medvedev was already thinking of the political implications of a guilty verdict .
the questionable legal proceedings have dealt his reform and modernization efforts a heavy blow , and beyond that they could affect relations with the west .
the russian leadership is seemingly unaware that any reform can only be accomplished with the necessary legal and constitutional framework , fancy pr campaigns and speeches wo n't do the trick .
indeed , the trial has reinforced the perception in the west that russia lacks many basic and constitutional rights .
however much germany , europe and the us are interested in having good ties with moscow , there is a growing feeling that a russia shaped and formed by putin can not be trusted .
no doubt us president barack obama , who managed to push through the start arms reduction treaty with russia last week , will be on the receiving end of such criticism .
the west may have readily embraced khodorkovsky and lebedev as symbols for a free , democratic and just russia .
their current treatment and the clearly politically motivated nature of their trial has now led many russians to look up to them as heros in a battle against a corrupt and arbitrary regime .

the verdict in khodorkovsky 's second trial could keep him behind bars for several more years . mikhail khodorkovsky has been found guilty of embezzlement for stealing and reselling over 200 tons of oil from wells he previously owned as head of the yukos oil company .
the judge in the case , viktor danilkin , read the verdict in a moscow courtroom on monday .
khodorkovsky 's business partner and co-defendant platon lebedev was also found guilty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khodorkovsky supporters gathered outside the court monday khodorkovsky is currently serving an eight-year prison sentence for tax evasion .
sentencing in the current case is expected in the next few days .
the prosecution is seeking a six-year sentence .
the russian news agency interfax reported that journalists present in the courtroom were asked to leave by danilkin just after the guilty decision was read .
the entire verdict could take several days to read .
observers have speculated that a date change in the verdict reading , originally scheduled for december 15 , was an attempt to reduce media attention .
shortly after the verdict was read , khodorkovsky 's defense lawyers said they would appeal the decision .
khodorkovsky had previously said he would take the case to the european court of human rights if he was found guilty .
high-profile trial the second trial of russia 's former richest man has garnered international attention .
germany is one of several western nations that have criticized the trial .
in a visit with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov in moscow in early november , german foreign minister guido westerwelle expressed " very serious concern about the conditions of the trial proceedings . "
westerwelle added it was in russia 's best interest to take such concerns seriously .
lavrov replied that it was a matter for the court to decide .
political rivals if khodorkovsky remains behind bars through 2012 , it would keep the outspoken political opponent of prime minister vladimir putin from wielding his influence ahead of the election .
due to his stance against putin and the kremlin , khodorkovsky has become a symbol for the russian opposition and human right activists who decry his imprisonment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin called for a guilty verdict last week khodorkovsky 's original trial in 2003 was widely seen as a politically motivated event , with putin - who was president at the time - pulling the strings .
khodorkovsky had openly funded opposition parties ahead of the 2003 parliamentary elections , which did not sit well with the kremlin .
putin was in the spotlight again leading up to monday 's verdict , making an appeal on live television last week that " the thief must remain in jail . "
the verdict and sentencing in the current case are being seen as a test of the independence of the russian justice system .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 27.12.2010 german government advisor backs eurobonds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians hope to stabilize the euro in 2011 a leading german economist has said that the euro can be stabilized by issuing loans at a set interest rate for the whole eurozone .
but the german government continues to oppose the idea . the debate about issuing so called eurobonds , or e-bonds , - loans with common interest rates across the eurozone - was ignited again on monday when professor peter bofinger , a member of the german government 's panel of independent economic advisors , said that the bonds would stabilize the eurozone .
" issuing eurobonds would make it clear that the countries in europe will remain solvent , and that it 's just no longer possible to push some countries into a corner and burden these countries with extremely high interest , " bofinger said in an interview with german broadcaster deutschland radio .
eurobonds would be issued to all eurozone countries with the same interest rate , allowing those in financial difficulties to benefit from the collective strength of the bloc .
germany and france , countries which enjoy relatively good reputations as debtors , oppose e-bonds .
in a speech to the german parliament last week , chancellor angela merkel laid out her criticism of the idea .
" it 's really important that we do n't make the mistake of collectivizing risks , which would happen with eurobonds , " she said .
" this is absolutely not a solution .
the solution is more harmony and more competitiveness in the eu member states and especially in the eurozone . "
disagreement over costs at the moment , germany borrows at a rate of 1.73 percent , but the average borrowing rate across the eurozone is slightly above 3 percent .
some economists say that if eurobonds were introduced , germany would end up paying more interest .
" there will be a substantial loss of reputation for germany , and germany will have to pay more debt for -lsb- its -rsb- interest , " markus kerber , a professor of economics at berlin 's technical university , told deutsche welle .
a eurozone bond could cost germany 17 billion euros -lrb- $ 22 billion -rrb- more each year , the german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bofinger thinks eurobonds will bring stability but bofinger thinks the assumption is flawed that the eurobonds ' interest rate would reflect the average national interest rates of individual states .
" the interest is so high in some countries because the risk of default is seen as being so high , " bofinger said .
" with a eurobond , the likelihood of a country defaulting is highly unlikely , and so i think it would have much lower interest rates than the average . "
bofinger also said that issuing eurobonds would be a good way of recognizing the austerity measures that are being implemented .
" one has to acknowledge what is being done in greece , portugal , ireland and spain .
these countries , which have really implemented very tough measures to try to stabilize the situation , they would be rewarded by allowing them access to financing with low interest rates , " bofinger said .
opponents say a collective eurozone debt pool would weaken economic competitiveness , because countries like germany , which has a very good reputation as a debtor , would share a credit rating with countries that , according kerber , do n't deserve the same rating .
tarnishing reputations " reputation is the result of challenging the markets .
if we abolish that system , we make it an anti-market system .
we make it an anti-meritocratic system and we give reputation and advantages in terms of interest to countries that do n't deserve it , " said kerber .
distorting competition in this way would destabilize the eurozone in the long term , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel does n't believe in collectivizing risk " i can not understand professor bofinger 's reasoning .
why should non-market conditions for raising funds for fragile countries stabilize the euro ? "

but the german government continues to oppose the idea . the debate about issuing so called eurobonds , or e-bonds , - loans with common interest rates across the eurozone - was ignited again on monday when professor peter bofinger , a member of the german government 's panel of independent economic advisors , said that the bonds would stabilize the eurozone .
" issuing eurobonds would make it clear that the countries in europe will remain solvent , and that it 's just no longer possible to push some countries into a corner and burden these countries with extremely high interest , " bofinger said in an interview with german broadcaster deutschland radio .
eurobonds would be issued to all eurozone countries with the same interest rate , allowing those in financial difficulties to benefit from the collective strength of the bloc .
germany and france , countries which enjoy relatively good reputations as debtors , oppose e-bonds .
in a speech to the german parliament last week , chancellor angela merkel laid out her criticism of the idea .
" it 's really important that we do n't make the mistake of collectivizing risks , which would happen with eurobonds , " she said .
" this is absolutely not a solution .
the solution is more harmony and more competitiveness in the eu member states and especially in the eurozone . "
disagreement over costs at the moment , germany borrows at a rate of 1.73 percent , but the average borrowing rate across the eurozone is slightly above 3 percent .
some economists say that if eurobonds were introduced , germany would end up paying more interest .
" there will be a substantial loss of reputation for germany , and germany will have to pay more debt for -lsb- its -rsb- interest , " markus kerber , a professor of economics at berlin 's technical university , told deutsche welle .
a eurozone bond could cost germany 17 billion euros -lrb- $ 22 billion -rrb- more each year , the german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bofinger thinks eurobonds will bring stability but bofinger thinks the assumption is flawed that the eurobonds ' interest rate would reflect the average national interest rates of individual states .
" the interest is so high in some countries because the risk of default is seen as being so high , " bofinger said .
" with a eurobond , the likelihood of a country defaulting is highly unlikely , and so i think it would have much lower interest rates than the average . "
bofinger also said that issuing eurobonds would be a good way of recognizing the austerity measures that are being implemented .
" one has to acknowledge what is being done in greece , portugal , ireland and spain .
these countries , which have really implemented very tough measures to try to stabilize the situation , they would be rewarded by allowing them access to financing with low interest rates , " bofinger said .
opponents say a collective eurozone debt pool would weaken economic competitiveness , because countries like germany , which has a very good reputation as a debtor , would share a credit rating with countries that , according kerber , do n't deserve the same rating .
tarnishing reputations " reputation is the result of challenging the markets .
if we abolish that system , we make it an anti-market system .
we make it an anti-meritocratic system and we give reputation and advantages in terms of interest to countries that do n't deserve it , " said kerber .
distorting competition in this way would destabilize the eurozone in the long term , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel does n't believe in collectivizing risk " i can not understand professor bofinger 's reasoning .
why should non-market conditions for raising funds for fragile countries stabilize the euro ? "
kerber said .
" in the long run , if you distort competition , the system will break down .
there will be a collapse and that collapse will bring down the euro . "
german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble has n't been as vehement in his opposition to eurobonds as merkel , but he has said that there should to be more political and fiscal integration before they are introduced .

the verdict in khodorkovsky 's second trial could keep him behind bars for several more years . mikhail khodorkovsky has been found guilty of embezzlement for stealing and reselling over 200 tons of oil from wells he previously owned as head of the yukos oil company .
the judge in the case , viktor danilkin , read the verdict in a moscow courtroom on monday .
khodorkovsky 's business partner and co-defendant platon lebedev was also found guilty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khodorkovsky supporters gathered outside the court monday khodorkovsky is currently serving an eight-year prison sentence for tax evasion .
sentencing in the current case is expected in the next few days .
the prosecution is seeking a six-year sentence .
the russian news agency interfax reported that journalists present in the courtroom were asked to leave by danilkin just after the guilty decision was read .
the entire verdict could take several days to read .
observers have speculated that a date change in the verdict reading , originally scheduled for december 15 , was an attempt to reduce media attention .
shortly after the verdict was read , khodorkovsky 's defense lawyers said they would appeal the decision .
khodorkovsky had previously said he would take the case to the european court of human rights if he was found guilty .
high-profile trial the second trial of russia 's former richest man has garnered international attention .
germany is one of several western nations that have criticized the trial .
in a visit with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov in moscow in early november , german foreign minister guido westerwelle expressed " very serious concern about the conditions of the trial proceedings . "
westerwelle added it was in russia 's best interest to take such concerns seriously .
lavrov replied that it was a matter for the court to decide .
political rivals if khodorkovsky remains behind bars through 2012 , it would keep the outspoken political opponent of prime minister vladimir putin from wielding his influence ahead of the election .
due to his stance against putin and the kremlin , khodorkovsky has become a symbol for the russian opposition and human right activists who decry his imprisonment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin called for a guilty verdict last week khodorkovsky 's original trial in 2003 was widely seen as a politically motivated event , with putin - who was president at the time - pulling the strings .
khodorkovsky had openly funded opposition parties ahead of the 2003 parliamentary elections , which did not sit well with the kremlin .
putin was in the spotlight again leading up to monday 's verdict , making an appeal on live television last week that " the thief must remain in jail . "
the verdict and sentencing in the current case are being seen as a test of the independence of the russian justice system .

west african bloc threatens intervention in ivory coast ecowas lacks adequate logistics and cohesion for a quick and decisive strike to remove the dictator who is trying to thwart the will of the ivoirians .
military force should be used if laurent gbagbo refuses to quit as it has been shown from the election result that the majority of the people does not want him to continue in power .
he should never underestimate a determined ecowas with a very strong nigerian influence and the support of the au , un , us and eu . - agholor , nigeria my opinion is that gbagbo should hand over power peacefully , but if that is not the case then ecowas will have to send in the military .
he can not just gain power by force .
a lot of resources were spent for the election to take place , so the people of ivory coast deserve to be heard . - james , kenya i think it 's high time we put an end to all of this military adventurism on the african continent so the ordinary people can be saved from these selfish individuals , and hopefully have some chance for some real development .
though there is a risk of abuse in intervening in the internal affairs of independent member states , this time around ecowas is right to use full force to oust gbagbo .
that would send a useful signal to all intending adventurists on the continent !
ecowas may even need to clearly define the circumstances under which it might routinely consider this form of intervention in future .
enough is enough ! - anthony , nigeria i am happy that ecowas has given a warning to laurent gbagbo that should he decide not to stand down , the bloc would use legitimate force to oust him from power .
for a long time now , the african union and the world have watched dictators cling to power even when they lost elections .
the peoples ' will , expressed through elections or the ballot box , has meant nothing . - malama , zambia while i am thankful that we have the presence of the un in our world , however , it would be a mistake to send un peacekeepers .
i believe ecowas is more in touch with what 's happening in ivory coast and it 's time we give credence and support to local initiatives of this magnitude .
the un should work with ecowas and give necessary guidance if need be .
too many cooks here will spoil these welcome " winds of change " we are beginning to witness in some parts of africa . - gari , unknown compiled by stuart tiffen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the country 's biggest city , abidjan , business largely went on as usual . the general strike was called for on sunday by supporters of alassane ouattara , the internationally recognized winner of ivory coast 's november presidential election . despite the united nations , the european union , the african union and the economic community of west african states -lrb- ecowas -rrb- all recognizing ouattara as the winner of the november 28 election , gbagbo continues to refuse to step down .
he says the election was rigged and was part of a plot against him orchestrated by france and the united states . the failed strike comes a day ahead of a trip to ivory coast by three ecowas leaders - the presidents of benin , sierra leone and cape verde - to try and personally convince gbagbo to step down .
should their bid fail , ecowas has threatened to take military action . threat of renewed civil war the standoff between the two presidential candidates has led to increased tension in the country , and around 200 people have already been killed in the election aftermath , according to the un human rights council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gbagbo has refused to relinquish power the unhrc also says at least 14,000 ivorians have fled to neighboring liberia , fearful of a return to the 2002-2003 civil war in ivory coast . " with their numbers growing , the humanitarian needs are increasing for the mostly women and children refugees as well as for the villagers hosting them , " the unhrc said in a statement on its website over the weekend . gbagbo 's interior minister , emile guirieoulou , on sunday rejected un allegations of widespread human rights violations in the election aftermath by gbagbo 's security forces , saying the world body was being partisan .
international pressure in addition to the threat of military intervention from ecowas , international pressure on gbagbo increased over the weekend as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ouattara has called for a nationwide general strike on sunday , airport authorities in the swiss city of basel grounded a plane belonging to gbagbo at the request of " the legitimate authorities " of ivory coast , a spokesman for the french foreign ministry said .
the aircraft is parked at the basel-mulhouse airport , which is jointly run by french and swiss authorities .
the us and european union previously imposed travel sanctions on gbagbo and his inner circle , while the world bank and the west african regional central bank have cut off his finances .

in a statement , german foreign minister guido westerwelle called the verdict " a step backward " for russia .
westerwelle said that the way the trial was conducted was " very dubious " and called on russia to " stand up for the rule of law , democracy and human rights . "
german human rights commissioner markus loening found even stronger words to condemn the verdict , telling the dpa news agency that he was " outraged . "

they see the verdict as casting doubt on president dmitry medvedev 's pledges to modernize russia . germany and other western countries have condemned the guilty verdict pronounced by a russian court against jailed tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky on new fraud charges .
in a statement , german foreign minister guido westerwelle called the verdict " a step backward " for russia .
westerwelle said that the way the trial was conducted was " very dubious " and called on russia to " stand up for the rule of law , democracy and human rights . "
german human rights commissioner markus loening found even stronger words to condemn the verdict , telling the dpa news agency that he was " outraged . "
" the judgment throws no good light on circumstances in russia , " he said .
loening described the verdict as " a crass misinterpretation of what happened in court . "
' russia must respect human rights commitments ' chief european union diplomat catherine ashton called on russia " to respect its international commitments in the field of human rights and the rule of law . "
she said the eu would " continue to follow developments very closely , including the forthcoming announcement of the sentence . "
across the atlantic , united states secretary of state hillary clinton said the verdict raised " serious questions about selective prosecution - and about the rule of law being overshadowed by political considerations . "
clinton also warned in a statement that " this and similar cases have a negative impact on russia 's reputation for fulfilling its international human rights obligations and improving its investment climate . "
embezzlement charges khodorkovsky was found guilty of embezzlement for stealing and reselling over 200 tons of oil from wells he previously owned as head of the yukos oil company .
his business partner and co-defendant platon lebedev was also found guilty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khodorkovsky 's supporters see him as a symbol for democratic struggle khodorkovsky is currently serving an eight-year prison sentence for tax evasion .
his release was scheduled for 2011 .
sentencing in the current case is expected in the next few days .
the prosecution is seeking a six-year jail term .
shortly after the verdict was read , khodorkovsky 's defense lawyers said they would appeal the decision .
khodorkovsky had previously said he would take the case to the european court of human rights if he was found guilty .
orchestrated by putin ?
khodorkovsky and his lawyers say the charges against him are politically motivated .
the tycoon has been an outspoken opponent of former president and current prime minister vladimir putin , openly funding opposition parties ahead of 2003 parliamentary elections .
khodorkovsky 's original trial in 2003 was widely seen as having been orchestrated by putin .
if khodorkovsky remains in jail through 2012 , it will prevent him from wielding his influence ahead of the election scheduled in that year .
the current case has been seen as a test of the independence of the russian justice system .
but monday 's conviction sheds grave doubts on president dmitry medvedev 's vows to modernize russia and take it out of putin 's shadow .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 27.12.2010 berlin plans undercover checks on financial advisors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : financial advisors need to think carefully about what they say financial advisors in german banks could receive an unpleasant visit from undercover investigators under a government plan aimed at protecting consumers against inadequate investment advice . german consumer protection minister ilse aigner plans to tighten controls on financial advisors selling shares and other investment products .
" in the future , undercover investigators will be deployed by the government – and they wo n't only be checking general terms and conditions , " aigner said in an interview with the german business newspaper handelsblatt .
rather than simply inspecting the fine print of contracts , investigators posing as potential customers would be able to assess whether financial advisors provide transparent explanations of the products they are selling .
risk management many private investors in germany who lost a chunk of their personal wealth in the financial crisis complain they were insufficiently warned of the risks attached to their investments .
financial advisors , they charge , like to sell high-risk investments not only because of the high commissions they collect but also because of the healthy margins they generate for their bank employers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many private investors saw their savings go down the drain in the financial crisis aigner envisions a state-run control program to complement " mystery shopper " tests already conducted by the independent german consumer research foundation , stiftung warentest .
the foundation conducts spot checks of products and services - including investment advice provided by banks and other financial institutions - and publishes the results .
in july , it released the results of a test of financial advice offered by 21 banks .
six banks failed and not one received the rating " good " or " very good . "
but the problem with the stiftung warentest 's program , aigner said , is that because informants ca n't be identified , banks frequently question the validity of its findings .
penalties still unknown by launching a state-run program , the minister hopes to keep financial advisors on their best behavior .
" laws only help when someone ensures that they are enforced , " she said .
aigner said she would like germany 's federal financial supervisory authority -lrb- bafin -rrb- to administer the undercover checks .
the minister gave no details about the penalties banks providing poor advice could face .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de piracy -pipe- 27.12.2010 swiss file-sharing website hires us lobbying firm großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapidshare is one of three european sites lobbying dc after being named as one of the most infringing websites , rapidshare is headed to the us capital to convince american lawmakers that it is not liable for illegal file-sharing . rapidshare , an online file-sharing site based in cham , switzerland , is under increased international scrutiny for enabling copyright infringement , as earlier this year members of the us congress named rapidshare one of the top six most infringing websites in the world .
" as you can imagine , we 're not very happy about that , " said daniel raimer , a german attorney and spokesman for rapidshare , in an interview with deutsche welle .
following the us government 's crackdown on infringing websites earlier this fall , seizing the domain names of more than 80 websites , rapidshare has found a way to reinvent itself in the american capital .
just last month , the company hired the washington , dc-based lobbying firm dutko to protect its interests abroad .
this likely makes it the first such european file-sharing company to lobby american lawmakers .
the company says its has more appointments coming up on capitol hill , and remains confident that it will get off the list by early 2011 , long before next year 's list is published .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss company only says about five percent of what is uploaded to its site is illegal only a small percentage of its files are illegal rapidshare estimates that copyrighted music and movies make up roughly five percent , or 10,000 of the 400,000 files uploaded every day .
although the site accepts and hosts every type of file , because the company takes many steps to filter out infringing files before they are posted , raimer argued that rapidshare is not the type of site the us should be going after .
" we believe that it 's unfair that we 're being put on the list , " he added .
" you ca n't just take a look at the number of infringing material that you can find on the server .
google has probably millions and millions of links to illegal files .
most people would probably agree that google is not a bad company . "
by international law rapidshare is not liable for what users upload and download , and recent german and american legal cases have upheld this notion .
the only thing that is required of rapidshare is to take down infringing files once the copyright holder tells it to .
while lobbying on behalf of foreign companies is nothing new in washington , it is new for foreign web companies to do so .
an online database of lobbying disclosures reveals that the only other european websites lobbying the us congress right now are two online gaming sites , pokerstars.net and partygaming.com.
us can exert limited power over foreign sites a new anti-piracy bill making its way through the us senate could clear the way for the government to seize more infringing domains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to most international law , rapidshare is not liable for what its users upload to the site and then download to their music players if the law passes , according to bob brauneis , professor of copyright law at george washington university in washington , dc , it could certainly impact rapidshare , despite the fact that it is not based in the united states . " dot-com companies operate around the world , but the company that controls the dot-com domain is in the united states , " he told deutsche welle .
" literally they have a computer in some room somewhere and if you flip a switch on that computer than domain name will disappear .
the information is still there in switzerland , but it 's not accessible at rapidshare.com because the link between rapidshare.com and the swiss computers has been cut . ”
the .com registry is maintained within the us and is subject to us law .
that means a court order could force the registry to freeze the domain name : rapidshare.com.
it does n't matter if rapidshare has its headquarters in switzerland or anywhere else .
while losing a domain name could temporarily impact the company 's business , changing to a new name is not a huge inconvenience .
rapidshare could just set up shop as rapidshare.ch , which is the most common suffix for swiss sites .
wikileaks , for example , used to have a .com suffix - now anyone can access that site at wikileaks.ch.
if seizing domains does n't stop copyright infringement , there is another step , brauneis added .
" the computers in switzerland are actually reached through a series of numbers called an internet protocol address , an ip address , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapidshare could avoid american law simply by changing to a swiss domain like rapidshare.ch " so everyone can spread around the world what the ip address is on those computers and they can continue to upload and download files , not a problem .
and if it turns out that after seizing a bunch of domain names , everyone is just turning to ip addresses - the ip addresses may be next . "
and it gets even more complicated from there .
data re-routing could drive up internet connection pricing " people are going to look for alternative ways of having those kind of sites available , " said peter eckersley , a digital rights advocate with the electronic frontier foundation , a non-profit organization based in san francisco .
however , he cautioned that if sites like this are forced to move offshore , then that may raise the actual cost of internet connections around the world .
" and the effect that will have is a significant increase in the amount of data that 's just moving over international fiber links , " he added .
" that will mean we 'll need to build more fiberlinks . and it 's going to make the cost of running the internet higher . "

" from my own and a police point of view , i urge and support a ban , " police union head bernhard witthaut told deutsche welle .
" i think it 's terrible how they mock foreigners living in germany , i think their concept of a state is terrible . "
witthaut was not alone in his comments .
the president of the central council of jews in germany , dieter graumann , said in an interview over the weekend that the npd , which currently has an estimated 7,000 members , had clearly set itself the goal of destroying democracy in germany .
the country must resist such attempts , he said , if necessary by issuing a ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernhard witthaut said a new court case must be well prepared the head of the turkish community in germany , kenan kolat , urged a more consistent prosecution of xenophobic attacks in germany .
banning the npd , he told the news agency dapd , could also " have a positive effect in the fight against right-wing extremism and racism . " the german government attempted to ban the npd in a case heard by the country 's highest court , the constitutional court , in 2001 .
but the case was thrown out two years later after it was disclosed that several people in the npd 's inner circle were german secret service undercover agents or informants .
signal in the fight against far-right extremism the police union 's witthaut said that some people in law enforcement believed it would be easier to deal with the far-right party if you knew how it operated and where it was active , whereas if the party were to go underground , it would be much more difficult to keep an eye on its activities . but he said he was convinced that outlawing a party listed as racist , anti-semitic and revisionist by germany 's domestic intelligence agency would be " an important signal in the fight against right-wing extremism . "
" many might view the risk of a renewed failure before germany 's highest court as such a grave aspect that they might dismiss steps in that direction , " bavaria 's interior minister joachim herrmann said on monday .
but he added that banning the npd was desirable , and he would continue to lobby for a ban of the party .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de piracy -pipe- 27.12.2010 swiss file-sharing website hires us lobbying firm großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapidshare is one of three european sites lobbying dc after being named as one of the most infringing websites , rapidshare is headed to the us capital to convince american lawmakers that it is not liable for illegal file-sharing . rapidshare , an online file-sharing site based in cham , switzerland , is under increased international scrutiny for enabling copyright infringement , as earlier this year members of the us congress named rapidshare one of the top six most infringing websites in the world .
" as you can imagine , we 're not very happy about that , " said daniel raimer , a german attorney and spokesman for rapidshare , in an interview with deutsche welle .
following the us government 's crackdown on infringing websites earlier this fall , seizing the domain names of more than 80 websites , rapidshare has found a way to reinvent itself in the american capital .
just last month , the company hired the washington , dc-based lobbying firm dutko to protect its interests abroad .
this likely makes it the first such european file-sharing company to lobby american lawmakers .
the company says its has more appointments coming up on capitol hill , and remains confident that it will get off the list by early 2011 , long before next year 's list is published .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss company only says about five percent of what is uploaded to its site is illegal only a small percentage of its files are illegal rapidshare estimates that copyrighted music and movies make up roughly five percent , or 10,000 of the 400,000 files uploaded every day .
although the site accepts and hosts every type of file , because the company takes many steps to filter out infringing files before they are posted , raimer argued that rapidshare is not the type of site the us should be going after .
" we believe that it 's unfair that we 're being put on the list , " he added .
" you ca n't just take a look at the number of infringing material that you can find on the server .
google has probably millions and millions of links to illegal files .
most people would probably agree that google is not a bad company . "
by international law rapidshare is not liable for what users upload and download , and recent german and american legal cases have upheld this notion .
the only thing that is required of rapidshare is to take down infringing files once the copyright holder tells it to .
while lobbying on behalf of foreign companies is nothing new in washington , it is new for foreign web companies to do so .
an online database of lobbying disclosures reveals that the only other european websites lobbying the us congress right now are two online gaming sites , pokerstars.net and partygaming.com.
us can exert limited power over foreign sites a new anti-piracy bill making its way through the us senate could clear the way for the government to seize more infringing domains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to most international law , rapidshare is not liable for what its users upload to the site and then download to their music players if the law passes , according to bob brauneis , professor of copyright law at george washington university in washington , dc , it could certainly impact rapidshare , despite the fact that it is not based in the united states . " dot-com companies operate around the world , but the company that controls the dot-com domain is in the united states , " he told deutsche welle .
" literally they have a computer in some room somewhere and if you flip a switch on that computer than domain name will disappear .
the information is still there in switzerland , but it 's not accessible at rapidshare.com because the link between rapidshare.com and the swiss computers has been cut . ”
the .com registry is maintained within the us and is subject to us law .
that means a court order could force the registry to freeze the domain name : rapidshare.com.
it does n't matter if rapidshare has its headquarters in switzerland or anywhere else .
while losing a domain name could temporarily impact the company 's business , changing to a new name is not a huge inconvenience .
rapidshare could just set up shop as rapidshare.ch , which is the most common suffix for swiss sites .
wikileaks , for example , used to have a .com suffix - now anyone can access that site at wikileaks.ch.
if seizing domains does n't stop copyright infringement , there is another step , brauneis added .
" the computers in switzerland are actually reached through a series of numbers called an internet protocol address , an ip address , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapidshare could avoid american law simply by changing to a swiss domain like rapidshare.ch " so everyone can spread around the world what the ip address is on those computers and they can continue to upload and download files , not a problem .
and if it turns out that after seizing a bunch of domain names , everyone is just turning to ip addresses - the ip addresses may be next . "
and it gets even more complicated from there .
data re-routing could drive up internet connection pricing " people are going to look for alternative ways of having those kind of sites available , " said peter eckersley , a digital rights advocate with the electronic frontier foundation , a non-profit organization based in san francisco .
however , he cautioned that if sites like this are forced to move offshore , then that may raise the actual cost of internet connections around the world .
" and the effect that will have is a significant increase in the amount of data that 's just moving over international fiber links , " he added .
" that will mean we 'll need to build more fiberlinks . and it 's going to make the cost of running the internet higher . "

it has found some unusual ways of doing this . tallinn is preparing for its moment in the spotlight as the european capital of culture 2011 . over 250 different events and festivals have been planned for the coming year that center on the motto , " stories of the seashore , " which hints at estonian history and reflects tallinn ’ s location next to the sea . according to maris hellrand , spokeswoman for the tallinn 2011 organizational committee , the relationship between tallinn and the sea is of particular importance .
until the end of the soviet union 's reign over estonia , which ended in 1991 , the city 's shores were a restricted military zone .
the soldiers are no longer there today , but access to the sea is still largely obstructed .
this is set to change in 2011 . " at the moment , there 's still an old jail at the seashore , " said hellrand .
" we want to transform the seaside promenade in front of it into a ' culture kilometer . " ' the culture kilometer is the planned heart for the year 's celebrations , with most of the tallinn 2011 events taking place there . unusual attractions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the event planners have many unusual ideas estonia , which is due to join the euro currency zone on january 1 , wants to present itself as a modern european country in 2011 .

" they will be put together into a one-hour film . " the film is due to be screened in august - not at a movie theater but on a large screen mounted in the sea .
the audience will be able to see it from the shore and watch as it bursts into flames together with the film reel at the end of the screening .

it involves audience members producing electricity for the stage lighting by pedaling on indoor bikes .
in this way , they help create a stage show that does not depend on fossil fuels . a look into the estonian soul the creators of tallinn 2011 hope to combine the future with tradition .
the youth song and dance celebration festival aims to exemplify that combination and will serve as one of the main capital of culture events . choral singing is an important tradition in estonia 's history , having played a key role in the singing revolution - a series of spontaneous mass-singing demonstrations that took place between 1987 and 1991 to help bring about estonia 's independence from the soviet union . in 2011 , thousands are expected to gather at the tallinn song festival grounds for several days in a special commemoration the 20th anniversary of independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many will sing again at the city 's song festival grounds " this festival is an opportunity to get a glimpse into the estonian soul within one weekend , " said hellrand .

" i think it 's terrible how they mock foreigners living in germany , i think their concept of a state is terrible . "
witthaut was not alone in his comments .
the president of the central council of jews in germany , dieter graumann , said in an interview over the weekend that the npd , which currently has an estimated 7,000 members , had clearly set itself the goal of destroying democracy in germany .

but the case was thrown out two years later after it was disclosed that several people in the npd 's inner circle were german secret service undercover agents or informants .
signal in the fight against far-right extremism the police union 's witthaut said that some people in law enforcement believed it would be easier to deal with the far-right party if you knew how it operated and where it was active , whereas if the party were to go underground , it would be much more difficult to keep an eye on its activities . but he said he was convinced that outlawing a party listed as racist , anti-semitic and revisionist by germany 's domestic intelligence agency would be " an important signal in the fight against right-wing extremism . "
" many might view the risk of a renewed failure before germany 's highest court as such a grave aspect that they might dismiss steps in that direction , " bavaria 's interior minister joachim herrmann said on monday .

they see the verdict as casting doubt on president dmitry medvedev 's pledges to modernize russia . germany and other western countries have condemned the guilty verdict pronounced by a russian court against jailed tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky on new fraud charges .
in a statement , german foreign minister guido westerwelle called the verdict " a step backward " for russia .
westerwelle said that the way the trial was conducted was " very dubious " and called on russia to " stand up for the rule of law , democracy and human rights . "
german human rights commissioner markus loening found even stronger words to condemn the verdict , telling the dpa news agency that he was " outraged . "
" the judgment throws no good light on circumstances in russia , " he said .
loening described the verdict as " a crass misinterpretation of what happened in court . "
' russia must respect human rights commitments ' chief european union diplomat catherine ashton called on russia " to respect its international commitments in the field of human rights and the rule of law . "
she said the eu would " continue to follow developments very closely , including the forthcoming announcement of the sentence . "
across the atlantic , united states secretary of state hillary clinton said the verdict raised " serious questions about selective prosecution - and about the rule of law being overshadowed by political considerations . "
clinton also warned in a statement that " this and similar cases have a negative impact on russia 's reputation for fulfilling its international human rights obligations and improving its investment climate . "

the prosecution is seeking a six-year jail term .
shortly after the verdict was read , khodorkovsky 's defense lawyers said they would appeal the decision .
khodorkovsky had previously said he would take the case to the european court of human rights if he was found guilty .
orchestrated by putin ?
khodorkovsky and his lawyers say the charges against him are politically motivated .
the tycoon has been an outspoken opponent of former president and current prime minister vladimir putin , openly funding opposition parties ahead of 2003 parliamentary elections .
khodorkovsky 's original trial in 2003 was widely seen as having been orchestrated by putin .
if khodorkovsky remains in jail through 2012 , it will prevent him from wielding his influence ahead of the election scheduled in that year .
the current case has been seen as a test of the independence of the russian justice system .
but monday 's conviction sheds grave doubts on president dmitry medvedev 's vows to modernize russia and take it out of putin 's shadow .

they see the verdict as casting doubt on president dmitry medvedev 's pledges to modernize russia . germany and other western countries have condemned the guilty verdict pronounced by a russian court against jailed tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky on new fraud charges .
in a statement , german foreign minister guido westerwelle called the verdict " a step backward " for russia .
westerwelle said that the way the trial was conducted was " very dubious " and called on russia to " stand up for the rule of law , democracy and human rights . "
german human rights commissioner markus loening found even stronger words to condemn the verdict , telling the dpa news agency that he was " outraged . "
" the judgment throws no good light on circumstances in russia , " he said .
loening described the verdict as " a crass misinterpretation of what happened in court . "
' russia must respect human rights commitments ' chief european union diplomat catherine ashton called on russia " to respect its international commitments in the field of human rights and the rule of law . "
she said the eu would " continue to follow developments very closely , including the forthcoming announcement of the sentence . "
across the atlantic , united states secretary of state hillary clinton said the verdict raised " serious questions about selective prosecution - and about the rule of law being overshadowed by political considerations . "
clinton also warned in a statement that " this and similar cases have a negative impact on russia 's reputation for fulfilling its international human rights obligations and improving its investment climate . "
embezzlement charges khodorkovsky was found guilty of embezzlement for stealing and reselling over 200 tons of oil from wells he previously owned as head of the yukos oil company .
his business partner and co-defendant platon lebedev was also found guilty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khodorkovsky 's supporters see him as a symbol for democratic struggle khodorkovsky is currently serving an eight-year prison sentence for tax evasion .
his release was scheduled for 2011 .
sentencing in the current case is expected in the next few days .
the prosecution is seeking a six-year jail term .
shortly after the verdict was read , khodorkovsky 's defense lawyers said they would appeal the decision .
khodorkovsky had previously said he would take the case to the european court of human rights if he was found guilty .
orchestrated by putin ?
khodorkovsky and his lawyers say the charges against him are politically motivated .
the tycoon has been an outspoken opponent of former president and current prime minister vladimir putin , openly funding opposition parties ahead of 2003 parliamentary elections .
khodorkovsky 's original trial in 2003 was widely seen as having been orchestrated by putin .

" as you can imagine , we 're not very happy about that , " said daniel raimer , a german attorney and spokesman for rapidshare , in an interview with deutsche welle .
following the us government 's crackdown on infringing websites earlier this fall , seizing the domain names of more than 80 websites , rapidshare has found a way to reinvent itself in the american capital .
just last month , the company hired the washington , dc-based lobbying firm dutko to protect its interests abroad .
this likely makes it the first such european file-sharing company to lobby american lawmakers .
the company says its has more appointments coming up on capitol hill , and remains confident that it will get off the list by early 2011 , long before next year 's list is published .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss company only says about five percent of what is uploaded to its site is illegal only a small percentage of its files are illegal rapidshare estimates that copyrighted music and movies make up roughly five percent , or 10,000 of the 400,000 files uploaded every day .
although the site accepts and hosts every type of file , because the company takes many steps to filter out infringing files before they are posted , raimer argued that rapidshare is not the type of site the us should be going after .

" you ca n't just take a look at the number of infringing material that you can find on the server .

by international law rapidshare is not liable for what users upload and download , and recent german and american legal cases have upheld this notion .
the only thing that is required of rapidshare is to take down infringing files once the copyright holder tells it to .
while lobbying on behalf of foreign companies is nothing new in washington , it is new for foreign web companies to do so .
an online database of lobbying disclosures reveals that the only other european websites lobbying the us congress right now are two online gaming sites , pokerstars.net and partygaming.com.

the information is still there in switzerland , but it 's not accessible at rapidshare.com because the link between rapidshare.com and the swiss computers has been cut . ”
the .com registry is maintained within the us and is subject to us law .
that means a court order could force the registry to freeze the domain name : rapidshare.com.

rapidshare could just set up shop as rapidshare.ch , which is the most common suffix for swiss sites .
wikileaks , for example , used to have a .com suffix - now anyone can access that site at wikileaks.ch.
if seizing domains does n't stop copyright infringement , there is another step , brauneis added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 27.12.2010 german police union urges ban of far-right npd großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banning the npd has proved to be tricky seven years after the german government failed in an attempt to ban a far-right party , calls have become louder for renewed efforts to outlaw a party that is under observation of the federal intelligence agency . germany 's police union gdp and the central council of jews in germany have appealed for renewed efforts to ban the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , a fringe group with no federal-level representation , but with seats in two of germany 's 16 state parliaments .
" from my own and a police point of view , i urge and support a ban , " police union head bernhard witthaut told deutsche welle .
" i think it 's terrible how they mock foreigners living in germany , i think their concept of a state is terrible . "
witthaut was not alone in his comments .
the president of the central council of jews in germany , dieter graumann , said in an interview over the weekend that the npd , which currently has an estimated 7,000 members , had clearly set itself the goal of destroying democracy in germany .
the country must resist such attempts , he said , if necessary by issuing a ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernhard witthaut said a new court case must be well prepared the head of the turkish community in germany , kenan kolat , urged a more consistent prosecution of xenophobic attacks in germany .
banning the npd , he told the news agency dapd , could also " have a positive effect in the fight against right-wing extremism and racism . " the german government attempted to ban the npd in a case heard by the country 's highest court , the constitutional court , in 2001 .
but the case was thrown out two years later after it was disclosed that several people in the npd 's inner circle were german secret service undercover agents or informants .
signal in the fight against far-right extremism the police union 's witthaut said that some people in law enforcement believed it would be easier to deal with the far-right party if you knew how it operated and where it was active , whereas if the party were to go underground , it would be much more difficult to keep an eye on its activities . but he said he was convinced that outlawing a party listed as racist , anti-semitic and revisionist by germany 's domestic intelligence agency would be " an important signal in the fight against right-wing extremism . "
" many might view the risk of a renewed failure before germany 's highest court as such a grave aspect that they might dismiss steps in that direction , " bavaria 's interior minister joachim herrmann said on monday .
but he added that banning the npd was desirable , and he would continue to lobby for a ban of the party .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 27.12.2010 german government advisor backs eurobonds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians hope to stabilize the euro in 2011 a leading german economist has said that the euro can be stabilized by issuing loans at a set interest rate for the whole eurozone .
but the german government continues to oppose the idea . the debate about issuing so called eurobonds , or e-bonds , - loans with common interest rates across the eurozone - was ignited again on monday when professor peter bofinger , a member of the german government 's panel of independent economic advisors , said that the bonds would stabilize the eurozone .
" issuing eurobonds would make it clear that the countries in europe will remain solvent , and that it 's just no longer possible to push some countries into a corner and burden these countries with extremely high interest , " bofinger said in an interview with german broadcaster deutschland radio .
eurobonds would be issued to all eurozone countries with the same interest rate , allowing those in financial difficulties to benefit from the collective strength of the bloc .
germany and france , countries which enjoy relatively good reputations as debtors , oppose e-bonds .
in a speech to the german parliament last week , chancellor angela merkel laid out her criticism of the idea .
" it 's really important that we do n't make the mistake of collectivizing risks , which would happen with eurobonds , " she said .
" this is absolutely not a solution .
the solution is more harmony and more competitiveness in the eu member states and especially in the eurozone . "
disagreement over costs at the moment , germany borrows at a rate of 1.73 percent , but the average borrowing rate across the eurozone is slightly above 3 percent .
some economists say that if eurobonds were introduced , germany would end up paying more interest .
" there will be a substantial loss of reputation for germany , and germany will have to pay more debt for -lsb- its -rsb- interest , " markus kerber , a professor of economics at berlin 's technical university , told deutsche welle .
a eurozone bond could cost germany 17 billion euros -lrb- $ 22 billion -rrb- more each year , the german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bofinger thinks eurobonds will bring stability but bofinger thinks the assumption is flawed that the eurobonds ' interest rate would reflect the average national interest rates of individual states .
" the interest is so high in some countries because the risk of default is seen as being so high , " bofinger said .
" with a eurobond , the likelihood of a country defaulting is highly unlikely , and so i think it would have much lower interest rates than the average . "
bofinger also said that issuing eurobonds would be a good way of recognizing the austerity measures that are being implemented .
" one has to acknowledge what is being done in greece , portugal , ireland and spain .
these countries , which have really implemented very tough measures to try to stabilize the situation , they would be rewarded by allowing them access to financing with low interest rates , " bofinger said .
opponents say a collective eurozone debt pool would weaken economic competitiveness , because countries like germany , which has a very good reputation as a debtor , would share a credit rating with countries that , according kerber , do n't deserve the same rating .
tarnishing reputations " reputation is the result of challenging the markets .
if we abolish that system , we make it an anti-market system .
we make it an anti-meritocratic system and we give reputation and advantages in terms of interest to countries that do n't deserve it , " said kerber .
distorting competition in this way would destabilize the eurozone in the long term , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel does n't believe in collectivizing risk " i can not understand professor bofinger 's reasoning .
why should non-market conditions for raising funds for fragile countries stabilize the euro ? "
kerber said .
" in the long run , if you distort competition , the system will break down .
there will be a collapse and that collapse will bring down the euro . "
german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble has n't been as vehement in his opposition to eurobonds as merkel , but he has said that there should to be more political and fiscal integration before they are introduced .
this would mean harmonizing national sacred cows like taxes , retirement policy and labor market legislation .
with a string of important state elections coming up in germany in 2011 , it seems unlikely that merkel will do an about-turn on the issue of eurobonds , which could be unpopular with the german electorate .

dw-world.de opinion : heading in the right direction , but eurozone stability wo n't be easy as angela merkel tries to harmonize european economic policy , one should expect a lot more discord , according to christoph hasselbach , deutsche welle 's brussels correspondent .
a prime example is the euro bonds dispute .
-lrb- 17.12.2010 -rrb- agreement at eu summit fails to reassure markets european leaders have agreed on a permanent rescue fund to cover countries in need of financial assistance .
german chancellor merkel hailed the summit as a success , but the measure has failed to reassure the markets .
-lrb- 17.12.2010 -rrb- eurobond proposals wo n't go away chancellor merkel has dismissed calls for the eurozone to pool sovereign debt due to the high costs it would impose on germany .
but some leaders still like the idea and plan to bring it up again at this week 's eu summit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 27.12.2010 german government advisor backs eurobonds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians hope to stabilize the euro in 2011 a leading german economist has said that the euro can be stabilized by issuing loans at a set interest rate for the whole eurozone .
but the german government continues to oppose the idea . the debate about issuing so called eurobonds , or e-bonds , - loans with common interest rates across the eurozone - was ignited again on monday when professor peter bofinger , a member of the german government 's panel of independent economic advisors , said that the bonds would stabilize the eurozone .
" issuing eurobonds would make it clear that the countries in europe will remain solvent , and that it 's just no longer possible to push some countries into a corner and burden these countries with extremely high interest , " bofinger said in an interview with german broadcaster deutschland radio .
eurobonds would be issued to all eurozone countries with the same interest rate , allowing those in financial difficulties to benefit from the collective strength of the bloc .
germany and france , countries which enjoy relatively good reputations as debtors , oppose e-bonds .
in a speech to the german parliament last week , chancellor angela merkel laid out her criticism of the idea .
" it 's really important that we do n't make the mistake of collectivizing risks , which would happen with eurobonds , " she said .
" this is absolutely not a solution .
the solution is more harmony and more competitiveness in the eu member states and especially in the eurozone . "
disagreement over costs at the moment , germany borrows at a rate of 1.73 percent , but the average borrowing rate across the eurozone is slightly above 3 percent .
some economists say that if eurobonds were introduced , germany would end up paying more interest .
" there will be a substantial loss of reputation for germany , and germany will have to pay more debt for -lsb- its -rsb- interest , " markus kerber , a professor of economics at berlin 's technical university , told deutsche welle .
a eurozone bond could cost germany 17 billion euros -lrb- $ 22 billion -rrb- more each year , the german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bofinger thinks eurobonds will bring stability but bofinger thinks the assumption is flawed that the eurobonds ' interest rate would reflect the average national interest rates of individual states .
" the interest is so high in some countries because the risk of default is seen as being so high , " bofinger said .
" with a eurobond , the likelihood of a country defaulting is highly unlikely , and so i think it would have much lower interest rates than the average . "
bofinger also said that issuing eurobonds would be a good way of recognizing the austerity measures that are being implemented .
" one has to acknowledge what is being done in greece , portugal , ireland and spain .
these countries , which have really implemented very tough measures to try to stabilize the situation , they would be rewarded by allowing them access to financing with low interest rates , " bofinger said .
opponents say a collective eurozone debt pool would weaken economic competitiveness , because countries like germany , which has a very good reputation as a debtor , would share a credit rating with countries that , according kerber , do n't deserve the same rating .
tarnishing reputations " reputation is the result of challenging the markets .
if we abolish that system , we make it an anti-market system .
we make it an anti-meritocratic system and we give reputation and advantages in terms of interest to countries that do n't deserve it , " said kerber .
distorting competition in this way would destabilize the eurozone in the long term , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel does n't believe in collectivizing risk " i can not understand professor bofinger 's reasoning .
why should non-market conditions for raising funds for fragile countries stabilize the euro ? "
kerber said .

but the german government continues to oppose the idea . the debate about issuing so called eurobonds , or e-bonds , - loans with common interest rates across the eurozone - was ignited again on monday when professor peter bofinger , a member of the german government 's panel of independent economic advisors , said that the bonds would stabilize the eurozone .
" issuing eurobonds would make it clear that the countries in europe will remain solvent , and that it 's just no longer possible to push some countries into a corner and burden these countries with extremely high interest , " bofinger said in an interview with german broadcaster deutschland radio .
eurobonds would be issued to all eurozone countries with the same interest rate , allowing those in financial difficulties to benefit from the collective strength of the bloc .
germany and france , countries which enjoy relatively good reputations as debtors , oppose e-bonds .
in a speech to the german parliament last week , chancellor angela merkel laid out her criticism of the idea .
" it 's really important that we do n't make the mistake of collectivizing risks , which would happen with eurobonds , " she said .
" this is absolutely not a solution .
the solution is more harmony and more competitiveness in the eu member states and especially in the eurozone . "
disagreement over costs at the moment , germany borrows at a rate of 1.73 percent , but the average borrowing rate across the eurozone is slightly above 3 percent .
some economists say that if eurobonds were introduced , germany would end up paying more interest .
" there will be a substantial loss of reputation for germany , and germany will have to pay more debt for -lsb- its -rsb- interest , " markus kerber , a professor of economics at berlin 's technical university , told deutsche welle .
a eurozone bond could cost germany 17 billion euros -lrb- $ 22 billion -rrb- more each year , the german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bofinger thinks eurobonds will bring stability but bofinger thinks the assumption is flawed that the eurobonds ' interest rate would reflect the average national interest rates of individual states .
" the interest is so high in some countries because the risk of default is seen as being so high , " bofinger said .
" with a eurobond , the likelihood of a country defaulting is highly unlikely , and so i think it would have much lower interest rates than the average . "
bofinger also said that issuing eurobonds would be a good way of recognizing the austerity measures that are being implemented .
" one has to acknowledge what is being done in greece , portugal , ireland and spain .
these countries , which have really implemented very tough measures to try to stabilize the situation , they would be rewarded by allowing them access to financing with low interest rates , " bofinger said .
opponents say a collective eurozone debt pool would weaken economic competitiveness , because countries like germany , which has a very good reputation as a debtor , would share a credit rating with countries that , according kerber , do n't deserve the same rating .
tarnishing reputations " reputation is the result of challenging the markets .
if we abolish that system , we make it an anti-market system .
we make it an anti-meritocratic system and we give reputation and advantages in terms of interest to countries that do n't deserve it , " said kerber .
distorting competition in this way would destabilize the eurozone in the long term , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel does n't believe in collectivizing risk " i can not understand professor bofinger 's reasoning .
why should non-market conditions for raising funds for fragile countries stabilize the euro ? "
kerber said .

there will be a collapse and that collapse will bring down the euro . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 27.12.2010 german police union urges ban of far-right npd großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banning the npd has proved to be tricky seven years after the german government failed in an attempt to ban a far-right party , calls have become louder for renewed efforts to outlaw a party that is under observation of the federal intelligence agency . germany 's police union gdp and the central council of jews in germany have appealed for renewed efforts to ban the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , a fringe group with no federal-level representation , but with seats in two of germany 's 16 state parliaments .
" from my own and a police point of view , i urge and support a ban , " police union head bernhard witthaut told deutsche welle .
" i think it 's terrible how they mock foreigners living in germany , i think their concept of a state is terrible . "
witthaut was not alone in his comments .
the president of the central council of jews in germany , dieter graumann , said in an interview over the weekend that the npd , which currently has an estimated 7,000 members , had clearly set itself the goal of destroying democracy in germany .
the country must resist such attempts , he said , if necessary by issuing a ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernhard witthaut said a new court case must be well prepared the head of the turkish community in germany , kenan kolat , urged a more consistent prosecution of xenophobic attacks in germany .
banning the npd , he told the news agency dapd , could also " have a positive effect in the fight against right-wing extremism and racism . " the german government attempted to ban the npd in a case heard by the country 's highest court , the constitutional court , in 2001 .
but the case was thrown out two years later after it was disclosed that several people in the npd 's inner circle were german secret service undercover agents or informants .
signal in the fight against far-right extremism the police union 's witthaut said that some people in law enforcement believed it would be easier to deal with the far-right party if you knew how it operated and where it was active , whereas if the party were to go underground , it would be much more difficult to keep an eye on its activities . but he said he was convinced that outlawing a party listed as racist , anti-semitic and revisionist by germany 's domestic intelligence agency would be " an important signal in the fight against right-wing extremism . "
" many might view the risk of a renewed failure before germany 's highest court as such a grave aspect that they might dismiss steps in that direction , " bavaria 's interior minister joachim herrmann said on monday .
but he added that banning the npd was desirable , and he would continue to lobby for a ban of the party .

banning the npd , he told the news agency dapd , could also " have a positive effect in the fight against right-wing extremism and racism . " the german government attempted to ban the npd in a case heard by the country 's highest court , the constitutional court , in 2001 .
but the case was thrown out two years later after it was disclosed that several people in the npd 's inner circle were german secret service undercover agents or informants .
signal in the fight against far-right extremism the police union 's witthaut said that some people in law enforcement believed it would be easier to deal with the far-right party if you knew how it operated and where it was active , whereas if the party were to go underground , it would be much more difficult to keep an eye on its activities . but he said he was convinced that outlawing a party listed as racist , anti-semitic and revisionist by germany 's domestic intelligence agency would be " an important signal in the fight against right-wing extremism . "
" many might view the risk of a renewed failure before germany 's highest court as such a grave aspect that they might dismiss steps in that direction , " bavaria 's interior minister joachim herrmann said on monday .
but he added that banning the npd was desirable , and he would continue to lobby for a ban of the party .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 27.12.2010 khodorkovsky verdict was politically motivated , say observers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khodorkovsky 's trial and verdict was politically motivated , critics say observers had already predicted a " guilty " verdict in the moscow trial of jailed russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky .
many believe the lawsuit against the kremlin critic is purely politically motivated . khodorkovsky has been found guilty of stealing 218 tons of oil he owned as head of the yukos oil company and of embezzling the proceeds .
the oil magnate , a vocal critic of the policies of then-russian president vladimir putin , was first tried for tax evasion in 2003 .
since then , he has been in a siberian prison , and the trial led to the breakup of his multimillion-euro oil concern .
the eu has called on russia to respect international rights in its sentencing which is expected in the next few days .
the moscow prosecutor 's office is seeking a further six-year sentence - which observers note would keep the putin political rival locked up beyond the next presidential elections , in 2012 .
a number of human-rights activists say the real reason khodorkovsky was tried a second time is because he dared to openly criticize putin , as well as actively support opposition candidates .
constant media presence khodorkovsky 's lawyer , juri schmidt , says the trial was the kremlin 's way of dealing with its fear of the public response to a vocal critic .
" khodorkovsky … is more present in the press than ever .
i think this fear is one of the main reasons that the trial against khodorkovsky and -lrb- platon -rrb- lebedev is even being held , " schmidt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regular marches to free khodorkovsky are held in moscow his omnipresence in the media has made khodorkovsky a symbolic hero for the russian opposition , as well as for human-rights activists , schmidt added .
" the government did n't expect such an enormous resonance among the public .
the apparently restrained reaction to the first verdict made them think that it would be the same in a second trial .
but they made an error , " schmidt said .
" opinion polls show that society is increasingly looking up to khodorkovsky .
this only serves to make the government more afraid . "
khodorkovsky overstepped limits , kremlin supporters say political scientist vyacheslav nikonov , known for his close ties to the kremlin , disputes the notion that moscow is afraid of khodorkovsky .
" the russian government is n't afraid of any oligarch , whether he is banned or active .
the state has many more ways to pressure an oligarch than the other way around , " nikonov said .
" the kremlin 's image wo n't suffer measurably from the khodorkovsky trial , and khodorkovsky has little influence on political power at the moment . "
according to nikonov , moscow pursued this trial for the nation 's best interest alone .
the oil magnate was arrested not because he started any election campaigns , but because he had " bought the control of meaningful committees " in russia 's parliament .
" without his say-so , even the finance ministry could n't complete certain operations .
and when a person like that starts to attack the state , by not paying taxes - that goes well beyond the limits of what is allowed , " nikonov said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khodorkovsky could spend six more years behind bars but the president of the moscow-based research institute panorama says he thinks other motivations are in play in moscow 's decision to prosecute khodorkovsky a second time .
" if he 's free , khodorkovsky could start legal proceedings against those who stripped him of his business - namely , putin and his then-deputy igor sechin , " said vladimir pribilovsky .
" besides , they are afraid that a free khodorkovsky would unite and lead an opposition . "
another khodorkovsky lawyer , vadim klyuvgant , said the government did everything it could to see that a " guilty " verdict was handed down .
the trial was anything but fair , he said : " it is all fabrication - simply fabrication from start to finish .
from the first word to the last , written or spoken .
it is all just made up with a single goal : vengeance . "
westerwelle weighs in western leaders , including german foreign minister guido westerwelle , have been keeping an intense eye on the trial .
the german minister made known his concerns about the conditions of the trial when he visited moscow in early november .
he told his russian counterpart sergei lavrov that russia needs to take the west 's concerns seriously .
lavrov replied by stressing the independent nature of russia 's justice system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle -lrb- left -rrb- let russia 's lavrov know the west is watching in fact , a russian court can freely decide on a verdict - but it needs to have the right information to decide with , said oleg orlov , chairman of the board of memorial , a center for human rights .
he and other trial watchers believe the court was putting too much pressure on the judges to deliver a fair verdict .
" the judge ... is in a very difficult position .
i ca n't imagine how a justice with any self respect can give a guilty verdict under these conditions .
but in today 's russia , everything is possible , " orlov said .
the defense started hearing closing arguments on 27 october .
khodorkovsky took the chance to speak , and he talked for three hours .
in the end he did n't ask the court for mercy , but he asked them to keep an open mind .
likely outcome : six more years speaking with irony , he asked the court to honor the prosecutor 's enormous efforts at fabricating a case against him , saying : " honorable court , i agree that a not-guilty verdict would be almost a utopian outcome . … the prosecution has done everything in its power to see that the court has no legitimate chance to declare me not guilty .
you should respect these efforts , because next time , the prosecution can just spit on an empty sheet of paper , put a rubber stamp on it , and demand 14 years of prison .
it would amount to the same thing . "
observers say that khodorkovsky will likely be sentenced to six more years in a siberian prison camp - in which case he would n't see freedom until 2017 .
khodorkovsky 's father , 78 year old boris khodorkovsky , said he fears he will never see his son again .
" i 'm old , and am afraid that after this trial , i wo n't see him again , if he is sent to siberia .
i ca n't fly anymore , because i have bad eyesight .
i do n't know what i would do , " the elder khodorkovsky said .
if he is convicted , khodorkovsky said he would take the case to the european court of human rights in strasbourg .

many believe the lawsuit against the kremlin critic is purely politically motivated . khodorkovsky has been found guilty of stealing 218 tons of oil he owned as head of the yukos oil company and of embezzling the proceeds .
the oil magnate , a vocal critic of the policies of then-russian president vladimir putin , was first tried for tax evasion in 2003 .
since then , he has been in a siberian prison , and the trial led to the breakup of his multimillion-euro oil concern .
the eu has called on russia to respect international rights in its sentencing which is expected in the next few days .
the moscow prosecutor 's office is seeking a further six-year sentence - which observers note would keep the putin political rival locked up beyond the next presidential elections , in 2012 .
a number of human-rights activists say the real reason khodorkovsky was tried a second time is because he dared to openly criticize putin , as well as actively support opposition candidates .
constant media presence khodorkovsky 's lawyer , juri schmidt , says the trial was the kremlin 's way of dealing with its fear of the public response to a vocal critic .
" khodorkovsky … is more present in the press than ever .
i think this fear is one of the main reasons that the trial against khodorkovsky and -lrb- platon -rrb- lebedev is even being held , " schmidt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regular marches to free khodorkovsky are held in moscow his omnipresence in the media has made khodorkovsky a symbolic hero for the russian opposition , as well as for human-rights activists , schmidt added .
" the government did n't expect such an enormous resonance among the public .
the apparently restrained reaction to the first verdict made them think that it would be the same in a second trial .
but they made an error , " schmidt said .
" opinion polls show that society is increasingly looking up to khodorkovsky .
this only serves to make the government more afraid . "
khodorkovsky overstepped limits , kremlin supporters say political scientist vyacheslav nikonov , known for his close ties to the kremlin , disputes the notion that moscow is afraid of khodorkovsky .
" the russian government is n't afraid of any oligarch , whether he is banned or active .
the state has many more ways to pressure an oligarch than the other way around , " nikonov said .
" the kremlin 's image wo n't suffer measurably from the khodorkovsky trial , and khodorkovsky has little influence on political power at the moment . "
according to nikonov , moscow pursued this trial for the nation 's best interest alone .
the oil magnate was arrested not because he started any election campaigns , but because he had " bought the control of meaningful committees " in russia 's parliament .
" without his say-so , even the finance ministry could n't complete certain operations .
and when a person like that starts to attack the state , by not paying taxes - that goes well beyond the limits of what is allowed , " nikonov said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khodorkovsky could spend six more years behind bars but the president of the moscow-based research institute panorama says he thinks other motivations are in play in moscow 's decision to prosecute khodorkovsky a second time .
" if he 's free , khodorkovsky could start legal proceedings against those who stripped him of his business - namely , putin and his then-deputy igor sechin , " said vladimir pribilovsky .
" besides , they are afraid that a free khodorkovsky would unite and lead an opposition . "
another khodorkovsky lawyer , vadim klyuvgant , said the government did everything it could to see that a " guilty " verdict was handed down .
the trial was anything but fair , he said : " it is all fabrication - simply fabrication from start to finish .
from the first word to the last , written or spoken .
it is all just made up with a single goal : vengeance . "
westerwelle weighs in western leaders , including german foreign minister guido westerwelle , have been keeping an intense eye on the trial .
the german minister made known his concerns about the conditions of the trial when he visited moscow in early november .
he told his russian counterpart sergei lavrov that russia needs to take the west 's concerns seriously .
lavrov replied by stressing the independent nature of russia 's justice system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle -lrb- left -rrb- let russia 's lavrov know the west is watching in fact , a russian court can freely decide on a verdict - but it needs to have the right information to decide with , said oleg orlov , chairman of the board of memorial , a center for human rights .
he and other trial watchers believe the court was putting too much pressure on the judges to deliver a fair verdict .
" the judge ... is in a very difficult position .
i ca n't imagine how a justice with any self respect can give a guilty verdict under these conditions .
but in today 's russia , everything is possible , " orlov said .
the defense started hearing closing arguments on 27 october .
khodorkovsky took the chance to speak , and he talked for three hours .
in the end he did n't ask the court for mercy , but he asked them to keep an open mind .
likely outcome : six more years speaking with irony , he asked the court to honor the prosecutor 's enormous efforts at fabricating a case against him , saying : " honorable court , i agree that a not-guilty verdict would be almost a utopian outcome . … the prosecution has done everything in its power to see that the court has no legitimate chance to declare me not guilty .
you should respect these efforts , because next time , the prosecution can just spit on an empty sheet of paper , put a rubber stamp on it , and demand 14 years of prison .
it would amount to the same thing . "
observers say that khodorkovsky will likely be sentenced to six more years in a siberian prison camp - in which case he would n't see freedom until 2017 .
khodorkovsky 's father , 78 year old boris khodorkovsky , said he fears he will never see his son again .
" i 'm old , and am afraid that after this trial , i wo n't see him again , if he is sent to siberia .
i ca n't fly anymore , because i have bad eyesight .
i do n't know what i would do , " the elder khodorkovsky said .
if he is convicted , khodorkovsky said he would take the case to the european court of human rights in strasbourg .

the verdict in khodorkovsky 's second trial could keep him behind bars for several more years . mikhail khodorkovsky has been found guilty of embezzlement for stealing and reselling over 200 tons of oil from wells he previously owned as head of the yukos oil company .
the judge in the case , viktor danilkin , read the verdict in a moscow courtroom on monday .
khodorkovsky 's business partner and co-defendant platon lebedev was also found guilty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khodorkovsky supporters gathered outside the court monday khodorkovsky is currently serving an eight-year prison sentence for tax evasion .
sentencing in the current case is expected in the next few days .
the prosecution is seeking a six-year sentence .
the russian news agency interfax reported that journalists present in the courtroom were asked to leave by danilkin just after the guilty decision was read .
the entire verdict could take several days to read .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 27.12.2010 german government advisor backs eurobonds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians hope to stabilize the euro in 2011 a leading german economist has said that the euro can be stabilized by issuing loans at a set interest rate for the whole eurozone .
but the german government continues to oppose the idea . the debate about issuing so called eurobonds , or e-bonds , - loans with common interest rates across the eurozone - was ignited again on monday when professor peter bofinger , a member of the german government 's panel of independent economic advisors , said that the bonds would stabilize the eurozone .
" issuing eurobonds would make it clear that the countries in europe will remain solvent , and that it 's just no longer possible to push some countries into a corner and burden these countries with extremely high interest , " bofinger said in an interview with german broadcaster deutschland radio .
eurobonds would be issued to all eurozone countries with the same interest rate , allowing those in financial difficulties to benefit from the collective strength of the bloc .
germany and france , countries which enjoy relatively good reputations as debtors , oppose e-bonds .
in a speech to the german parliament last week , chancellor angela merkel laid out her criticism of the idea .
" it 's really important that we do n't make the mistake of collectivizing risks , which would happen with eurobonds , " she said .
" this is absolutely not a solution .
the solution is more harmony and more competitiveness in the eu member states and especially in the eurozone . "
disagreement over costs at the moment , germany borrows at a rate of 1.73 percent , but the average borrowing rate across the eurozone is slightly above 3 percent .
some economists say that if eurobonds were introduced , germany would end up paying more interest .
" there will be a substantial loss of reputation for germany , and germany will have to pay more debt for -lsb- its -rsb- interest , " markus kerber , a professor of economics at berlin 's technical university , told deutsche welle .
a eurozone bond could cost germany 17 billion euros -lrb- $ 22 billion -rrb- more each year , the german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bofinger thinks eurobonds will bring stability but bofinger thinks the assumption is flawed that the eurobonds ' interest rate would reflect the average national interest rates of individual states .
" the interest is so high in some countries because the risk of default is seen as being so high , " bofinger said .
" with a eurobond , the likelihood of a country defaulting is highly unlikely , and so i think it would have much lower interest rates than the average . "
bofinger also said that issuing eurobonds would be a good way of recognizing the austerity measures that are being implemented .
" one has to acknowledge what is being done in greece , portugal , ireland and spain .
these countries , which have really implemented very tough measures to try to stabilize the situation , they would be rewarded by allowing them access to financing with low interest rates , " bofinger said .
opponents say a collective eurozone debt pool would weaken economic competitiveness , because countries like germany , which has a very good reputation as a debtor , would share a credit rating with countries that , according kerber , do n't deserve the same rating .
tarnishing reputations " reputation is the result of challenging the markets .
if we abolish that system , we make it an anti-market system .
we make it an anti-meritocratic system and we give reputation and advantages in terms of interest to countries that do n't deserve it , " said kerber .
distorting competition in this way would destabilize the eurozone in the long term , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel does n't believe in collectivizing risk " i can not understand professor bofinger 's reasoning .
why should non-market conditions for raising funds for fragile countries stabilize the euro ? "
kerber said .
" in the long run , if you distort competition , the system will break down .
there will be a collapse and that collapse will bring down the euro . "
german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble has n't been as vehement in his opposition to eurobonds as merkel , but he has said that there should to be more political and fiscal integration before they are introduced .
this would mean harmonizing national sacred cows like taxes , retirement policy and labor market legislation .
with a string of important state elections coming up in germany in 2011 , it seems unlikely that merkel will do an about-turn on the issue of eurobonds , which could be unpopular with the german electorate .

the incumbent president laurent ghagbo refused to concede rule to internationally recognized election winner alassane ouattara . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
west african bloc threatens intervention in ivory coast ecowas lacks adequate logistics and cohesion for a quick and decisive strike to remove the dictator who is trying to thwart the will of the ivoirians .
military force should be used if laurent gbagbo refuses to quit as it has been shown from the election result that the majority of the people does not want him to continue in power .
he should never underestimate a determined ecowas with a very strong nigerian influence and the support of the au , un , us and eu . - agholor , nigeria my opinion is that gbagbo should hand over power peacefully , but if that is not the case then ecowas will have to send in the military .
he can not just gain power by force .
a lot of resources were spent for the election to take place , so the people of ivory coast deserve to be heard . - james , kenya i think it 's high time we put an end to all of this military adventurism on the african continent so the ordinary people can be saved from these selfish individuals , and hopefully have some chance for some real development .
though there is a risk of abuse in intervening in the internal affairs of independent member states , this time around ecowas is right to use full force to oust gbagbo .
that would send a useful signal to all intending adventurists on the continent !
ecowas may even need to clearly define the circumstances under which it might routinely consider this form of intervention in future .
enough is enough ! - anthony , nigeria i am happy that ecowas has given a warning to laurent gbagbo that should he decide not to stand down , the bloc would use legitimate force to oust him from power .
for a long time now , the african union and the world have watched dictators cling to power even when they lost elections .
the peoples ' will , expressed through elections or the ballot box , has meant nothing . - malama , zambia while i am thankful that we have the presence of the un in our world , however , it would be a mistake to send un peacekeepers .
i believe ecowas is more in touch with what 's happening in ivory coast and it 's time we give credence and support to local initiatives of this magnitude .
the un should work with ecowas and give necessary guidance if need be .
too many cooks here will spoil these welcome " winds of change " we are beginning to witness in some parts of africa . - gari , unknown compiled by stuart tiffen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the german government continues to oppose the idea . the debate about issuing so called eurobonds , or e-bonds , - loans with common interest rates across the eurozone - was ignited again on monday when professor peter bofinger , a member of the german government 's panel of independent economic advisors , said that the bonds would stabilize the eurozone .
" issuing eurobonds would make it clear that the countries in europe will remain solvent , and that it 's just no longer possible to push some countries into a corner and burden these countries with extremely high interest , " bofinger said in an interview with german broadcaster deutschland radio .
eurobonds would be issued to all eurozone countries with the same interest rate , allowing those in financial difficulties to benefit from the collective strength of the bloc .
germany and france , countries which enjoy relatively good reputations as debtors , oppose e-bonds .
in a speech to the german parliament last week , chancellor angela merkel laid out her criticism of the idea .
" it 's really important that we do n't make the mistake of collectivizing risks , which would happen with eurobonds , " she said .
" this is absolutely not a solution .
the solution is more harmony and more competitiveness in the eu member states and especially in the eurozone . "
disagreement over costs at the moment , germany borrows at a rate of 1.73 percent , but the average borrowing rate across the eurozone is slightly above 3 percent .

police say the device resembled those that exploded at the swiss and chilean embassies last week .
are anarchists to blame ? bomb disposal experts defused a parcel bomb found at the greek embassy in rome on monday .
police sources said the device , which arrived at the embassy on christmas eve but was not opened until monday , was similar to two bombs that went off at the swiss and chilean embassies last week .
those attacks injured a swiss embassy employee and a chilean diplomat .
investigators believe the device was sent by the same anarchist group that claimed responsibility for last thursday 's bombings .
the group , calling itself the informal anarchist federation -lrb- fai -rrb- , said in a note found near one of the blasts that the attacks were carried out by their " lambros fountas revolutionary cell . "
the note said the group wanted to " destroy the system of domination . "
fountas was a greek far-left activist who was killed in a gunfight with greek police in march .
possible links with november attacks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : november 's attacks triggered a massive police operation in greece italian authorities said they were investigating whether the bombings were connected with a suspected far-left anarchist plot carried out in greece in november .
in that campaign , more than a dozen packages with explosives were sent to foreign embassies in athens and european government leaders .
the incidents have raised concern that violence by european militant groups may be on the increase as governments introduce severe austerity packages in the wake of the financial crisis .
embassies in rome were on high alert following monday 's incident .
police were called in to investigate suspicious parcels at the missions of denmark , finland , monaco , morocco , sweden , ukraine and venezuela , which were all found to be false alarms .

the group , calling itself the informal anarchist federation -lrb- fai -rrb- , said in a note found near one of the blasts that the attacks were carried out by their " lambros fountas revolutionary cell . "
the note said the group wanted to " destroy the system of domination . "
fountas was a greek far-left activist who was killed in a gunfight with greek police in march .
possible links with november attacks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : november 's attacks triggered a massive police operation in greece italian authorities said they were investigating whether the bombings were connected with a suspected far-left anarchist plot carried out in greece in november .
in that campaign , more than a dozen packages with explosives were sent to foreign embassies in athens and european government leaders .
the incidents have raised concern that violence by european militant groups may be on the increase as governments introduce severe austerity packages in the wake of the financial crisis .
embassies in rome were on high alert following monday 's incident .
police were called in to investigate suspicious parcels at the missions of denmark , finland , monaco , morocco , sweden , ukraine and venezuela , which were all found to be false alarms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de piracy -pipe- 27.12.2010 swiss file-sharing website hires us lobbying firm großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapidshare is one of three european sites lobbying dc after being named as one of the most infringing websites , rapidshare is headed to the us capital to convince american lawmakers that it is not liable for illegal file-sharing . rapidshare , an online file-sharing site based in cham , switzerland , is under increased international scrutiny for enabling copyright infringement , as earlier this year members of the us congress named rapidshare one of the top six most infringing websites in the world .
" as you can imagine , we 're not very happy about that , " said daniel raimer , a german attorney and spokesman for rapidshare , in an interview with deutsche welle .
following the us government 's crackdown on infringing websites earlier this fall , seizing the domain names of more than 80 websites , rapidshare has found a way to reinvent itself in the american capital .
just last month , the company hired the washington , dc-based lobbying firm dutko to protect its interests abroad .
this likely makes it the first such european file-sharing company to lobby american lawmakers .
the company says its has more appointments coming up on capitol hill , and remains confident that it will get off the list by early 2011 , long before next year 's list is published .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss company only says about five percent of what is uploaded to its site is illegal only a small percentage of its files are illegal rapidshare estimates that copyrighted music and movies make up roughly five percent , or 10,000 of the 400,000 files uploaded every day .
although the site accepts and hosts every type of file , because the company takes many steps to filter out infringing files before they are posted , raimer argued that rapidshare is not the type of site the us should be going after .
" we believe that it 's unfair that we 're being put on the list , " he added .
" you ca n't just take a look at the number of infringing material that you can find on the server .
google has probably millions and millions of links to illegal files .
most people would probably agree that google is not a bad company . "
by international law rapidshare is not liable for what users upload and download , and recent german and american legal cases have upheld this notion .
the only thing that is required of rapidshare is to take down infringing files once the copyright holder tells it to .
while lobbying on behalf of foreign companies is nothing new in washington , it is new for foreign web companies to do so .
an online database of lobbying disclosures reveals that the only other european websites lobbying the us congress right now are two online gaming sites , pokerstars.net and partygaming.com.
us can exert limited power over foreign sites a new anti-piracy bill making its way through the us senate could clear the way for the government to seize more infringing domains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to most international law , rapidshare is not liable for what its users upload to the site and then download to their music players if the law passes , according to bob brauneis , professor of copyright law at george washington university in washington , dc , it could certainly impact rapidshare , despite the fact that it is not based in the united states . " dot-com companies operate around the world , but the company that controls the dot-com domain is in the united states , " he told deutsche welle .
" literally they have a computer in some room somewhere and if you flip a switch on that computer than domain name will disappear .
the information is still there in switzerland , but it 's not accessible at rapidshare.com because the link between rapidshare.com and the swiss computers has been cut . ”
the .com registry is maintained within the us and is subject to us law .
that means a court order could force the registry to freeze the domain name : rapidshare.com.
it does n't matter if rapidshare has its headquarters in switzerland or anywhere else .
while losing a domain name could temporarily impact the company 's business , changing to a new name is not a huge inconvenience .
rapidshare could just set up shop as rapidshare.ch , which is the most common suffix for swiss sites .
wikileaks , for example , used to have a .com suffix - now anyone can access that site at wikileaks.ch.
if seizing domains does n't stop copyright infringement , there is another step , brauneis added .
" the computers in switzerland are actually reached through a series of numbers called an internet protocol address , an ip address , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapidshare could avoid american law simply by changing to a swiss domain like rapidshare.ch " so everyone can spread around the world what the ip address is on those computers and they can continue to upload and download files , not a problem .
and if it turns out that after seizing a bunch of domain names , everyone is just turning to ip addresses - the ip addresses may be next . "
and it gets even more complicated from there .
data re-routing could drive up internet connection pricing " people are going to look for alternative ways of having those kind of sites available , " said peter eckersley , a digital rights advocate with the electronic frontier foundation , a non-profit organization based in san francisco .
however , he cautioned that if sites like this are forced to move offshore , then that may raise the actual cost of internet connections around the world .
" and the effect that will have is a significant increase in the amount of data that 's just moving over international fiber links , " he added .
" that will mean we 'll need to build more fiberlinks . and it 's going to make the cost of running the internet higher . "

they see the verdict as casting doubt on president dmitry medvedev 's pledges to modernize russia . germany and other western countries have condemned the guilty verdict pronounced by a russian court against jailed tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky on new fraud charges .
in a statement , german foreign minister guido westerwelle called the verdict " a step backward " for russia .
westerwelle said that the way the trial was conducted was " very dubious " and called on russia to " stand up for the rule of law , democracy and human rights . "
german human rights commissioner markus loening found even stronger words to condemn the verdict , telling the dpa news agency that he was " outraged . "

his release was scheduled for 2011 .
sentencing in the current case is expected in the next few days .
the prosecution is seeking a six-year jail term .
shortly after the verdict was read , khodorkovsky 's defense lawyers said they would appeal the decision .
khodorkovsky had previously said he would take the case to the european court of human rights if he was found guilty .
orchestrated by putin ?
khodorkovsky and his lawyers say the charges against him are politically motivated .
the tycoon has been an outspoken opponent of former president and current prime minister vladimir putin , openly funding opposition parties ahead of 2003 parliamentary elections .
khodorkovsky 's original trial in 2003 was widely seen as having been orchestrated by putin .
if khodorkovsky remains in jail through 2012 , it will prevent him from wielding his influence ahead of the election scheduled in that year .
the current case has been seen as a test of the independence of the russian justice system .
but monday 's conviction sheds grave doubts on president dmitry medvedev 's vows to modernize russia and take it out of putin 's shadow .

its repercussions could be widespread , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . the guilty verdict in the trial of the former yukos owner mikhail khodorkovsky and his business partner , platon lebedev , comes as no surprise .
this was far from a free and fair trial , instead it was politically motivated .
sentencing has not yet been handed down but it 's expected that the two men will be jailed until at least 2012 - the year of the presidential elections - if not until 2017 .
many observers say that the former president and current prime minister , vladimir putin , was the driving force behind the guilty verdict . khodorkovsky was first jailed on tax evasion charges in 2003 and many believe that putin wanted to punish khodorkovsky for his perceived meddling in russian politics and his anti-putin stance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel , head of dw 's russian service in the run-up to the current verdict , putin publicly called for a guilty verdict , describing khodorkovsky as a thief .
politically , not the best of moves , considering that moscow was so keen to give the impression of a fair and independent trial .
president dmitry medevedev 's remarks were more circumspect when he said that no one - not even a president or any other high-ranking official , like putin - should comment on the current legal proceedings .
no doubt medvedev was already thinking of the political implications of a guilty verdict .
the questionable legal proceedings have dealt his reform and modernization efforts a heavy blow , and beyond that they could affect relations with the west .
the russian leadership is seemingly unaware that any reform can only be accomplished with the necessary legal and constitutional framework , fancy pr campaigns and speeches wo n't do the trick .
indeed , the trial has reinforced the perception in the west that russia lacks many basic and constitutional rights .
however much germany , europe and the us are interested in having good ties with moscow , there is a growing feeling that a russia shaped and formed by putin can not be trusted .
no doubt us president barack obama , who managed to push through the start arms reduction treaty with russia last week , will be on the receiving end of such criticism .
the west may have readily embraced khodorkovsky and lebedev as symbols for a free , democratic and just russia .
their current treatment and the clearly politically motivated nature of their trial has now led many russians to look up to them as heros in a battle against a corrupt and arbitrary regime .

" the judgment throws no good light on circumstances in russia , " he said .
loening described the verdict as " a crass misinterpretation of what happened in court . "
' russia must respect human rights commitments ' chief european union diplomat catherine ashton called on russia " to respect its international commitments in the field of human rights and the rule of law . "
she said the eu would " continue to follow developments very closely , including the forthcoming announcement of the sentence . "
across the atlantic , united states secretary of state hillary clinton said the verdict raised " serious questions about selective prosecution - and about the rule of law being overshadowed by political considerations . "
clinton also warned in a statement that " this and similar cases have a negative impact on russia 's reputation for fulfilling its international human rights obligations and improving its investment climate . "
embezzlement charges khodorkovsky was found guilty of embezzlement for stealing and reselling over 200 tons of oil from wells he previously owned as head of the yukos oil company .
his business partner and co-defendant platon lebedev was also found guilty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khodorkovsky 's supporters see him as a symbol for democratic struggle khodorkovsky is currently serving an eight-year prison sentence for tax evasion .
his release was scheduled for 2011 .
sentencing in the current case is expected in the next few days .
the prosecution is seeking a six-year jail term .
shortly after the verdict was read , khodorkovsky 's defense lawyers said they would appeal the decision .
khodorkovsky had previously said he would take the case to the european court of human rights if he was found guilty .
orchestrated by putin ?
khodorkovsky and his lawyers say the charges against him are politically motivated .
the tycoon has been an outspoken opponent of former president and current prime minister vladimir putin , openly funding opposition parties ahead of 2003 parliamentary elections .
khodorkovsky 's original trial in 2003 was widely seen as having been orchestrated by putin .
if khodorkovsky remains in jail through 2012 , it will prevent him from wielding his influence ahead of the election scheduled in that year .
the current case has been seen as a test of the independence of the russian justice system .
but monday 's conviction sheds grave doubts on president dmitry medvedev 's vows to modernize russia and take it out of putin 's shadow .

" from my own and a police point of view , i urge and support a ban , " police union head bernhard witthaut told deutsche welle .
" i think it 's terrible how they mock foreigners living in germany , i think their concept of a state is terrible . "
witthaut was not alone in his comments .
the president of the central council of jews in germany , dieter graumann , said in an interview over the weekend that the npd , which currently has an estimated 7,000 members , had clearly set itself the goal of destroying democracy in germany .
the country must resist such attempts , he said , if necessary by issuing a ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernhard witthaut said a new court case must be well prepared the head of the turkish community in germany , kenan kolat , urged a more consistent prosecution of xenophobic attacks in germany .
banning the npd , he told the news agency dapd , could also " have a positive effect in the fight against right-wing extremism and racism . " the german government attempted to ban the npd in a case heard by the country 's highest court , the constitutional court , in 2001 .
but the case was thrown out two years later after it was disclosed that several people in the npd 's inner circle were german secret service undercover agents or informants .
signal in the fight against far-right extremism the police union 's witthaut said that some people in law enforcement believed it would be easier to deal with the far-right party if you knew how it operated and where it was active , whereas if the party were to go underground , it would be much more difficult to keep an eye on its activities . but he said he was convinced that outlawing a party listed as racist , anti-semitic and revisionist by germany 's domestic intelligence agency would be " an important signal in the fight against right-wing extremism . "
" many might view the risk of a renewed failure before germany 's highest court as such a grave aspect that they might dismiss steps in that direction , " bavaria 's interior minister joachim herrmann said on monday .
but he added that banning the npd was desirable , and he would continue to lobby for a ban of the party .

the ka-sat is designed to provide tens of millions of europeans , especially those living in rural areas , with faster access to the internet .
ka-sat has a total throughput of some 70 gigabits per second , however typically satellite internet access costs much more than dsl or cable modem service .
the new satellite will cover a large swath of europe , ranging from north africa to southern scandinavia , and touching into the edges of the middle east .
" ka-sat will be the cornerstone of a breakthrough infrastructure deployed by eutelsat for users across europe and the mediterranean basin , " said michel de rosen , the chief executive of eutelsat , in a statement .
eutelsat is the company that will operate the satellite .
" by combining a satellite equipped with more than 80 spotbeams and a network of ground stations , this new program will deliver more capacity than any other satellite program deployed worldwide . "
the company also said that commercial internet service will begin in may 2011 .

muthenthaler says they wanted to both raise public awareness about erfinderhaus ' mostly invisible services and provide a launch pad for the new items they 've helped develop .

the german market needs the support even though its inventors generate a similar number of patents to japan , which is only outperformed by the united states .

gyro gearloose 's profession is often misunderstood deciding which of these solutions should be realized is the real art of the business . as technology makes information easier to access and patents simpler to file , muthenthaler says more inventions are being created than ever before .
erfinderhaus receives 1,000 ideas a year .
some come as rough plans , some as finished designs .

muthenthaler 's search is taking him beyond germany , austria and switzerland . erfinderhaus has launched a new website named inpama , aimed at american inventors .

many believe the lawsuit against the kremlin critic is purely politically motivated . khodorkovsky has been found guilty of stealing 218 tons of oil he owned as head of the yukos oil company and of embezzling the proceeds .
the oil magnate , a vocal critic of the policies of then-russian president vladimir putin , was first tried for tax evasion in 2003 .
since then , he has been in a siberian prison , and the trial led to the breakup of his multimillion-euro oil concern .
the eu has called on russia to respect international rights in its sentencing which is expected in the next few days .
the moscow prosecutor 's office is seeking a further six-year sentence - which observers note would keep the putin political rival locked up beyond the next presidential elections , in 2012 .
a number of human-rights activists say the real reason khodorkovsky was tried a second time is because he dared to openly criticize putin , as well as actively support opposition candidates .
constant media presence khodorkovsky 's lawyer , juri schmidt , says the trial was the kremlin 's way of dealing with its fear of the public response to a vocal critic .
" khodorkovsky … is more present in the press than ever .
i think this fear is one of the main reasons that the trial against khodorkovsky and -lrb- platon -rrb- lebedev is even being held , " schmidt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regular marches to free khodorkovsky are held in moscow his omnipresence in the media has made khodorkovsky a symbolic hero for the russian opposition , as well as for human-rights activists , schmidt added .
" the government did n't expect such an enormous resonance among the public .
the apparently restrained reaction to the first verdict made them think that it would be the same in a second trial .
but they made an error , " schmidt said .
" opinion polls show that society is increasingly looking up to khodorkovsky .
this only serves to make the government more afraid . "
khodorkovsky overstepped limits , kremlin supporters say political scientist vyacheslav nikonov , known for his close ties to the kremlin , disputes the notion that moscow is afraid of khodorkovsky .
" the russian government is n't afraid of any oligarch , whether he is banned or active .
the state has many more ways to pressure an oligarch than the other way around , " nikonov said .
" the kremlin 's image wo n't suffer measurably from the khodorkovsky trial , and khodorkovsky has little influence on political power at the moment . "
according to nikonov , moscow pursued this trial for the nation 's best interest alone .
the oil magnate was arrested not because he started any election campaigns , but because he had " bought the control of meaningful committees " in russia 's parliament .
" without his say-so , even the finance ministry could n't complete certain operations .
and when a person like that starts to attack the state , by not paying taxes - that goes well beyond the limits of what is allowed , " nikonov said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khodorkovsky could spend six more years behind bars but the president of the moscow-based research institute panorama says he thinks other motivations are in play in moscow 's decision to prosecute khodorkovsky a second time .
" if he 's free , khodorkovsky could start legal proceedings against those who stripped him of his business - namely , putin and his then-deputy igor sechin , " said vladimir pribilovsky .
" besides , they are afraid that a free khodorkovsky would unite and lead an opposition . "
another khodorkovsky lawyer , vadim klyuvgant , said the government did everything it could to see that a " guilty " verdict was handed down .
the trial was anything but fair , he said : " it is all fabrication - simply fabrication from start to finish .
from the first word to the last , written or spoken .
it is all just made up with a single goal : vengeance . "
westerwelle weighs in western leaders , including german foreign minister guido westerwelle , have been keeping an intense eye on the trial .
the german minister made known his concerns about the conditions of the trial when he visited moscow in early november .
he told his russian counterpart sergei lavrov that russia needs to take the west 's concerns seriously .
lavrov replied by stressing the independent nature of russia 's justice system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle -lrb- left -rrb- let russia 's lavrov know the west is watching in fact , a russian court can freely decide on a verdict - but it needs to have the right information to decide with , said oleg orlov , chairman of the board of memorial , a center for human rights .
he and other trial watchers believe the court was putting too much pressure on the judges to deliver a fair verdict .
" the judge ... is in a very difficult position .
i ca n't imagine how a justice with any self respect can give a guilty verdict under these conditions .
but in today 's russia , everything is possible , " orlov said .
the defense started hearing closing arguments on 27 october .
khodorkovsky took the chance to speak , and he talked for three hours .
in the end he did n't ask the court for mercy , but he asked them to keep an open mind .
likely outcome : six more years speaking with irony , he asked the court to honor the prosecutor 's enormous efforts at fabricating a case against him , saying : " honorable court , i agree that a not-guilty verdict would be almost a utopian outcome . … the prosecution has done everything in its power to see that the court has no legitimate chance to declare me not guilty .
you should respect these efforts , because next time , the prosecution can just spit on an empty sheet of paper , put a rubber stamp on it , and demand 14 years of prison .
it would amount to the same thing . "
observers say that khodorkovsky will likely be sentenced to six more years in a siberian prison camp - in which case he would n't see freedom until 2017 .
khodorkovsky 's father , 78 year old boris khodorkovsky , said he fears he will never see his son again .
" i 'm old , and am afraid that after this trial , i wo n't see him again , if he is sent to siberia .
i ca n't fly anymore , because i have bad eyesight .
i do n't know what i would do , " the elder khodorkovsky said .
if he is convicted , khodorkovsky said he would take the case to the european court of human rights in strasbourg .
