thousands have been spending their nights in airports hoping their flights will take off . fresh snowfall overnight caused further setbacks at frankfurt airport , with no planes taking off or landing on tuesday morning .
around 130 departures , and a further 130 arrivals , were canceled at germany 's biggest air terminal .
one of the airport 's three runaways was reopened , allowing the first plane of the day to land at 8:28 a.m.
brussels airport and london heathrow , the world 's busiest airport , continued to experience disruption .
it was running a reduced number of flights on tuesday .
eurostar services from london to paris and brussels had also been hit .
speed restrictions mean that fewer trains were running .
eurostar asked " all customers booked to travel before christmas to refund or exchange their tickets free of charge , if their travel is not essential . "
thousands of passengers spent monday night waiting in airports and train stations , as the countdown to christmas shortens .
airports struggle airports were experiencing a backlog of passengers after hundreds of flights were cancelled over the weekend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : december is one of the most popular times to travel at frankfurt , some 340 of the 1,340 takeoffs and landings were canceled on monday , while at london heathrow , europe 's busiest airport , a very limited service began again on monday after a weekend of almost total standstill .
many other airports opened for a few hours before closing again .
the berlin airport operators said they did not expect services to return to normal before christmas .
the german transport minister , peter ramsauer , has suggested to local authorities that they allow flights at night , in order to clear the backlog of passengers .
the british authorities have already withdrawn the ban on night-flights until december 24 , christmas eve .
trains disrupted trains around berlin were seriously delayed on monday due to heavy snowfalls in the region .
throughout the country , frozen switches led to considerable problems .
a number of trains were canceled and , among those that ran , delays of over an hour were frequent .
speed limits were introduced on high-speed tracks to prevent damage to train undercarriages from blocks of ice .
the company operating almost all of germany 's long-distance trains , deutsche bahn , continued to warn passengers that trains were likely to be very crowded .
" there are likely to be considerable bottlenecks on major lines because of the cancelation of flights , " they wrote on their website .
throughout much of europe , railways were similarly disrupted .
even in southern sweden , which is used to heavy snow , 100 of 350 train journeys were cancelled on monday .
restrictions on the roads bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting around on foot has been the only option for many people on the roads too , the weather has caused serious disruption .
the authorities imposed a travel ban on buses and trucks in paris .
in parts of germany trucks weighing more than 7.5 tons were at times banned from freeways after a series of accidents in which tractor-trailers skidded and blocked the carriageway .
in the western state of north rhine-westphalia , there were 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- of traffic jams during the monday morning rush hour .
the police have been complaining that many drivers are still using summer tires , in spite of the icy conditions .
the chief executive of the association of local authorities , gerd landsberg , told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper that , after the costs of last year 's heavy winter , local governments would have to cut back on clearing the roads .
he said drivers would have to get used to driving on snowy roads , as they do in scandinavia .
although it 's expected that the weather will warm on thursday , another cold spell is forecast in time for christmas , although it is not expected to bring much snow .

with more than $ 1.3 trillion of assets , pimco is one of the world 's largest bond investment firms .
the company , based in newport beach , california , is owned by germany 's allianz group .
bosomworth said if the three nations reverted to their own currencies , they would be able to sell their products abroad more competitively and use export revenues to drive further economic growth and repay their heavy debt loads .
investor confidence once economic growth and investor confidence returned to the countries , they could reintegrate into the single currency area , he added .
the idea of countries leaving the eurozone has been making the rounds ever since the greek debt crisis emerged with news that the country 's financial situation was far worse than previously acknowledged .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal could become the next eurozone rescue candidate many experts argue , however , that such a move would lead to massive costs that would ultimately undermine economic performance .
the two rescue packages for greece and ireland and the possibility of portugal and even spain becoming the next bailout candidates have found eurozone countries scrambling to save the common currency in the long term .
help from partners on thursday , european union leaders agreed on a change in the bloc 's rule-book , the lisbon treaty , clearing the way for a permanent rescue fund for crisis-hit eurozone countries from mid-2013 .
bosomworth believes that belgium , italy and spain will be able to get over their own debt problems while remaining inside the eurozone - but only with substantial help from partners .

it does n't want to spoil the cheer , but reminds everybody of the dangers of corruption . christmas is just around the corner , and people are scrambling to find the perfect presents to stack under the tree .
but one organization is n't feeling the festive spirit and wants to do away with presents entirely – at least in the world of business .
the german association of materials management , purchasing and logistics -lrb- ammpl -rrb- says gifts have no place in business and that a good supplier wo n't need them to keep its customers .
the association represents some 8,000 members , and in 2008 established a ' code of conduct ' which covers corporate gift giving .
but it 's not always easy to draw a line between a small token of appreciation and a gift that could open the door to a host of ethical dilemmas .
that 's why sebastian schroeder , an ammpl compliance expert , says the code of conduct drafted by his organization lets companies decide what limits are acceptable .
comparable business dinners in london , hamburg or shanghai come at very different prices , he pointed out .
" ultimately it is up to the individual employee of a company to determine if a present has been made in good faith , " he told deutsche welle .
" we did n't set a limit to the value of presents . "

" and sometimes a german buyer shows up and wants to get right to the deal and sign a contract , only to find there are certain limitations . "
in china , for instance , monetary gifts are not at all uncommon , although they are " clearly not acceptable in europe and the united states , " schroeder said .
companies may be reluctant to insult their business partners by returning a gift , giving rise to the challenge of different cultural expectations .

" the important thing is that people do n't put themselves in a position of dependency , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have clear rules that money and anything with monetary value are not to be accepted . "
gift giving has decreased in volume during recent years , according to von stockert , but occasionally someone in the company will receive a present .
if it ca n't be given back without jeopardizing a business relationship , then it 's likely to end up going to charity ... and the company has to pay taxes on it .
" nowadays more companies are keeping these regulations in mind when it comes to accepting gifts and giving them , " von stockert said .
sebastian schroeder of ammpl added the idea is n't to spoil christmas fun , but to foster an environment where companies work together " fairly and in a spirit of partnership . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 21.12.2010 campaigners target sandblasted jeans on health grounds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fine particles of sand can scar the lungs of blasting workers campaigners are eager to put an end to the practice of sandblasting jeans because of a link with the disease silicosis .
in turkey , where the practice is now banned , thousands of ex-workers are thought to be suffering . consumers looking for a pair of jeans with that special worn look might want to check the label , according to campaigners .
the clean clothes campaign -lrb- ccc -rrb- is calling for a global ban on the practice of sandblasting , in which denim is sprayed with sand at high pressure to give the material a distressed look .
sandblasting is associated with the disease silicosis - a lung disease caused by fine particles of sand thrown into the air during the process .
turkey was a major producer of sandblasted garments before a ban on the process was implemented in 2009 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sandblasted jeans are popular on the high street around 10,000 people have been employed in sandblasting , according to yesim yasin , from the istanbul-based solidarity committee of sandblasting laborers .
" unfortunately many studies reveal the fact that almost 50 percent of the total number of employees are expected to contract this disease , silicosis , " yasin said .
" silicosis has always been and still is incurable .
the workers are sick , but as they have worked in the informal sector they have no basic legal rights . "
effort to persuade big firms the committee and the ccc have started a campaign for turkey to recognize that victims of sandblasting are victims of an industrial disease .
this would enable the families of 46 workers who have already died to receive benefits and support .
the groups also say that silicosis sufferers who are still alive are in need of help .
one of them is 39-year-old mehmet basak ; doctors predict he has about a year to live .
" i am having difficulty while walking , especially when i have to climb up a hill or even stairs i am totally out of breath , i can not breathe , " basak told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey was a center for sandblasting until the ban " i used to work from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.
dust would build up all over my body , you could n't even recognize me or my co-workers until we showered . "
the clean clothes campaign says that the garment industry is getting around the turkish prohibition by shifting the work to subcontractors in developing countries ; they argue that this is immoral on health grounds .
the group - an alliance of organizations in 15 european countries - is trying to persuade jeans makers to abandon the practice altogether .
" a number of big jeans producers like levis strauss and h & m have all said they would stop sandblasting with almost immediate effect , or by the end of this year , " said wyger wentholdt from the ccc .
" there are a couple of jeans brands who have not wanted to react to our approach at all . "
wendholt warned that , after lobbying , a name and shame campaign could follow against firms that persist in using the material .

he told monday 's berliner zeitung newspaper , " the welfare of the child must be the first consideration .
it 's not so much an issue of whether the adults want to live as a happy family .
i do n't believe that children want to grow up in a homosexual partnership . "
uta kehr , spokeswoman for the association of lesbians and gays in germany , said that kauder was encouraging prejudices against homosexual parents who care for children .
but worse still was the fact that he was humiliating homosexual parents in the eyes of their children .
" how will the 15-year-old son of a lesbian couple feel , for example , if he reads such things in the paper ? " she said .
children in " rainbow " families just as happy her position was backed up by leaders of the green party , who also pointed out that the german ministry for family affairs had recently published a study showing children who lived in so-called " rainbow " families felt just as well-looked-after and were just as successful as children of the same age in conventional families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker kauder has met with sharp criticism for his remarks kauder made his comment in remarks on pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- , a procedure which allows genetic control of artificially inseminated embryos before they are placed in the mother 's womb .
the german parliament is to have a free vote on proposals to allow highly restricted access to pgd in cases where there are good grounds to fear that the unborn child could suffer from a serious genetic disease .
kauder argued in the interview that " pgd opens the door to the temptation to select and manipulate life . "
but , he said , there was no " right to a child . "

it does n't want to spoil the cheer , but reminds everybody of the dangers of corruption . christmas is just around the corner , and people are scrambling to find the perfect presents to stack under the tree .
but one organization is n't feeling the festive spirit and wants to do away with presents entirely – at least in the world of business .
the german association of materials management , purchasing and logistics -lrb- ammpl -rrb- says gifts have no place in business and that a good supplier wo n't need them to keep its customers .
the association represents some 8,000 members , and in 2008 established a ' code of conduct ' which covers corporate gift giving .
but it 's not always easy to draw a line between a small token of appreciation and a gift that could open the door to a host of ethical dilemmas .
that 's why sebastian schroeder , an ammpl compliance expert , says the code of conduct drafted by his organization lets companies decide what limits are acceptable .
comparable business dinners in london , hamburg or shanghai come at very different prices , he pointed out .

instead , pyongyang on tuesday apparently offered to allow nuclear inspectors back in after kicking them out last year . instead of unleashing all-out war as some had feared pyongyang might do after south korea decided to go ahead with military exercises on monday , pyongyang let it be known that seoul ’ s provocations needed no response . south korea conducted the drills on monday despite repeated warnings from pyongyang that such a move would only escalate tension on the peninsula , but directed all shots into the sea , a good ten kilometers away from the two countries ' disputed sea border . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korean col. lee boong-woo , spokesman for the joint chiefs of staff , spoke briefly after the 90 minutes of military exercises were over in the south korean media , most of the editorials commended seoul ’ s decision to go ahead with the drills and send a strong message to pyongyang it was willing to act if need be . last month , the government had come under heavy criticism when it failed to show enough military resolve in the wake of pyongyang 's attack on the south korean island of yeonpyeong that killed two soldiers and two civilians . deadlock at un security council the sigh of relief in south korea coincided with deadlocked efforts at the un security council in new york to ease tension on the korean peninsula . the us and japan want to issue a statement blaming the crisis on pyongyang , but china and russia refuse to concede on this point . bildunterschrift : south korean marines went ahead with live-fire drills despite repeated warnings from pyongyang china ’ s vice ambassador to the united nations wang min summed up his country 's stance after the behind-the-scenes talks were broken off : " maintaining peace and stability on the peninsula is in the interest of both the south and the north , as well as other relevant parties .
we strongly appeal to all parties to exercise maximum restraint and act in a responsible manner . " " we ’ ll be guided by what north korea does " meanwhile , us troubleshooter bill richardson said in beijing that pyongyang had agreed to allow international nuclear inspectors back in the country after kicking them out last year . " the north is willing to allow international atomic agency personnel to visit the yongbyon sites and make sure that there are no efforts to enrich uranium .
secondly , the north is willing to negotiate with south korea to sell close to 12,000 spent fuel rods and ship them out of the country . " " it 's time for citizen diplomats like myself to step aside and let governments move forward , " he added .

thousands have been spending their nights in airports hoping their flights will take off . fresh snowfall overnight caused further setbacks at frankfurt airport , with no planes taking off or landing on tuesday morning .
around 130 departures , and a further 130 arrivals , were canceled at germany 's biggest air terminal .
one of the airport 's three runaways was reopened , allowing the first plane of the day to land at 8:28 a.m.
brussels airport and london heathrow , the world 's busiest airport , continued to experience disruption .
it was running a reduced number of flights on tuesday .
eurostar services from london to paris and brussels had also been hit .
speed restrictions mean that fewer trains were running .
eurostar asked " all customers booked to travel before christmas to refund or exchange their tickets free of charge , if their travel is not essential . "
thousands of passengers spent monday night waiting in airports and train stations , as the countdown to christmas shortens .
airports struggle airports were experiencing a backlog of passengers after hundreds of flights were cancelled over the weekend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : december is one of the most popular times to travel at frankfurt , some 340 of the 1,340 takeoffs and landings were canceled on monday , while at london heathrow , europe 's busiest airport , a very limited service began again on monday after a weekend of almost total standstill .
many other airports opened for a few hours before closing again .
the berlin airport operators said they did not expect services to return to normal before christmas .
the german transport minister , peter ramsauer , has suggested to local authorities that they allow flights at night , in order to clear the backlog of passengers .
the british authorities have already withdrawn the ban on night-flights until december 24 , christmas eve .
trains disrupted trains around berlin were seriously delayed on monday due to heavy snowfalls in the region .
throughout the country , frozen switches led to considerable problems .
a number of trains were canceled and , among those that ran , delays of over an hour were frequent .
speed limits were introduced on high-speed tracks to prevent damage to train undercarriages from blocks of ice .
the company operating almost all of germany 's long-distance trains , deutsche bahn , continued to warn passengers that trains were likely to be very crowded .
" there are likely to be considerable bottlenecks on major lines because of the cancelation of flights , " they wrote on their website .
throughout much of europe , railways were similarly disrupted .
even in southern sweden , which is used to heavy snow , 100 of 350 train journeys were cancelled on monday .
restrictions on the roads bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting around on foot has been the only option for many people on the roads too , the weather has caused serious disruption .
the authorities imposed a travel ban on buses and trucks in paris .
in parts of germany trucks weighing more than 7.5 tons were at times banned from freeways after a series of accidents in which tractor-trailers skidded and blocked the carriageway .
in the western state of north rhine-westphalia , there were 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- of traffic jams during the monday morning rush hour .
the police have been complaining that many drivers are still using summer tires , in spite of the icy conditions .
the chief executive of the association of local authorities , gerd landsberg , told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper that , after the costs of last year 's heavy winter , local governments would have to cut back on clearing the roads .
he said drivers would have to get used to driving on snowy roads , as they do in scandinavia .
although it 's expected that the weather will warm on thursday , another cold spell is forecast in time for christmas , although it is not expected to bring much snow .

he told monday 's berliner zeitung newspaper , " the welfare of the child must be the first consideration .
it 's not so much an issue of whether the adults want to live as a happy family .
i do n't believe that children want to grow up in a homosexual partnership . "
uta kehr , spokeswoman for the association of lesbians and gays in germany , said that kauder was encouraging prejudices against homosexual parents who care for children .
but worse still was the fact that he was humiliating homosexual parents in the eyes of their children .
" how will the 15-year-old son of a lesbian couple feel , for example , if he reads such things in the paper ? " she said .
children in " rainbow " families just as happy her position was backed up by leaders of the green party , who also pointed out that the german ministry for family affairs had recently published a study showing children who lived in so-called " rainbow " families felt just as well-looked-after and were just as successful as children of the same age in conventional families .

the german parliament is to have a free vote on proposals to allow highly restricted access to pgd in cases where there are good grounds to fear that the unborn child could suffer from a serious genetic disease .
kauder argued in the interview that " pgd opens the door to the temptation to select and manipulate life . "
but , he said , there was no " right to a child . "

this year , the only fights were over how many dortmund players we could include . nick , ben and jefferson are all great admirers of what juergen klopp has done at dortmund , but matt has obviously come down with a serious case of yellow-and-black fever .
left to his own devices , he would have included no fewer than eight dortmund players in his top 11 .
in the end , the rest of us applied the restraints -lrb- that is , we tied him to his bed -rrb- , so that a few players from other teams got the credit they deserved as well .
we begin with a pair of excellent african strikers .
bildunterschrift : cisse has carried a huge load for freiburg fantastic forwards one player we all agreed on , even matt , was freiburg 's papiss demba cisse .
with his 13 goals , the senegalese striker has the small southwestern german club sniffing the rarefied air at seldom experienced elevations in the table .
matt put it best : " cisse is from another planet - one where one man is enough to propel a team like freiburg up to sixth . "
not shabby for a player who came from the french second division .
chapeau !
on numbers alone , frankfurt 's theofanis gekas would have been a logical choice , but we all felt that he has gotten a number of lucky goals .
matt wanted dortmund 's lukas barrios , while nick preferred schalke 's klaas-jan huntelaar , but jefferson and ben went for didier ya konan .
how important is he to hanover ?
consider this .
since he joined the club in 2009 , hanover have n't earned a single point with him out of the starting line-up .
that 's truly a most valuable player .
majestic midfield no arguments at all about where to start in midfield : dortmund 's nuri sahin and shinji kagawa .
but what can be said about this dynamic duo that has n't been said thousands of times before ?
well how about this ?
sahin is the smartest player in german football .
to watch him is to see a player who seems to know exactly what 's happening in all areas of the pitch at all times .
that 's the definition of a rudder , and you can bet lots of huge european clubs will be vying for his services in the summer .
there 's room for improvement , though - from the spot .
sahin failed to convert the two penalties he took this season , about the only thing he did wrong in the latter half of 2010 .
moving on to kagawa , the three things most often mentioned are 1 -rrb- he 's from japan , 2 -rrb- he only cost 300,000 euros and 3 -rrb- he runs around a lot .
that 's all true but being japanese and cheap hardly guarantees footballing success , and lots of players run around lots without posting eight goals as he has .
what 's often neglected is his fantastic on-the-ball technique .
when he cuts into the middle of the pitch , the only player who 's more dangerous from medium range is arjen robben .
bildunterschrift : this man 's spectacular goals have fans saying " play it again , sam " matt went purely dortmund for the rest of midfield , but the aesthetes among us agreed that we just had to have leverkusen 's sidney sam .
it 's not just that the 22-year-old sam has scored six goals - it 's the way he 's scored them .
for example , his 20-meter-plus volley against kaiserslautern .
or his curling left-footer against hoffenheim .
or ... oh , just go to youtube , and check them out for yourselves .
he 's joined by teammate arturo vidal . six of his eight goals may have come on penalties , but nerves count in football , and the chilean converted all his attempts .
and they were n't meaningless ones either .
they resulted in seven points .
vidal is a main reason perennial unstable leverkusen are playing with consistency and are the only team with a slight chance of overtaking dortmund .
dependable defenders and one great goalkeeper dortmund have by far and away the best defense in the league , so it 's no surprise that mats hummels and marcel schmelzer were unanimous choices .
bildunterschrift : it 's been mighty hard getting by hummels hummels is quite simply the best defender at the moment in germany .
bayern 's uli hoeness is man of few regrets , but he surely must rue the decision to let hummels go in 2008 .
-lrb- there are rumors , terrifying to dortmund fans , that there 's a buy-back clause in the defender 's contract . -rrb-
schmelzer , meanwhile , makes the squad because he excels at the position , left back , that most teams struggle to fill .
his ability to get forward make dortmund ambidextrous , so to speak , and that 's one reason why only two teams this season succeeded in stopping them .
bildunterschrift : the new lahm is an ochs at right back , you could pencil in philipp lahm most years , but this time round the honors go to frankfurt 's captain patrick ochs .
never heard of him ?
you 're not alone , but for years now he 's been one of the bundesliga 's best value-for-money players , equally adapt at protecting the back and going forward .
he 's also versatile , sometimes moving up to midfield , and dependable , having played all but a handful of minutes in frankfurt 's matches .
the other central defender was the trickiest .
nick and matt were in the majority , preferring dortmund 's neven subotic , and ben had the funniest argument for hanover 's emanuel pogatetz : " no team should be without a mad austrian bastard . "
but jefferson intervened , dictatorially , because he felt someone from mainz had to be included .
and since mainz coach thomas tuchel rotates all other positions , that man had to be their captain nikolce noveski .
the 31-year-old noveski has n't missed a single minute , and while lewis holtby and andre schuerrle have grabbed the press attention , mainz have the second-best defense in the league - and the second-best spot in the standings .
last but by no means least , there 's schalke 's manuel neuer .
a homegrown product , he kept the royal blues within striking distance during their horrid start - without him , schalke would almost certainly be in the relegation zone .
and his first-half performance in schalke 's 2-0 win over bayern was truly heroic , as he turned away shot after shot .
best goalkeeper in germany ?
no question about that - even dortmund-phile matt put him on the list .
best goalkeeper in the world ?
maybe .
and that 's a mark of just how good our bundesliga top xi is at the back .

with more than $ 1.3 trillion of assets , pimco is one of the world 's largest bond investment firms .
the company , based in newport beach , california , is owned by germany 's allianz group .
bosomworth said if the three nations reverted to their own currencies , they would be able to sell their products abroad more competitively and use export revenues to drive further economic growth and repay their heavy debt loads .
investor confidence once economic growth and investor confidence returned to the countries , they could reintegrate into the single currency area , he added .
the idea of countries leaving the eurozone has been making the rounds ever since the greek debt crisis emerged with news that the country 's financial situation was far worse than previously acknowledged .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal could become the next eurozone rescue candidate many experts argue , however , that such a move would lead to massive costs that would ultimately undermine economic performance .
the two rescue packages for greece and ireland and the possibility of portugal and even spain becoming the next bailout candidates have found eurozone countries scrambling to save the common currency in the long term .
help from partners on thursday , european union leaders agreed on a change in the bloc 's rule-book , the lisbon treaty , clearing the way for a permanent rescue fund for crisis-hit eurozone countries from mid-2013 .
bosomworth believes that belgium , italy and spain will be able to get over their own debt problems while remaining inside the eurozone - but only with substantial help from partners .

an increasing number of holidaymakers are opting for eco-tourism which aims to protect travel destinations and their natural surroundings . it 's a scene emblematic of global mass tourism .
at 8 in the morning , the early risers have already spread out their towels on the sun loungers by the pool .
by 11 , the first jug of sangria has been ordered and the all-you-can-eat buffet is getting ready to open . and even though the hotel is on the sunny spanish island of mallorca , the staff all speak german , and are ready to cater to the every need of holidaymakers who 've spent 287 euros -lrb- $ 378 -rrb- a head for a week-long package tour , flights and cocktails included .
it might seem like a low-cost way of escaping the grim german winter , but the environmental cost is high .
mass tourism often takes a heavy toll on nature .
on the island of mallorca , the consequences of five decades of unchecked tourism include a water shortage and a concrete jungle along the coastline .
even the once unspoilt beaches of the balearic island are now lined with yacht harbors .
traveling with a good conscience bildunterschrift : mallorca is no longer an insider tip but the situation does n't need to get any worse .
the alternative to mass tourism is ‘ soft ' or green tourism – also known as environmentally-friendly tourism , gentle tourism , sustainable tourism and ecotourism .
essentially , the aim is to leave travel destinations unspoiled or unchanged by tourism . " ecotourism is a responsible form of travel that contributes to environmental protection and the wellbeing of local communities , ” explains ayako ezaki from the international ecotourism society -lrb- ties -rrb- .
" both the environment and the populations visited should benefit in cultural , economic and environmental terms from tourism . "
so , why is n't everyone doing it ?
mainly , because ecotourism is considerably more expensive than a package trip – and to many , snagging a bargain still matters more than having a clear conscience .
responsible travel is a concept that has yet to sink in on a broader scale , despite the galloping pace of climate change .
not so very long ago , international travel was prohibitively costly , so only a privileged few could afford to see the world .
but recent decades have seen low-cost tourism boom – at least for the developed world .
some 900 million people a year take advantage of no-frills travel options every year , and the knock-on effect is a rapid rise in co2 levels .
growing awareness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in laos , tourists can stay overnight high up in centuries-old trees nevertheless , increasing numbers of travellers are realizing that it 's not okay to use liters of water every time they take a shower when locals lack access to a clean drinking water supply .
according to ties , the ecotourism sector has been growing by 34 percent each year since 1990 .
jonathan tourtellot from the national geographic center for sustainable destinations attributes the trend to increased awareness of environmental issues and the need to curb climate change .
" moreover , there 's also a growing interest in ' authentic ' destinations , " he says .
this means that tourists do n't just hole up in sterile hotels but get to actually explore their environment in all its natural beauty .
but even ecotourists tend to fly to their destinations , thereby adding to global co2 emissions .
and with their swimming pools , air conditioning , restaurants and cafés that remain lit up into the early hours of the morning , tourist centres all over the world consume high levels of energy .
by switching to renewable energies , hotels can also do their bit to make sustainable tourism a viable alternative .
one hotel on the island kho khao in thailnd has done just that .
the kho khao beach resort now meets most of its energy needs through a combination of solar and wind power units .
the hotel owners hope to cut the island 's carbon emissions by 20 percent , and in the long run , they hope that kho khao will provide a model for sustainable tourism in thailand .
putting the brakes on climate change is one aspect of green travel , and protecting natural habitats from the ravages of mass tourism is another .
kho khao is home to ocean turtles , dolphins and rare birds , and these will only survive if the local tourism industry develops at a gentle pace .
the economics of tourism bildunterschrift : getting to know the local population is one aspect of ecotourism yet another aspect of responsible tourism is the role it plays in the economies of developing nations .
ayako ekazi from ties explains that ecotourism should ideally help tackle local poverty and promote growth .
moreover , tourists can talk to locals and learn something about the country they are visiting – exchange of information and communication is inevitably constructive and educational .
" ecotourism is not a one-way street , ” says ezaki .
" these days it is often cited as an opportunity for growth in developing nations , but that does n't mean it does n't exist in the richer nations . ”
the national geographic center for sustainable destinations , for example , is currently working on an initiative in the douro valley in portugal to promote gentle tourism .
and even mallorca is not yet a lost cause : it 's home to numerous projects aimed at preserving the island 's countryside .
and after the spanish property crash of 2007 , the government put a stop to further hotel construction in many regions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 21.12.2010 dortmund dominate the bundesliga best 11 of 2010 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a whole lot of these guys made our best-of list christmas is usually a time of acrimony at deutsche welle sports , as we argue about who should make our top xi .
this year , the only fights were over how many dortmund players we could include . nick , ben and jefferson are all great admirers of what juergen klopp has done at dortmund , but matt has obviously come down with a serious case of yellow-and-black fever .
left to his own devices , he would have included no fewer than eight dortmund players in his top 11 .
in the end , the rest of us applied the restraints -lrb- that is , we tied him to his bed -rrb- , so that a few players from other teams got the credit they deserved as well .
we begin with a pair of excellent african strikers .
bildunterschrift : cisse has carried a huge load for freiburg fantastic forwards one player we all agreed on , even matt , was freiburg 's papiss demba cisse .
with his 13 goals , the senegalese striker has the small southwestern german club sniffing the rarefied air at seldom experienced elevations in the table .
matt put it best : " cisse is from another planet - one where one man is enough to propel a team like freiburg up to sixth . "
not shabby for a player who came from the french second division .
chapeau !
on numbers alone , frankfurt 's theofanis gekas would have been a logical choice , but we all felt that he has gotten a number of lucky goals .
matt wanted dortmund 's lukas barrios , while nick preferred schalke 's klaas-jan huntelaar , but jefferson and ben went for didier ya konan .
how important is he to hanover ?
consider this .
since he joined the club in 2009 , hanover have n't earned a single point with him out of the starting line-up .
that 's truly a most valuable player .
majestic midfield no arguments at all about where to start in midfield : dortmund 's nuri sahin and shinji kagawa .
but what can be said about this dynamic duo that has n't been said thousands of times before ?
well how about this ?
sahin is the smartest player in german football .
to watch him is to see a player who seems to know exactly what 's happening in all areas of the pitch at all times .
that 's the definition of a rudder , and you can bet lots of huge european clubs will be vying for his services in the summer .
there 's room for improvement , though - from the spot .
sahin failed to convert the two penalties he took this season , about the only thing he did wrong in the latter half of 2010 .
moving on to kagawa , the three things most often mentioned are 1 -rrb- he 's from japan , 2 -rrb- he only cost 300,000 euros and 3 -rrb- he runs around a lot .
that 's all true but being japanese and cheap hardly guarantees footballing success , and lots of players run around lots without posting eight goals as he has .
what 's often neglected is his fantastic on-the-ball technique .
when he cuts into the middle of the pitch , the only player who 's more dangerous from medium range is arjen robben .
bildunterschrift : this man 's spectacular goals have fans saying " play it again , sam " matt went purely dortmund for the rest of midfield , but the aesthetes among us agreed that we just had to have leverkusen 's sidney sam .
it 's not just that the 22-year-old sam has scored six goals - it 's the way he 's scored them .
for example , his 20-meter-plus volley against kaiserslautern .
or his curling left-footer against hoffenheim .
or ... oh , just go to youtube , and check them out for yourselves .
he 's joined by teammate arturo vidal . six of his eight goals may have come on penalties , but nerves count in football , and the chilean converted all his attempts .
and they were n't meaningless ones either .
they resulted in seven points .
vidal is a main reason perennial unstable leverkusen are playing with consistency and are the only team with a slight chance of overtaking dortmund .
dependable defenders and one great goalkeeper dortmund have by far and away the best defense in the league , so it 's no surprise that mats hummels and marcel schmelzer were unanimous choices .
bildunterschrift : it 's been mighty hard getting by hummels hummels is quite simply the best defender at the moment in germany .
bayern 's uli hoeness is man of few regrets , but he surely must rue the decision to let hummels go in 2008 .
-lrb- there are rumors , terrifying to dortmund fans , that there 's a buy-back clause in the defender 's contract . -rrb-
schmelzer , meanwhile , makes the squad because he excels at the position , left back , that most teams struggle to fill .
his ability to get forward make dortmund ambidextrous , so to speak , and that 's one reason why only two teams this season succeeded in stopping them .
bildunterschrift : the new lahm is an ochs at right back , you could pencil in philipp lahm most years , but this time round the honors go to frankfurt 's captain patrick ochs .
never heard of him ?
you 're not alone , but for years now he 's been one of the bundesliga 's best value-for-money players , equally adapt at protecting the back and going forward .
he 's also versatile , sometimes moving up to midfield , and dependable , having played all but a handful of minutes in frankfurt 's matches .
the other central defender was the trickiest .
nick and matt were in the majority , preferring dortmund 's neven subotic , and ben had the funniest argument for hanover 's emanuel pogatetz : " no team should be without a mad austrian bastard . "
but jefferson intervened , dictatorially , because he felt someone from mainz had to be included .
and since mainz coach thomas tuchel rotates all other positions , that man had to be their captain nikolce noveski .
the 31-year-old noveski has n't missed a single minute , and while lewis holtby and andre schuerrle have grabbed the press attention , mainz have the second-best defense in the league - and the second-best spot in the standings .
last but by no means least , there 's schalke 's manuel neuer .
a homegrown product , he kept the royal blues within striking distance during their horrid start - without him , schalke would almost certainly be in the relegation zone .
and his first-half performance in schalke 's 2-0 win over bayern was truly heroic , as he turned away shot after shot .
best goalkeeper in germany ?
no question about that - even dortmund-phile matt put him on the list .
best goalkeeper in the world ?
maybe .
and that 's a mark of just how good our bundesliga top xi is at the back .

instead , pyongyang on tuesday apparently offered to allow nuclear inspectors back in after kicking them out last year . instead of unleashing all-out war as some had feared pyongyang might do after south korea decided to go ahead with military exercises on monday , pyongyang let it be known that seoul ’ s provocations needed no response . south korea conducted the drills on monday despite repeated warnings from pyongyang that such a move would only escalate tension on the peninsula , but directed all shots into the sea , a good ten kilometers away from the two countries ' disputed sea border . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korean col. lee boong-woo , spokesman for the joint chiefs of staff , spoke briefly after the 90 minutes of military exercises were over in the south korean media , most of the editorials commended seoul ’ s decision to go ahead with the drills and send a strong message to pyongyang it was willing to act if need be . last month , the government had come under heavy criticism when it failed to show enough military resolve in the wake of pyongyang 's attack on the south korean island of yeonpyeong that killed two soldiers and two civilians . deadlock at un security council the sigh of relief in south korea coincided with deadlocked efforts at the un security council in new york to ease tension on the korean peninsula . the us and japan want to issue a statement blaming the crisis on pyongyang , but china and russia refuse to concede on this point . bildunterschrift : south korean marines went ahead with live-fire drills despite repeated warnings from pyongyang china ’ s vice ambassador to the united nations wang min summed up his country 's stance after the behind-the-scenes talks were broken off : " maintaining peace and stability on the peninsula is in the interest of both the south and the north , as well as other relevant parties .
we strongly appeal to all parties to exercise maximum restraint and act in a responsible manner . " " we ’ ll be guided by what north korea does " meanwhile , us troubleshooter bill richardson said in beijing that pyongyang had agreed to allow international nuclear inspectors back in the country after kicking them out last year . " the north is willing to allow international atomic agency personnel to visit the yongbyon sites and make sure that there are no efforts to enrich uranium .
secondly , the north is willing to negotiate with south korea to sell close to 12,000 spent fuel rods and ship them out of the country . " " it 's time for citizen diplomats like myself to step aside and let governments move forward , " he added .

the move has led to fears about press freedom with protests ahead of the vote . lawmakers in hungary have given a controversial new body powers to oversee public news production and levy high fines on private media that break rules on political reporting .
the hungarian parliament passed the law establishing the national media and communications authority -lrb- nmhh -rrb- on monday evening , according to the hungarian national news agency mti .
some 1,500 protesters gathered outside the parliament in the hours before the vote , claiming that it would restrict press freedom , after an appeal was made on the social network site facebook .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orban 's government says the changes are necessary as technology changes the new body is to be controlled by members of the ruling right-wing conservative fidesz party , which is led by prime minister viktor orban and has a comfortable majority in parliament .
the government claims the law is overdue and reflects a need to address changes in technology .
the nmhh council will be able to impose heavy fines on the producers of radio , television , online and newspaper content that is deemed " not politically balanced . "
naming of sources journalists could also be required to submit names of their sources to the nmhh if necessary for " national security , " according to draft rules .
in protest against the legislation , some newspapers were released with blank front pages earlier this month .
critics say the aim of the law is to silence dissent , with fines of up to 92,000 euros -lrb- $ 120,000 -rrb- large enough to force the closure of small media outlets . author : richard connor -lrb- afp , dpa , reuters -rrb- editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in turkey , where the practice is now banned , thousands of ex-workers are thought to be suffering . consumers looking for a pair of jeans with that special worn look might want to check the label , according to campaigners .
the clean clothes campaign -lrb- ccc -rrb- is calling for a global ban on the practice of sandblasting , in which denim is sprayed with sand at high pressure to give the material a distressed look .
sandblasting is associated with the disease silicosis - a lung disease caused by fine particles of sand thrown into the air during the process .
turkey was a major producer of sandblasted garments before a ban on the process was implemented in 2009 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sandblasted jeans are popular on the high street around 10,000 people have been employed in sandblasting , according to yesim yasin , from the istanbul-based solidarity committee of sandblasting laborers .
" unfortunately many studies reveal the fact that almost 50 percent of the total number of employees are expected to contract this disease , silicosis , " yasin said .
" silicosis has always been and still is incurable .
the workers are sick , but as they have worked in the informal sector they have no basic legal rights . "
effort to persuade big firms the committee and the ccc have started a campaign for turkey to recognize that victims of sandblasting are victims of an industrial disease .
this would enable the families of 46 workers who have already died to receive benefits and support .
the groups also say that silicosis sufferers who are still alive are in need of help .
one of them is 39-year-old mehmet basak ; doctors predict he has about a year to live .
" i am having difficulty while walking , especially when i have to climb up a hill or even stairs i am totally out of breath , i can not breathe , " basak told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey was a center for sandblasting until the ban " i used to work from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.
dust would build up all over my body , you could n't even recognize me or my co-workers until we showered . "
the clean clothes campaign says that the garment industry is getting around the turkish prohibition by shifting the work to subcontractors in developing countries ; they argue that this is immoral on health grounds .
the group - an alliance of organizations in 15 european countries - is trying to persuade jeans makers to abandon the practice altogether .
" a number of big jeans producers like levis strauss and h & m have all said they would stop sandblasting with almost immediate effect , or by the end of this year , " said wyger wentholdt from the ccc .
" there are a couple of jeans brands who have not wanted to react to our approach at all . "
wendholt warned that , after lobbying , a name and shame campaign could follow against firms that persist in using the material .

this year , the only fights were over how many dortmund players we could include . nick , ben and jefferson are all great admirers of what juergen klopp has done at dortmund , but matt has obviously come down with a serious case of yellow-and-black fever .
left to his own devices , he would have included no fewer than eight dortmund players in his top 11 .
in the end , the rest of us applied the restraints -lrb- that is , we tied him to his bed -rrb- , so that a few players from other teams got the credit they deserved as well .
we begin with a pair of excellent african strikers .
bildunterschrift : cisse has carried a huge load for freiburg fantastic forwards one player we all agreed on , even matt , was freiburg 's papiss demba cisse .
with his 13 goals , the senegalese striker has the small southwestern german club sniffing the rarefied air at seldom experienced elevations in the table .
matt put it best : " cisse is from another planet - one where one man is enough to propel a team like freiburg up to sixth . "
not shabby for a player who came from the french second division .
chapeau !
on numbers alone , frankfurt 's theofanis gekas would have been a logical choice , but we all felt that he has gotten a number of lucky goals .
matt wanted dortmund 's lukas barrios , while nick preferred schalke 's klaas-jan huntelaar , but jefferson and ben went for didier ya konan .
how important is he to hanover ?
consider this .
since he joined the club in 2009 , hanover have n't earned a single point with him out of the starting line-up .
that 's truly a most valuable player .
majestic midfield no arguments at all about where to start in midfield : dortmund 's nuri sahin and shinji kagawa .
but what can be said about this dynamic duo that has n't been said thousands of times before ?
well how about this ?
sahin is the smartest player in german football .
to watch him is to see a player who seems to know exactly what 's happening in all areas of the pitch at all times .
that 's the definition of a rudder , and you can bet lots of huge european clubs will be vying for his services in the summer .
there 's room for improvement , though - from the spot .
sahin failed to convert the two penalties he took this season , about the only thing he did wrong in the latter half of 2010 .
moving on to kagawa , the three things most often mentioned are 1 -rrb- he 's from japan , 2 -rrb- he only cost 300,000 euros and 3 -rrb- he runs around a lot .
that 's all true but being japanese and cheap hardly guarantees footballing success , and lots of players run around lots without posting eight goals as he has .
what 's often neglected is his fantastic on-the-ball technique .
when he cuts into the middle of the pitch , the only player who 's more dangerous from medium range is arjen robben .
bildunterschrift : this man 's spectacular goals have fans saying " play it again , sam " matt went purely dortmund for the rest of midfield , but the aesthetes among us agreed that we just had to have leverkusen 's sidney sam .
it 's not just that the 22-year-old sam has scored six goals - it 's the way he 's scored them .
for example , his 20-meter-plus volley against kaiserslautern .
or his curling left-footer against hoffenheim .
or ... oh , just go to youtube , and check them out for yourselves .
he 's joined by teammate arturo vidal . six of his eight goals may have come on penalties , but nerves count in football , and the chilean converted all his attempts .
and they were n't meaningless ones either .
they resulted in seven points .
vidal is a main reason perennial unstable leverkusen are playing with consistency and are the only team with a slight chance of overtaking dortmund .
dependable defenders and one great goalkeeper dortmund have by far and away the best defense in the league , so it 's no surprise that mats hummels and marcel schmelzer were unanimous choices .
bildunterschrift : it 's been mighty hard getting by hummels hummels is quite simply the best defender at the moment in germany .
bayern 's uli hoeness is man of few regrets , but he surely must rue the decision to let hummels go in 2008 .
-lrb- there are rumors , terrifying to dortmund fans , that there 's a buy-back clause in the defender 's contract . -rrb-
schmelzer , meanwhile , makes the squad because he excels at the position , left back , that most teams struggle to fill .
his ability to get forward make dortmund ambidextrous , so to speak , and that 's one reason why only two teams this season succeeded in stopping them .
bildunterschrift : the new lahm is an ochs at right back , you could pencil in philipp lahm most years , but this time round the honors go to frankfurt 's captain patrick ochs .
never heard of him ?
you 're not alone , but for years now he 's been one of the bundesliga 's best value-for-money players , equally adapt at protecting the back and going forward .
he 's also versatile , sometimes moving up to midfield , and dependable , having played all but a handful of minutes in frankfurt 's matches .
the other central defender was the trickiest .
nick and matt were in the majority , preferring dortmund 's neven subotic , and ben had the funniest argument for hanover 's emanuel pogatetz : " no team should be without a mad austrian bastard . "
but jefferson intervened , dictatorially , because he felt someone from mainz had to be included .
and since mainz coach thomas tuchel rotates all other positions , that man had to be their captain nikolce noveski .
the 31-year-old noveski has n't missed a single minute , and while lewis holtby and andre schuerrle have grabbed the press attention , mainz have the second-best defense in the league - and the second-best spot in the standings .
last but by no means least , there 's schalke 's manuel neuer .
a homegrown product , he kept the royal blues within striking distance during their horrid start - without him , schalke would almost certainly be in the relegation zone .
and his first-half performance in schalke 's 2-0 win over bayern was truly heroic , as he turned away shot after shot .
best goalkeeper in germany ?
no question about that - even dortmund-phile matt put him on the list .
best goalkeeper in the world ?
maybe .
and that 's a mark of just how good our bundesliga top xi is at the back .

an increasing number of holidaymakers are opting for eco-tourism which aims to protect travel destinations and their natural surroundings . it 's a scene emblematic of global mass tourism .
at 8 in the morning , the early risers have already spread out their towels on the sun loungers by the pool .
by 11 , the first jug of sangria has been ordered and the all-you-can-eat buffet is getting ready to open . and even though the hotel is on the sunny spanish island of mallorca , the staff all speak german , and are ready to cater to the every need of holidaymakers who 've spent 287 euros -lrb- $ 378 -rrb- a head for a week-long package tour , flights and cocktails included .
it might seem like a low-cost way of escaping the grim german winter , but the environmental cost is high .
mass tourism often takes a heavy toll on nature .
on the island of mallorca , the consequences of five decades of unchecked tourism include a water shortage and a concrete jungle along the coastline .
even the once unspoilt beaches of the balearic island are now lined with yacht harbors .
traveling with a good conscience bildunterschrift : mallorca is no longer an insider tip but the situation does n't need to get any worse .
the alternative to mass tourism is ‘ soft ' or green tourism – also known as environmentally-friendly tourism , gentle tourism , sustainable tourism and ecotourism .
essentially , the aim is to leave travel destinations unspoiled or unchanged by tourism . " ecotourism is a responsible form of travel that contributes to environmental protection and the wellbeing of local communities , ” explains ayako ezaki from the international ecotourism society -lrb- ties -rrb- .
" both the environment and the populations visited should benefit in cultural , economic and environmental terms from tourism . "
so , why is n't everyone doing it ?
mainly , because ecotourism is considerably more expensive than a package trip – and to many , snagging a bargain still matters more than having a clear conscience .
responsible travel is a concept that has yet to sink in on a broader scale , despite the galloping pace of climate change .
not so very long ago , international travel was prohibitively costly , so only a privileged few could afford to see the world .
but recent decades have seen low-cost tourism boom – at least for the developed world .
some 900 million people a year take advantage of no-frills travel options every year , and the knock-on effect is a rapid rise in co2 levels .
growing awareness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in laos , tourists can stay overnight high up in centuries-old trees nevertheless , increasing numbers of travellers are realizing that it 's not okay to use liters of water every time they take a shower when locals lack access to a clean drinking water supply .
according to ties , the ecotourism sector has been growing by 34 percent each year since 1990 .
jonathan tourtellot from the national geographic center for sustainable destinations attributes the trend to increased awareness of environmental issues and the need to curb climate change .
" moreover , there 's also a growing interest in ' authentic ' destinations , " he says .
this means that tourists do n't just hole up in sterile hotels but get to actually explore their environment in all its natural beauty .
but even ecotourists tend to fly to their destinations , thereby adding to global co2 emissions .
and with their swimming pools , air conditioning , restaurants and cafés that remain lit up into the early hours of the morning , tourist centres all over the world consume high levels of energy .
by switching to renewable energies , hotels can also do their bit to make sustainable tourism a viable alternative .
one hotel on the island kho khao in thailnd has done just that .
the kho khao beach resort now meets most of its energy needs through a combination of solar and wind power units .
the hotel owners hope to cut the island 's carbon emissions by 20 percent , and in the long run , they hope that kho khao will provide a model for sustainable tourism in thailand .
putting the brakes on climate change is one aspect of green travel , and protecting natural habitats from the ravages of mass tourism is another .
kho khao is home to ocean turtles , dolphins and rare birds , and these will only survive if the local tourism industry develops at a gentle pace .
the economics of tourism bildunterschrift : getting to know the local population is one aspect of ecotourism yet another aspect of responsible tourism is the role it plays in the economies of developing nations .
ayako ekazi from ties explains that ecotourism should ideally help tackle local poverty and promote growth .
moreover , tourists can talk to locals and learn something about the country they are visiting – exchange of information and communication is inevitably constructive and educational .
" ecotourism is not a one-way street , ” says ezaki .
" these days it is often cited as an opportunity for growth in developing nations , but that does n't mean it does n't exist in the richer nations . ”
the national geographic center for sustainable destinations , for example , is currently working on an initiative in the douro valley in portugal to promote gentle tourism .
and even mallorca is not yet a lost cause : it 's home to numerous projects aimed at preserving the island 's countryside .
and after the spanish property crash of 2007 , the government put a stop to further hotel construction in many regions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 21.12.2010 no presents this year in corporate germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cash gifts are absolutely off limits in germany a major german industry association is urging managers to rethink corporate christmas gifts this year .
it does n't want to spoil the cheer , but reminds everybody of the dangers of corruption . christmas is just around the corner , and people are scrambling to find the perfect presents to stack under the tree .
but one organization is n't feeling the festive spirit and wants to do away with presents entirely – at least in the world of business .
the german association of materials management , purchasing and logistics -lrb- ammpl -rrb- says gifts have no place in business and that a good supplier wo n't need them to keep its customers .
the association represents some 8,000 members , and in 2008 established a ' code of conduct ' which covers corporate gift giving .
but it 's not always easy to draw a line between a small token of appreciation and a gift that could open the door to a host of ethical dilemmas .
that 's why sebastian schroeder , an ammpl compliance expert , says the code of conduct drafted by his organization lets companies decide what limits are acceptable .
comparable business dinners in london , hamburg or shanghai come at very different prices , he pointed out .
" ultimately it is up to the individual employee of a company to determine if a present has been made in good faith , " he told deutsche welle .
" we did n't set a limit to the value of presents . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airport operator fraport says its staff know what 's acceptable despite their clean-cut reputation , german managers have gone astray on numerous occasions .
in recent years , corruption scandals have rocked companies including siemens , man , daimler , and volkswagen .
intercultural challenge in a globalized business environment , there 's always the issue of differing cultural expectations .
representatives from asian , middle eastern and south american companies are likely to expect a tighter bond with business partners than many germans are used to , schroeder said .
" they close deals based more on personal trust , " he said .
" and sometimes a german buyer shows up and wants to get right to the deal and sign a contract , only to find there are certain limitations . "
in china , for instance , monetary gifts are not at all uncommon , although they are " clearly not acceptable in europe and the united states , " schroeder said .

the group , led by war crimes suspect joseph kony , already carries out attacks in these regions up to four times a week , according to a report published by the agencies alliance , which includes oxfam , christian aid , refugees international , world vision and war child uk .
despite concerted but ultimately unsuccessful efforts by the ugandan army in december 2008 to finally defeat the lra , the group - known for its slaughter of civilians and the abduction of children - continues to strike fear across central africa .
the failure of operation lightning thunder resulted in a wave of brutal revenge attacks by the lra .
" the lra 's leaders call themselves christian visionaries , but they are mass-murderers roving around central africa searching for communities to eviscerate , " richard gowan , an africa expert with the european council for foreign affairs , told deutsche welle . " efforts to deal with the lra as a rational political force have failed . " " the un tried to talk to the lra in 2006-8 , which was a useful experiment , but the negotiations went nowhere and uganda 's military campaign against lra bases in the eastern congo in 2008 only forced the lra into the central african republic and sudan , sending tens of thousands of civilians running for their lives . " it is alleged that the lra has killed more than 2,000 people since december 2008 while kidnapping more than 2,600 and forcing more than 400,000 refugees to flee from dr congo , the central african republic and southern sudan .
" the acute suffering and mass population displacement the lra has generated across international borders is undermining stability in an already fragile region , where southern sudan is preparing to hold a landmark referendum on secession in early 2011 , " the alliance report - entitled " the ghosts of christmas past " - said .
alun mcdonald , oxfam 's regional media and communications officer for the horn , east and central africa , says the international community 's response has been weak and counter-productive . " the lra is the most deadly group in dr congo at the moment , killing over 1,000 people this year .
yet less than 1,000 of the 18,500 un peacekeepers in the country are deployed in lra-affected areas . " alliance calls for international intervention to stop lra bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : war crimes suspect kony remains as elusive as his lra as well as warning of the potential for christmas attacks , the agencies alliance has called on the international community to do more to stop the lra once and for all .
" war child advocates for the scaling-up of non-military interventions in the region , primarily focusing on the safe release and reintegration into communities of child soldiers recruited by the lra , particularly girl soldiers who are often neglected in the reintegration process which increases the likelihood of re-recruitment , " nivi narang , the campaigns director at war child uk , told deutsche welle .
" we want the international community to give the lra problem the attention it deserves , " oxfam 's mcdonald said .
" governments should explore non-military options for dealing with the lra while remembering that many lra fighters are in fact abducted children .
helping them to escape and defect would put an enormous dent in the lra 's military capacity . "
mcdonald also believes that increased numbers of well-trained un peacekeepers in areas most at risk from lra attacks would act as a real deterrent to the small but violent group .
un , us show increased willingness to act bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un is sending more peacekeepers to areas at risk in response , the un security council has echoed the call for greater international action and has dispatched 900 peacekeepers to a remote region of dr congo where the lra carried out consecutive christmas attacks in 2008 and 2009 .
the security council has also welcomed an african union move to set up a joint task force to fight the lra and deploy joint border patrols . the united states , which provided logistical support for the ugandan army 's operation lightning thunder in 2008 , has also promised to support a new effort to finally defeat the lra and catch the elusive kony , who is wanted by the international criminal court for war crimes and crimes against humanity . president barack obama presented congress with a new plan last week that would promote " the defection , disarmament , demobilization , and reintegration of remaining lra fighters ; and ... increase humanitarian access and provide continued relief to affected communities . "
the plan is part of a wider strategy agreed upon by congress six months ago to " defuse the spiraling bloodshed in central africa , protect the civilian population and bring lra leaders to justice . " experts lament too little action coming too late bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african forces fighting the lra need more international help the belief among experts is that while it is a positive development that the united nations and united states are now moving the lra problem up their african agendas , a lot of damage has already been done and the efforts they speak of may be too little too late . " the un has huge problems in central africa , ranging from instability in the congo to the upcoming independence referendum in south sudan , " said richard gowan .
" there are thousands of peacekeepers in the region , but they 're overstretched already . "
gowan believes that tackling the lra will be a long and grinding process with the only ' quick fix ' coming from the death or arrest of its leader , joseph kony . even that might not end the threat the lra poses to central africa . " very , very few people would shed a tear for kony , " gowan said . " but if he died , the lra might still keep going in a new form .

it does n't want to spoil the cheer , but reminds everybody of the dangers of corruption . christmas is just around the corner , and people are scrambling to find the perfect presents to stack under the tree .
but one organization is n't feeling the festive spirit and wants to do away with presents entirely – at least in the world of business .
the german association of materials management , purchasing and logistics -lrb- ammpl -rrb- says gifts have no place in business and that a good supplier wo n't need them to keep its customers .
the association represents some 8,000 members , and in 2008 established a ' code of conduct ' which covers corporate gift giving .
but it 's not always easy to draw a line between a small token of appreciation and a gift that could open the door to a host of ethical dilemmas .
that 's why sebastian schroeder , an ammpl compliance expert , says the code of conduct drafted by his organization lets companies decide what limits are acceptable .
comparable business dinners in london , hamburg or shanghai come at very different prices , he pointed out .
" ultimately it is up to the individual employee of a company to determine if a present has been made in good faith , " he told deutsche welle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 21.12.2010 dortmund dominate the bundesliga best 11 of 2010 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a whole lot of these guys made our best-of list christmas is usually a time of acrimony at deutsche welle sports , as we argue about who should make our top xi .
this year , the only fights were over how many dortmund players we could include . nick , ben and jefferson are all great admirers of what juergen klopp has done at dortmund , but matt has obviously come down with a serious case of yellow-and-black fever .
left to his own devices , he would have included no fewer than eight dortmund players in his top 11 .
in the end , the rest of us applied the restraints -lrb- that is , we tied him to his bed -rrb- , so that a few players from other teams got the credit they deserved as well .
we begin with a pair of excellent african strikers .
bildunterschrift : cisse has carried a huge load for freiburg fantastic forwards one player we all agreed on , even matt , was freiburg 's papiss demba cisse .
with his 13 goals , the senegalese striker has the small southwestern german club sniffing the rarefied air at seldom experienced elevations in the table .
matt put it best : " cisse is from another planet - one where one man is enough to propel a team like freiburg up to sixth . "
not shabby for a player who came from the french second division .
chapeau !
on numbers alone , frankfurt 's theofanis gekas would have been a logical choice , but we all felt that he has gotten a number of lucky goals .
matt wanted dortmund 's lukas barrios , while nick preferred schalke 's klaas-jan huntelaar , but jefferson and ben went for didier ya konan .
how important is he to hanover ?
consider this .
since he joined the club in 2009 , hanover have n't earned a single point with him out of the starting line-up .
that 's truly a most valuable player .
majestic midfield no arguments at all about where to start in midfield : dortmund 's nuri sahin and shinji kagawa .
but what can be said about this dynamic duo that has n't been said thousands of times before ?
well how about this ?
sahin is the smartest player in german football .
to watch him is to see a player who seems to know exactly what 's happening in all areas of the pitch at all times .
that 's the definition of a rudder , and you can bet lots of huge european clubs will be vying for his services in the summer .
there 's room for improvement , though - from the spot .
sahin failed to convert the two penalties he took this season , about the only thing he did wrong in the latter half of 2010 .
moving on to kagawa , the three things most often mentioned are 1 -rrb- he 's from japan , 2 -rrb- he only cost 300,000 euros and 3 -rrb- he runs around a lot .
that 's all true but being japanese and cheap hardly guarantees footballing success , and lots of players run around lots without posting eight goals as he has .
what 's often neglected is his fantastic on-the-ball technique .
when he cuts into the middle of the pitch , the only player who 's more dangerous from medium range is arjen robben .
bildunterschrift : this man 's spectacular goals have fans saying " play it again , sam " matt went purely dortmund for the rest of midfield , but the aesthetes among us agreed that we just had to have leverkusen 's sidney sam .
it 's not just that the 22-year-old sam has scored six goals - it 's the way he 's scored them .
for example , his 20-meter-plus volley against kaiserslautern .
or his curling left-footer against hoffenheim .
or ... oh , just go to youtube , and check them out for yourselves .
he 's joined by teammate arturo vidal . six of his eight goals may have come on penalties , but nerves count in football , and the chilean converted all his attempts .
and they were n't meaningless ones either .
they resulted in seven points .
vidal is a main reason perennial unstable leverkusen are playing with consistency and are the only team with a slight chance of overtaking dortmund .
dependable defenders and one great goalkeeper dortmund have by far and away the best defense in the league , so it 's no surprise that mats hummels and marcel schmelzer were unanimous choices .
bildunterschrift : it 's been mighty hard getting by hummels hummels is quite simply the best defender at the moment in germany .
bayern 's uli hoeness is man of few regrets , but he surely must rue the decision to let hummels go in 2008 .
-lrb- there are rumors , terrifying to dortmund fans , that there 's a buy-back clause in the defender 's contract . -rrb-
schmelzer , meanwhile , makes the squad because he excels at the position , left back , that most teams struggle to fill .
his ability to get forward make dortmund ambidextrous , so to speak , and that 's one reason why only two teams this season succeeded in stopping them .
bildunterschrift : the new lahm is an ochs at right back , you could pencil in philipp lahm most years , but this time round the honors go to frankfurt 's captain patrick ochs .
never heard of him ?
you 're not alone , but for years now he 's been one of the bundesliga 's best value-for-money players , equally adapt at protecting the back and going forward .
he 's also versatile , sometimes moving up to midfield , and dependable , having played all but a handful of minutes in frankfurt 's matches .
the other central defender was the trickiest .
nick and matt were in the majority , preferring dortmund 's neven subotic , and ben had the funniest argument for hanover 's emanuel pogatetz : " no team should be without a mad austrian bastard . "
but jefferson intervened , dictatorially , because he felt someone from mainz had to be included .
and since mainz coach thomas tuchel rotates all other positions , that man had to be their captain nikolce noveski .
the 31-year-old noveski has n't missed a single minute , and while lewis holtby and andre schuerrle have grabbed the press attention , mainz have the second-best defense in the league - and the second-best spot in the standings .
last but by no means least , there 's schalke 's manuel neuer .
a homegrown product , he kept the royal blues within striking distance during their horrid start - without him , schalke would almost certainly be in the relegation zone .
and his first-half performance in schalke 's 2-0 win over bayern was truly heroic , as he turned away shot after shot .
best goalkeeper in germany ?
no question about that - even dortmund-phile matt put him on the list .
best goalkeeper in the world ?
maybe .
and that 's a mark of just how good our bundesliga top xi is at the back .

but the excitement faded fast . in the lazy midday sun , it is playtime for the children in the tribal hamlet of tembhli in india 's western state of maharashtra .
using sticks , they roll old tire tubes and stones along a concrete road .
they are excited to have such a smooth surface to play on . three months ago , this road did not exist .
but in september the otherwise sleepy hamlet saw a flurry of activity as it prepared to receive prime minister manmohan singh and congress party president sonia gandhi , who were coming to distribute the first set of unique identification -lrb- uid -rrb- cards . titled " aadhaar , " meaning support , the project aims to equip each indian citizen with biometric identification numbers based on thumbprints and iris scans .
this ambitious scheme has come under heavy criticism for several reasons , one of them being the claim by some experts that it will result in the invasion of privacy .
but the indian government has defended the project , claiming it will help poor and disadvantaged citizens avail public welfare schemes more easily .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : road construction has been left incomplete in some parts of tembhli fleeting elation after years of feeling abandoned , the villagers of tembhli were initially thrilled to be chosen for a visit by no less than the prime minister himself , but their elation did not last long . the attention bestowed on them by the government was only fleeting , says 28-year-old sunanda karma thakre , who with her husband is one of the many who usually migrate to the neighboring state of gujarat to find work . " we were about to leave for gujarat this year too , but then we heard of the prime minister ’ s visit .
we decided to stay , thinking the ministers would help us find work here .
but that did not materialize , " she points out . " if they come again , we will tell them about our troubles .
but all these government officials only came to us around the time of the pm ’ s visit .
now no one seems to be interested in listening to us .
no one has stepped into the village since then .
even the roads that were being built lie incomplete and some of us still don ’ t have electricity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunanda karma thakre is a skeptical about the new biometric uid cards lack of work opportunities drive laborers away laborers in tembhli struggle to find occasional work as farm hands in the nearby fields , which fetches them barely a euro a day .
by comparison , the state of gujarat , especially the saurashtra region , offers plenty of employment opportunities on the sugarcane plantations , cotton and groundnut-crushing factories , or on farms .
this work can fetch a laborer between two to three euros a day .
this ensures that when they return to tembhli at the beginning of monsoon , they have a decent amount saved up . while it may seem to be an advantage in terms of income , migration brings with it a host of other problems .
the migrants often leave their homes behind to live in dire conditions in gujarat , often without shelter .
on top of this , they have to uproot their families every year , taking their children out of school , causing a high dropout rate and increasing illiteracy . immediate needs have to be addressed what is important right now is to address the villagers ’ more immediate needs of employment and housing , says madi raju makkan , a member of the tembhli gram panchayat , or village council . " implementation of the national rural employment guarantee scheme should begin as soon as possible .
the government makes promises and then doesn ’ t follow up on them .
that is why the people lose all hope of getting work and leave for saurashtra .
there are many in our village with a ' below poverty line ' status , who don ’ t have proper houses to live in .
many public schemes in the village are incomplete and our village is often inundated in the monsoon floods .
we have lodged many appeals , but the government has not taken any initiatives to act on them . " bildunterschrift : many migrant workers are forced to live on the streets the unique identification -lrb- uid -rrb- cards are supposed to change matters .
villagers can seek loans and open bank accounts more easily .
officials claim the cards will help improve execution of the national rural employment guarantee scheme , although it is not yet clear how this will work . it may be too soon to tell whether these cards will make a difference .
however , as the initial hype and excitement fades away , there is increasing disillusionment among the people of tembhli as they realize that while the uid card is a much needed proof of identity , it will not give them what they want most of all – a chance to earn a better living . author : pia chandavarkar -lrb- tembhli -rrb- editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

thousands have been spending their nights in airports hoping their flights will take off . fresh snowfall overnight caused further setbacks at frankfurt airport , with no planes taking off or landing on tuesday morning .
around 130 departures , and a further 130 arrivals , were canceled at germany 's biggest air terminal .
one of the airport 's three runaways was reopened , allowing the first plane of the day to land at 8:28 a.m.
brussels airport and london heathrow , the world 's busiest airport , continued to experience disruption .
it was running a reduced number of flights on tuesday .
eurostar services from london to paris and brussels had also been hit .
speed restrictions mean that fewer trains were running .
eurostar asked " all customers booked to travel before christmas to refund or exchange their tickets free of charge , if their travel is not essential . "
thousands of passengers spent monday night waiting in airports and train stations , as the countdown to christmas shortens .
airports struggle airports were experiencing a backlog of passengers after hundreds of flights were cancelled over the weekend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : december is one of the most popular times to travel at frankfurt , some 340 of the 1,340 takeoffs and landings were canceled on monday , while at london heathrow , europe 's busiest airport , a very limited service began again on monday after a weekend of almost total standstill .
many other airports opened for a few hours before closing again .
the berlin airport operators said they did not expect services to return to normal before christmas .
the german transport minister , peter ramsauer , has suggested to local authorities that they allow flights at night , in order to clear the backlog of passengers .
the british authorities have already withdrawn the ban on night-flights until december 24 , christmas eve .
trains disrupted trains around berlin were seriously delayed on monday due to heavy snowfalls in the region .
throughout the country , frozen switches led to considerable problems .
a number of trains were canceled and , among those that ran , delays of over an hour were frequent .
speed limits were introduced on high-speed tracks to prevent damage to train undercarriages from blocks of ice .
the company operating almost all of germany 's long-distance trains , deutsche bahn , continued to warn passengers that trains were likely to be very crowded .
" there are likely to be considerable bottlenecks on major lines because of the cancelation of flights , " they wrote on their website .
throughout much of europe , railways were similarly disrupted .
even in southern sweden , which is used to heavy snow , 100 of 350 train journeys were cancelled on monday .
restrictions on the roads bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting around on foot has been the only option for many people on the roads too , the weather has caused serious disruption .
the authorities imposed a travel ban on buses and trucks in paris .
in parts of germany trucks weighing more than 7.5 tons were at times banned from freeways after a series of accidents in which tractor-trailers skidded and blocked the carriageway .
in the western state of north rhine-westphalia , there were 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- of traffic jams during the monday morning rush hour .
the police have been complaining that many drivers are still using summer tires , in spite of the icy conditions .
the chief executive of the association of local authorities , gerd landsberg , told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper that , after the costs of last year 's heavy winter , local governments would have to cut back on clearing the roads .
he said drivers would have to get used to driving on snowy roads , as they do in scandinavia .
although it 's expected that the weather will warm on thursday , another cold spell is forecast in time for christmas , although it is not expected to bring much snow .

while in goethe 's day , singing was an integral part of life in germany , the collective choir of the nation has since fallen rather silent .
christmas can go some way to restarting a passion . rudolph tiersch grew up in a world of song .
when he was a child , friends would come and visit his family on sundays and would sit in the kitchen , drink tea , chat and laugh .
as televisions were still a rarity in those days , it was only ever a matter of time before someone would pick up a guitar and the assembled company would burst into song .
for tiersch , who is now 50 years old , they are happy memories .
and not only for what they were , but for what he describes as their ability to unite people .
" it brings people together and gives them a home singing about their religion or their country , " tiersch told deutsche welle .
" chanting is the simplest way to bring people together .
you always have a voice with you .
not everyone can play the guitar or the piano , but everyone can sing . "
a long healthy tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinmar the minnesinger the basic german volkslied has its roots in the 12th century , which gave birth to minnesingers , who largely sung of love .
over time , the songs came to deal with other important issues such as religion , social conditions , and the soul of the people .
by the 19th century it had been turned into an art form , laden with bourgeois expression .
when the nazis seized power in 1933 , they used the national tradition of folk to promote what they claimed to be pure and german .
they wrote new songs to the tune of national socialism , successfully using them as instruments for manipulation and propaganda .
once the war was over , the east german communist regime continued to manipulate the masses through music , as tiersch recalls .
" i recall a song called unsere heimat which poetically describes the beauty of the country set to a lyrical melody , " he said .
" the underlying message was that socialism made it possible . "
from passion to profession although much in germany has changed in the twenty years since reunification , too many decades of state-decreed singing appears to have robbed many people of their lust for letting it all out .
not so tiersch , whose love of song is so profound that he is a professional choirmaster .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the frankfurt / oder singing academy he is the head of the singakademie in the eastern german town of frankfurt / oder , which comprises a children 's , a youth , a concert and a chamber-choir .
the choirmaster has been awarded germany 's federal cross of merit for his efforts to bring singing back into everyday life .
he says he sees his choirs as a social network .
" it 's like a little society inside society , " the choirmaster said .
" you 've got the judge on that side and the salesman there , but they sing together , they 're talking together , maybe they drink beer together . "
seeing a mixed bag of people united through song pleases tiersch greatly , and as choir member antonia brill explains , there are plenty of benefits to being part of a group with music at its core .
" it helps you .
when you 're sad , you think about moments when you sang together with everyone and it feels good , or when you 're singing on your own at home , you feel better , " the 19-year-old said .
re-igniting the fire but antonia is not necessarily the rule .
rudolph tiersch says it is becoming increasingly difficult to encourage young germans to sing , a state of affairs which he finds alarming .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when better to sing than at christmas ?
" it has been scientifically proven that singing activates parts of the brain which otherwise lie idle , " he said .
" children who hear their parents sing before they are three years old are better at school than their classmates who have only consumed music in the media . "
he believes the over-emphasis of individual freedom in society as we know it today often leads to social isolation , and is keen to point out the sense of community which comes from singing together .
particularly at this time of year .
" christmas is becoming more and more commercial in germany , too , " he said .
" with prosperity we are moving away from the religious traditions which are part of every society .
but christmas singing takes us back to our roots . "
and to prove his point , he has his singers working on bach 's christmas oratorio , which he explains is all about bringing love into the world .
as his singing academy is based in the former gdr , where the state opposed the church , many of his choir members are not familiar with the religious concepts which the music conveys .
to set that right , they discuss the work as a group , the aim always being to give the audience goose-bumps .
" if we do n't , we 've done something wrong , " the choirmaster said .

a number of cabinet posts will remain unfilled , pending further appraisal of the candidates .
parliamentarians also voted for a government program which aims to attract more foreign investment and fight terrorism .
al-maliki 's rival and former premier , iyad allawi , who narrowly won the election in march but was unable to form a government , said he would support the new government .
" we wish and we hope for this government to succeed in meeting the people 's requirements , " he said .
us president barack obama welcomed the formation of a new government , describing it as a " significant " historic moment .
" today 's vote in the council of representatives is a significant moment in iraq 's history and a major step forward in advancing national unity , " he said in a written statement .
he added that the us would continue its partnership with iraq and help to build a peaceful nation " that is fully integrated into the region and the international community . "
britain also hailed the deal , with foreign secretary william hague saying it would allow the new government to tackle the country 's problems .
" this will reinforce stability and allow iraq 's political leaders to work together for the benefit of their country and people . "

an increasing number of holidaymakers are opting for eco-tourism which aims to protect travel destinations and their natural surroundings . it 's a scene emblematic of global mass tourism .
at 8 in the morning , the early risers have already spread out their towels on the sun loungers by the pool .
by 11 , the first jug of sangria has been ordered and the all-you-can-eat buffet is getting ready to open . and even though the hotel is on the sunny spanish island of mallorca , the staff all speak german , and are ready to cater to the every need of holidaymakers who 've spent 287 euros -lrb- $ 378 -rrb- a head for a week-long package tour , flights and cocktails included .
it might seem like a low-cost way of escaping the grim german winter , but the environmental cost is high .
mass tourism often takes a heavy toll on nature .
on the island of mallorca , the consequences of five decades of unchecked tourism include a water shortage and a concrete jungle along the coastline .
even the once unspoilt beaches of the balearic island are now lined with yacht harbors .
traveling with a good conscience bildunterschrift : mallorca is no longer an insider tip but the situation does n't need to get any worse .
the alternative to mass tourism is ‘ soft ' or green tourism – also known as environmentally-friendly tourism , gentle tourism , sustainable tourism and ecotourism .
essentially , the aim is to leave travel destinations unspoiled or unchanged by tourism . " ecotourism is a responsible form of travel that contributes to environmental protection and the wellbeing of local communities , ” explains ayako ezaki from the international ecotourism society -lrb- ties -rrb- .
" both the environment and the populations visited should benefit in cultural , economic and environmental terms from tourism . "
so , why is n't everyone doing it ?
mainly , because ecotourism is considerably more expensive than a package trip – and to many , snagging a bargain still matters more than having a clear conscience .
responsible travel is a concept that has yet to sink in on a broader scale , despite the galloping pace of climate change .
not so very long ago , international travel was prohibitively costly , so only a privileged few could afford to see the world .
but recent decades have seen low-cost tourism boom – at least for the developed world .
some 900 million people a year take advantage of no-frills travel options every year , and the knock-on effect is a rapid rise in co2 levels .
growing awareness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in laos , tourists can stay overnight high up in centuries-old trees nevertheless , increasing numbers of travellers are realizing that it 's not okay to use liters of water every time they take a shower when locals lack access to a clean drinking water supply .
according to ties , the ecotourism sector has been growing by 34 percent each year since 1990 .
jonathan tourtellot from the national geographic center for sustainable destinations attributes the trend to increased awareness of environmental issues and the need to curb climate change .
" moreover , there 's also a growing interest in ' authentic ' destinations , " he says .
this means that tourists do n't just hole up in sterile hotels but get to actually explore their environment in all its natural beauty .
but even ecotourists tend to fly to their destinations , thereby adding to global co2 emissions .
and with their swimming pools , air conditioning , restaurants and cafés that remain lit up into the early hours of the morning , tourist centres all over the world consume high levels of energy .
by switching to renewable energies , hotels can also do their bit to make sustainable tourism a viable alternative .
one hotel on the island kho khao in thailnd has done just that .
the kho khao beach resort now meets most of its energy needs through a combination of solar and wind power units .
the hotel owners hope to cut the island 's carbon emissions by 20 percent , and in the long run , they hope that kho khao will provide a model for sustainable tourism in thailand .
putting the brakes on climate change is one aspect of green travel , and protecting natural habitats from the ravages of mass tourism is another .
kho khao is home to ocean turtles , dolphins and rare birds , and these will only survive if the local tourism industry develops at a gentle pace .
the economics of tourism bildunterschrift : getting to know the local population is one aspect of ecotourism yet another aspect of responsible tourism is the role it plays in the economies of developing nations .
ayako ekazi from ties explains that ecotourism should ideally help tackle local poverty and promote growth .
moreover , tourists can talk to locals and learn something about the country they are visiting – exchange of information and communication is inevitably constructive and educational .
" ecotourism is not a one-way street , ” says ezaki .
" these days it is often cited as an opportunity for growth in developing nations , but that does n't mean it does n't exist in the richer nations . ”
the national geographic center for sustainable destinations , for example , is currently working on an initiative in the douro valley in portugal to promote gentle tourism .
and even mallorca is not yet a lost cause : it 's home to numerous projects aimed at preserving the island 's countryside .
and after the spanish property crash of 2007 , the government put a stop to further hotel construction in many regions .

in turkey , where the practice is now banned , thousands of ex-workers are thought to be suffering . consumers looking for a pair of jeans with that special worn look might want to check the label , according to campaigners .
the clean clothes campaign -lrb- ccc -rrb- is calling for a global ban on the practice of sandblasting , in which denim is sprayed with sand at high pressure to give the material a distressed look .
sandblasting is associated with the disease silicosis - a lung disease caused by fine particles of sand thrown into the air during the process .
turkey was a major producer of sandblasted garments before a ban on the process was implemented in 2009 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sandblasted jeans are popular on the high street around 10,000 people have been employed in sandblasting , according to yesim yasin , from the istanbul-based solidarity committee of sandblasting laborers .
" unfortunately many studies reveal the fact that almost 50 percent of the total number of employees are expected to contract this disease , silicosis , " yasin said .
" silicosis has always been and still is incurable .
the workers are sick , but as they have worked in the informal sector they have no basic legal rights . "
effort to persuade big firms the committee and the ccc have started a campaign for turkey to recognize that victims of sandblasting are victims of an industrial disease .
this would enable the families of 46 workers who have already died to receive benefits and support .
the groups also say that silicosis sufferers who are still alive are in need of help .
one of them is 39-year-old mehmet basak ; doctors predict he has about a year to live .
" i am having difficulty while walking , especially when i have to climb up a hill or even stairs i am totally out of breath , i can not breathe , " basak told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey was a center for sandblasting until the ban " i used to work from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.
dust would build up all over my body , you could n't even recognize me or my co-workers until we showered . "
the clean clothes campaign says that the garment industry is getting around the turkish prohibition by shifting the work to subcontractors in developing countries ; they argue that this is immoral on health grounds .
the group - an alliance of organizations in 15 european countries - is trying to persuade jeans makers to abandon the practice altogether .
" a number of big jeans producers like levis strauss and h & m have all said they would stop sandblasting with almost immediate effect , or by the end of this year , " said wyger wentholdt from the ccc .
" there are a couple of jeans brands who have not wanted to react to our approach at all . "
wendholt warned that , after lobbying , a name and shame campaign could follow against firms that persist in using the material .

thousands have been spending their nights in airports hoping their flights will take off . fresh snowfall overnight caused further setbacks at frankfurt airport , with no planes taking off or landing on tuesday morning .
around 130 departures , and a further 130 arrivals , were canceled at germany 's biggest air terminal .
one of the airport 's three runaways was reopened , allowing the first plane of the day to land at 8:28 a.m.
brussels airport and london heathrow , the world 's busiest airport , continued to experience disruption .
it was running a reduced number of flights on tuesday .
eurostar services from london to paris and brussels had also been hit .
speed restrictions mean that fewer trains were running .
eurostar asked " all customers booked to travel before christmas to refund or exchange their tickets free of charge , if their travel is not essential . "
thousands of passengers spent monday night waiting in airports and train stations , as the countdown to christmas shortens .
airports struggle airports were experiencing a backlog of passengers after hundreds of flights were cancelled over the weekend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : december is one of the most popular times to travel at frankfurt , some 340 of the 1,340 takeoffs and landings were canceled on monday , while at london heathrow , europe 's busiest airport , a very limited service began again on monday after a weekend of almost total standstill .
many other airports opened for a few hours before closing again .
the berlin airport operators said they did not expect services to return to normal before christmas .
the german transport minister , peter ramsauer , has suggested to local authorities that they allow flights at night , in order to clear the backlog of passengers .
the british authorities have already withdrawn the ban on night-flights until december 24 , christmas eve .
trains disrupted trains around berlin were seriously delayed on monday due to heavy snowfalls in the region .
throughout the country , frozen switches led to considerable problems .
a number of trains were canceled and , among those that ran , delays of over an hour were frequent .
speed limits were introduced on high-speed tracks to prevent damage to train undercarriages from blocks of ice .
the company operating almost all of germany 's long-distance trains , deutsche bahn , continued to warn passengers that trains were likely to be very crowded .
" there are likely to be considerable bottlenecks on major lines because of the cancelation of flights , " they wrote on their website .
throughout much of europe , railways were similarly disrupted .
even in southern sweden , which is used to heavy snow , 100 of 350 train journeys were cancelled on monday .
restrictions on the roads bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting around on foot has been the only option for many people on the roads too , the weather has caused serious disruption .
the authorities imposed a travel ban on buses and trucks in paris .
in parts of germany trucks weighing more than 7.5 tons were at times banned from freeways after a series of accidents in which tractor-trailers skidded and blocked the carriageway .
in the western state of north rhine-westphalia , there were 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- of traffic jams during the monday morning rush hour .
the police have been complaining that many drivers are still using summer tires , in spite of the icy conditions .
the chief executive of the association of local authorities , gerd landsberg , told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper that , after the costs of last year 's heavy winter , local governments would have to cut back on clearing the roads .
he said drivers would have to get used to driving on snowy roads , as they do in scandinavia .
although it 's expected that the weather will warm on thursday , another cold spell is forecast in time for christmas , although it is not expected to bring much snow .

thousands have been spending their nights in airports hoping their flights will take off . fresh snowfall overnight caused further setbacks at frankfurt airport , with no planes taking off or landing on tuesday morning .
around 130 departures , and a further 130 arrivals , were canceled at germany 's biggest air terminal .
one of the airport 's three runaways was reopened , allowing the first plane of the day to land at 8:28 a.m.
brussels airport and london heathrow , the world 's busiest airport , continued to experience disruption .
it was running a reduced number of flights on tuesday .
eurostar services from london to paris and brussels had also been hit .
speed restrictions mean that fewer trains were running .
eurostar asked " all customers booked to travel before christmas to refund or exchange their tickets free of charge , if their travel is not essential . "
thousands of passengers spent monday night waiting in airports and train stations , as the countdown to christmas shortens .
airports struggle airports were experiencing a backlog of passengers after hundreds of flights were cancelled over the weekend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : december is one of the most popular times to travel at frankfurt , some 340 of the 1,340 takeoffs and landings were canceled on monday , while at london heathrow , europe 's busiest airport , a very limited service began again on monday after a weekend of almost total standstill .
many other airports opened for a few hours before closing again .
the berlin airport operators said they did not expect services to return to normal before christmas .
the german transport minister , peter ramsauer , has suggested to local authorities that they allow flights at night , in order to clear the backlog of passengers .
the british authorities have already withdrawn the ban on night-flights until december 24 , christmas eve .
trains disrupted trains around berlin were seriously delayed on monday due to heavy snowfalls in the region .
throughout the country , frozen switches led to considerable problems .
a number of trains were canceled and , among those that ran , delays of over an hour were frequent .
speed limits were introduced on high-speed tracks to prevent damage to train undercarriages from blocks of ice .
the company operating almost all of germany 's long-distance trains , deutsche bahn , continued to warn passengers that trains were likely to be very crowded .
" there are likely to be considerable bottlenecks on major lines because of the cancelation of flights , " they wrote on their website .
throughout much of europe , railways were similarly disrupted .
even in southern sweden , which is used to heavy snow , 100 of 350 train journeys were cancelled on monday .
restrictions on the roads bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting around on foot has been the only option for many people on the roads too , the weather has caused serious disruption .
the authorities imposed a travel ban on buses and trucks in paris .
in parts of germany trucks weighing more than 7.5 tons were at times banned from freeways after a series of accidents in which tractor-trailers skidded and blocked the carriageway .
in the western state of north rhine-westphalia , there were 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- of traffic jams during the monday morning rush hour .
the police have been complaining that many drivers are still using summer tires , in spite of the icy conditions .
the chief executive of the association of local authorities , gerd landsberg , told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper that , after the costs of last year 's heavy winter , local governments would have to cut back on clearing the roads .
he said drivers would have to get used to driving on snowy roads , as they do in scandinavia .
although it 's expected that the weather will warm on thursday , another cold spell is forecast in time for christmas , although it is not expected to bring much snow .

but the excitement faded fast . in the lazy midday sun , it is playtime for the children in the tribal hamlet of tembhli in india 's western state of maharashtra .
using sticks , they roll old tire tubes and stones along a concrete road .
they are excited to have such a smooth surface to play on . three months ago , this road did not exist .
but in september the otherwise sleepy hamlet saw a flurry of activity as it prepared to receive prime minister manmohan singh and congress party president sonia gandhi , who were coming to distribute the first set of unique identification -lrb- uid -rrb- cards . titled " aadhaar , " meaning support , the project aims to equip each indian citizen with biometric identification numbers based on thumbprints and iris scans .
this ambitious scheme has come under heavy criticism for several reasons , one of them being the claim by some experts that it will result in the invasion of privacy .
but the indian government has defended the project , claiming it will help poor and disadvantaged citizens avail public welfare schemes more easily .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : road construction has been left incomplete in some parts of tembhli fleeting elation after years of feeling abandoned , the villagers of tembhli were initially thrilled to be chosen for a visit by no less than the prime minister himself , but their elation did not last long . the attention bestowed on them by the government was only fleeting , says 28-year-old sunanda karma thakre , who with her husband is one of the many who usually migrate to the neighboring state of gujarat to find work . " we were about to leave for gujarat this year too , but then we heard of the prime minister ’ s visit .
we decided to stay , thinking the ministers would help us find work here .
but that did not materialize , " she points out . " if they come again , we will tell them about our troubles .
but all these government officials only came to us around the time of the pm ’ s visit .
now no one seems to be interested in listening to us .
no one has stepped into the village since then .
even the roads that were being built lie incomplete and some of us still don ’ t have electricity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunanda karma thakre is a skeptical about the new biometric uid cards lack of work opportunities drive laborers away laborers in tembhli struggle to find occasional work as farm hands in the nearby fields , which fetches them barely a euro a day .
by comparison , the state of gujarat , especially the saurashtra region , offers plenty of employment opportunities on the sugarcane plantations , cotton and groundnut-crushing factories , or on farms .
this work can fetch a laborer between two to three euros a day .
this ensures that when they return to tembhli at the beginning of monsoon , they have a decent amount saved up . while it may seem to be an advantage in terms of income , migration brings with it a host of other problems .
the migrants often leave their homes behind to live in dire conditions in gujarat , often without shelter .
on top of this , they have to uproot their families every year , taking their children out of school , causing a high dropout rate and increasing illiteracy . immediate needs have to be addressed what is important right now is to address the villagers ’ more immediate needs of employment and housing , says madi raju makkan , a member of the tembhli gram panchayat , or village council . " implementation of the national rural employment guarantee scheme should begin as soon as possible .
the government makes promises and then doesn ’ t follow up on them .
that is why the people lose all hope of getting work and leave for saurashtra .
there are many in our village with a ' below poverty line ' status , who don ’ t have proper houses to live in .
many public schemes in the village are incomplete and our village is often inundated in the monsoon floods .
we have lodged many appeals , but the government has not taken any initiatives to act on them . " bildunterschrift : many migrant workers are forced to live on the streets the unique identification -lrb- uid -rrb- cards are supposed to change matters .
villagers can seek loans and open bank accounts more easily .
officials claim the cards will help improve execution of the national rural employment guarantee scheme , although it is not yet clear how this will work . it may be too soon to tell whether these cards will make a difference .
however , as the initial hype and excitement fades away , there is increasing disillusionment among the people of tembhli as they realize that while the uid card is a much needed proof of identity , it will not give them what they want most of all – a chance to earn a better living . author : pia chandavarkar -lrb- tembhli -rrb- editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an increasing number of holidaymakers are opting for eco-tourism which aims to protect travel destinations and their natural surroundings . it 's a scene emblematic of global mass tourism .
at 8 in the morning , the early risers have already spread out their towels on the sun loungers by the pool .
by 11 , the first jug of sangria has been ordered and the all-you-can-eat buffet is getting ready to open . and even though the hotel is on the sunny spanish island of mallorca , the staff all speak german , and are ready to cater to the every need of holidaymakers who 've spent 287 euros -lrb- $ 378 -rrb- a head for a week-long package tour , flights and cocktails included .
it might seem like a low-cost way of escaping the grim german winter , but the environmental cost is high .
mass tourism often takes a heavy toll on nature .
on the island of mallorca , the consequences of five decades of unchecked tourism include a water shortage and a concrete jungle along the coastline .
even the once unspoilt beaches of the balearic island are now lined with yacht harbors .
traveling with a good conscience bildunterschrift : mallorca is no longer an insider tip but the situation does n't need to get any worse .
the alternative to mass tourism is ‘ soft ' or green tourism – also known as environmentally-friendly tourism , gentle tourism , sustainable tourism and ecotourism .
essentially , the aim is to leave travel destinations unspoiled or unchanged by tourism . " ecotourism is a responsible form of travel that contributes to environmental protection and the wellbeing of local communities , ” explains ayako ezaki from the international ecotourism society -lrb- ties -rrb- .
" both the environment and the populations visited should benefit in cultural , economic and environmental terms from tourism . "
so , why is n't everyone doing it ?
mainly , because ecotourism is considerably more expensive than a package trip – and to many , snagging a bargain still matters more than having a clear conscience .
responsible travel is a concept that has yet to sink in on a broader scale , despite the galloping pace of climate change .

with more than $ 1.3 trillion of assets , pimco is one of the world 's largest bond investment firms .
the company , based in newport beach , california , is owned by germany 's allianz group .
bosomworth said if the three nations reverted to their own currencies , they would be able to sell their products abroad more competitively and use export revenues to drive further economic growth and repay their heavy debt loads .
investor confidence once economic growth and investor confidence returned to the countries , they could reintegrate into the single currency area , he added .
the idea of countries leaving the eurozone has been making the rounds ever since the greek debt crisis emerged with news that the country 's financial situation was far worse than previously acknowledged .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal could become the next eurozone rescue candidate many experts argue , however , that such a move would lead to massive costs that would ultimately undermine economic performance .
the two rescue packages for greece and ireland and the possibility of portugal and even spain becoming the next bailout candidates have found eurozone countries scrambling to save the common currency in the long term .
help from partners on thursday , european union leaders agreed on a change in the bloc 's rule-book , the lisbon treaty , clearing the way for a permanent rescue fund for crisis-hit eurozone countries from mid-2013 .
bosomworth believes that belgium , italy and spain will be able to get over their own debt problems while remaining inside the eurozone - but only with substantial help from partners .

an increasing number of holidaymakers are opting for eco-tourism which aims to protect travel destinations and their natural surroundings . it 's a scene emblematic of global mass tourism .

it might seem like a low-cost way of escaping the grim german winter , but the environmental cost is high .
mass tourism often takes a heavy toll on nature .
on the island of mallorca , the consequences of five decades of unchecked tourism include a water shortage and a concrete jungle along the coastline .
even the once unspoilt beaches of the balearic island are now lined with yacht harbors .
traveling with a good conscience bildunterschrift : mallorca is no longer an insider tip but the situation does n't need to get any worse .
the alternative to mass tourism is ‘ soft ' or green tourism – also known as environmentally-friendly tourism , gentle tourism , sustainable tourism and ecotourism .
essentially , the aim is to leave travel destinations unspoiled or unchanged by tourism . " ecotourism is a responsible form of travel that contributes to environmental protection and the wellbeing of local communities , ” explains ayako ezaki from the international ecotourism society -lrb- ties -rrb- .
" both the environment and the populations visited should benefit in cultural , economic and environmental terms from tourism . "
so , why is n't everyone doing it ?
mainly , because ecotourism is considerably more expensive than a package trip – and to many , snagging a bargain still matters more than having a clear conscience .
responsible travel is a concept that has yet to sink in on a broader scale , despite the galloping pace of climate change .
not so very long ago , international travel was prohibitively costly , so only a privileged few could afford to see the world .

while in goethe 's day , singing was an integral part of life in germany , the collective choir of the nation has since fallen rather silent .
christmas can go some way to restarting a passion . rudolph tiersch grew up in a world of song .
when he was a child , friends would come and visit his family on sundays and would sit in the kitchen , drink tea , chat and laugh .
as televisions were still a rarity in those days , it was only ever a matter of time before someone would pick up a guitar and the assembled company would burst into song .
for tiersch , who is now 50 years old , they are happy memories .
and not only for what they were , but for what he describes as their ability to unite people .
" it brings people together and gives them a home singing about their religion or their country , " tiersch told deutsche welle .
" chanting is the simplest way to bring people together .
you always have a voice with you .
not everyone can play the guitar or the piano , but everyone can sing . "
a long healthy tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinmar the minnesinger the basic german volkslied has its roots in the 12th century , which gave birth to minnesingers , who largely sung of love .
over time , the songs came to deal with other important issues such as religion , social conditions , and the soul of the people .
by the 19th century it had been turned into an art form , laden with bourgeois expression .
when the nazis seized power in 1933 , they used the national tradition of folk to promote what they claimed to be pure and german .
they wrote new songs to the tune of national socialism , successfully using them as instruments for manipulation and propaganda .
once the war was over , the east german communist regime continued to manipulate the masses through music , as tiersch recalls .
" i recall a song called unsere heimat which poetically describes the beauty of the country set to a lyrical melody , " he said .
" the underlying message was that socialism made it possible . "
from passion to profession although much in germany has changed in the twenty years since reunification , too many decades of state-decreed singing appears to have robbed many people of their lust for letting it all out .
not so tiersch , whose love of song is so profound that he is a professional choirmaster .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the frankfurt / oder singing academy he is the head of the singakademie in the eastern german town of frankfurt / oder , which comprises a children 's , a youth , a concert and a chamber-choir .
the choirmaster has been awarded germany 's federal cross of merit for his efforts to bring singing back into everyday life .
he says he sees his choirs as a social network .
" it 's like a little society inside society , " the choirmaster said .
" you 've got the judge on that side and the salesman there , but they sing together , they 're talking together , maybe they drink beer together . "
seeing a mixed bag of people united through song pleases tiersch greatly , and as choir member antonia brill explains , there are plenty of benefits to being part of a group with music at its core .
" it helps you .
when you 're sad , you think about moments when you sang together with everyone and it feels good , or when you 're singing on your own at home , you feel better , " the 19-year-old said .
re-igniting the fire but antonia is not necessarily the rule .
rudolph tiersch says it is becoming increasingly difficult to encourage young germans to sing , a state of affairs which he finds alarming .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when better to sing than at christmas ?
" it has been scientifically proven that singing activates parts of the brain which otherwise lie idle , " he said .
" children who hear their parents sing before they are three years old are better at school than their classmates who have only consumed music in the media . "
he believes the over-emphasis of individual freedom in society as we know it today often leads to social isolation , and is keen to point out the sense of community which comes from singing together .
particularly at this time of year .
" christmas is becoming more and more commercial in germany , too , " he said .
" with prosperity we are moving away from the religious traditions which are part of every society .
but christmas singing takes us back to our roots . "
and to prove his point , he has his singers working on bach 's christmas oratorio , which he explains is all about bringing love into the world .
as his singing academy is based in the former gdr , where the state opposed the church , many of his choir members are not familiar with the religious concepts which the music conveys .
to set that right , they discuss the work as a group , the aim always being to give the audience goose-bumps .
" if we do n't , we 've done something wrong , " the choirmaster said .

jonathan tourtellot from the national geographic center for sustainable destinations attributes the trend to increased awareness of environmental issues and the need to curb climate change .

one hotel on the island kho khao in thailnd has done just that .
the kho khao beach resort now meets most of its energy needs through a combination of solar and wind power units .
the hotel owners hope to cut the island 's carbon emissions by 20 percent , and in the long run , they hope that kho khao will provide a model for sustainable tourism in thailand .

" these days it is often cited as an opportunity for growth in developing nations , but that does n't mean it does n't exist in the richer nations . ”
the national geographic center for sustainable destinations , for example , is currently working on an initiative in the douro valley in portugal to promote gentle tourism .

an increasing number of holidaymakers are opting for eco-tourism which aims to protect travel destinations and their natural surroundings . it 's a scene emblematic of global mass tourism .
at 8 in the morning , the early risers have already spread out their towels on the sun loungers by the pool .
by 11 , the first jug of sangria has been ordered and the all-you-can-eat buffet is getting ready to open . and even though the hotel is on the sunny spanish island of mallorca , the staff all speak german , and are ready to cater to the every need of holidaymakers who 've spent 287 euros -lrb- $ 378 -rrb- a head for a week-long package tour , flights and cocktails included .
it might seem like a low-cost way of escaping the grim german winter , but the environmental cost is high .
mass tourism often takes a heavy toll on nature .
on the island of mallorca , the consequences of five decades of unchecked tourism include a water shortage and a concrete jungle along the coastline .
even the once unspoilt beaches of the balearic island are now lined with yacht harbors .
traveling with a good conscience bildunterschrift : mallorca is no longer an insider tip but the situation does n't need to get any worse .
the alternative to mass tourism is ‘ soft ' or green tourism – also known as environmentally-friendly tourism , gentle tourism , sustainable tourism and ecotourism .
essentially , the aim is to leave travel destinations unspoiled or unchanged by tourism . " ecotourism is a responsible form of travel that contributes to environmental protection and the wellbeing of local communities , ” explains ayako ezaki from the international ecotourism society -lrb- ties -rrb- .
" both the environment and the populations visited should benefit in cultural , economic and environmental terms from tourism . "
so , why is n't everyone doing it ?
mainly , because ecotourism is considerably more expensive than a package trip – and to many , snagging a bargain still matters more than having a clear conscience .
responsible travel is a concept that has yet to sink in on a broader scale , despite the galloping pace of climate change .
not so very long ago , international travel was prohibitively costly , so only a privileged few could afford to see the world .
but recent decades have seen low-cost tourism boom – at least for the developed world .
some 900 million people a year take advantage of no-frills travel options every year , and the knock-on effect is a rapid rise in co2 levels .

with more than $ 1.3 trillion of assets , pimco is one of the world 's largest bond investment firms .
the company , based in newport beach , california , is owned by germany 's allianz group .
bosomworth said if the three nations reverted to their own currencies , they would be able to sell their products abroad more competitively and use export revenues to drive further economic growth and repay their heavy debt loads .
investor confidence once economic growth and investor confidence returned to the countries , they could reintegrate into the single currency area , he added .
the idea of countries leaving the eurozone has been making the rounds ever since the greek debt crisis emerged with news that the country 's financial situation was far worse than previously acknowledged .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal could become the next eurozone rescue candidate many experts argue , however , that such a move would lead to massive costs that would ultimately undermine economic performance .
the two rescue packages for greece and ireland and the possibility of portugal and even spain becoming the next bailout candidates have found eurozone countries scrambling to save the common currency in the long term .
help from partners on thursday , european union leaders agreed on a change in the bloc 's rule-book , the lisbon treaty , clearing the way for a permanent rescue fund for crisis-hit eurozone countries from mid-2013 .
bosomworth believes that belgium , italy and spain will be able to get over their own debt problems while remaining inside the eurozone - but only with substantial help from partners .

in turkey , where the practice is now banned , thousands of ex-workers are thought to be suffering . consumers looking for a pair of jeans with that special worn look might want to check the label , according to campaigners .
the clean clothes campaign -lrb- ccc -rrb- is calling for a global ban on the practice of sandblasting , in which denim is sprayed with sand at high pressure to give the material a distressed look .
sandblasting is associated with the disease silicosis - a lung disease caused by fine particles of sand thrown into the air during the process .
turkey was a major producer of sandblasted garments before a ban on the process was implemented in 2009 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sandblasted jeans are popular on the high street around 10,000 people have been employed in sandblasting , according to yesim yasin , from the istanbul-based solidarity committee of sandblasting laborers .
" unfortunately many studies reveal the fact that almost 50 percent of the total number of employees are expected to contract this disease , silicosis , " yasin said .
" silicosis has always been and still is incurable .
the workers are sick , but as they have worked in the informal sector they have no basic legal rights . "
effort to persuade big firms the committee and the ccc have started a campaign for turkey to recognize that victims of sandblasting are victims of an industrial disease .
this would enable the families of 46 workers who have already died to receive benefits and support .
the groups also say that silicosis sufferers who are still alive are in need of help .
one of them is 39-year-old mehmet basak ; doctors predict he has about a year to live .
" i am having difficulty while walking , especially when i have to climb up a hill or even stairs i am totally out of breath , i can not breathe , " basak told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey was a center for sandblasting until the ban " i used to work from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.
dust would build up all over my body , you could n't even recognize me or my co-workers until we showered . "
the clean clothes campaign says that the garment industry is getting around the turkish prohibition by shifting the work to subcontractors in developing countries ; they argue that this is immoral on health grounds .
the group - an alliance of organizations in 15 european countries - is trying to persuade jeans makers to abandon the practice altogether .
" a number of big jeans producers like levis strauss and h & m have all said they would stop sandblasting with almost immediate effect , or by the end of this year , " said wyger wentholdt from the ccc .
" there are a couple of jeans brands who have not wanted to react to our approach at all . "
wendholt warned that , after lobbying , a name and shame campaign could follow against firms that persist in using the material .

thousands have been spending their nights in airports hoping their flights will take off . fresh snowfall overnight caused further setbacks at frankfurt airport , with no planes taking off or landing on tuesday morning .
around 130 departures , and a further 130 arrivals , were canceled at germany 's biggest air terminal .
one of the airport 's three runaways was reopened , allowing the first plane of the day to land at 8:28 a.m.
brussels airport and london heathrow , the world 's busiest airport , continued to experience disruption .
it was running a reduced number of flights on tuesday .
eurostar services from london to paris and brussels had also been hit .
speed restrictions mean that fewer trains were running .
eurostar asked " all customers booked to travel before christmas to refund or exchange their tickets free of charge , if their travel is not essential . "
thousands of passengers spent monday night waiting in airports and train stations , as the countdown to christmas shortens .
airports struggle airports were experiencing a backlog of passengers after hundreds of flights were cancelled over the weekend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : december is one of the most popular times to travel at frankfurt , some 340 of the 1,340 takeoffs and landings were canceled on monday , while at london heathrow , europe 's busiest airport , a very limited service began again on monday after a weekend of almost total standstill .
many other airports opened for a few hours before closing again .
the berlin airport operators said they did not expect services to return to normal before christmas .
the german transport minister , peter ramsauer , has suggested to local authorities that they allow flights at night , in order to clear the backlog of passengers .
the british authorities have already withdrawn the ban on night-flights until december 24 , christmas eve .
trains disrupted trains around berlin were seriously delayed on monday due to heavy snowfalls in the region .
throughout the country , frozen switches led to considerable problems .
a number of trains were canceled and , among those that ran , delays of over an hour were frequent .
speed limits were introduced on high-speed tracks to prevent damage to train undercarriages from blocks of ice .
the company operating almost all of germany 's long-distance trains , deutsche bahn , continued to warn passengers that trains were likely to be very crowded .
" there are likely to be considerable bottlenecks on major lines because of the cancelation of flights , " they wrote on their website .
throughout much of europe , railways were similarly disrupted .
even in southern sweden , which is used to heavy snow , 100 of 350 train journeys were cancelled on monday .
restrictions on the roads bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting around on foot has been the only option for many people on the roads too , the weather has caused serious disruption .
the authorities imposed a travel ban on buses and trucks in paris .
in parts of germany trucks weighing more than 7.5 tons were at times banned from freeways after a series of accidents in which tractor-trailers skidded and blocked the carriageway .
in the western state of north rhine-westphalia , there were 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- of traffic jams during the monday morning rush hour .
the police have been complaining that many drivers are still using summer tires , in spite of the icy conditions .
the chief executive of the association of local authorities , gerd landsberg , told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper that , after the costs of last year 's heavy winter , local governments would have to cut back on clearing the roads .
he said drivers would have to get used to driving on snowy roads , as they do in scandinavia .
although it 's expected that the weather will warm on thursday , another cold spell is forecast in time for christmas , although it is not expected to bring much snow .

while in goethe 's day , singing was an integral part of life in germany , the collective choir of the nation has since fallen rather silent .
christmas can go some way to restarting a passion . rudolph tiersch grew up in a world of song .
when he was a child , friends would come and visit his family on sundays and would sit in the kitchen , drink tea , chat and laugh .
as televisions were still a rarity in those days , it was only ever a matter of time before someone would pick up a guitar and the assembled company would burst into song .
for tiersch , who is now 50 years old , they are happy memories .
and not only for what they were , but for what he describes as their ability to unite people .
" it brings people together and gives them a home singing about their religion or their country , " tiersch told deutsche welle .
" chanting is the simplest way to bring people together .

a long healthy tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinmar the minnesinger the basic german volkslied has its roots in the 12th century , which gave birth to minnesingers , who largely sung of love .
over time , the songs came to deal with other important issues such as religion , social conditions , and the soul of the people .
by the 19th century it had been turned into an art form , laden with bourgeois expression .
when the nazis seized power in 1933 , they used the national tradition of folk to promote what they claimed to be pure and german .
they wrote new songs to the tune of national socialism , successfully using them as instruments for manipulation and propaganda .
once the war was over , the east german communist regime continued to manipulate the masses through music , as tiersch recalls .

" the underlying message was that socialism made it possible . "
from passion to profession although much in germany has changed in the twenty years since reunification , too many decades of state-decreed singing appears to have robbed many people of their lust for letting it all out .

" it helps you .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 21.12.2010 dortmund dominate the bundesliga best 11 of 2010 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a whole lot of these guys made our best-of list christmas is usually a time of acrimony at deutsche welle sports , as we argue about who should make our top xi .
this year , the only fights were over how many dortmund players we could include . nick , ben and jefferson are all great admirers of what juergen klopp has done at dortmund , but matt has obviously come down with a serious case of yellow-and-black fever .
left to his own devices , he would have included no fewer than eight dortmund players in his top 11 .
in the end , the rest of us applied the restraints -lrb- that is , we tied him to his bed -rrb- , so that a few players from other teams got the credit they deserved as well .
we begin with a pair of excellent african strikers .
bildunterschrift : cisse has carried a huge load for freiburg fantastic forwards one player we all agreed on , even matt , was freiburg 's papiss demba cisse .
with his 13 goals , the senegalese striker has the small southwestern german club sniffing the rarefied air at seldom experienced elevations in the table .
matt put it best : " cisse is from another planet - one where one man is enough to propel a team like freiburg up to sixth . "
not shabby for a player who came from the french second division .
chapeau !
on numbers alone , frankfurt 's theofanis gekas would have been a logical choice , but we all felt that he has gotten a number of lucky goals .
matt wanted dortmund 's lukas barrios , while nick preferred schalke 's klaas-jan huntelaar , but jefferson and ben went for didier ya konan .
how important is he to hanover ?
consider this .
since he joined the club in 2009 , hanover have n't earned a single point with him out of the starting line-up .
that 's truly a most valuable player .
majestic midfield no arguments at all about where to start in midfield : dortmund 's nuri sahin and shinji kagawa .
but what can be said about this dynamic duo that has n't been said thousands of times before ?
well how about this ?
sahin is the smartest player in german football .
to watch him is to see a player who seems to know exactly what 's happening in all areas of the pitch at all times .
that 's the definition of a rudder , and you can bet lots of huge european clubs will be vying for his services in the summer .
there 's room for improvement , though - from the spot .
sahin failed to convert the two penalties he took this season , about the only thing he did wrong in the latter half of 2010 .
moving on to kagawa , the three things most often mentioned are 1 -rrb- he 's from japan , 2 -rrb- he only cost 300,000 euros and 3 -rrb- he runs around a lot .
that 's all true but being japanese and cheap hardly guarantees footballing success , and lots of players run around lots without posting eight goals as he has .
what 's often neglected is his fantastic on-the-ball technique .
when he cuts into the middle of the pitch , the only player who 's more dangerous from medium range is arjen robben .
bildunterschrift : this man 's spectacular goals have fans saying " play it again , sam " matt went purely dortmund for the rest of midfield , but the aesthetes among us agreed that we just had to have leverkusen 's sidney sam .
it 's not just that the 22-year-old sam has scored six goals - it 's the way he 's scored them .
for example , his 20-meter-plus volley against kaiserslautern .
or his curling left-footer against hoffenheim .
or ... oh , just go to youtube , and check them out for yourselves .
he 's joined by teammate arturo vidal . six of his eight goals may have come on penalties , but nerves count in football , and the chilean converted all his attempts .
and they were n't meaningless ones either .
they resulted in seven points .
vidal is a main reason perennial unstable leverkusen are playing with consistency and are the only team with a slight chance of overtaking dortmund .
dependable defenders and one great goalkeeper dortmund have by far and away the best defense in the league , so it 's no surprise that mats hummels and marcel schmelzer were unanimous choices .
bildunterschrift : it 's been mighty hard getting by hummels hummels is quite simply the best defender at the moment in germany .
bayern 's uli hoeness is man of few regrets , but he surely must rue the decision to let hummels go in 2008 .
-lrb- there are rumors , terrifying to dortmund fans , that there 's a buy-back clause in the defender 's contract . -rrb-
schmelzer , meanwhile , makes the squad because he excels at the position , left back , that most teams struggle to fill .
his ability to get forward make dortmund ambidextrous , so to speak , and that 's one reason why only two teams this season succeeded in stopping them .
bildunterschrift : the new lahm is an ochs at right back , you could pencil in philipp lahm most years , but this time round the honors go to frankfurt 's captain patrick ochs .
never heard of him ?
you 're not alone , but for years now he 's been one of the bundesliga 's best value-for-money players , equally adapt at protecting the back and going forward .
he 's also versatile , sometimes moving up to midfield , and dependable , having played all but a handful of minutes in frankfurt 's matches .
the other central defender was the trickiest .
nick and matt were in the majority , preferring dortmund 's neven subotic , and ben had the funniest argument for hanover 's emanuel pogatetz : " no team should be without a mad austrian bastard . "
but jefferson intervened , dictatorially , because he felt someone from mainz had to be included .
and since mainz coach thomas tuchel rotates all other positions , that man had to be their captain nikolce noveski .
the 31-year-old noveski has n't missed a single minute , and while lewis holtby and andre schuerrle have grabbed the press attention , mainz have the second-best defense in the league - and the second-best spot in the standings .
last but by no means least , there 's schalke 's manuel neuer .
a homegrown product , he kept the royal blues within striking distance during their horrid start - without him , schalke would almost certainly be in the relegation zone .
and his first-half performance in schalke 's 2-0 win over bayern was truly heroic , as he turned away shot after shot .
best goalkeeper in germany ?
no question about that - even dortmund-phile matt put him on the list .
best goalkeeper in the world ?
maybe .
and that 's a mark of just how good our bundesliga top xi is at the back .

he 's also versatile , sometimes moving up to midfield , and dependable , having played all but a handful of minutes in frankfurt 's matches .
the other central defender was the trickiest .
nick and matt were in the majority , preferring dortmund 's neven subotic , and ben had the funniest argument for hanover 's emanuel pogatetz : " no team should be without a mad austrian bastard . "
but jefferson intervened , dictatorially , because he felt someone from mainz had to be included .
and since mainz coach thomas tuchel rotates all other positions , that man had to be their captain nikolce noveski .
the 31-year-old noveski has n't missed a single minute , and while lewis holtby and andre schuerrle have grabbed the press attention , mainz have the second-best defense in the league - and the second-best spot in the standings .
last but by no means least , there 's schalke 's manuel neuer .
a homegrown product , he kept the royal blues within striking distance during their horrid start - without him , schalke would almost certainly be in the relegation zone .
and his first-half performance in schalke 's 2-0 win over bayern was truly heroic , as he turned away shot after shot .
best goalkeeper in germany ?
no question about that - even dortmund-phile matt put him on the list .
best goalkeeper in the world ?
maybe .
and that 's a mark of just how good our bundesliga top xi is at the back .

this year , the only fights were over how many dortmund players we could include . nick , ben and jefferson are all great admirers of what juergen klopp has done at dortmund , but matt has obviously come down with a serious case of yellow-and-black fever .
left to his own devices , he would have included no fewer than eight dortmund players in his top 11 .
in the end , the rest of us applied the restraints -lrb- that is , we tied him to his bed -rrb- , so that a few players from other teams got the credit they deserved as well .
we begin with a pair of excellent african strikers .
bildunterschrift : cisse has carried a huge load for freiburg fantastic forwards one player we all agreed on , even matt , was freiburg 's papiss demba cisse .
with his 13 goals , the senegalese striker has the small southwestern german club sniffing the rarefied air at seldom experienced elevations in the table .
matt put it best : " cisse is from another planet - one where one man is enough to propel a team like freiburg up to sixth . "
not shabby for a player who came from the french second division .
chapeau !
on numbers alone , frankfurt 's theofanis gekas would have been a logical choice , but we all felt that he has gotten a number of lucky goals .
matt wanted dortmund 's lukas barrios , while nick preferred schalke 's klaas-jan huntelaar , but jefferson and ben went for didier ya konan .
how important is he to hanover ?
consider this .
since he joined the club in 2009 , hanover have n't earned a single point with him out of the starting line-up .
that 's truly a most valuable player .
majestic midfield no arguments at all about where to start in midfield : dortmund 's nuri sahin and shinji kagawa .
but what can be said about this dynamic duo that has n't been said thousands of times before ?
well how about this ?
sahin is the smartest player in german football .
to watch him is to see a player who seems to know exactly what 's happening in all areas of the pitch at all times .
that 's the definition of a rudder , and you can bet lots of huge european clubs will be vying for his services in the summer .
there 's room for improvement , though - from the spot .
sahin failed to convert the two penalties he took this season , about the only thing he did wrong in the latter half of 2010 .
moving on to kagawa , the three things most often mentioned are 1 -rrb- he 's from japan , 2 -rrb- he only cost 300,000 euros and 3 -rrb- he runs around a lot .
that 's all true but being japanese and cheap hardly guarantees footballing success , and lots of players run around lots without posting eight goals as he has .
what 's often neglected is his fantastic on-the-ball technique .
when he cuts into the middle of the pitch , the only player who 's more dangerous from medium range is arjen robben .
bildunterschrift : this man 's spectacular goals have fans saying " play it again , sam " matt went purely dortmund for the rest of midfield , but the aesthetes among us agreed that we just had to have leverkusen 's sidney sam .
it 's not just that the 22-year-old sam has scored six goals - it 's the way he 's scored them .
for example , his 20-meter-plus volley against kaiserslautern .
or his curling left-footer against hoffenheim .
or ... oh , just go to youtube , and check them out for yourselves .
he 's joined by teammate arturo vidal . six of his eight goals may have come on penalties , but nerves count in football , and the chilean converted all his attempts .
and they were n't meaningless ones either .
they resulted in seven points .
vidal is a main reason perennial unstable leverkusen are playing with consistency and are the only team with a slight chance of overtaking dortmund .
dependable defenders and one great goalkeeper dortmund have by far and away the best defense in the league , so it 's no surprise that mats hummels and marcel schmelzer were unanimous choices .
bildunterschrift : it 's been mighty hard getting by hummels hummels is quite simply the best defender at the moment in germany .
bayern 's uli hoeness is man of few regrets , but he surely must rue the decision to let hummels go in 2008 .
-lrb- there are rumors , terrifying to dortmund fans , that there 's a buy-back clause in the defender 's contract . -rrb-
schmelzer , meanwhile , makes the squad because he excels at the position , left back , that most teams struggle to fill .
his ability to get forward make dortmund ambidextrous , so to speak , and that 's one reason why only two teams this season succeeded in stopping them .
bildunterschrift : the new lahm is an ochs at right back , you could pencil in philipp lahm most years , but this time round the honors go to frankfurt 's captain patrick ochs .
never heard of him ?
you 're not alone , but for years now he 's been one of the bundesliga 's best value-for-money players , equally adapt at protecting the back and going forward .
he 's also versatile , sometimes moving up to midfield , and dependable , having played all but a handful of minutes in frankfurt 's matches .

and since mainz coach thomas tuchel rotates all other positions , that man had to be their captain nikolce noveski .
the 31-year-old noveski has n't missed a single minute , and while lewis holtby and andre schuerrle have grabbed the press attention , mainz have the second-best defense in the league - and the second-best spot in the standings .

a number of cabinet posts will remain unfilled , pending further appraisal of the candidates .
parliamentarians also voted for a government program which aims to attract more foreign investment and fight terrorism .
al-maliki 's rival and former premier , iyad allawi , who narrowly won the election in march but was unable to form a government , said he would support the new government .
" we wish and we hope for this government to succeed in meeting the people 's requirements , " he said .
us president barack obama welcomed the formation of a new government , describing it as a " significant " historic moment .
" today 's vote in the council of representatives is a significant moment in iraq 's history and a major step forward in advancing national unity , " he said in a written statement .
he added that the us would continue its partnership with iraq and help to build a peaceful nation " that is fully integrated into the region and the international community . "
britain also hailed the deal , with foreign secretary william hague saying it would allow the new government to tackle the country 's problems .
" this will reinforce stability and allow iraq 's political leaders to work together for the benefit of their country and people . "

while in goethe 's day , singing was an integral part of life in germany , the collective choir of the nation has since fallen rather silent .
christmas can go some way to restarting a passion . rudolph tiersch grew up in a world of song .
when he was a child , friends would come and visit his family on sundays and would sit in the kitchen , drink tea , chat and laugh .
as televisions were still a rarity in those days , it was only ever a matter of time before someone would pick up a guitar and the assembled company would burst into song .
for tiersch , who is now 50 years old , they are happy memories .
and not only for what they were , but for what he describes as their ability to unite people .
" it brings people together and gives them a home singing about their religion or their country , " tiersch told deutsche welle .
" chanting is the simplest way to bring people together .
you always have a voice with you .
not everyone can play the guitar or the piano , but everyone can sing . "
a long healthy tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinmar the minnesinger the basic german volkslied has its roots in the 12th century , which gave birth to minnesingers , who largely sung of love .
over time , the songs came to deal with other important issues such as religion , social conditions , and the soul of the people .
by the 19th century it had been turned into an art form , laden with bourgeois expression .
when the nazis seized power in 1933 , they used the national tradition of folk to promote what they claimed to be pure and german .
they wrote new songs to the tune of national socialism , successfully using them as instruments for manipulation and propaganda .
once the war was over , the east german communist regime continued to manipulate the masses through music , as tiersch recalls .
" i recall a song called unsere heimat which poetically describes the beauty of the country set to a lyrical melody , " he said .
" the underlying message was that socialism made it possible . "
from passion to profession although much in germany has changed in the twenty years since reunification , too many decades of state-decreed singing appears to have robbed many people of their lust for letting it all out .
not so tiersch , whose love of song is so profound that he is a professional choirmaster .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the frankfurt / oder singing academy he is the head of the singakademie in the eastern german town of frankfurt / oder , which comprises a children 's , a youth , a concert and a chamber-choir .
the choirmaster has been awarded germany 's federal cross of merit for his efforts to bring singing back into everyday life .
he says he sees his choirs as a social network .
" it 's like a little society inside society , " the choirmaster said .
" you 've got the judge on that side and the salesman there , but they sing together , they 're talking together , maybe they drink beer together . "
seeing a mixed bag of people united through song pleases tiersch greatly , and as choir member antonia brill explains , there are plenty of benefits to being part of a group with music at its core .
" it helps you .
when you 're sad , you think about moments when you sang together with everyone and it feels good , or when you 're singing on your own at home , you feel better , " the 19-year-old said .
re-igniting the fire but antonia is not necessarily the rule .
rudolph tiersch says it is becoming increasingly difficult to encourage young germans to sing , a state of affairs which he finds alarming .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when better to sing than at christmas ?
" it has been scientifically proven that singing activates parts of the brain which otherwise lie idle , " he said .
" children who hear their parents sing before they are three years old are better at school than their classmates who have only consumed music in the media . "
he believes the over-emphasis of individual freedom in society as we know it today often leads to social isolation , and is keen to point out the sense of community which comes from singing together .
particularly at this time of year .
" christmas is becoming more and more commercial in germany , too , " he said .
" with prosperity we are moving away from the religious traditions which are part of every society .
but christmas singing takes us back to our roots . "
and to prove his point , he has his singers working on bach 's christmas oratorio , which he explains is all about bringing love into the world .
as his singing academy is based in the former gdr , where the state opposed the church , many of his choir members are not familiar with the religious concepts which the music conveys .
to set that right , they discuss the work as a group , the aim always being to give the audience goose-bumps .
" if we do n't , we 've done something wrong , " the choirmaster said .

he told monday 's berliner zeitung newspaper , " the welfare of the child must be the first consideration .
it 's not so much an issue of whether the adults want to live as a happy family .
i do n't believe that children want to grow up in a homosexual partnership . "
uta kehr , spokeswoman for the association of lesbians and gays in germany , said that kauder was encouraging prejudices against homosexual parents who care for children .
but worse still was the fact that he was humiliating homosexual parents in the eyes of their children .
" how will the 15-year-old son of a lesbian couple feel , for example , if he reads such things in the paper ? " she said .
children in " rainbow " families just as happy her position was backed up by leaders of the green party , who also pointed out that the german ministry for family affairs had recently published a study showing children who lived in so-called " rainbow " families felt just as well-looked-after and were just as successful as children of the same age in conventional families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker kauder has met with sharp criticism for his remarks kauder made his comment in remarks on pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- , a procedure which allows genetic control of artificially inseminated embryos before they are placed in the mother 's womb .
the german parliament is to have a free vote on proposals to allow highly restricted access to pgd in cases where there are good grounds to fear that the unborn child could suffer from a serious genetic disease .
kauder argued in the interview that " pgd opens the door to the temptation to select and manipulate life . "
but , he said , there was no " right to a child . "

" it brings people together and gives them a home singing about their religion or their country , " tiersch told deutsche welle .
" chanting is the simplest way to bring people together .
you always have a voice with you .
not everyone can play the guitar or the piano , but everyone can sing . "
a long healthy tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinmar the minnesinger the basic german volkslied has its roots in the 12th century , which gave birth to minnesingers , who largely sung of love .
over time , the songs came to deal with other important issues such as religion , social conditions , and the soul of the people .
by the 19th century it had been turned into an art form , laden with bourgeois expression .
when the nazis seized power in 1933 , they used the national tradition of folk to promote what they claimed to be pure and german .
they wrote new songs to the tune of national socialism , successfully using them as instruments for manipulation and propaganda .
once the war was over , the east german communist regime continued to manipulate the masses through music , as tiersch recalls .
" i recall a song called unsere heimat which poetically describes the beauty of the country set to a lyrical melody , " he said .
" the underlying message was that socialism made it possible . "
from passion to profession although much in germany has changed in the twenty years since reunification , too many decades of state-decreed singing appears to have robbed many people of their lust for letting it all out .
not so tiersch , whose love of song is so profound that he is a professional choirmaster .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the frankfurt / oder singing academy he is the head of the singakademie in the eastern german town of frankfurt / oder , which comprises a children 's , a youth , a concert and a chamber-choir .
the choirmaster has been awarded germany 's federal cross of merit for his efforts to bring singing back into everyday life .
he says he sees his choirs as a social network .
" it 's like a little society inside society , " the choirmaster said .
" you 've got the judge on that side and the salesman there , but they sing together , they 're talking together , maybe they drink beer together . "
seeing a mixed bag of people united through song pleases tiersch greatly , and as choir member antonia brill explains , there are plenty of benefits to being part of a group with music at its core .
" it helps you .
when you 're sad , you think about moments when you sang together with everyone and it feels good , or when you 're singing on your own at home , you feel better , " the 19-year-old said .
re-igniting the fire but antonia is not necessarily the rule .
rudolph tiersch says it is becoming increasingly difficult to encourage young germans to sing , a state of affairs which he finds alarming .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when better to sing than at christmas ?
" it has been scientifically proven that singing activates parts of the brain which otherwise lie idle , " he said .
" children who hear their parents sing before they are three years old are better at school than their classmates who have only consumed music in the media . "
he believes the over-emphasis of individual freedom in society as we know it today often leads to social isolation , and is keen to point out the sense of community which comes from singing together .
particularly at this time of year .
" christmas is becoming more and more commercial in germany , too , " he said .
" with prosperity we are moving away from the religious traditions which are part of every society .
but christmas singing takes us back to our roots . "
and to prove his point , he has his singers working on bach 's christmas oratorio , which he explains is all about bringing love into the world .
as his singing academy is based in the former gdr , where the state opposed the church , many of his choir members are not familiar with the religious concepts which the music conveys .
to set that right , they discuss the work as a group , the aim always being to give the audience goose-bumps .
" if we do n't , we 've done something wrong , " the choirmaster said .

in turkey , where the practice is now banned , thousands of ex-workers are thought to be suffering . consumers looking for a pair of jeans with that special worn look might want to check the label , according to campaigners .
the clean clothes campaign -lrb- ccc -rrb- is calling for a global ban on the practice of sandblasting , in which denim is sprayed with sand at high pressure to give the material a distressed look .
sandblasting is associated with the disease silicosis - a lung disease caused by fine particles of sand thrown into the air during the process .
turkey was a major producer of sandblasted garments before a ban on the process was implemented in 2009 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sandblasted jeans are popular on the high street around 10,000 people have been employed in sandblasting , according to yesim yasin , from the istanbul-based solidarity committee of sandblasting laborers .
" unfortunately many studies reveal the fact that almost 50 percent of the total number of employees are expected to contract this disease , silicosis , " yasin said .
" silicosis has always been and still is incurable .
the workers are sick , but as they have worked in the informal sector they have no basic legal rights . "
effort to persuade big firms the committee and the ccc have started a campaign for turkey to recognize that victims of sandblasting are victims of an industrial disease .
this would enable the families of 46 workers who have already died to receive benefits and support .
the groups also say that silicosis sufferers who are still alive are in need of help .
one of them is 39-year-old mehmet basak ; doctors predict he has about a year to live .
" i am having difficulty while walking , especially when i have to climb up a hill or even stairs i am totally out of breath , i can not breathe , " basak told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey was a center for sandblasting until the ban " i used to work from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.
dust would build up all over my body , you could n't even recognize me or my co-workers until we showered . "
the clean clothes campaign says that the garment industry is getting around the turkish prohibition by shifting the work to subcontractors in developing countries ; they argue that this is immoral on health grounds .
the group - an alliance of organizations in 15 european countries - is trying to persuade jeans makers to abandon the practice altogether .
" a number of big jeans producers like levis strauss and h & m have all said they would stop sandblasting with almost immediate effect , or by the end of this year , " said wyger wentholdt from the ccc .
" there are a couple of jeans brands who have not wanted to react to our approach at all . "
wendholt warned that , after lobbying , a name and shame campaign could follow against firms that persist in using the material .

he told monday 's berliner zeitung newspaper , " the welfare of the child must be the first consideration .
it 's not so much an issue of whether the adults want to live as a happy family .
i do n't believe that children want to grow up in a homosexual partnership . "
uta kehr , spokeswoman for the association of lesbians and gays in germany , said that kauder was encouraging prejudices against homosexual parents who care for children .
but worse still was the fact that he was humiliating homosexual parents in the eyes of their children .
" how will the 15-year-old son of a lesbian couple feel , for example , if he reads such things in the paper ? " she said .
children in " rainbow " families just as happy her position was backed up by leaders of the green party , who also pointed out that the german ministry for family affairs had recently published a study showing children who lived in so-called " rainbow " families felt just as well-looked-after and were just as successful as children of the same age in conventional families .

the german parliament is to have a free vote on proposals to allow highly restricted access to pgd in cases where there are good grounds to fear that the unborn child could suffer from a serious genetic disease .
kauder argued in the interview that " pgd opens the door to the temptation to select and manipulate life . "
but , he said , there was no " right to a child . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 21.12.2010 aid groups urge action to stop atrocities by the lord 's resistance army großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atrocities carried out by the lra continue across central africa urgent calls from an alliance of aid organizations for international intervention have turned the spotlight on the continuing atrocities being committed by the lord 's resistance army -lrb- lra -rrb- across central africa . the alliance of 19 aid agencies fears that the lra , a sectarian religious and military group which formed out of a rebellion in uganda in the 1980s , will step up its attacks on remote communities in sudan , central african republic and dr congo during the christmas period .
the group , led by war crimes suspect joseph kony , already carries out attacks in these regions up to four times a week , according to a report published by the agencies alliance , which includes oxfam , christian aid , refugees international , world vision and war child uk .
despite concerted but ultimately unsuccessful efforts by the ugandan army in december 2008 to finally defeat the lra , the group - known for its slaughter of civilians and the abduction of children - continues to strike fear across central africa .
the failure of operation lightning thunder resulted in a wave of brutal revenge attacks by the lra .
" the lra 's leaders call themselves christian visionaries , but they are mass-murderers roving around central africa searching for communities to eviscerate , " richard gowan , an africa expert with the european council for foreign affairs , told deutsche welle . " efforts to deal with the lra as a rational political force have failed . " " the un tried to talk to the lra in 2006-8 , which was a useful experiment , but the negotiations went nowhere and uganda 's military campaign against lra bases in the eastern congo in 2008 only forced the lra into the central african republic and sudan , sending tens of thousands of civilians running for their lives . " it is alleged that the lra has killed more than 2,000 people since december 2008 while kidnapping more than 2,600 and forcing more than 400,000 refugees to flee from dr congo , the central african republic and southern sudan .
" the acute suffering and mass population displacement the lra has generated across international borders is undermining stability in an already fragile region , where southern sudan is preparing to hold a landmark referendum on secession in early 2011 , " the alliance report - entitled " the ghosts of christmas past " - said .
alun mcdonald , oxfam 's regional media and communications officer for the horn , east and central africa , says the international community 's response has been weak and counter-productive . " the lra is the most deadly group in dr congo at the moment , killing over 1,000 people this year .
yet less than 1,000 of the 18,500 un peacekeepers in the country are deployed in lra-affected areas . " alliance calls for international intervention to stop lra bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : war crimes suspect kony remains as elusive as his lra as well as warning of the potential for christmas attacks , the agencies alliance has called on the international community to do more to stop the lra once and for all .
" war child advocates for the scaling-up of non-military interventions in the region , primarily focusing on the safe release and reintegration into communities of child soldiers recruited by the lra , particularly girl soldiers who are often neglected in the reintegration process which increases the likelihood of re-recruitment , " nivi narang , the campaigns director at war child uk , told deutsche welle .
" we want the international community to give the lra problem the attention it deserves , " oxfam 's mcdonald said .
" governments should explore non-military options for dealing with the lra while remembering that many lra fighters are in fact abducted children .
helping them to escape and defect would put an enormous dent in the lra 's military capacity . "
mcdonald also believes that increased numbers of well-trained un peacekeepers in areas most at risk from lra attacks would act as a real deterrent to the small but violent group .
un , us show increased willingness to act bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un is sending more peacekeepers to areas at risk in response , the un security council has echoed the call for greater international action and has dispatched 900 peacekeepers to a remote region of dr congo where the lra carried out consecutive christmas attacks in 2008 and 2009 .
the security council has also welcomed an african union move to set up a joint task force to fight the lra and deploy joint border patrols . the united states , which provided logistical support for the ugandan army 's operation lightning thunder in 2008 , has also promised to support a new effort to finally defeat the lra and catch the elusive kony , who is wanted by the international criminal court for war crimes and crimes against humanity . president barack obama presented congress with a new plan last week that would promote " the defection , disarmament , demobilization , and reintegration of remaining lra fighters ; and ... increase humanitarian access and provide continued relief to affected communities . "
the plan is part of a wider strategy agreed upon by congress six months ago to " defuse the spiraling bloodshed in central africa , protect the civilian population and bring lra leaders to justice . " experts lament too little action coming too late bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african forces fighting the lra need more international help the belief among experts is that while it is a positive development that the united nations and united states are now moving the lra problem up their african agendas , a lot of damage has already been done and the efforts they speak of may be too little too late . " the un has huge problems in central africa , ranging from instability in the congo to the upcoming independence referendum in south sudan , " said richard gowan .
" there are thousands of peacekeepers in the region , but they 're overstretched already . "
gowan believes that tackling the lra will be a long and grinding process with the only ' quick fix ' coming from the death or arrest of its leader , joseph kony . even that might not end the threat the lra poses to central africa . " very , very few people would shed a tear for kony , " gowan said . " but if he died , the lra might still keep going in a new form .

his attorney argues that the issue of isp liability should remain the key issue in the case . carl lundstrom , one of the four defendants in the pirate bay website trial , has formally appealed to the swedish supreme court against the denial of the party 's previous appeal in late november .
he is one of the founders of the pirate bay - a website that provides links to bittorrent files that can be used to share unauthorized copies of films , music files and software .
in an interview with sveriges radio 's p3 news program , lundstrom 's attorney , per e samuelsson , said that his client does not accept the sentence of four months of jail time for himself , and a collective fine for him and the three other defendants of 46 million swedish kronor -lrb- 5.1 million euros -rrb- .
the four had been previously found guilty of copyright infringement .
however , members of the defense argued that the site , which began in 2003 , does not actually host any copyrighted material , but rather provides links to those files .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 21.12.2010 new german bill proposed for limited embryo screening großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bill 's backers want pgd only to prevent serious disease german members of parliament have presented draft legislation that would allow the screening of implanted embryos , but only to identify serious genetic diseases .
that goes too far for many lawmakers . parliamentarians from all german mainstream parties joined on tuesday to present a draft bill which would allow embryo screening - also known as pre-implantation genetic diagnosis or pgd - in narrowly defined situations .
two other draft bills are on the way , both taking an even more restrictive line .
the new bills are a response to a decision by the federal court of justice in july , that ruled that a total and unconditional ban of pgd would not be in line with the constitution .
one of the main proponents of the current bill , ulrike flach of the junior coalition partner in chancellor angela merkel 's government , the liberal free democrats , emphasized that it was not intended to open any floodgates .
" pre-implantation genetic diagnosis will , in general , still be banned , " she said .
" but it will be allowed under very special circumstances . "
those circumstances include cases where one parent suffers from a severe hereditary condition which could be passed on to the child and would lead to severe disease , stillbirth or miscarriage .
avoiding abortions peter hintze of angela merkel 's christian democrats , said that the kind of cases they were talking about could lead to late abortions , since pre-natal diagnosis for such conditions is legal .
" our bill focuses on the situation of the women affected , " he said .
" we want to keep them free of conflicts over pregnancy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel is one of the conservatives who oppose pgd on principle the bill would set up an ethics commission to decide which genetic conditions would justify the use of screening .

pgd raises ethical questions because it also has the potential to screen for genetic characteristics unrelated to medical necessity .
anxieties about " designer babies " are not new , prompting jerzy montag of the opposition green party to try to calm any such fears " i 'm not thinking of parents who 'd like to have a musically gifted child , or one with blue eyes , or one that does n't suffer from obesity , " he said .
" but i 'm thinking for instance of a woman who already has a child suffering from a severe congenital disease , a woman who wants to have another child , but wants to ensure it has a better deal in life .
although the bill presented on tuesday is supported by members of all parties , it will not necessarily get majority support in the bundestag .
opponents , including those who will sponsor the other two drafts , fear that screening to remove undesirable genes , however serious , could eventually have an adverse impact on the way society treats people with disabilities .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 21.12.2010 opinion : improve trade regulations to curb resource squeeze großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " china uses unconventional methods to secure access to raw materials in africa " a new global challenge is threatening the german economy : many raw materials are in short supply .
it 's not because deposits are empty , but because international trade mechanisms are outdated , writes juergen wiemann . industrial companies in germany are complaining about the rising prices of rare minerals and metals needed for electromobility and photovoltaics .
one in two , according to a poll conducted by the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , even worries whether it will get the critical raw materials at all .
yet , geologists say all metals will be available in sufficient quantities in the earth 's crust for the foreseeable future .
at worst , oil may become scarce .
geology is , however , responsible for the concentration of deposits on just a few of the world 's regions and countries .
this leaves the way open for the formation of cartels and for monopolistic behaviour , especially as global production of raw materials is below the " geological production possibility " .
this is due to a political environment in many developing countries with major reserves which is anything but inviting for mining investment .
and that is no coincidence : rare and strategically important natural resources simply attract war and civil war .
demand on the rise worldwide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if one raw material is not available , the whole value chain is in danger " german industry 's acute fear of a resource squeeze is aggravated by the coincidence of rising world demand and the reluctance shown by a number of countries to supply their natural resources : high-tech industries are processing more and more new minerals and rare metals .
if only one of these substances is not available in sufficient quantity , the whole value chain is in danger .
but that is exactly what is likely to happen , because with their rapid industrialisation , emerging economies , too , are developing a growing need for industrial raw materials .
it is no wonder that they are inclined to limit exports of their raw materials or to impose export taxes on them so as to give their own industries a competitive edge .
only recently , china has demonstrated this kind of self-assertive industrial policy with its restrictions on the export of rare earths , startling the old industrialised countries .
furthermore , the emerging economies are trying to secure direct access to the raw materials of other developing countries , especially in africa .
in the process , they are using some quite unconventional instruments .
chinese state-owned enterprises , for example , are providing development assistance for complementary infrastructure development .
thus , the concern about the supply of raw materials is entirely justified .
consequently , the german government and the european commission are taking the matter seriously .
a report by the european commission judges the supply situation to be critical in the case of 14 materials .
governments get involved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wto headquarters in geneva , switzerland with its ' raw materials initiative ' , the commission intends to face up to the emerging supply risks and to encourage joint action by the eu member states to reduce dependence on external raw materials through increased materials efficiency , recycling and a search for alternatives .
the german economics minister , too , is suggesting that a ' german raw materials corporation ' should act as a demand cartel and challenge the supply power of china and other commodity exporters .
for a liberal economics minister , this is anything but a matter of course .
according to his ' weltanschauung ' , it is best left to the individual enterprise to worry about its supplies of raw materials , while government takes responsibility for the functioning of open world markets in compliance with the rules of the multilateral trading system .
yet it must be asked whether invoking the wto rules against aggressive trade policies will be effective in the case of china .
the wto itself does not have any ' hard power ' to impose sanctions for infringements of its rules ; it can do no more than award the victor in a dispute settlement the right to take retaliatory measures with a similar effect to that of the infringement committed by the loser .
but as china 's economic weight in the world grows and its industries become increasingly integrated into international value chains , the leverage exercised by punitive european tariffs on imports from china dwindles .
subsidies in developed nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european countries protect their agricultural products through subsidies yet , through the sheer existence of the multilateral trading system , wto members tend to follow the rules most of the time , even without formal dispute settlement .
when referring to the ' soft power ' of the wto , member states such as europeans and americans , however , have felt no compunction in defending their agriculture against imports from more competitive developing countries and to subsidise their own agricultural exports .
therefore , not only notorious critics of globalisation discern an asymmetrical distribution of power in the world economic institutions between industrialised and developing countries , which should at least have been corrected in the wto during the current development round .
but after nearly ten years of negotiations in the doha -lrb- development -rrb- round the promise has still not been kept .
beyond ritualised commitments in every g7 / g8 / g20 summit communiqué , neither the eu nor the u.s. has made a convincing effort to cut the gordian knot of the mutually obstructive agricultural interests of industrialised and developing nations with a general offer to open their markets and reduce their export subsidies .
improved management and trade regulations further evidence of the half-hearted nature of the europeans ' commitment to the world trade order , with its implications for the trade and economic policies of all the member countries , is the little attention paid to this year 's ' world trade report ' of the wto on ' trade in natural resources ' .
based on the state of art in economic theory and citing numerous empirical examples , the ' world trade report 2010 ' describes the specific mechanisms and perils of natural resource markets and the exploitation of natural resources in a finite world .
in his foreword , wto director general pascal lamy even questions the “ standard prescriptions for greater trade openness ” for natural resources markets , according to which free trade will always produce the best result for all participating countries .
he argues that the developing countries ' management of natural resources should be improved to prevent over-exploitation and that the wto should adopt further and more precise rules on the world trade in natural resources with a view to defusing the emerging conflicts between producing and consuming countries .
lamy therefore rightly calls for a “ prompt closure of the doha round ” , so that the new challenges and conflicts in the international natural resources trade may be dealt with under the wto umbrella . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. jürgen wiemann is head of the research project ' multilateral trading system and development cooperation ' at deutsche gesellschaft für technische zusammenarbeit -lrb- gtz -rrb- and former deputy director of the german development institute -lrb- die -rrb- .
die is one of the leading think tanks for development policy world-wide .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 21.12.2010 new german bill proposed for limited embryo screening großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bill 's backers want pgd only to prevent serious disease german members of parliament have presented draft legislation that would allow the screening of implanted embryos , but only to identify serious genetic diseases .
that goes too far for many lawmakers . parliamentarians from all german mainstream parties joined on tuesday to present a draft bill which would allow embryo screening - also known as pre-implantation genetic diagnosis or pgd - in narrowly defined situations .
two other draft bills are on the way , both taking an even more restrictive line .
the new bills are a response to a decision by the federal court of justice in july , that ruled that a total and unconditional ban of pgd would not be in line with the constitution .
one of the main proponents of the current bill , ulrike flach of the junior coalition partner in chancellor angela merkel 's government , the liberal free democrats , emphasized that it was not intended to open any floodgates .
" pre-implantation genetic diagnosis will , in general , still be banned , " she said .
" but it will be allowed under very special circumstances . "
those circumstances include cases where one parent suffers from a severe hereditary condition which could be passed on to the child and would lead to severe disease , stillbirth or miscarriage .
avoiding abortions peter hintze of angela merkel 's christian democrats , said that the kind of cases they were talking about could lead to late abortions , since pre-natal diagnosis for such conditions is legal .
" our bill focuses on the situation of the women affected , " he said .
" we want to keep them free of conflicts over pregnancy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel is one of the conservatives who oppose pgd on principle the bill would set up an ethics commission to decide which genetic conditions would justify the use of screening .
the commission would be able to respond to scientific developments , removing diseases from the list should cures become available .
pgd raises ethical questions because it also has the potential to screen for genetic characteristics unrelated to medical necessity .
anxieties about " designer babies " are not new , prompting jerzy montag of the opposition green party to try to calm any such fears " i 'm not thinking of parents who 'd like to have a musically gifted child , or one with blue eyes , or one that does n't suffer from obesity , " he said .
" but i 'm thinking for instance of a woman who already has a child suffering from a severe congenital disease , a woman who wants to have another child , but wants to ensure it has a better deal in life .

that goes too far for many lawmakers . parliamentarians from all german mainstream parties joined on tuesday to present a draft bill which would allow embryo screening - also known as pre-implantation genetic diagnosis or pgd - in narrowly defined situations .
two other draft bills are on the way , both taking an even more restrictive line .
the new bills are a response to a decision by the federal court of justice in july , that ruled that a total and unconditional ban of pgd would not be in line with the constitution .
one of the main proponents of the current bill , ulrike flach of the junior coalition partner in chancellor angela merkel 's government , the liberal free democrats , emphasized that it was not intended to open any floodgates .
" pre-implantation genetic diagnosis will , in general , still be banned , " she said .
" but it will be allowed under very special circumstances . "
those circumstances include cases where one parent suffers from a severe hereditary condition which could be passed on to the child and would lead to severe disease , stillbirth or miscarriage .
avoiding abortions peter hintze of angela merkel 's christian democrats , said that the kind of cases they were talking about could lead to late abortions , since pre-natal diagnosis for such conditions is legal .
" our bill focuses on the situation of the women affected , " he said .
" we want to keep them free of conflicts over pregnancy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel is one of the conservatives who oppose pgd on principle the bill would set up an ethics commission to decide which genetic conditions would justify the use of screening .
the commission would be able to respond to scientific developments , removing diseases from the list should cures become available .
pgd raises ethical questions because it also has the potential to screen for genetic characteristics unrelated to medical necessity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 21.12.2010 eu tightens emissions restrictions for light trucks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : light trucks will be allowed to emit 147 grams co2 per kilometer from 2020 the eu 's environment ministers have agreed on emissions and mileage regulations for small vans and other utility vehicles .
but environmentalists say the new rules were largely influenced by germany 's strong car lobby . germany and the european union 's executive are praising an agreement among eu countries to tighten emissions rules for vehicles , but environmentalists are less convinced .
new regulations agreed on monday require vans and other utility vehicles to reduce their rate of carbon emissions per kilometre over the next decade , in a bid to drive down the transport sector 's share of greenhouse gasses .
european union environment ministers stipulated that from 2020 onwards , vehicles weighing up to 3.5 tons will only be allowed to emit 147 grams of co2 per kilometer , which translates into some 5.6 liters of diesel per kilometer .
today , light trucks are allowed to emit 200 grams per kilometer .
" it 's a very good compromise on something that was a source of debate for a long time , " said norbert roettgen , germany 's environment minister , adding that the new regulations will help the environment without placing too much of a burden on the car industry .
hopes are that the decision will help create new jobs .
demand for fuel-saving engines will be on the rise over the next decade because of rising petrol prices , says claudia kemfert from the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- . " in times of globalization a country 's competitive edge will depend on their ability to build energy-saving products and vehicles , " kemfert told deutsche welle .
" so germany and europe can gain a competitive advantage by launching these technologies first . "
ending a heated debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's environment minister says the new rules are a ' good compromise ' the issue has long been a point of conflict within the bloc , with germany pushing for regulations not to go below 150 grams of co2 per kilometer .
together with the eu 's two other major car-producing countries france and italy , germany had opposed stricter suggestions by the eu 's executive , the european commission .
the commission had demanded limitations of 135 grams of co2 per kilometer for light trucks , yet the eu 's climate chief , connie hedegaard , also described the compromise as a step forward .
" we have got things that are definitely more ambitious than what the industry and the sector claimed that they could do , " she said at a press conference .
the european parliament still has to approve the decision , with a vote expected in mid-january .
the new regulations could increase prices for small trucks by several thousand euros .
producers whose vehicles exceed the 147 grams per kilometer will have to pay a fine of 95 euros per gram per vehicle .
the regulations are staggered , so that by 2014 emissions for light trucks are supposed to go down to 175 grams of co2 per kilometer .
currently regulations are only in place for private cars .
their emissions are supposed to fall below 130 grams of co2 per kilometer by 2012 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists say germany 's car lobby has again shown its strength german car lobby environmentalists complained that the decision watered down what the european commission proposed in 2009 .
" it 's very disappointing and yet another example of germany preventing more progressive politics from being put in place " , wolfgang lohbeck from greenpeace told deutsche welle .
" it shows that the german car lobby is very strong . "
" you could argue that -lrb- monday 's -rrb- decision was in fact not that important , " said lohbeck , adding that small vans and other utility vehicles only make up about eight percent of all cars on german roads .
according to the german environment ministry , these vehicles are responsible for some six percent of co2 emissions caused by traffic .
environmentalists are now concerned , lohbeck told deutsche welle , that the car lobby will continue to resist future decisions .
the regulations for cars , which were introduced last year , will soon be reviewed again by the eu .
" i hope that monday 's decision was not a bad premonition for what they 'll decide there , " lohbeck said .

she wants a much clearer outline of citizen rights with respect to how their data is used . european union justice commissioner , viviane reding , has slammed the american government for not showing a serious interest in data protection rights .
the united states and eu are at odds over washington 's drive for increased access to european citizens ' bank and flight records .
european authorities do n't believe that their us counterparts are adequately protecting consumer rights .
" from the outset , we have noted an apparent lack of interest on the us side to talk seriously about data protection , " reding said in a statement released on monday , just two weeks after holding talks with high-level american officials , including with us attorney general eric holder and janet napolitano , the secretary of homeland security .
in the same statement , reding described those officials as " unprepared " and " uninterested " in data privacy issues .
" they have not even appointed a negotiator , " she added in the statement , but noted that she " expects " the telephone number of the negotiator before year 's end .
meanwhile , the european union has designated françoise le bail , the director general of the commission 's department for justice , as its negotiator .
eu pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american ambassador to the eu , william e. kennard disagrees with reding 's charges brussels is pushing washington for a document that would clearly outline the basis of future data-sharing agreements .
earlier this month , the eu 's 27 justice ministers gave the bloc 's executive the green light to negotiate a " personal data protection agreement " with washington .
the agreement would aim to prevent the abuse of europeans ' privacy as authorities share information in the struggle against terrorism and other crimes .
the eu is seeking " more proportionate " use of this data as well as the right for eu citizens to modify and delete information and take the government to court over abuses of their data .
reding also is encouraging the americans to create an independent data protection supervisory position , which exists in all eu member states .
in a press conference in brussels on monday , the american ambassador to the european union dismissed reding 's statement .
" i disagree - we 're moving ahead , " he said .

in the same statement , reding described those officials as " unprepared " and " uninterested " in data privacy issues .
" they have not even appointed a negotiator , " she added in the statement , but noted that she " expects " the telephone number of the negotiator before year 's end .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 21.12.2010 german researchers develop ice-free windshield großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has been hit unusually early with winter this year it 's what most european drivers are dreaming of these days : a farewell to ice-scraping .
but drivers need some patience : the new technology is not ready for the market yet , the german researchers say . with snow continuing to fall and temperatures often below zero degree celsius -lrb- 32 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in many parts of the continent , many europeans currently have to get up earlier than usual to scrape off the ice covering the windshields of their cars before they can actually drive off .
that may soon be a thing of the past , according to german researchers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not ready for mass-production yet in recent months , scientists at the fraunhofer institute for surface technology -lrb- ist -rrb- in braunschweig , in north-central germany , have announced a new car window glass which they claim does not allow an ice layer to form in the first place - even at temperatures as low as minus 18 celsius .
last month , volkswagen joined the project , hoping to turn this research into a feature on its cars .
" -lsb- the window -rsb- has been well-understood on a laboratory scale , but now needs to be implemented for large-scale operation , " said harthmuth hoffmann , a volkswagen spokesperson , in an e-mail sent to deutsche welle .
the problem is that this coating can interfere with radio and mobile phone reception .
heat ca n't radiate skyward the new glass works differently from a heated window - it is based on a physical principle : a wafer-thin transparent coating of indium tin oxide is applied to the window .
" we call this a ' low-e ' -lrb- low thermal emissivity -rrb- coating , " said thomas drescher of volkswagen development , in an interview with the dpa news service .
" applied to the outer glazing , it prevents heat from radiating skyward . "
the conductive " low-e coating " protects the glass from cooling .
that way , water on the outer surface does not condense or freeze and there is no ice film in the first place because radiative heat loss to the cold sky is minimised and this prevents or delays cooling of the glass surface to below the dew point .
scientists have worked on similar projects for some 50 years , andreas klein from technical university of darmstadt told deutsche welle .
" the challenge here is that they 're creating a coating which is applied externally rather than inside .
so the mechanism will have to be able to withstand adverse weather conditions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : driving in winter could just become this little bit easier older systems work with layers made from tin oxide .
but these are far from perfect - both from a practical and an esthetical point of view , the researchers found .
when glass is bent , for instance , the old layers will break because the temperatures get too high .
" our new layer is extremely stable , " said bernd szyszka , an ist researcher , in a statement published on the fraunhofer institute 's website .
" temperatures of up to 900 degrees celsius are no problem .
even if you bend the layer extensively it stays the way it is . "
when the layer is used in windshields , of course , weather conditions such as cloudiness , relative humidity and wind can affect the windows ' condensation behaviour .
" the ' low-e coating ' can not prevent ice formation or condensation entirely , but it can significantly reduce the likelihood of it happening , " drescher added .
ice-free windshield still not ready for the mass market for now , one drawback with the system as it is is that the new coating limits radio traffic in the car , which can impair radio and mobile phone reception , added harthmuth hoffmann , the volkswagen spokesperson .
as such , it remains unclear as to when the first cars equipped with the new wind screen can roll out from volkswagen 's assembly lines .
" it will take some time before the ice-free car windscreen is market-ready , " drescher noted , " but we are working intensively toward this goal . "

but drivers need some patience : the new technology is not ready for the market yet , the german researchers say . with snow continuing to fall and temperatures often below zero degree celsius -lrb- 32 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in many parts of the continent , many europeans currently have to get up earlier than usual to scrape off the ice covering the windshields of their cars before they can actually drive off .
that may soon be a thing of the past , according to german researchers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not ready for mass-production yet in recent months , scientists at the fraunhofer institute for surface technology -lrb- ist -rrb- in braunschweig , in north-central germany , have announced a new car window glass which they claim does not allow an ice layer to form in the first place - even at temperatures as low as minus 18 celsius .
last month , volkswagen joined the project , hoping to turn this research into a feature on its cars .
" -lsb- the window -rsb- has been well-understood on a laboratory scale , but now needs to be implemented for large-scale operation , " said harthmuth hoffmann , a volkswagen spokesperson , in an e-mail sent to deutsche welle .
the problem is that this coating can interfere with radio and mobile phone reception .
heat ca n't radiate skyward the new glass works differently from a heated window - it is based on a physical principle : a wafer-thin transparent coating of indium tin oxide is applied to the window .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 21.12.2010 german researchers develop ice-free windshield großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has been hit unusually early with winter this year it 's what most european drivers are dreaming of these days : a farewell to ice-scraping .
but drivers need some patience : the new technology is not ready for the market yet , the german researchers say . with snow continuing to fall and temperatures often below zero degree celsius -lrb- 32 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in many parts of the continent , many europeans currently have to get up earlier than usual to scrape off the ice covering the windshields of their cars before they can actually drive off .
that may soon be a thing of the past , according to german researchers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not ready for mass-production yet in recent months , scientists at the fraunhofer institute for surface technology -lrb- ist -rrb- in braunschweig , in north-central germany , have announced a new car window glass which they claim does not allow an ice layer to form in the first place - even at temperatures as low as minus 18 celsius .
last month , volkswagen joined the project , hoping to turn this research into a feature on its cars .
" -lsb- the window -rsb- has been well-understood on a laboratory scale , but now needs to be implemented for large-scale operation , " said harthmuth hoffmann , a volkswagen spokesperson , in an e-mail sent to deutsche welle .
the problem is that this coating can interfere with radio and mobile phone reception .
heat ca n't radiate skyward the new glass works differently from a heated window - it is based on a physical principle : a wafer-thin transparent coating of indium tin oxide is applied to the window .
" we call this a ' low-e ' -lrb- low thermal emissivity -rrb- coating , " said thomas drescher of volkswagen development , in an interview with the dpa news service .
" applied to the outer glazing , it prevents heat from radiating skyward . "
the conductive " low-e coating " protects the glass from cooling .
that way , water on the outer surface does not condense or freeze and there is no ice film in the first place because radiative heat loss to the cold sky is minimised and this prevents or delays cooling of the glass surface to below the dew point .
scientists have worked on similar projects for some 50 years , andreas klein from technical university of darmstadt told deutsche welle .
" the challenge here is that they 're creating a coating which is applied externally rather than inside .
so the mechanism will have to be able to withstand adverse weather conditions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : driving in winter could just become this little bit easier older systems work with layers made from tin oxide .
but these are far from perfect - both from a practical and an esthetical point of view , the researchers found .
when glass is bent , for instance , the old layers will break because the temperatures get too high .
" our new layer is extremely stable , " said bernd szyszka , an ist researcher , in a statement published on the fraunhofer institute 's website .
" temperatures of up to 900 degrees celsius are no problem .
even if you bend the layer extensively it stays the way it is . "
when the layer is used in windshields , of course , weather conditions such as cloudiness , relative humidity and wind can affect the windows ' condensation behaviour .
" the ' low-e coating ' can not prevent ice formation or condensation entirely , but it can significantly reduce the likelihood of it happening , " drescher added .
ice-free windshield still not ready for the mass market for now , one drawback with the system as it is is that the new coating limits radio traffic in the car , which can impair radio and mobile phone reception , added harthmuth hoffmann , the volkswagen spokesperson .
as such , it remains unclear as to when the first cars equipped with the new wind screen can roll out from volkswagen 's assembly lines .
" it will take some time before the ice-free car windscreen is market-ready , " drescher noted , " but we are working intensively toward this goal . "

she wants a much clearer outline of citizen rights with respect to how their data is used . european union justice commissioner , viviane reding , has slammed the american government for not showing a serious interest in data protection rights .
the united states and eu are at odds over washington 's drive for increased access to european citizens ' bank and flight records .
european authorities do n't believe that their us counterparts are adequately protecting consumer rights .
" from the outset , we have noted an apparent lack of interest on the us side to talk seriously about data protection , " reding said in a statement released on monday , just two weeks after holding talks with high-level american officials , including with us attorney general eric holder and janet napolitano , the secretary of homeland security .
in the same statement , reding described those officials as " unprepared " and " uninterested " in data privacy issues .
" they have not even appointed a negotiator , " she added in the statement , but noted that she " expects " the telephone number of the negotiator before year 's end .
meanwhile , the european union has designated françoise le bail , the director general of the commission 's department for justice , as its negotiator .
eu pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american ambassador to the eu , william e. kennard disagrees with reding 's charges brussels is pushing washington for a document that would clearly outline the basis of future data-sharing agreements .

the agreement would aim to prevent the abuse of europeans ' privacy as authorities share information in the struggle against terrorism and other crimes .
the eu is seeking " more proportionate " use of this data as well as the right for eu citizens to modify and delete information and take the government to court over abuses of their data .
reding also is encouraging the americans to create an independent data protection supervisory position , which exists in all eu member states .
in a press conference in brussels on monday , the american ambassador to the european union dismissed reding 's statement .
" i disagree - we 're moving ahead , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 21.12.2010 new german bill proposed for limited embryo screening großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bill 's backers want pgd only to prevent serious disease german members of parliament have presented draft legislation that would allow the screening of implanted embryos , but only to identify serious genetic diseases .
that goes too far for many lawmakers . parliamentarians from all german mainstream parties joined on tuesday to present a draft bill which would allow embryo screening - also known as pre-implantation genetic diagnosis or pgd - in narrowly defined situations .
two other draft bills are on the way , both taking an even more restrictive line .
the new bills are a response to a decision by the federal court of justice in july , that ruled that a total and unconditional ban of pgd would not be in line with the constitution .
one of the main proponents of the current bill , ulrike flach of the junior coalition partner in chancellor angela merkel 's government , the liberal free democrats , emphasized that it was not intended to open any floodgates .
" pre-implantation genetic diagnosis will , in general , still be banned , " she said .
" but it will be allowed under very special circumstances . "
those circumstances include cases where one parent suffers from a severe hereditary condition which could be passed on to the child and would lead to severe disease , stillbirth or miscarriage .
avoiding abortions peter hintze of angela merkel 's christian democrats , said that the kind of cases they were talking about could lead to late abortions , since pre-natal diagnosis for such conditions is legal .
" our bill focuses on the situation of the women affected , " he said .
" we want to keep them free of conflicts over pregnancy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel is one of the conservatives who oppose pgd on principle the bill would set up an ethics commission to decide which genetic conditions would justify the use of screening .
the commission would be able to respond to scientific developments , removing diseases from the list should cures become available .
pgd raises ethical questions because it also has the potential to screen for genetic characteristics unrelated to medical necessity .
anxieties about " designer babies " are not new , prompting jerzy montag of the opposition green party to try to calm any such fears " i 'm not thinking of parents who 'd like to have a musically gifted child , or one with blue eyes , or one that does n't suffer from obesity , " he said .
" but i 'm thinking for instance of a woman who already has a child suffering from a severe congenital disease , a woman who wants to have another child , but wants to ensure it has a better deal in life .
although the bill presented on tuesday is supported by members of all parties , it will not necessarily get majority support in the bundestag .
opponents , including those who will sponsor the other two drafts , fear that screening to remove undesirable genes , however serious , could eventually have an adverse impact on the way society treats people with disabilities .

his attorney argues that the issue of isp liability should remain the key issue in the case . carl lundstrom , one of the four defendants in the pirate bay website trial , has formally appealed to the swedish supreme court against the denial of the party 's previous appeal in late november .
he is one of the founders of the pirate bay - a website that provides links to bittorrent files that can be used to share unauthorized copies of films , music files and software .
in an interview with sveriges radio 's p3 news program , lundstrom 's attorney , per e samuelsson , said that his client does not accept the sentence of four months of jail time for himself , and a collective fine for him and the three other defendants of 46 million swedish kronor -lrb- 5.1 million euros -rrb- .

that goes too far for many lawmakers . parliamentarians from all german mainstream parties joined on tuesday to present a draft bill which would allow embryo screening - also known as pre-implantation genetic diagnosis or pgd - in narrowly defined situations .
two other draft bills are on the way , both taking an even more restrictive line .
the new bills are a response to a decision by the federal court of justice in july , that ruled that a total and unconditional ban of pgd would not be in line with the constitution .
one of the main proponents of the current bill , ulrike flach of the junior coalition partner in chancellor angela merkel 's government , the liberal free democrats , emphasized that it was not intended to open any floodgates .
" pre-implantation genetic diagnosis will , in general , still be banned , " she said .
" but it will be allowed under very special circumstances . "
those circumstances include cases where one parent suffers from a severe hereditary condition which could be passed on to the child and would lead to severe disease , stillbirth or miscarriage .
avoiding abortions peter hintze of angela merkel 's christian democrats , said that the kind of cases they were talking about could lead to late abortions , since pre-natal diagnosis for such conditions is legal .
" our bill focuses on the situation of the women affected , " he said .
" we want to keep them free of conflicts over pregnancy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel is one of the conservatives who oppose pgd on principle the bill would set up an ethics commission to decide which genetic conditions would justify the use of screening .
the commission would be able to respond to scientific developments , removing diseases from the list should cures become available .
pgd raises ethical questions because it also has the potential to screen for genetic characteristics unrelated to medical necessity .
anxieties about " designer babies " are not new , prompting jerzy montag of the opposition green party to try to calm any such fears " i 'm not thinking of parents who 'd like to have a musically gifted child , or one with blue eyes , or one that does n't suffer from obesity , " he said .
" but i 'm thinking for instance of a woman who already has a child suffering from a severe congenital disease , a woman who wants to have another child , but wants to ensure it has a better deal in life .
although the bill presented on tuesday is supported by members of all parties , it will not necessarily get majority support in the bundestag .
opponents , including those who will sponsor the other two drafts , fear that screening to remove undesirable genes , however serious , could eventually have an adverse impact on the way society treats people with disabilities .

she wants a much clearer outline of citizen rights with respect to how their data is used . european union justice commissioner , viviane reding , has slammed the american government for not showing a serious interest in data protection rights .
the united states and eu are at odds over washington 's drive for increased access to european citizens ' bank and flight records .
european authorities do n't believe that their us counterparts are adequately protecting consumer rights .
" from the outset , we have noted an apparent lack of interest on the us side to talk seriously about data protection , " reding said in a statement released on monday , just two weeks after holding talks with high-level american officials , including with us attorney general eric holder and janet napolitano , the secretary of homeland security .
in the same statement , reding described those officials as " unprepared " and " uninterested " in data privacy issues .
" they have not even appointed a negotiator , " she added in the statement , but noted that she " expects " the telephone number of the negotiator before year 's end .
meanwhile , the european union has designated françoise le bail , the director general of the commission 's department for justice , as its negotiator .
eu pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american ambassador to the eu , william e. kennard disagrees with reding 's charges brussels is pushing washington for a document that would clearly outline the basis of future data-sharing agreements .
earlier this month , the eu 's 27 justice ministers gave the bloc 's executive the green light to negotiate a " personal data protection agreement " with washington .
the agreement would aim to prevent the abuse of europeans ' privacy as authorities share information in the struggle against terrorism and other crimes .
the eu is seeking " more proportionate " use of this data as well as the right for eu citizens to modify and delete information and take the government to court over abuses of their data .
reding also is encouraging the americans to create an independent data protection supervisory position , which exists in all eu member states .
in a press conference in brussels on monday , the american ambassador to the european union dismissed reding 's statement .
" i disagree - we 're moving ahead , " he said .

but the excitement faded fast . in the lazy midday sun , it is playtime for the children in the tribal hamlet of tembhli in india 's western state of maharashtra .
using sticks , they roll old tire tubes and stones along a concrete road .
they are excited to have such a smooth surface to play on . three months ago , this road did not exist .
but in september the otherwise sleepy hamlet saw a flurry of activity as it prepared to receive prime minister manmohan singh and congress party president sonia gandhi , who were coming to distribute the first set of unique identification -lrb- uid -rrb- cards . titled " aadhaar , " meaning support , the project aims to equip each indian citizen with biometric identification numbers based on thumbprints and iris scans .
this ambitious scheme has come under heavy criticism for several reasons , one of them being the claim by some experts that it will result in the invasion of privacy .
but the indian government has defended the project , claiming it will help poor and disadvantaged citizens avail public welfare schemes more easily .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : road construction has been left incomplete in some parts of tembhli fleeting elation after years of feeling abandoned , the villagers of tembhli were initially thrilled to be chosen for a visit by no less than the prime minister himself , but their elation did not last long . the attention bestowed on them by the government was only fleeting , says 28-year-old sunanda karma thakre , who with her husband is one of the many who usually migrate to the neighboring state of gujarat to find work . " we were about to leave for gujarat this year too , but then we heard of the prime minister ’ s visit .
we decided to stay , thinking the ministers would help us find work here .
but that did not materialize , " she points out . " if they come again , we will tell them about our troubles .
but all these government officials only came to us around the time of the pm ’ s visit .
now no one seems to be interested in listening to us .
no one has stepped into the village since then .
even the roads that were being built lie incomplete and some of us still don ’ t have electricity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunanda karma thakre is a skeptical about the new biometric uid cards lack of work opportunities drive laborers away laborers in tembhli struggle to find occasional work as farm hands in the nearby fields , which fetches them barely a euro a day .
by comparison , the state of gujarat , especially the saurashtra region , offers plenty of employment opportunities on the sugarcane plantations , cotton and groundnut-crushing factories , or on farms .
this work can fetch a laborer between two to three euros a day .
this ensures that when they return to tembhli at the beginning of monsoon , they have a decent amount saved up . while it may seem to be an advantage in terms of income , migration brings with it a host of other problems .
the migrants often leave their homes behind to live in dire conditions in gujarat , often without shelter .
on top of this , they have to uproot their families every year , taking their children out of school , causing a high dropout rate and increasing illiteracy . immediate needs have to be addressed what is important right now is to address the villagers ’ more immediate needs of employment and housing , says madi raju makkan , a member of the tembhli gram panchayat , or village council . " implementation of the national rural employment guarantee scheme should begin as soon as possible .
the government makes promises and then doesn ’ t follow up on them .
that is why the people lose all hope of getting work and leave for saurashtra .
there are many in our village with a ' below poverty line ' status , who don ’ t have proper houses to live in .
many public schemes in the village are incomplete and our village is often inundated in the monsoon floods .
we have lodged many appeals , but the government has not taken any initiatives to act on them . " bildunterschrift : many migrant workers are forced to live on the streets the unique identification -lrb- uid -rrb- cards are supposed to change matters .
villagers can seek loans and open bank accounts more easily .
officials claim the cards will help improve execution of the national rural employment guarantee scheme , although it is not yet clear how this will work . it may be too soon to tell whether these cards will make a difference .
however , as the initial hype and excitement fades away , there is increasing disillusionment among the people of tembhli as they realize that while the uid card is a much needed proof of identity , it will not give them what they want most of all – a chance to earn a better living . author : pia chandavarkar -lrb- tembhli -rrb- editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with more than $ 1.3 trillion of assets , pimco is one of the world 's largest bond investment firms .
the company , based in newport beach , california , is owned by germany 's allianz group .
bosomworth said if the three nations reverted to their own currencies , they would be able to sell their products abroad more competitively and use export revenues to drive further economic growth and repay their heavy debt loads .
investor confidence once economic growth and investor confidence returned to the countries , they could reintegrate into the single currency area , he added .
the idea of countries leaving the eurozone has been making the rounds ever since the greek debt crisis emerged with news that the country 's financial situation was far worse than previously acknowledged .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal could become the next eurozone rescue candidate many experts argue , however , that such a move would lead to massive costs that would ultimately undermine economic performance .
the two rescue packages for greece and ireland and the possibility of portugal and even spain becoming the next bailout candidates have found eurozone countries scrambling to save the common currency in the long term .
help from partners on thursday , european union leaders agreed on a change in the bloc 's rule-book , the lisbon treaty , clearing the way for a permanent rescue fund for crisis-hit eurozone countries from mid-2013 .
bosomworth believes that belgium , italy and spain will be able to get over their own debt problems while remaining inside the eurozone - but only with substantial help from partners .

with more than $ 1.3 trillion of assets , pimco is one of the world 's largest bond investment firms .
the company , based in newport beach , california , is owned by germany 's allianz group .
bosomworth said if the three nations reverted to their own currencies , they would be able to sell their products abroad more competitively and use export revenues to drive further economic growth and repay their heavy debt loads .
investor confidence once economic growth and investor confidence returned to the countries , they could reintegrate into the single currency area , he added .
the idea of countries leaving the eurozone has been making the rounds ever since the greek debt crisis emerged with news that the country 's financial situation was far worse than previously acknowledged .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal could become the next eurozone rescue candidate many experts argue , however , that such a move would lead to massive costs that would ultimately undermine economic performance .
the two rescue packages for greece and ireland and the possibility of portugal and even spain becoming the next bailout candidates have found eurozone countries scrambling to save the common currency in the long term .
help from partners on thursday , european union leaders agreed on a change in the bloc 's rule-book , the lisbon treaty , clearing the way for a permanent rescue fund for crisis-hit eurozone countries from mid-2013 .
bosomworth believes that belgium , italy and spain will be able to get over their own debt problems while remaining inside the eurozone - but only with substantial help from partners .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 21.12.2010 dortmund dominate the bundesliga best 11 of 2010 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a whole lot of these guys made our best-of list christmas is usually a time of acrimony at deutsche welle sports , as we argue about who should make our top xi .
this year , the only fights were over how many dortmund players we could include . nick , ben and jefferson are all great admirers of what juergen klopp has done at dortmund , but matt has obviously come down with a serious case of yellow-and-black fever .
left to his own devices , he would have included no fewer than eight dortmund players in his top 11 .
in the end , the rest of us applied the restraints -lrb- that is , we tied him to his bed -rrb- , so that a few players from other teams got the credit they deserved as well .
we begin with a pair of excellent african strikers .
bildunterschrift : cisse has carried a huge load for freiburg fantastic forwards one player we all agreed on , even matt , was freiburg 's papiss demba cisse .
with his 13 goals , the senegalese striker has the small southwestern german club sniffing the rarefied air at seldom experienced elevations in the table .
matt put it best : " cisse is from another planet - one where one man is enough to propel a team like freiburg up to sixth . "
not shabby for a player who came from the french second division .
chapeau !
on numbers alone , frankfurt 's theofanis gekas would have been a logical choice , but we all felt that he has gotten a number of lucky goals .
matt wanted dortmund 's lukas barrios , while nick preferred schalke 's klaas-jan huntelaar , but jefferson and ben went for didier ya konan .
how important is he to hanover ?
consider this .
since he joined the club in 2009 , hanover have n't earned a single point with him out of the starting line-up .
that 's truly a most valuable player .
majestic midfield no arguments at all about where to start in midfield : dortmund 's nuri sahin and shinji kagawa .
but what can be said about this dynamic duo that has n't been said thousands of times before ?
well how about this ?
sahin is the smartest player in german football .
to watch him is to see a player who seems to know exactly what 's happening in all areas of the pitch at all times .
that 's the definition of a rudder , and you can bet lots of huge european clubs will be vying for his services in the summer .
there 's room for improvement , though - from the spot .
sahin failed to convert the two penalties he took this season , about the only thing he did wrong in the latter half of 2010 .
moving on to kagawa , the three things most often mentioned are 1 -rrb- he 's from japan , 2 -rrb- he only cost 300,000 euros and 3 -rrb- he runs around a lot .
that 's all true but being japanese and cheap hardly guarantees footballing success , and lots of players run around lots without posting eight goals as he has .
what 's often neglected is his fantastic on-the-ball technique .
when he cuts into the middle of the pitch , the only player who 's more dangerous from medium range is arjen robben .
bildunterschrift : this man 's spectacular goals have fans saying " play it again , sam " matt went purely dortmund for the rest of midfield , but the aesthetes among us agreed that we just had to have leverkusen 's sidney sam .
it 's not just that the 22-year-old sam has scored six goals - it 's the way he 's scored them .
for example , his 20-meter-plus volley against kaiserslautern .
or his curling left-footer against hoffenheim .
or ... oh , just go to youtube , and check them out for yourselves .
he 's joined by teammate arturo vidal . six of his eight goals may have come on penalties , but nerves count in football , and the chilean converted all his attempts .
and they were n't meaningless ones either .
they resulted in seven points .
vidal is a main reason perennial unstable leverkusen are playing with consistency and are the only team with a slight chance of overtaking dortmund .
dependable defenders and one great goalkeeper dortmund have by far and away the best defense in the league , so it 's no surprise that mats hummels and marcel schmelzer were unanimous choices .
bildunterschrift : it 's been mighty hard getting by hummels hummels is quite simply the best defender at the moment in germany .
bayern 's uli hoeness is man of few regrets , but he surely must rue the decision to let hummels go in 2008 .
-lrb- there are rumors , terrifying to dortmund fans , that there 's a buy-back clause in the defender 's contract . -rrb-
schmelzer , meanwhile , makes the squad because he excels at the position , left back , that most teams struggle to fill .
his ability to get forward make dortmund ambidextrous , so to speak , and that 's one reason why only two teams this season succeeded in stopping them .
bildunterschrift : the new lahm is an ochs at right back , you could pencil in philipp lahm most years , but this time round the honors go to frankfurt 's captain patrick ochs .
never heard of him ?
you 're not alone , but for years now he 's been one of the bundesliga 's best value-for-money players , equally adapt at protecting the back and going forward .
he 's also versatile , sometimes moving up to midfield , and dependable , having played all but a handful of minutes in frankfurt 's matches .
the other central defender was the trickiest .
nick and matt were in the majority , preferring dortmund 's neven subotic , and ben had the funniest argument for hanover 's emanuel pogatetz : " no team should be without a mad austrian bastard . "
but jefferson intervened , dictatorially , because he felt someone from mainz had to be included .
and since mainz coach thomas tuchel rotates all other positions , that man had to be their captain nikolce noveski .
the 31-year-old noveski has n't missed a single minute , and while lewis holtby and andre schuerrle have grabbed the press attention , mainz have the second-best defense in the league - and the second-best spot in the standings .
last but by no means least , there 's schalke 's manuel neuer .
a homegrown product , he kept the royal blues within striking distance during their horrid start - without him , schalke would almost certainly be in the relegation zone .
and his first-half performance in schalke 's 2-0 win over bayern was truly heroic , as he turned away shot after shot .
best goalkeeper in germany ?
no question about that - even dortmund-phile matt put him on the list .
best goalkeeper in the world ?
maybe .
and that 's a mark of just how good our bundesliga top xi is at the back .

the group , led by war crimes suspect joseph kony , already carries out attacks in these regions up to four times a week , according to a report published by the agencies alliance , which includes oxfam , christian aid , refugees international , world vision and war child uk .
despite concerted but ultimately unsuccessful efforts by the ugandan army in december 2008 to finally defeat the lra , the group - known for its slaughter of civilians and the abduction of children - continues to strike fear across central africa .
the failure of operation lightning thunder resulted in a wave of brutal revenge attacks by the lra .
" the lra 's leaders call themselves christian visionaries , but they are mass-murderers roving around central africa searching for communities to eviscerate , " richard gowan , an africa expert with the european council for foreign affairs , told deutsche welle . " efforts to deal with the lra as a rational political force have failed . " " the un tried to talk to the lra in 2006-8 , which was a useful experiment , but the negotiations went nowhere and uganda 's military campaign against lra bases in the eastern congo in 2008 only forced the lra into the central african republic and sudan , sending tens of thousands of civilians running for their lives . " it is alleged that the lra has killed more than 2,000 people since december 2008 while kidnapping more than 2,600 and forcing more than 400,000 refugees to flee from dr congo , the central african republic and southern sudan .
" the acute suffering and mass population displacement the lra has generated across international borders is undermining stability in an already fragile region , where southern sudan is preparing to hold a landmark referendum on secession in early 2011 , " the alliance report - entitled " the ghosts of christmas past " - said .
alun mcdonald , oxfam 's regional media and communications officer for the horn , east and central africa , says the international community 's response has been weak and counter-productive . " the lra is the most deadly group in dr congo at the moment , killing over 1,000 people this year .
yet less than 1,000 of the 18,500 un peacekeepers in the country are deployed in lra-affected areas . " alliance calls for international intervention to stop lra bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : war crimes suspect kony remains as elusive as his lra as well as warning of the potential for christmas attacks , the agencies alliance has called on the international community to do more to stop the lra once and for all .
" war child advocates for the scaling-up of non-military interventions in the region , primarily focusing on the safe release and reintegration into communities of child soldiers recruited by the lra , particularly girl soldiers who are often neglected in the reintegration process which increases the likelihood of re-recruitment , " nivi narang , the campaigns director at war child uk , told deutsche welle .
" we want the international community to give the lra problem the attention it deserves , " oxfam 's mcdonald said .
" governments should explore non-military options for dealing with the lra while remembering that many lra fighters are in fact abducted children .
helping them to escape and defect would put an enormous dent in the lra 's military capacity . "
mcdonald also believes that increased numbers of well-trained un peacekeepers in areas most at risk from lra attacks would act as a real deterrent to the small but violent group .
un , us show increased willingness to act bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un is sending more peacekeepers to areas at risk in response , the un security council has echoed the call for greater international action and has dispatched 900 peacekeepers to a remote region of dr congo where the lra carried out consecutive christmas attacks in 2008 and 2009 .
the security council has also welcomed an african union move to set up a joint task force to fight the lra and deploy joint border patrols . the united states , which provided logistical support for the ugandan army 's operation lightning thunder in 2008 , has also promised to support a new effort to finally defeat the lra and catch the elusive kony , who is wanted by the international criminal court for war crimes and crimes against humanity . president barack obama presented congress with a new plan last week that would promote " the defection , disarmament , demobilization , and reintegration of remaining lra fighters ; and ... increase humanitarian access and provide continued relief to affected communities . "
the plan is part of a wider strategy agreed upon by congress six months ago to " defuse the spiraling bloodshed in central africa , protect the civilian population and bring lra leaders to justice . " experts lament too little action coming too late bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african forces fighting the lra need more international help the belief among experts is that while it is a positive development that the united nations and united states are now moving the lra problem up their african agendas , a lot of damage has already been done and the efforts they speak of may be too little too late . " the un has huge problems in central africa , ranging from instability in the congo to the upcoming independence referendum in south sudan , " said richard gowan .
" there are thousands of peacekeepers in the region , but they 're overstretched already . "
gowan believes that tackling the lra will be a long and grinding process with the only ' quick fix ' coming from the death or arrest of its leader , joseph kony . even that might not end the threat the lra poses to central africa . " very , very few people would shed a tear for kony , " gowan said . " but if he died , the lra might still keep going in a new form .

it does n't want to spoil the cheer , but reminds everybody of the dangers of corruption . christmas is just around the corner , and people are scrambling to find the perfect presents to stack under the tree .
but one organization is n't feeling the festive spirit and wants to do away with presents entirely – at least in the world of business .
the german association of materials management , purchasing and logistics -lrb- ammpl -rrb- says gifts have no place in business and that a good supplier wo n't need them to keep its customers .
the association represents some 8,000 members , and in 2008 established a ' code of conduct ' which covers corporate gift giving .
but it 's not always easy to draw a line between a small token of appreciation and a gift that could open the door to a host of ethical dilemmas .
that 's why sebastian schroeder , an ammpl compliance expert , says the code of conduct drafted by his organization lets companies decide what limits are acceptable .
comparable business dinners in london , hamburg or shanghai come at very different prices , he pointed out .
" ultimately it is up to the individual employee of a company to determine if a present has been made in good faith , " he told deutsche welle .
" we did n't set a limit to the value of presents . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airport operator fraport says its staff know what 's acceptable despite their clean-cut reputation , german managers have gone astray on numerous occasions .

intercultural challenge in a globalized business environment , there 's always the issue of differing cultural expectations .
representatives from asian , middle eastern and south american companies are likely to expect a tighter bond with business partners than many germans are used to , schroeder said .
" they close deals based more on personal trust , " he said .
" and sometimes a german buyer shows up and wants to get right to the deal and sign a contract , only to find there are certain limitations . "
in china , for instance , monetary gifts are not at all uncommon , although they are " clearly not acceptable in europe and the united states , " schroeder said .
companies may be reluctant to insult their business partners by returning a gift , giving rise to the challenge of different cultural expectations .
wariness of owing favors clemens von stockert , a manager in the compliance department of fraport airport in frankfurt , says his company deals with potential problems by banning gifts like airline tickets , car shares , and inexpensive credit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the thought that counts : dinner comes at a different price depending on the city a dinner out is fine – it 's gone after having been eaten .

" the important thing is that people do n't put themselves in a position of dependency , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have clear rules that money and anything with monetary value are not to be accepted . "
gift giving has decreased in volume during recent years , according to von stockert , but occasionally someone in the company will receive a present .
if it ca n't be given back without jeopardizing a business relationship , then it 's likely to end up going to charity ... and the company has to pay taxes on it .
" nowadays more companies are keeping these regulations in mind when it comes to accepting gifts and giving them , " von stockert said .
sebastian schroeder of ammpl added the idea is n't to spoil christmas fun , but to foster an environment where companies work together " fairly and in a spirit of partnership . "
" it is true that christmas and similar holidays are used as an opportunity to intensify existing relationships between companies , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 21.12.2010 campaigners target sandblasted jeans on health grounds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fine particles of sand can scar the lungs of blasting workers campaigners are eager to put an end to the practice of sandblasting jeans because of a link with the disease silicosis .
in turkey , where the practice is now banned , thousands of ex-workers are thought to be suffering . consumers looking for a pair of jeans with that special worn look might want to check the label , according to campaigners .
the clean clothes campaign -lrb- ccc -rrb- is calling for a global ban on the practice of sandblasting , in which denim is sprayed with sand at high pressure to give the material a distressed look .
sandblasting is associated with the disease silicosis - a lung disease caused by fine particles of sand thrown into the air during the process .
turkey was a major producer of sandblasted garments before a ban on the process was implemented in 2009 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sandblasted jeans are popular on the high street around 10,000 people have been employed in sandblasting , according to yesim yasin , from the istanbul-based solidarity committee of sandblasting laborers .
" unfortunately many studies reveal the fact that almost 50 percent of the total number of employees are expected to contract this disease , silicosis , " yasin said .
" silicosis has always been and still is incurable .
the workers are sick , but as they have worked in the informal sector they have no basic legal rights . "
effort to persuade big firms the committee and the ccc have started a campaign for turkey to recognize that victims of sandblasting are victims of an industrial disease .
this would enable the families of 46 workers who have already died to receive benefits and support .
the groups also say that silicosis sufferers who are still alive are in need of help .
one of them is 39-year-old mehmet basak ; doctors predict he has about a year to live .
" i am having difficulty while walking , especially when i have to climb up a hill or even stairs i am totally out of breath , i can not breathe , " basak told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey was a center for sandblasting until the ban " i used to work from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.
dust would build up all over my body , you could n't even recognize me or my co-workers until we showered . "
the clean clothes campaign says that the garment industry is getting around the turkish prohibition by shifting the work to subcontractors in developing countries ; they argue that this is immoral on health grounds .
the group - an alliance of organizations in 15 european countries - is trying to persuade jeans makers to abandon the practice altogether .
" a number of big jeans producers like levis strauss and h & m have all said they would stop sandblasting with almost immediate effect , or by the end of this year , " said wyger wentholdt from the ccc .
" there are a couple of jeans brands who have not wanted to react to our approach at all . "
wendholt warned that , after lobbying , a name and shame campaign could follow against firms that persist in using the material .

instead , pyongyang on tuesday apparently offered to allow nuclear inspectors back in after kicking them out last year . instead of unleashing all-out war as some had feared pyongyang might do after south korea decided to go ahead with military exercises on monday , pyongyang let it be known that seoul ’ s provocations needed no response . south korea conducted the drills on monday despite repeated warnings from pyongyang that such a move would only escalate tension on the peninsula , but directed all shots into the sea , a good ten kilometers away from the two countries ' disputed sea border . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korean col. lee boong-woo , spokesman for the joint chiefs of staff , spoke briefly after the 90 minutes of military exercises were over in the south korean media , most of the editorials commended seoul ’ s decision to go ahead with the drills and send a strong message to pyongyang it was willing to act if need be . last month , the government had come under heavy criticism when it failed to show enough military resolve in the wake of pyongyang 's attack on the south korean island of yeonpyeong that killed two soldiers and two civilians . deadlock at un security council the sigh of relief in south korea coincided with deadlocked efforts at the un security council in new york to ease tension on the korean peninsula . the us and japan want to issue a statement blaming the crisis on pyongyang , but china and russia refuse to concede on this point . bildunterschrift : south korean marines went ahead with live-fire drills despite repeated warnings from pyongyang china ’ s vice ambassador to the united nations wang min summed up his country 's stance after the behind-the-scenes talks were broken off : " maintaining peace and stability on the peninsula is in the interest of both the south and the north , as well as other relevant parties .
we strongly appeal to all parties to exercise maximum restraint and act in a responsible manner . " " we ’ ll be guided by what north korea does " meanwhile , us troubleshooter bill richardson said in beijing that pyongyang had agreed to allow international nuclear inspectors back in the country after kicking them out last year . " the north is willing to allow international atomic agency personnel to visit the yongbyon sites and make sure that there are no efforts to enrich uranium .
secondly , the north is willing to negotiate with south korea to sell close to 12,000 spent fuel rods and ship them out of the country . " " it 's time for citizen diplomats like myself to step aside and let governments move forward , " he added .

an increasing number of holidaymakers are opting for eco-tourism which aims to protect travel destinations and their natural surroundings . it 's a scene emblematic of global mass tourism .
at 8 in the morning , the early risers have already spread out their towels on the sun loungers by the pool .
by 11 , the first jug of sangria has been ordered and the all-you-can-eat buffet is getting ready to open . and even though the hotel is on the sunny spanish island of mallorca , the staff all speak german , and are ready to cater to the every need of holidaymakers who 've spent 287 euros -lrb- $ 378 -rrb- a head for a week-long package tour , flights and cocktails included .
it might seem like a low-cost way of escaping the grim german winter , but the environmental cost is high .
mass tourism often takes a heavy toll on nature .
on the island of mallorca , the consequences of five decades of unchecked tourism include a water shortage and a concrete jungle along the coastline .
even the once unspoilt beaches of the balearic island are now lined with yacht harbors .
traveling with a good conscience bildunterschrift : mallorca is no longer an insider tip but the situation does n't need to get any worse .
the alternative to mass tourism is ‘ soft ' or green tourism – also known as environmentally-friendly tourism , gentle tourism , sustainable tourism and ecotourism .
essentially , the aim is to leave travel destinations unspoiled or unchanged by tourism . " ecotourism is a responsible form of travel that contributes to environmental protection and the wellbeing of local communities , ” explains ayako ezaki from the international ecotourism society -lrb- ties -rrb- .
" both the environment and the populations visited should benefit in cultural , economic and environmental terms from tourism . "
so , why is n't everyone doing it ?
mainly , because ecotourism is considerably more expensive than a package trip – and to many , snagging a bargain still matters more than having a clear conscience .
responsible travel is a concept that has yet to sink in on a broader scale , despite the galloping pace of climate change .
not so very long ago , international travel was prohibitively costly , so only a privileged few could afford to see the world .
but recent decades have seen low-cost tourism boom – at least for the developed world .
some 900 million people a year take advantage of no-frills travel options every year , and the knock-on effect is a rapid rise in co2 levels .
growing awareness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in laos , tourists can stay overnight high up in centuries-old trees nevertheless , increasing numbers of travellers are realizing that it 's not okay to use liters of water every time they take a shower when locals lack access to a clean drinking water supply .
according to ties , the ecotourism sector has been growing by 34 percent each year since 1990 .
jonathan tourtellot from the national geographic center for sustainable destinations attributes the trend to increased awareness of environmental issues and the need to curb climate change .
" moreover , there 's also a growing interest in ' authentic ' destinations , " he says .
this means that tourists do n't just hole up in sterile hotels but get to actually explore their environment in all its natural beauty .
but even ecotourists tend to fly to their destinations , thereby adding to global co2 emissions .
and with their swimming pools , air conditioning , restaurants and cafés that remain lit up into the early hours of the morning , tourist centres all over the world consume high levels of energy .
by switching to renewable energies , hotels can also do their bit to make sustainable tourism a viable alternative .
one hotel on the island kho khao in thailnd has done just that .
the kho khao beach resort now meets most of its energy needs through a combination of solar and wind power units .
the hotel owners hope to cut the island 's carbon emissions by 20 percent , and in the long run , they hope that kho khao will provide a model for sustainable tourism in thailand .
putting the brakes on climate change is one aspect of green travel , and protecting natural habitats from the ravages of mass tourism is another .
kho khao is home to ocean turtles , dolphins and rare birds , and these will only survive if the local tourism industry develops at a gentle pace .
the economics of tourism bildunterschrift : getting to know the local population is one aspect of ecotourism yet another aspect of responsible tourism is the role it plays in the economies of developing nations .
ayako ekazi from ties explains that ecotourism should ideally help tackle local poverty and promote growth .
moreover , tourists can talk to locals and learn something about the country they are visiting – exchange of information and communication is inevitably constructive and educational .
" ecotourism is not a one-way street , ” says ezaki .
" these days it is often cited as an opportunity for growth in developing nations , but that does n't mean it does n't exist in the richer nations . ”
the national geographic center for sustainable destinations , for example , is currently working on an initiative in the douro valley in portugal to promote gentle tourism .
and even mallorca is not yet a lost cause : it 's home to numerous projects aimed at preserving the island 's countryside .
and after the spanish property crash of 2007 , the government put a stop to further hotel construction in many regions .

this year , the only fights were over how many dortmund players we could include . nick , ben and jefferson are all great admirers of what juergen klopp has done at dortmund , but matt has obviously come down with a serious case of yellow-and-black fever .
left to his own devices , he would have included no fewer than eight dortmund players in his top 11 .
in the end , the rest of us applied the restraints -lrb- that is , we tied him to his bed -rrb- , so that a few players from other teams got the credit they deserved as well .
we begin with a pair of excellent african strikers .
bildunterschrift : cisse has carried a huge load for freiburg fantastic forwards one player we all agreed on , even matt , was freiburg 's papiss demba cisse .
with his 13 goals , the senegalese striker has the small southwestern german club sniffing the rarefied air at seldom experienced elevations in the table .
matt put it best : " cisse is from another planet - one where one man is enough to propel a team like freiburg up to sixth . "
not shabby for a player who came from the french second division .
chapeau !
on numbers alone , frankfurt 's theofanis gekas would have been a logical choice , but we all felt that he has gotten a number of lucky goals .
matt wanted dortmund 's lukas barrios , while nick preferred schalke 's klaas-jan huntelaar , but jefferson and ben went for didier ya konan .
how important is he to hanover ?
consider this .
since he joined the club in 2009 , hanover have n't earned a single point with him out of the starting line-up .
that 's truly a most valuable player .
majestic midfield no arguments at all about where to start in midfield : dortmund 's nuri sahin and shinji kagawa .
but what can be said about this dynamic duo that has n't been said thousands of times before ?
well how about this ?
sahin is the smartest player in german football .
to watch him is to see a player who seems to know exactly what 's happening in all areas of the pitch at all times .
that 's the definition of a rudder , and you can bet lots of huge european clubs will be vying for his services in the summer .
there 's room for improvement , though - from the spot .
sahin failed to convert the two penalties he took this season , about the only thing he did wrong in the latter half of 2010 .
moving on to kagawa , the three things most often mentioned are 1 -rrb- he 's from japan , 2 -rrb- he only cost 300,000 euros and 3 -rrb- he runs around a lot .
that 's all true but being japanese and cheap hardly guarantees footballing success , and lots of players run around lots without posting eight goals as he has .
what 's often neglected is his fantastic on-the-ball technique .
when he cuts into the middle of the pitch , the only player who 's more dangerous from medium range is arjen robben .
bildunterschrift : this man 's spectacular goals have fans saying " play it again , sam " matt went purely dortmund for the rest of midfield , but the aesthetes among us agreed that we just had to have leverkusen 's sidney sam .
it 's not just that the 22-year-old sam has scored six goals - it 's the way he 's scored them .
for example , his 20-meter-plus volley against kaiserslautern .
or his curling left-footer against hoffenheim .
or ... oh , just go to youtube , and check them out for yourselves .
he 's joined by teammate arturo vidal . six of his eight goals may have come on penalties , but nerves count in football , and the chilean converted all his attempts .
and they were n't meaningless ones either .
they resulted in seven points .
vidal is a main reason perennial unstable leverkusen are playing with consistency and are the only team with a slight chance of overtaking dortmund .
dependable defenders and one great goalkeeper dortmund have by far and away the best defense in the league , so it 's no surprise that mats hummels and marcel schmelzer were unanimous choices .
bildunterschrift : it 's been mighty hard getting by hummels hummels is quite simply the best defender at the moment in germany .
bayern 's uli hoeness is man of few regrets , but he surely must rue the decision to let hummels go in 2008 .
-lrb- there are rumors , terrifying to dortmund fans , that there 's a buy-back clause in the defender 's contract . -rrb-
schmelzer , meanwhile , makes the squad because he excels at the position , left back , that most teams struggle to fill .
his ability to get forward make dortmund ambidextrous , so to speak , and that 's one reason why only two teams this season succeeded in stopping them .
bildunterschrift : the new lahm is an ochs at right back , you could pencil in philipp lahm most years , but this time round the honors go to frankfurt 's captain patrick ochs .
never heard of him ?
you 're not alone , but for years now he 's been one of the bundesliga 's best value-for-money players , equally adapt at protecting the back and going forward .
he 's also versatile , sometimes moving up to midfield , and dependable , having played all but a handful of minutes in frankfurt 's matches .
the other central defender was the trickiest .
nick and matt were in the majority , preferring dortmund 's neven subotic , and ben had the funniest argument for hanover 's emanuel pogatetz : " no team should be without a mad austrian bastard . "
but jefferson intervened , dictatorially , because he felt someone from mainz had to be included .
and since mainz coach thomas tuchel rotates all other positions , that man had to be their captain nikolce noveski .
the 31-year-old noveski has n't missed a single minute , and while lewis holtby and andre schuerrle have grabbed the press attention , mainz have the second-best defense in the league - and the second-best spot in the standings .
last but by no means least , there 's schalke 's manuel neuer .
a homegrown product , he kept the royal blues within striking distance during their horrid start - without him , schalke would almost certainly be in the relegation zone .
and his first-half performance in schalke 's 2-0 win over bayern was truly heroic , as he turned away shot after shot .
best goalkeeper in germany ?
no question about that - even dortmund-phile matt put him on the list .
best goalkeeper in the world ?
maybe .
and that 's a mark of just how good our bundesliga top xi is at the back .

thousands have been spending their nights in airports hoping their flights will take off . fresh snowfall overnight caused further setbacks at frankfurt airport , with no planes taking off or landing on tuesday morning .
around 130 departures , and a further 130 arrivals , were canceled at germany 's biggest air terminal .
one of the airport 's three runaways was reopened , allowing the first plane of the day to land at 8:28 a.m.
brussels airport and london heathrow , the world 's busiest airport , continued to experience disruption .
it was running a reduced number of flights on tuesday .
eurostar services from london to paris and brussels had also been hit .
speed restrictions mean that fewer trains were running .
eurostar asked " all customers booked to travel before christmas to refund or exchange their tickets free of charge , if their travel is not essential . "
thousands of passengers spent monday night waiting in airports and train stations , as the countdown to christmas shortens .
airports struggle airports were experiencing a backlog of passengers after hundreds of flights were cancelled over the weekend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : december is one of the most popular times to travel at frankfurt , some 340 of the 1,340 takeoffs and landings were canceled on monday , while at london heathrow , europe 's busiest airport , a very limited service began again on monday after a weekend of almost total standstill .
many other airports opened for a few hours before closing again .
the berlin airport operators said they did not expect services to return to normal before christmas .
the german transport minister , peter ramsauer , has suggested to local authorities that they allow flights at night , in order to clear the backlog of passengers .
the british authorities have already withdrawn the ban on night-flights until december 24 , christmas eve .
trains disrupted trains around berlin were seriously delayed on monday due to heavy snowfalls in the region .
throughout the country , frozen switches led to considerable problems .
a number of trains were canceled and , among those that ran , delays of over an hour were frequent .
speed limits were introduced on high-speed tracks to prevent damage to train undercarriages from blocks of ice .
the company operating almost all of germany 's long-distance trains , deutsche bahn , continued to warn passengers that trains were likely to be very crowded .
" there are likely to be considerable bottlenecks on major lines because of the cancelation of flights , " they wrote on their website .
throughout much of europe , railways were similarly disrupted .
even in southern sweden , which is used to heavy snow , 100 of 350 train journeys were cancelled on monday .
restrictions on the roads bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting around on foot has been the only option for many people on the roads too , the weather has caused serious disruption .
the authorities imposed a travel ban on buses and trucks in paris .
in parts of germany trucks weighing more than 7.5 tons were at times banned from freeways after a series of accidents in which tractor-trailers skidded and blocked the carriageway .
in the western state of north rhine-westphalia , there were 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- of traffic jams during the monday morning rush hour .
the police have been complaining that many drivers are still using summer tires , in spite of the icy conditions .
the chief executive of the association of local authorities , gerd landsberg , told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper that , after the costs of last year 's heavy winter , local governments would have to cut back on clearing the roads .

while in goethe 's day , singing was an integral part of life in germany , the collective choir of the nation has since fallen rather silent .
christmas can go some way to restarting a passion . rudolph tiersch grew up in a world of song .
when he was a child , friends would come and visit his family on sundays and would sit in the kitchen , drink tea , chat and laugh .
as televisions were still a rarity in those days , it was only ever a matter of time before someone would pick up a guitar and the assembled company would burst into song .
for tiersch , who is now 50 years old , they are happy memories .
and not only for what they were , but for what he describes as their ability to unite people .
" it brings people together and gives them a home singing about their religion or their country , " tiersch told deutsche welle .
" chanting is the simplest way to bring people together .
you always have a voice with you .
not everyone can play the guitar or the piano , but everyone can sing . "
a long healthy tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinmar the minnesinger the basic german volkslied has its roots in the 12th century , which gave birth to minnesingers , who largely sung of love .
over time , the songs came to deal with other important issues such as religion , social conditions , and the soul of the people .
by the 19th century it had been turned into an art form , laden with bourgeois expression .
when the nazis seized power in 1933 , they used the national tradition of folk to promote what they claimed to be pure and german .
they wrote new songs to the tune of national socialism , successfully using them as instruments for manipulation and propaganda .
once the war was over , the east german communist regime continued to manipulate the masses through music , as tiersch recalls .
" i recall a song called unsere heimat which poetically describes the beauty of the country set to a lyrical melody , " he said .
" the underlying message was that socialism made it possible . "
from passion to profession although much in germany has changed in the twenty years since reunification , too many decades of state-decreed singing appears to have robbed many people of their lust for letting it all out .
not so tiersch , whose love of song is so profound that he is a professional choirmaster .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the frankfurt / oder singing academy he is the head of the singakademie in the eastern german town of frankfurt / oder , which comprises a children 's , a youth , a concert and a chamber-choir .
the choirmaster has been awarded germany 's federal cross of merit for his efforts to bring singing back into everyday life .
he says he sees his choirs as a social network .
" it 's like a little society inside society , " the choirmaster said .
" you 've got the judge on that side and the salesman there , but they sing together , they 're talking together , maybe they drink beer together . "
seeing a mixed bag of people united through song pleases tiersch greatly , and as choir member antonia brill explains , there are plenty of benefits to being part of a group with music at its core .
" it helps you .
when you 're sad , you think about moments when you sang together with everyone and it feels good , or when you 're singing on your own at home , you feel better , " the 19-year-old said .
re-igniting the fire but antonia is not necessarily the rule .
rudolph tiersch says it is becoming increasingly difficult to encourage young germans to sing , a state of affairs which he finds alarming .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when better to sing than at christmas ?
" it has been scientifically proven that singing activates parts of the brain which otherwise lie idle , " he said .
" children who hear their parents sing before they are three years old are better at school than their classmates who have only consumed music in the media . "
he believes the over-emphasis of individual freedom in society as we know it today often leads to social isolation , and is keen to point out the sense of community which comes from singing together .
particularly at this time of year .
" christmas is becoming more and more commercial in germany , too , " he said .
" with prosperity we are moving away from the religious traditions which are part of every society .
but christmas singing takes us back to our roots . "
and to prove his point , he has his singers working on bach 's christmas oratorio , which he explains is all about bringing love into the world .
as his singing academy is based in the former gdr , where the state opposed the church , many of his choir members are not familiar with the religious concepts which the music conveys .
to set that right , they discuss the work as a group , the aim always being to give the audience goose-bumps .
" if we do n't , we 've done something wrong , " the choirmaster said .

thousands have been spending their nights in airports hoping their flights will take off . fresh snowfall overnight caused further setbacks at frankfurt airport , with no planes taking off or landing on tuesday morning .
around 130 departures , and a further 130 arrivals , were canceled at germany 's biggest air terminal .
one of the airport 's three runaways was reopened , allowing the first plane of the day to land at 8:28 a.m.
brussels airport and london heathrow , the world 's busiest airport , continued to experience disruption .
it was running a reduced number of flights on tuesday .
eurostar services from london to paris and brussels had also been hit .
speed restrictions mean that fewer trains were running .
eurostar asked " all customers booked to travel before christmas to refund or exchange their tickets free of charge , if their travel is not essential . "
thousands of passengers spent monday night waiting in airports and train stations , as the countdown to christmas shortens .
airports struggle airports were experiencing a backlog of passengers after hundreds of flights were cancelled over the weekend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : december is one of the most popular times to travel at frankfurt , some 340 of the 1,340 takeoffs and landings were canceled on monday , while at london heathrow , europe 's busiest airport , a very limited service began again on monday after a weekend of almost total standstill .
many other airports opened for a few hours before closing again .
the berlin airport operators said they did not expect services to return to normal before christmas .
the german transport minister , peter ramsauer , has suggested to local authorities that they allow flights at night , in order to clear the backlog of passengers .
the british authorities have already withdrawn the ban on night-flights until december 24 , christmas eve .
trains disrupted trains around berlin were seriously delayed on monday due to heavy snowfalls in the region .
throughout the country , frozen switches led to considerable problems .
a number of trains were canceled and , among those that ran , delays of over an hour were frequent .
speed limits were introduced on high-speed tracks to prevent damage to train undercarriages from blocks of ice .
the company operating almost all of germany 's long-distance trains , deutsche bahn , continued to warn passengers that trains were likely to be very crowded .
" there are likely to be considerable bottlenecks on major lines because of the cancelation of flights , " they wrote on their website .
throughout much of europe , railways were similarly disrupted .
even in southern sweden , which is used to heavy snow , 100 of 350 train journeys were cancelled on monday .
restrictions on the roads bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting around on foot has been the only option for many people on the roads too , the weather has caused serious disruption .
the authorities imposed a travel ban on buses and trucks in paris .
in parts of germany trucks weighing more than 7.5 tons were at times banned from freeways after a series of accidents in which tractor-trailers skidded and blocked the carriageway .
in the western state of north rhine-westphalia , there were 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- of traffic jams during the monday morning rush hour .
the police have been complaining that many drivers are still using summer tires , in spite of the icy conditions .
the chief executive of the association of local authorities , gerd landsberg , told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper that , after the costs of last year 's heavy winter , local governments would have to cut back on clearing the roads .
he said drivers would have to get used to driving on snowy roads , as they do in scandinavia .
although it 's expected that the weather will warm on thursday , another cold spell is forecast in time for christmas , although it is not expected to bring much snow .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 21.12.2010 german researchers develop ice-free windshield großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has been hit unusually early with winter this year it 's what most european drivers are dreaming of these days : a farewell to ice-scraping .
but drivers need some patience : the new technology is not ready for the market yet , the german researchers say . with snow continuing to fall and temperatures often below zero degree celsius -lrb- 32 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in many parts of the continent , many europeans currently have to get up earlier than usual to scrape off the ice covering the windshields of their cars before they can actually drive off .
that may soon be a thing of the past , according to german researchers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not ready for mass-production yet in recent months , scientists at the fraunhofer institute for surface technology -lrb- ist -rrb- in braunschweig , in north-central germany , have announced a new car window glass which they claim does not allow an ice layer to form in the first place - even at temperatures as low as minus 18 celsius .
last month , volkswagen joined the project , hoping to turn this research into a feature on its cars .
" -lsb- the window -rsb- has been well-understood on a laboratory scale , but now needs to be implemented for large-scale operation , " said harthmuth hoffmann , a volkswagen spokesperson , in an e-mail sent to deutsche welle .
the problem is that this coating can interfere with radio and mobile phone reception .
heat ca n't radiate skyward the new glass works differently from a heated window - it is based on a physical principle : a wafer-thin transparent coating of indium tin oxide is applied to the window .
" we call this a ' low-e ' -lrb- low thermal emissivity -rrb- coating , " said thomas drescher of volkswagen development , in an interview with the dpa news service .
" applied to the outer glazing , it prevents heat from radiating skyward . "
the conductive " low-e coating " protects the glass from cooling .
that way , water on the outer surface does not condense or freeze and there is no ice film in the first place because radiative heat loss to the cold sky is minimised and this prevents or delays cooling of the glass surface to below the dew point .
scientists have worked on similar projects for some 50 years , andreas klein from technical university of darmstadt told deutsche welle .
" the challenge here is that they 're creating a coating which is applied externally rather than inside .
so the mechanism will have to be able to withstand adverse weather conditions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : driving in winter could just become this little bit easier older systems work with layers made from tin oxide .
but these are far from perfect - both from a practical and an esthetical point of view , the researchers found .
when glass is bent , for instance , the old layers will break because the temperatures get too high .
" our new layer is extremely stable , " said bernd szyszka , an ist researcher , in a statement published on the fraunhofer institute 's website .
" temperatures of up to 900 degrees celsius are no problem .
even if you bend the layer extensively it stays the way it is . "
when the layer is used in windshields , of course , weather conditions such as cloudiness , relative humidity and wind can affect the windows ' condensation behaviour .
" the ' low-e coating ' can not prevent ice formation or condensation entirely , but it can significantly reduce the likelihood of it happening , " drescher added .
ice-free windshield still not ready for the mass market for now , one drawback with the system as it is is that the new coating limits radio traffic in the car , which can impair radio and mobile phone reception , added harthmuth hoffmann , the volkswagen spokesperson .
as such , it remains unclear as to when the first cars equipped with the new wind screen can roll out from volkswagen 's assembly lines .
" it will take some time before the ice-free car windscreen is market-ready , " drescher noted , " but we are working intensively toward this goal . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 21.12.2010 new german bill proposed for limited embryo screening großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bill 's backers want pgd only to prevent serious disease german members of parliament have presented draft legislation that would allow the screening of implanted embryos , but only to identify serious genetic diseases .
that goes too far for many lawmakers . parliamentarians from all german mainstream parties joined on tuesday to present a draft bill which would allow embryo screening - also known as pre-implantation genetic diagnosis or pgd - in narrowly defined situations .
two other draft bills are on the way , both taking an even more restrictive line .
the new bills are a response to a decision by the federal court of justice in july , that ruled that a total and unconditional ban of pgd would not be in line with the constitution .
one of the main proponents of the current bill , ulrike flach of the junior coalition partner in chancellor angela merkel 's government , the liberal free democrats , emphasized that it was not intended to open any floodgates .
" pre-implantation genetic diagnosis will , in general , still be banned , " she said .
" but it will be allowed under very special circumstances . "
those circumstances include cases where one parent suffers from a severe hereditary condition which could be passed on to the child and would lead to severe disease , stillbirth or miscarriage .
avoiding abortions peter hintze of angela merkel 's christian democrats , said that the kind of cases they were talking about could lead to late abortions , since pre-natal diagnosis for such conditions is legal .
" our bill focuses on the situation of the women affected , " he said .
" we want to keep them free of conflicts over pregnancy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel is one of the conservatives who oppose pgd on principle the bill would set up an ethics commission to decide which genetic conditions would justify the use of screening .
the commission would be able to respond to scientific developments , removing diseases from the list should cures become available .
pgd raises ethical questions because it also has the potential to screen for genetic characteristics unrelated to medical necessity .
anxieties about " designer babies " are not new , prompting jerzy montag of the opposition green party to try to calm any such fears " i 'm not thinking of parents who 'd like to have a musically gifted child , or one with blue eyes , or one that does n't suffer from obesity , " he said .
" but i 'm thinking for instance of a woman who already has a child suffering from a severe congenital disease , a woman who wants to have another child , but wants to ensure it has a better deal in life .
although the bill presented on tuesday is supported by members of all parties , it will not necessarily get majority support in the bundestag .
opponents , including those who will sponsor the other two drafts , fear that screening to remove undesirable genes , however serious , could eventually have an adverse impact on the way society treats people with disabilities .

they seized propaganda in the homes of some former members of a group that was outlawed in 2009 . police raided homes of suspected neo-nazis in four german states on tuesday in an effort to prevent a meeting of right-wing extremists from across the country from being held .
the homes in question are said to have belonged to members of the successor organization to the outlawed union of german youth faithful to the homeland -lrb- hdj -rrb- .
the state criminal police office in the northern city of hanover said in a statemet that police had seized right-wing extremist propoganda that members of the group allegedly planned to hand out to minors in youth camps .
just like hitler youth 's camps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hdj organization ran camps in the style of the hitler youth the hdj was banned by the then german interior minister , wolfgang schaeuble in march of 2009 , because the group had run camps based on the model of the hitler youth , teaching children as young as six that foreigners and jews were a threat to the nation .
according to police , after the hdj was banned , former members continued their work in the guise of the young national democrats .
police said there was a danger that the neo-nazis would have broken laws at their planned get-together , including incitement to racial hatred and wearing banned uniforms .
in addition to lower saxony , where hanover is the state capital , raids were carried out in berlin , rhineland-palatinate and baden-wuerttemberg .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 21.12.2010 eu tightens emissions restrictions for light trucks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : light trucks will be allowed to emit 147 grams co2 per kilometer from 2020 the eu 's environment ministers have agreed on emissions and mileage regulations for small vans and other utility vehicles .
but environmentalists say the new rules were largely influenced by germany 's strong car lobby . germany and the european union 's executive are praising an agreement among eu countries to tighten emissions rules for vehicles , but environmentalists are less convinced .
new regulations agreed on monday require vans and other utility vehicles to reduce their rate of carbon emissions per kilometre over the next decade , in a bid to drive down the transport sector 's share of greenhouse gasses .
european union environment ministers stipulated that from 2020 onwards , vehicles weighing up to 3.5 tons will only be allowed to emit 147 grams of co2 per kilometer , which translates into some 5.6 liters of diesel per kilometer .
today , light trucks are allowed to emit 200 grams per kilometer .
" it 's a very good compromise on something that was a source of debate for a long time , " said norbert roettgen , germany 's environment minister , adding that the new regulations will help the environment without placing too much of a burden on the car industry .
hopes are that the decision will help create new jobs .
demand for fuel-saving engines will be on the rise over the next decade because of rising petrol prices , says claudia kemfert from the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- . " in times of globalization a country 's competitive edge will depend on their ability to build energy-saving products and vehicles , " kemfert told deutsche welle .
" so germany and europe can gain a competitive advantage by launching these technologies first . "
ending a heated debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's environment minister says the new rules are a ' good compromise ' the issue has long been a point of conflict within the bloc , with germany pushing for regulations not to go below 150 grams of co2 per kilometer .
together with the eu 's two other major car-producing countries france and italy , germany had opposed stricter suggestions by the eu 's executive , the european commission .
the commission had demanded limitations of 135 grams of co2 per kilometer for light trucks , yet the eu 's climate chief , connie hedegaard , also described the compromise as a step forward .
" we have got things that are definitely more ambitious than what the industry and the sector claimed that they could do , " she said at a press conference .
the european parliament still has to approve the decision , with a vote expected in mid-january .
the new regulations could increase prices for small trucks by several thousand euros .
producers whose vehicles exceed the 147 grams per kilometer will have to pay a fine of 95 euros per gram per vehicle .
the regulations are staggered , so that by 2014 emissions for light trucks are supposed to go down to 175 grams of co2 per kilometer .
currently regulations are only in place for private cars .
their emissions are supposed to fall below 130 grams of co2 per kilometer by 2012 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists say germany 's car lobby has again shown its strength german car lobby environmentalists complained that the decision watered down what the european commission proposed in 2009 .
" it 's very disappointing and yet another example of germany preventing more progressive politics from being put in place " , wolfgang lohbeck from greenpeace told deutsche welle .
" it shows that the german car lobby is very strong . "
" you could argue that -lrb- monday 's -rrb- decision was in fact not that important , " said lohbeck , adding that small vans and other utility vehicles only make up about eight percent of all cars on german roads .
according to the german environment ministry , these vehicles are responsible for some six percent of co2 emissions caused by traffic .
environmentalists are now concerned , lohbeck told deutsche welle , that the car lobby will continue to resist future decisions .
the regulations for cars , which were introduced last year , will soon be reviewed again by the eu .
" i hope that monday 's decision was not a bad premonition for what they 'll decide there , " lohbeck said .

she wants a much clearer outline of citizen rights with respect to how their data is used . european union justice commissioner , viviane reding , has slammed the american government for not showing a serious interest in data protection rights .
the united states and eu are at odds over washington 's drive for increased access to european citizens ' bank and flight records .
european authorities do n't believe that their us counterparts are adequately protecting consumer rights .
" from the outset , we have noted an apparent lack of interest on the us side to talk seriously about data protection , " reding said in a statement released on monday , just two weeks after holding talks with high-level american officials , including with us attorney general eric holder and janet napolitano , the secretary of homeland security .
in the same statement , reding described those officials as " unprepared " and " uninterested " in data privacy issues .
" they have not even appointed a negotiator , " she added in the statement , but noted that she " expects " the telephone number of the negotiator before year 's end .
meanwhile , the european union has designated françoise le bail , the director general of the commission 's department for justice , as its negotiator .
eu pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american ambassador to the eu , william e. kennard disagrees with reding 's charges brussels is pushing washington for a document that would clearly outline the basis of future data-sharing agreements .
earlier this month , the eu 's 27 justice ministers gave the bloc 's executive the green light to negotiate a " personal data protection agreement " with washington .
the agreement would aim to prevent the abuse of europeans ' privacy as authorities share information in the struggle against terrorism and other crimes .
the eu is seeking " more proportionate " use of this data as well as the right for eu citizens to modify and delete information and take the government to court over abuses of their data .
reding also is encouraging the americans to create an independent data protection supervisory position , which exists in all eu member states .
in a press conference in brussels on monday , the american ambassador to the european union dismissed reding 's statement .
" i disagree - we 're moving ahead , " he said .

thousands have been spending their nights in airports hoping their flights will take off . fresh snowfall overnight caused further setbacks at frankfurt airport , with no planes taking off or landing on tuesday morning .
around 130 departures , and a further 130 arrivals , were canceled at germany 's biggest air terminal .
one of the airport 's three runaways was reopened , allowing the first plane of the day to land at 8:28 a.m.
brussels airport and london heathrow , the world 's busiest airport , continued to experience disruption .
it was running a reduced number of flights on tuesday .
eurostar services from london to paris and brussels had also been hit .
speed restrictions mean that fewer trains were running .
eurostar asked " all customers booked to travel before christmas to refund or exchange their tickets free of charge , if their travel is not essential . "
thousands of passengers spent monday night waiting in airports and train stations , as the countdown to christmas shortens .
airports struggle airports were experiencing a backlog of passengers after hundreds of flights were cancelled over the weekend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : december is one of the most popular times to travel at frankfurt , some 340 of the 1,340 takeoffs and landings were canceled on monday , while at london heathrow , europe 's busiest airport , a very limited service began again on monday after a weekend of almost total standstill .
many other airports opened for a few hours before closing again .
the berlin airport operators said they did not expect services to return to normal before christmas .
the german transport minister , peter ramsauer , has suggested to local authorities that they allow flights at night , in order to clear the backlog of passengers .
the british authorities have already withdrawn the ban on night-flights until december 24 , christmas eve .
trains disrupted trains around berlin were seriously delayed on monday due to heavy snowfalls in the region .
throughout the country , frozen switches led to considerable problems .
a number of trains were canceled and , among those that ran , delays of over an hour were frequent .
speed limits were introduced on high-speed tracks to prevent damage to train undercarriages from blocks of ice .
the company operating almost all of germany 's long-distance trains , deutsche bahn , continued to warn passengers that trains were likely to be very crowded .
" there are likely to be considerable bottlenecks on major lines because of the cancelation of flights , " they wrote on their website .
throughout much of europe , railways were similarly disrupted .
even in southern sweden , which is used to heavy snow , 100 of 350 train journeys were cancelled on monday .
restrictions on the roads bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting around on foot has been the only option for many people on the roads too , the weather has caused serious disruption .
the authorities imposed a travel ban on buses and trucks in paris .
in parts of germany trucks weighing more than 7.5 tons were at times banned from freeways after a series of accidents in which tractor-trailers skidded and blocked the carriageway .
in the western state of north rhine-westphalia , there were 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- of traffic jams during the monday morning rush hour .
the police have been complaining that many drivers are still using summer tires , in spite of the icy conditions .
the chief executive of the association of local authorities , gerd landsberg , told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper that , after the costs of last year 's heavy winter , local governments would have to cut back on clearing the roads .
he said drivers would have to get used to driving on snowy roads , as they do in scandinavia .
although it 's expected that the weather will warm on thursday , another cold spell is forecast in time for christmas , although it is not expected to bring much snow .

this year , the only fights were over how many dortmund players we could include . nick , ben and jefferson are all great admirers of what juergen klopp has done at dortmund , but matt has obviously come down with a serious case of yellow-and-black fever .
left to his own devices , he would have included no fewer than eight dortmund players in his top 11 .
in the end , the rest of us applied the restraints -lrb- that is , we tied him to his bed -rrb- , so that a few players from other teams got the credit they deserved as well .
we begin with a pair of excellent african strikers .
bildunterschrift : cisse has carried a huge load for freiburg fantastic forwards one player we all agreed on , even matt , was freiburg 's papiss demba cisse .
with his 13 goals , the senegalese striker has the small southwestern german club sniffing the rarefied air at seldom experienced elevations in the table .
matt put it best : " cisse is from another planet - one where one man is enough to propel a team like freiburg up to sixth . "
not shabby for a player who came from the french second division .
chapeau !
on numbers alone , frankfurt 's theofanis gekas would have been a logical choice , but we all felt that he has gotten a number of lucky goals .
matt wanted dortmund 's lukas barrios , while nick preferred schalke 's klaas-jan huntelaar , but jefferson and ben went for didier ya konan .
how important is he to hanover ?
consider this .
since he joined the club in 2009 , hanover have n't earned a single point with him out of the starting line-up .
that 's truly a most valuable player .
majestic midfield no arguments at all about where to start in midfield : dortmund 's nuri sahin and shinji kagawa .
but what can be said about this dynamic duo that has n't been said thousands of times before ?
well how about this ?
sahin is the smartest player in german football .
to watch him is to see a player who seems to know exactly what 's happening in all areas of the pitch at all times .
that 's the definition of a rudder , and you can bet lots of huge european clubs will be vying for his services in the summer .
there 's room for improvement , though - from the spot .
sahin failed to convert the two penalties he took this season , about the only thing he did wrong in the latter half of 2010 .
moving on to kagawa , the three things most often mentioned are 1 -rrb- he 's from japan , 2 -rrb- he only cost 300,000 euros and 3 -rrb- he runs around a lot .
that 's all true but being japanese and cheap hardly guarantees footballing success , and lots of players run around lots without posting eight goals as he has .
what 's often neglected is his fantastic on-the-ball technique .
when he cuts into the middle of the pitch , the only player who 's more dangerous from medium range is arjen robben .
bildunterschrift : this man 's spectacular goals have fans saying " play it again , sam " matt went purely dortmund for the rest of midfield , but the aesthetes among us agreed that we just had to have leverkusen 's sidney sam .
it 's not just that the 22-year-old sam has scored six goals - it 's the way he 's scored them .
for example , his 20-meter-plus volley against kaiserslautern .
or his curling left-footer against hoffenheim .
or ... oh , just go to youtube , and check them out for yourselves .
he 's joined by teammate arturo vidal . six of his eight goals may have come on penalties , but nerves count in football , and the chilean converted all his attempts .
and they were n't meaningless ones either .
they resulted in seven points .
vidal is a main reason perennial unstable leverkusen are playing with consistency and are the only team with a slight chance of overtaking dortmund .
dependable defenders and one great goalkeeper dortmund have by far and away the best defense in the league , so it 's no surprise that mats hummels and marcel schmelzer were unanimous choices .
bildunterschrift : it 's been mighty hard getting by hummels hummels is quite simply the best defender at the moment in germany .
bayern 's uli hoeness is man of few regrets , but he surely must rue the decision to let hummels go in 2008 .
-lrb- there are rumors , terrifying to dortmund fans , that there 's a buy-back clause in the defender 's contract . -rrb-
schmelzer , meanwhile , makes the squad because he excels at the position , left back , that most teams struggle to fill .
his ability to get forward make dortmund ambidextrous , so to speak , and that 's one reason why only two teams this season succeeded in stopping them .
bildunterschrift : the new lahm is an ochs at right back , you could pencil in philipp lahm most years , but this time round the honors go to frankfurt 's captain patrick ochs .
never heard of him ?
you 're not alone , but for years now he 's been one of the bundesliga 's best value-for-money players , equally adapt at protecting the back and going forward .
he 's also versatile , sometimes moving up to midfield , and dependable , having played all but a handful of minutes in frankfurt 's matches .
the other central defender was the trickiest .
nick and matt were in the majority , preferring dortmund 's neven subotic , and ben had the funniest argument for hanover 's emanuel pogatetz : " no team should be without a mad austrian bastard . "
but jefferson intervened , dictatorially , because he felt someone from mainz had to be included .
and since mainz coach thomas tuchel rotates all other positions , that man had to be their captain nikolce noveski .
the 31-year-old noveski has n't missed a single minute , and while lewis holtby and andre schuerrle have grabbed the press attention , mainz have the second-best defense in the league - and the second-best spot in the standings .
last but by no means least , there 's schalke 's manuel neuer .
a homegrown product , he kept the royal blues within striking distance during their horrid start - without him , schalke would almost certainly be in the relegation zone .
and his first-half performance in schalke 's 2-0 win over bayern was truly heroic , as he turned away shot after shot .
best goalkeeper in germany ?
no question about that - even dortmund-phile matt put him on the list .
best goalkeeper in the world ?
maybe .
and that 's a mark of just how good our bundesliga top xi is at the back .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 21.12.2010 no presents this year in corporate germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cash gifts are absolutely off limits in germany a major german industry association is urging managers to rethink corporate christmas gifts this year .
it does n't want to spoil the cheer , but reminds everybody of the dangers of corruption . christmas is just around the corner , and people are scrambling to find the perfect presents to stack under the tree .
but one organization is n't feeling the festive spirit and wants to do away with presents entirely – at least in the world of business .
the german association of materials management , purchasing and logistics -lrb- ammpl -rrb- says gifts have no place in business and that a good supplier wo n't need them to keep its customers .
the association represents some 8,000 members , and in 2008 established a ' code of conduct ' which covers corporate gift giving .
but it 's not always easy to draw a line between a small token of appreciation and a gift that could open the door to a host of ethical dilemmas .
that 's why sebastian schroeder , an ammpl compliance expert , says the code of conduct drafted by his organization lets companies decide what limits are acceptable .
comparable business dinners in london , hamburg or shanghai come at very different prices , he pointed out .
" ultimately it is up to the individual employee of a company to determine if a present has been made in good faith , " he told deutsche welle .
" we did n't set a limit to the value of presents . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airport operator fraport says its staff know what 's acceptable despite their clean-cut reputation , german managers have gone astray on numerous occasions .
in recent years , corruption scandals have rocked companies including siemens , man , daimler , and volkswagen .
intercultural challenge in a globalized business environment , there 's always the issue of differing cultural expectations .
representatives from asian , middle eastern and south american companies are likely to expect a tighter bond with business partners than many germans are used to , schroeder said .
" they close deals based more on personal trust , " he said .
" and sometimes a german buyer shows up and wants to get right to the deal and sign a contract , only to find there are certain limitations . "
in china , for instance , monetary gifts are not at all uncommon , although they are " clearly not acceptable in europe and the united states , " schroeder said .
companies may be reluctant to insult their business partners by returning a gift , giving rise to the challenge of different cultural expectations .
wariness of owing favors clemens von stockert , a manager in the compliance department of fraport airport in frankfurt , says his company deals with potential problems by banning gifts like airline tickets , car shares , and inexpensive credit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the thought that counts : dinner comes at a different price depending on the city a dinner out is fine – it 's gone after having been eaten .
but anything over 35 euros should be internally documented , according to von stockert .
" the important thing is that people do n't put themselves in a position of dependency , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have clear rules that money and anything with monetary value are not to be accepted . "
gift giving has decreased in volume during recent years , according to von stockert , but occasionally someone in the company will receive a present .
if it ca n't be given back without jeopardizing a business relationship , then it 's likely to end up going to charity ... and the company has to pay taxes on it .
" nowadays more companies are keeping these regulations in mind when it comes to accepting gifts and giving them , " von stockert said .
sebastian schroeder of ammpl added the idea is n't to spoil christmas fun , but to foster an environment where companies work together " fairly and in a spirit of partnership . "
" it is true that christmas and similar holidays are used as an opportunity to intensify existing relationships between companies , " he said .

while in goethe 's day , singing was an integral part of life in germany , the collective choir of the nation has since fallen rather silent .
christmas can go some way to restarting a passion . rudolph tiersch grew up in a world of song .
when he was a child , friends would come and visit his family on sundays and would sit in the kitchen , drink tea , chat and laugh .
as televisions were still a rarity in those days , it was only ever a matter of time before someone would pick up a guitar and the assembled company would burst into song .
for tiersch , who is now 50 years old , they are happy memories .
and not only for what they were , but for what he describes as their ability to unite people .
" it brings people together and gives them a home singing about their religion or their country , " tiersch told deutsche welle .
" chanting is the simplest way to bring people together .
you always have a voice with you .
not everyone can play the guitar or the piano , but everyone can sing . "
a long healthy tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinmar the minnesinger the basic german volkslied has its roots in the 12th century , which gave birth to minnesingers , who largely sung of love .
over time , the songs came to deal with other important issues such as religion , social conditions , and the soul of the people .
by the 19th century it had been turned into an art form , laden with bourgeois expression .
when the nazis seized power in 1933 , they used the national tradition of folk to promote what they claimed to be pure and german .
they wrote new songs to the tune of national socialism , successfully using them as instruments for manipulation and propaganda .
once the war was over , the east german communist regime continued to manipulate the masses through music , as tiersch recalls .
" i recall a song called unsere heimat which poetically describes the beauty of the country set to a lyrical melody , " he said .
" the underlying message was that socialism made it possible . "
from passion to profession although much in germany has changed in the twenty years since reunification , too many decades of state-decreed singing appears to have robbed many people of their lust for letting it all out .
not so tiersch , whose love of song is so profound that he is a professional choirmaster .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the frankfurt / oder singing academy he is the head of the singakademie in the eastern german town of frankfurt / oder , which comprises a children 's , a youth , a concert and a chamber-choir .
the choirmaster has been awarded germany 's federal cross of merit for his efforts to bring singing back into everyday life .
he says he sees his choirs as a social network .
" it 's like a little society inside society , " the choirmaster said .
" you 've got the judge on that side and the salesman there , but they sing together , they 're talking together , maybe they drink beer together . "
seeing a mixed bag of people united through song pleases tiersch greatly , and as choir member antonia brill explains , there are plenty of benefits to being part of a group with music at its core .
" it helps you .
when you 're sad , you think about moments when you sang together with everyone and it feels good , or when you 're singing on your own at home , you feel better , " the 19-year-old said .
re-igniting the fire but antonia is not necessarily the rule .
rudolph tiersch says it is becoming increasingly difficult to encourage young germans to sing , a state of affairs which he finds alarming .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when better to sing than at christmas ?
" it has been scientifically proven that singing activates parts of the brain which otherwise lie idle , " he said .
" children who hear their parents sing before they are three years old are better at school than their classmates who have only consumed music in the media . "
he believes the over-emphasis of individual freedom in society as we know it today often leads to social isolation , and is keen to point out the sense of community which comes from singing together .
particularly at this time of year .
" christmas is becoming more and more commercial in germany , too , " he said .
" with prosperity we are moving away from the religious traditions which are part of every society .
but christmas singing takes us back to our roots . "
and to prove his point , he has his singers working on bach 's christmas oratorio , which he explains is all about bringing love into the world .
as his singing academy is based in the former gdr , where the state opposed the church , many of his choir members are not familiar with the religious concepts which the music conveys .
to set that right , they discuss the work as a group , the aim always being to give the audience goose-bumps .
" if we do n't , we 've done something wrong , " the choirmaster said .

thousands have been spending their nights in airports hoping their flights will take off . fresh snowfall overnight caused further setbacks at frankfurt airport , with no planes taking off or landing on tuesday morning .
around 130 departures , and a further 130 arrivals , were canceled at germany 's biggest air terminal .
one of the airport 's three runaways was reopened , allowing the first plane of the day to land at 8:28 a.m.
brussels airport and london heathrow , the world 's busiest airport , continued to experience disruption .
it was running a reduced number of flights on tuesday .
eurostar services from london to paris and brussels had also been hit .
speed restrictions mean that fewer trains were running .
eurostar asked " all customers booked to travel before christmas to refund or exchange their tickets free of charge , if their travel is not essential . "
thousands of passengers spent monday night waiting in airports and train stations , as the countdown to christmas shortens .
airports struggle airports were experiencing a backlog of passengers after hundreds of flights were cancelled over the weekend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : december is one of the most popular times to travel at frankfurt , some 340 of the 1,340 takeoffs and landings were canceled on monday , while at london heathrow , europe 's busiest airport , a very limited service began again on monday after a weekend of almost total standstill .
many other airports opened for a few hours before closing again .
the berlin airport operators said they did not expect services to return to normal before christmas .
the german transport minister , peter ramsauer , has suggested to local authorities that they allow flights at night , in order to clear the backlog of passengers .
the british authorities have already withdrawn the ban on night-flights until december 24 , christmas eve .
trains disrupted trains around berlin were seriously delayed on monday due to heavy snowfalls in the region .
throughout the country , frozen switches led to considerable problems .
a number of trains were canceled and , among those that ran , delays of over an hour were frequent .
speed limits were introduced on high-speed tracks to prevent damage to train undercarriages from blocks of ice .
the company operating almost all of germany 's long-distance trains , deutsche bahn , continued to warn passengers that trains were likely to be very crowded .
" there are likely to be considerable bottlenecks on major lines because of the cancelation of flights , " they wrote on their website .
throughout much of europe , railways were similarly disrupted .
even in southern sweden , which is used to heavy snow , 100 of 350 train journeys were cancelled on monday .
restrictions on the roads bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting around on foot has been the only option for many people on the roads too , the weather has caused serious disruption .
the authorities imposed a travel ban on buses and trucks in paris .
in parts of germany trucks weighing more than 7.5 tons were at times banned from freeways after a series of accidents in which tractor-trailers skidded and blocked the carriageway .
in the western state of north rhine-westphalia , there were 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- of traffic jams during the monday morning rush hour .
the police have been complaining that many drivers are still using summer tires , in spite of the icy conditions .
the chief executive of the association of local authorities , gerd landsberg , told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper that , after the costs of last year 's heavy winter , local governments would have to cut back on clearing the roads .
he said drivers would have to get used to driving on snowy roads , as they do in scandinavia .
although it 's expected that the weather will warm on thursday , another cold spell is forecast in time for christmas , although it is not expected to bring much snow .

this year , the only fights were over how many dortmund players we could include . nick , ben and jefferson are all great admirers of what juergen klopp has done at dortmund , but matt has obviously come down with a serious case of yellow-and-black fever .
left to his own devices , he would have included no fewer than eight dortmund players in his top 11 .
in the end , the rest of us applied the restraints -lrb- that is , we tied him to his bed -rrb- , so that a few players from other teams got the credit they deserved as well .
we begin with a pair of excellent african strikers .
bildunterschrift : cisse has carried a huge load for freiburg fantastic forwards one player we all agreed on , even matt , was freiburg 's papiss demba cisse .
with his 13 goals , the senegalese striker has the small southwestern german club sniffing the rarefied air at seldom experienced elevations in the table .
matt put it best : " cisse is from another planet - one where one man is enough to propel a team like freiburg up to sixth . "
not shabby for a player who came from the french second division .
chapeau !
on numbers alone , frankfurt 's theofanis gekas would have been a logical choice , but we all felt that he has gotten a number of lucky goals .
matt wanted dortmund 's lukas barrios , while nick preferred schalke 's klaas-jan huntelaar , but jefferson and ben went for didier ya konan .
how important is he to hanover ?
consider this .
since he joined the club in 2009 , hanover have n't earned a single point with him out of the starting line-up .
that 's truly a most valuable player .
majestic midfield no arguments at all about where to start in midfield : dortmund 's nuri sahin and shinji kagawa .
but what can be said about this dynamic duo that has n't been said thousands of times before ?
well how about this ?
sahin is the smartest player in german football .
to watch him is to see a player who seems to know exactly what 's happening in all areas of the pitch at all times .
that 's the definition of a rudder , and you can bet lots of huge european clubs will be vying for his services in the summer .
there 's room for improvement , though - from the spot .
sahin failed to convert the two penalties he took this season , about the only thing he did wrong in the latter half of 2010 .
moving on to kagawa , the three things most often mentioned are 1 -rrb- he 's from japan , 2 -rrb- he only cost 300,000 euros and 3 -rrb- he runs around a lot .
that 's all true but being japanese and cheap hardly guarantees footballing success , and lots of players run around lots without posting eight goals as he has .
what 's often neglected is his fantastic on-the-ball technique .
when he cuts into the middle of the pitch , the only player who 's more dangerous from medium range is arjen robben .
bildunterschrift : this man 's spectacular goals have fans saying " play it again , sam " matt went purely dortmund for the rest of midfield , but the aesthetes among us agreed that we just had to have leverkusen 's sidney sam .
it 's not just that the 22-year-old sam has scored six goals - it 's the way he 's scored them .
for example , his 20-meter-plus volley against kaiserslautern .
or his curling left-footer against hoffenheim .
or ... oh , just go to youtube , and check them out for yourselves .
he 's joined by teammate arturo vidal . six of his eight goals may have come on penalties , but nerves count in football , and the chilean converted all his attempts .
and they were n't meaningless ones either .
they resulted in seven points .
vidal is a main reason perennial unstable leverkusen are playing with consistency and are the only team with a slight chance of overtaking dortmund .
dependable defenders and one great goalkeeper dortmund have by far and away the best defense in the league , so it 's no surprise that mats hummels and marcel schmelzer were unanimous choices .
bildunterschrift : it 's been mighty hard getting by hummels hummels is quite simply the best defender at the moment in germany .
bayern 's uli hoeness is man of few regrets , but he surely must rue the decision to let hummels go in 2008 .
-lrb- there are rumors , terrifying to dortmund fans , that there 's a buy-back clause in the defender 's contract . -rrb-
schmelzer , meanwhile , makes the squad because he excels at the position , left back , that most teams struggle to fill .
his ability to get forward make dortmund ambidextrous , so to speak , and that 's one reason why only two teams this season succeeded in stopping them .
bildunterschrift : the new lahm is an ochs at right back , you could pencil in philipp lahm most years , but this time round the honors go to frankfurt 's captain patrick ochs .
never heard of him ?
you 're not alone , but for years now he 's been one of the bundesliga 's best value-for-money players , equally adapt at protecting the back and going forward .
he 's also versatile , sometimes moving up to midfield , and dependable , having played all but a handful of minutes in frankfurt 's matches .
the other central defender was the trickiest .
nick and matt were in the majority , preferring dortmund 's neven subotic , and ben had the funniest argument for hanover 's emanuel pogatetz : " no team should be without a mad austrian bastard . "
but jefferson intervened , dictatorially , because he felt someone from mainz had to be included .
and since mainz coach thomas tuchel rotates all other positions , that man had to be their captain nikolce noveski .
the 31-year-old noveski has n't missed a single minute , and while lewis holtby and andre schuerrle have grabbed the press attention , mainz have the second-best defense in the league - and the second-best spot in the standings .
last but by no means least , there 's schalke 's manuel neuer .
a homegrown product , he kept the royal blues within striking distance during their horrid start - without him , schalke would almost certainly be in the relegation zone .
and his first-half performance in schalke 's 2-0 win over bayern was truly heroic , as he turned away shot after shot .
best goalkeeper in germany ?
no question about that - even dortmund-phile matt put him on the list .
best goalkeeper in the world ?
maybe .
and that 's a mark of just how good our bundesliga top xi is at the back .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 21.12.2010 no presents this year in corporate germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cash gifts are absolutely off limits in germany a major german industry association is urging managers to rethink corporate christmas gifts this year .
it does n't want to spoil the cheer , but reminds everybody of the dangers of corruption . christmas is just around the corner , and people are scrambling to find the perfect presents to stack under the tree .
but one organization is n't feeling the festive spirit and wants to do away with presents entirely – at least in the world of business .
the german association of materials management , purchasing and logistics -lrb- ammpl -rrb- says gifts have no place in business and that a good supplier wo n't need them to keep its customers .
the association represents some 8,000 members , and in 2008 established a ' code of conduct ' which covers corporate gift giving .
but it 's not always easy to draw a line between a small token of appreciation and a gift that could open the door to a host of ethical dilemmas .
that 's why sebastian schroeder , an ammpl compliance expert , says the code of conduct drafted by his organization lets companies decide what limits are acceptable .
comparable business dinners in london , hamburg or shanghai come at very different prices , he pointed out .
" ultimately it is up to the individual employee of a company to determine if a present has been made in good faith , " he told deutsche welle .
" we did n't set a limit to the value of presents . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airport operator fraport says its staff know what 's acceptable despite their clean-cut reputation , german managers have gone astray on numerous occasions .
in recent years , corruption scandals have rocked companies including siemens , man , daimler , and volkswagen .
intercultural challenge in a globalized business environment , there 's always the issue of differing cultural expectations .
representatives from asian , middle eastern and south american companies are likely to expect a tighter bond with business partners than many germans are used to , schroeder said .
" they close deals based more on personal trust , " he said .
" and sometimes a german buyer shows up and wants to get right to the deal and sign a contract , only to find there are certain limitations . "
in china , for instance , monetary gifts are not at all uncommon , although they are " clearly not acceptable in europe and the united states , " schroeder said .
companies may be reluctant to insult their business partners by returning a gift , giving rise to the challenge of different cultural expectations .
wariness of owing favors clemens von stockert , a manager in the compliance department of fraport airport in frankfurt , says his company deals with potential problems by banning gifts like airline tickets , car shares , and inexpensive credit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the thought that counts : dinner comes at a different price depending on the city a dinner out is fine – it 's gone after having been eaten .
but anything over 35 euros should be internally documented , according to von stockert .
" the important thing is that people do n't put themselves in a position of dependency , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have clear rules that money and anything with monetary value are not to be accepted . "
gift giving has decreased in volume during recent years , according to von stockert , but occasionally someone in the company will receive a present .
if it ca n't be given back without jeopardizing a business relationship , then it 's likely to end up going to charity ... and the company has to pay taxes on it .
" nowadays more companies are keeping these regulations in mind when it comes to accepting gifts and giving them , " von stockert said .
sebastian schroeder of ammpl added the idea is n't to spoil christmas fun , but to foster an environment where companies work together " fairly and in a spirit of partnership . "
" it is true that christmas and similar holidays are used as an opportunity to intensify existing relationships between companies , " he said .

he told monday 's berliner zeitung newspaper , " the welfare of the child must be the first consideration .
it 's not so much an issue of whether the adults want to live as a happy family .
i do n't believe that children want to grow up in a homosexual partnership . "
uta kehr , spokeswoman for the association of lesbians and gays in germany , said that kauder was encouraging prejudices against homosexual parents who care for children .
but worse still was the fact that he was humiliating homosexual parents in the eyes of their children .
" how will the 15-year-old son of a lesbian couple feel , for example , if he reads such things in the paper ? " she said .
children in " rainbow " families just as happy her position was backed up by leaders of the green party , who also pointed out that the german ministry for family affairs had recently published a study showing children who lived in so-called " rainbow " families felt just as well-looked-after and were just as successful as children of the same age in conventional families .

the german parliament is to have a free vote on proposals to allow highly restricted access to pgd in cases where there are good grounds to fear that the unborn child could suffer from a serious genetic disease .
kauder argued in the interview that " pgd opens the door to the temptation to select and manipulate life . "
but , he said , there was no " right to a child . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 21.12.2010 german researchers develop ice-free windshield großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has been hit unusually early with winter this year it 's what most european drivers are dreaming of these days : a farewell to ice-scraping .
but drivers need some patience : the new technology is not ready for the market yet , the german researchers say . with snow continuing to fall and temperatures often below zero degree celsius -lrb- 32 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in many parts of the continent , many europeans currently have to get up earlier than usual to scrape off the ice covering the windshields of their cars before they can actually drive off .
that may soon be a thing of the past , according to german researchers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not ready for mass-production yet in recent months , scientists at the fraunhofer institute for surface technology -lrb- ist -rrb- in braunschweig , in north-central germany , have announced a new car window glass which they claim does not allow an ice layer to form in the first place - even at temperatures as low as minus 18 celsius .
last month , volkswagen joined the project , hoping to turn this research into a feature on its cars .
" -lsb- the window -rsb- has been well-understood on a laboratory scale , but now needs to be implemented for large-scale operation , " said harthmuth hoffmann , a volkswagen spokesperson , in an e-mail sent to deutsche welle .
the problem is that this coating can interfere with radio and mobile phone reception .
heat ca n't radiate skyward the new glass works differently from a heated window - it is based on a physical principle : a wafer-thin transparent coating of indium tin oxide is applied to the window .
" we call this a ' low-e ' -lrb- low thermal emissivity -rrb- coating , " said thomas drescher of volkswagen development , in an interview with the dpa news service .
" applied to the outer glazing , it prevents heat from radiating skyward . "
the conductive " low-e coating " protects the glass from cooling .
that way , water on the outer surface does not condense or freeze and there is no ice film in the first place because radiative heat loss to the cold sky is minimised and this prevents or delays cooling of the glass surface to below the dew point .
scientists have worked on similar projects for some 50 years , andreas klein from technical university of darmstadt told deutsche welle .
" the challenge here is that they 're creating a coating which is applied externally rather than inside .
so the mechanism will have to be able to withstand adverse weather conditions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : driving in winter could just become this little bit easier older systems work with layers made from tin oxide .
but these are far from perfect - both from a practical and an esthetical point of view , the researchers found .
when glass is bent , for instance , the old layers will break because the temperatures get too high .
" our new layer is extremely stable , " said bernd szyszka , an ist researcher , in a statement published on the fraunhofer institute 's website .
" temperatures of up to 900 degrees celsius are no problem .
even if you bend the layer extensively it stays the way it is . "
when the layer is used in windshields , of course , weather conditions such as cloudiness , relative humidity and wind can affect the windows ' condensation behaviour .
" the ' low-e coating ' can not prevent ice formation or condensation entirely , but it can significantly reduce the likelihood of it happening , " drescher added .
ice-free windshield still not ready for the mass market for now , one drawback with the system as it is is that the new coating limits radio traffic in the car , which can impair radio and mobile phone reception , added harthmuth hoffmann , the volkswagen spokesperson .
as such , it remains unclear as to when the first cars equipped with the new wind screen can roll out from volkswagen 's assembly lines .
" it will take some time before the ice-free car windscreen is market-ready , " drescher noted , " but we are working intensively toward this goal . "

but drivers need some patience : the new technology is not ready for the market yet , the german researchers say . with snow continuing to fall and temperatures often below zero degree celsius -lrb- 32 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in many parts of the continent , many europeans currently have to get up earlier than usual to scrape off the ice covering the windshields of their cars before they can actually drive off .
that may soon be a thing of the past , according to german researchers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not ready for mass-production yet in recent months , scientists at the fraunhofer institute for surface technology -lrb- ist -rrb- in braunschweig , in north-central germany , have announced a new car window glass which they claim does not allow an ice layer to form in the first place - even at temperatures as low as minus 18 celsius .
last month , volkswagen joined the project , hoping to turn this research into a feature on its cars .
" -lsb- the window -rsb- has been well-understood on a laboratory scale , but now needs to be implemented for large-scale operation , " said harthmuth hoffmann , a volkswagen spokesperson , in an e-mail sent to deutsche welle .
the problem is that this coating can interfere with radio and mobile phone reception .
heat ca n't radiate skyward the new glass works differently from a heated window - it is based on a physical principle : a wafer-thin transparent coating of indium tin oxide is applied to the window .
" we call this a ' low-e ' -lrb- low thermal emissivity -rrb- coating , " said thomas drescher of volkswagen development , in an interview with the dpa news service .
" applied to the outer glazing , it prevents heat from radiating skyward . "
the conductive " low-e coating " protects the glass from cooling .
that way , water on the outer surface does not condense or freeze and there is no ice film in the first place because radiative heat loss to the cold sky is minimised and this prevents or delays cooling of the glass surface to below the dew point .
scientists have worked on similar projects for some 50 years , andreas klein from technical university of darmstadt told deutsche welle .
" the challenge here is that they 're creating a coating which is applied externally rather than inside .
so the mechanism will have to be able to withstand adverse weather conditions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : driving in winter could just become this little bit easier older systems work with layers made from tin oxide .
but these are far from perfect - both from a practical and an esthetical point of view , the researchers found .
when glass is bent , for instance , the old layers will break because the temperatures get too high .
" our new layer is extremely stable , " said bernd szyszka , an ist researcher , in a statement published on the fraunhofer institute 's website .
" temperatures of up to 900 degrees celsius are no problem .
even if you bend the layer extensively it stays the way it is . "
when the layer is used in windshields , of course , weather conditions such as cloudiness , relative humidity and wind can affect the windows ' condensation behaviour .
" the ' low-e coating ' can not prevent ice formation or condensation entirely , but it can significantly reduce the likelihood of it happening , " drescher added .
ice-free windshield still not ready for the mass market for now , one drawback with the system as it is is that the new coating limits radio traffic in the car , which can impair radio and mobile phone reception , added harthmuth hoffmann , the volkswagen spokesperson .
as such , it remains unclear as to when the first cars equipped with the new wind screen can roll out from volkswagen 's assembly lines .
" it will take some time before the ice-free car windscreen is market-ready , " drescher noted , " but we are working intensively toward this goal . "

she wants a much clearer outline of citizen rights with respect to how their data is used . european union justice commissioner , viviane reding , has slammed the american government for not showing a serious interest in data protection rights .
the united states and eu are at odds over washington 's drive for increased access to european citizens ' bank and flight records .
european authorities do n't believe that their us counterparts are adequately protecting consumer rights .
" from the outset , we have noted an apparent lack of interest on the us side to talk seriously about data protection , " reding said in a statement released on monday , just two weeks after holding talks with high-level american officials , including with us attorney general eric holder and janet napolitano , the secretary of homeland security .
in the same statement , reding described those officials as " unprepared " and " uninterested " in data privacy issues .
" they have not even appointed a negotiator , " she added in the statement , but noted that she " expects " the telephone number of the negotiator before year 's end .

the agreement would aim to prevent the abuse of europeans ' privacy as authorities share information in the struggle against terrorism and other crimes .
the eu is seeking " more proportionate " use of this data as well as the right for eu citizens to modify and delete information and take the government to court over abuses of their data .
reding also is encouraging the americans to create an independent data protection supervisory position , which exists in all eu member states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 21.12.2010 eu tightens emissions restrictions for light trucks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : light trucks will be allowed to emit 147 grams co2 per kilometer from 2020 the eu 's environment ministers have agreed on emissions and mileage regulations for small vans and other utility vehicles .
but environmentalists say the new rules were largely influenced by germany 's strong car lobby . germany and the european union 's executive are praising an agreement among eu countries to tighten emissions rules for vehicles , but environmentalists are less convinced .
new regulations agreed on monday require vans and other utility vehicles to reduce their rate of carbon emissions per kilometre over the next decade , in a bid to drive down the transport sector 's share of greenhouse gasses .
european union environment ministers stipulated that from 2020 onwards , vehicles weighing up to 3.5 tons will only be allowed to emit 147 grams of co2 per kilometer , which translates into some 5.6 liters of diesel per kilometer .
today , light trucks are allowed to emit 200 grams per kilometer .
" it 's a very good compromise on something that was a source of debate for a long time , " said norbert roettgen , germany 's environment minister , adding that the new regulations will help the environment without placing too much of a burden on the car industry .
hopes are that the decision will help create new jobs .
demand for fuel-saving engines will be on the rise over the next decade because of rising petrol prices , says claudia kemfert from the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- . " in times of globalization a country 's competitive edge will depend on their ability to build energy-saving products and vehicles , " kemfert told deutsche welle .
" so germany and europe can gain a competitive advantage by launching these technologies first . "
ending a heated debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's environment minister says the new rules are a ' good compromise ' the issue has long been a point of conflict within the bloc , with germany pushing for regulations not to go below 150 grams of co2 per kilometer .
together with the eu 's two other major car-producing countries france and italy , germany had opposed stricter suggestions by the eu 's executive , the european commission .
the commission had demanded limitations of 135 grams of co2 per kilometer for light trucks , yet the eu 's climate chief , connie hedegaard , also described the compromise as a step forward .
" we have got things that are definitely more ambitious than what the industry and the sector claimed that they could do , " she said at a press conference .
the european parliament still has to approve the decision , with a vote expected in mid-january .
the new regulations could increase prices for small trucks by several thousand euros .
producers whose vehicles exceed the 147 grams per kilometer will have to pay a fine of 95 euros per gram per vehicle .
the regulations are staggered , so that by 2014 emissions for light trucks are supposed to go down to 175 grams of co2 per kilometer .
currently regulations are only in place for private cars .
their emissions are supposed to fall below 130 grams of co2 per kilometer by 2012 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists say germany 's car lobby has again shown its strength german car lobby environmentalists complained that the decision watered down what the european commission proposed in 2009 .
" it 's very disappointing and yet another example of germany preventing more progressive politics from being put in place " , wolfgang lohbeck from greenpeace told deutsche welle .
" it shows that the german car lobby is very strong . "
" you could argue that -lrb- monday 's -rrb- decision was in fact not that important , " said lohbeck , adding that small vans and other utility vehicles only make up about eight percent of all cars on german roads .
according to the german environment ministry , these vehicles are responsible for some six percent of co2 emissions caused by traffic .
environmentalists are now concerned , lohbeck told deutsche welle , that the car lobby will continue to resist future decisions .
the regulations for cars , which were introduced last year , will soon be reviewed again by the eu .
" i hope that monday 's decision was not a bad premonition for what they 'll decide there , " lohbeck said .

they start over and again until they have the piece pitch perfect .
it 's part of the workshop atmosphere at the barenboim-said foundation 's music academy in the center of ramallah .
martin koegel , oboist with the german chamber ensemble polyphonia - a subgroup of the deutsche symphonie orchester berlin - is more than happy with the students at the palestinian music school .
he and his fellow musicians have come to offer some additional training .
" for us , it 's about meeting the kids where they are .
we have young people here who began playing just a year ago and others that have five years experience , " koegel told deutsche welle .
" with the more experienced players , we work on pieces together in small ensembles that we 'll present in concert .
and with the beginners , we are trying lay a foundation to help them play together and learn what 's important in the process . "
making music inside the academy , music from all manner of instruments streams out of practice rooms into the halls .
even the offices are full of young musicians hard at work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hard at play yara khawaja practices cello under the watchful eyes of cellist thomas roesseler .
the 11 year-old palestinian player can scarcely be seen behind her instrument , which she has now been learning for two years .
she says it took her a little while to get used to being in the presence of more experienced musicians .
" i was a little nervous at the beginning , " yara said .
" but it 's a great opportunity to be able to play with these professionals .
a rare opportunity the school , which opened in 2006 , is sponsored by the barenboim-said foundation and is one of the few place in the palestinian west bank which teaches classical music .
the foundation itself is largely financed by the andalusian regional government in spain .
nabeel abboud ashkar is director of the academy and stresses the importance of visits such as those from polyphonia .
" workshops with international musicians open doors - not just to the world of classical music , but also in terms of cultural dialogue , " he said , adding that it is particularly important in conflict zones .
martin koegle also believes in the validity of working cross-culturally .
" people here are interested in classical music , " he said , " but they do n't have all the training and educational opportunities we have in europe , for instance .
and we want to do what we can to help . "
future professionals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students take to the stage in ramallah polyphonia musicians have already offered similar workshops in other countries , most recently in algeria and morocco .
then , as now , the projects were financed by the german foreign office and organized by deutsche welle .
as the ramallah workshop comes to a close , the young players shift their attention to the three concerts they will give to show what they have learned .
the more accomplished musicians will play on stage alongside their tutors from germany .
but even for those at the beginning of their musical training , the concerts are an invaluable way of gaining valuable experience .

that goes too far for many lawmakers . parliamentarians from all german mainstream parties joined on tuesday to present a draft bill which would allow embryo screening - also known as pre-implantation genetic diagnosis or pgd - in narrowly defined situations .

" pre-implantation genetic diagnosis will , in general , still be banned , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 21.12.2010 german researchers develop ice-free windshield großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has been hit unusually early with winter this year it 's what most european drivers are dreaming of these days : a farewell to ice-scraping .
but drivers need some patience : the new technology is not ready for the market yet , the german researchers say . with snow continuing to fall and temperatures often below zero degree celsius -lrb- 32 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in many parts of the continent , many europeans currently have to get up earlier than usual to scrape off the ice covering the windshields of their cars before they can actually drive off .
that may soon be a thing of the past , according to german researchers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not ready for mass-production yet in recent months , scientists at the fraunhofer institute for surface technology -lrb- ist -rrb- in braunschweig , in north-central germany , have announced a new car window glass which they claim does not allow an ice layer to form in the first place - even at temperatures as low as minus 18 celsius .
last month , volkswagen joined the project , hoping to turn this research into a feature on its cars .
" -lsb- the window -rsb- has been well-understood on a laboratory scale , but now needs to be implemented for large-scale operation , " said harthmuth hoffmann , a volkswagen spokesperson , in an e-mail sent to deutsche welle .
the problem is that this coating can interfere with radio and mobile phone reception .
heat ca n't radiate skyward the new glass works differently from a heated window - it is based on a physical principle : a wafer-thin transparent coating of indium tin oxide is applied to the window .
" we call this a ' low-e ' -lrb- low thermal emissivity -rrb- coating , " said thomas drescher of volkswagen development , in an interview with the dpa news service .
" applied to the outer glazing , it prevents heat from radiating skyward . "
the conductive " low-e coating " protects the glass from cooling .
that way , water on the outer surface does not condense or freeze and there is no ice film in the first place because radiative heat loss to the cold sky is minimised and this prevents or delays cooling of the glass surface to below the dew point .
scientists have worked on similar projects for some 50 years , andreas klein from technical university of darmstadt told deutsche welle .
" the challenge here is that they 're creating a coating which is applied externally rather than inside .
so the mechanism will have to be able to withstand adverse weather conditions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : driving in winter could just become this little bit easier older systems work with layers made from tin oxide .
but these are far from perfect - both from a practical and an esthetical point of view , the researchers found .
when glass is bent , for instance , the old layers will break because the temperatures get too high .
" our new layer is extremely stable , " said bernd szyszka , an ist researcher , in a statement published on the fraunhofer institute 's website .
" temperatures of up to 900 degrees celsius are no problem .
even if you bend the layer extensively it stays the way it is . "
when the layer is used in windshields , of course , weather conditions such as cloudiness , relative humidity and wind can affect the windows ' condensation behaviour .
" the ' low-e coating ' can not prevent ice formation or condensation entirely , but it can significantly reduce the likelihood of it happening , " drescher added .
ice-free windshield still not ready for the mass market for now , one drawback with the system as it is is that the new coating limits radio traffic in the car , which can impair radio and mobile phone reception , added harthmuth hoffmann , the volkswagen spokesperson .
as such , it remains unclear as to when the first cars equipped with the new wind screen can roll out from volkswagen 's assembly lines .
" it will take some time before the ice-free car windscreen is market-ready , " drescher noted , " but we are working intensively toward this goal . "

she wants a much clearer outline of citizen rights with respect to how their data is used . european union justice commissioner , viviane reding , has slammed the american government for not showing a serious interest in data protection rights .
the united states and eu are at odds over washington 's drive for increased access to european citizens ' bank and flight records .
european authorities do n't believe that their us counterparts are adequately protecting consumer rights .
" from the outset , we have noted an apparent lack of interest on the us side to talk seriously about data protection , " reding said in a statement released on monday , just two weeks after holding talks with high-level american officials , including with us attorney general eric holder and janet napolitano , the secretary of homeland security .
in the same statement , reding described those officials as " unprepared " and " uninterested " in data privacy issues .
" they have not even appointed a negotiator , " she added in the statement , but noted that she " expects " the telephone number of the negotiator before year 's end .
meanwhile , the european union has designated françoise le bail , the director general of the commission 's department for justice , as its negotiator .
eu pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american ambassador to the eu , william e. kennard disagrees with reding 's charges brussels is pushing washington for a document that would clearly outline the basis of future data-sharing agreements .
earlier this month , the eu 's 27 justice ministers gave the bloc 's executive the green light to negotiate a " personal data protection agreement " with washington .
the agreement would aim to prevent the abuse of europeans ' privacy as authorities share information in the struggle against terrorism and other crimes .
the eu is seeking " more proportionate " use of this data as well as the right for eu citizens to modify and delete information and take the government to court over abuses of their data .
reding also is encouraging the americans to create an independent data protection supervisory position , which exists in all eu member states .
in a press conference in brussels on monday , the american ambassador to the european union dismissed reding 's statement .
" i disagree - we 're moving ahead , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 21.12.2010 german researchers develop ice-free windshield großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has been hit unusually early with winter this year it 's what most european drivers are dreaming of these days : a farewell to ice-scraping .
but drivers need some patience : the new technology is not ready for the market yet , the german researchers say . with snow continuing to fall and temperatures often below zero degree celsius -lrb- 32 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in many parts of the continent , many europeans currently have to get up earlier than usual to scrape off the ice covering the windshields of their cars before they can actually drive off .
that may soon be a thing of the past , according to german researchers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not ready for mass-production yet in recent months , scientists at the fraunhofer institute for surface technology -lrb- ist -rrb- in braunschweig , in north-central germany , have announced a new car window glass which they claim does not allow an ice layer to form in the first place - even at temperatures as low as minus 18 celsius .
last month , volkswagen joined the project , hoping to turn this research into a feature on its cars .
" -lsb- the window -rsb- has been well-understood on a laboratory scale , but now needs to be implemented for large-scale operation , " said harthmuth hoffmann , a volkswagen spokesperson , in an e-mail sent to deutsche welle .
the problem is that this coating can interfere with radio and mobile phone reception .
heat ca n't radiate skyward the new glass works differently from a heated window - it is based on a physical principle : a wafer-thin transparent coating of indium tin oxide is applied to the window .
" we call this a ' low-e ' -lrb- low thermal emissivity -rrb- coating , " said thomas drescher of volkswagen development , in an interview with the dpa news service .
" applied to the outer glazing , it prevents heat from radiating skyward . "
the conductive " low-e coating " protects the glass from cooling .
that way , water on the outer surface does not condense or freeze and there is no ice film in the first place because radiative heat loss to the cold sky is minimised and this prevents or delays cooling of the glass surface to below the dew point .
scientists have worked on similar projects for some 50 years , andreas klein from technical university of darmstadt told deutsche welle .
" the challenge here is that they 're creating a coating which is applied externally rather than inside .
so the mechanism will have to be able to withstand adverse weather conditions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : driving in winter could just become this little bit easier older systems work with layers made from tin oxide .
but these are far from perfect - both from a practical and an esthetical point of view , the researchers found .
when glass is bent , for instance , the old layers will break because the temperatures get too high .
" our new layer is extremely stable , " said bernd szyszka , an ist researcher , in a statement published on the fraunhofer institute 's website .
" temperatures of up to 900 degrees celsius are no problem .
even if you bend the layer extensively it stays the way it is . "
when the layer is used in windshields , of course , weather conditions such as cloudiness , relative humidity and wind can affect the windows ' condensation behaviour .
" the ' low-e coating ' can not prevent ice formation or condensation entirely , but it can significantly reduce the likelihood of it happening , " drescher added .
ice-free windshield still not ready for the mass market for now , one drawback with the system as it is is that the new coating limits radio traffic in the car , which can impair radio and mobile phone reception , added harthmuth hoffmann , the volkswagen spokesperson .
as such , it remains unclear as to when the first cars equipped with the new wind screen can roll out from volkswagen 's assembly lines .
" it will take some time before the ice-free car windscreen is market-ready , " drescher noted , " but we are working intensively toward this goal . "

that goes too far for many lawmakers . parliamentarians from all german mainstream parties joined on tuesday to present a draft bill which would allow embryo screening - also known as pre-implantation genetic diagnosis or pgd - in narrowly defined situations .
two other draft bills are on the way , both taking an even more restrictive line .
the new bills are a response to a decision by the federal court of justice in july , that ruled that a total and unconditional ban of pgd would not be in line with the constitution .
one of the main proponents of the current bill , ulrike flach of the junior coalition partner in chancellor angela merkel 's government , the liberal free democrats , emphasized that it was not intended to open any floodgates .
" pre-implantation genetic diagnosis will , in general , still be banned , " she said .
" but it will be allowed under very special circumstances . "
those circumstances include cases where one parent suffers from a severe hereditary condition which could be passed on to the child and would lead to severe disease , stillbirth or miscarriage .
avoiding abortions peter hintze of angela merkel 's christian democrats , said that the kind of cases they were talking about could lead to late abortions , since pre-natal diagnosis for such conditions is legal .
" our bill focuses on the situation of the women affected , " he said .
" we want to keep them free of conflicts over pregnancy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel is one of the conservatives who oppose pgd on principle the bill would set up an ethics commission to decide which genetic conditions would justify the use of screening .
the commission would be able to respond to scientific developments , removing diseases from the list should cures become available .
pgd raises ethical questions because it also has the potential to screen for genetic characteristics unrelated to medical necessity .
anxieties about " designer babies " are not new , prompting jerzy montag of the opposition green party to try to calm any such fears " i 'm not thinking of parents who 'd like to have a musically gifted child , or one with blue eyes , or one that does n't suffer from obesity , " he said .
" but i 'm thinking for instance of a woman who already has a child suffering from a severe congenital disease , a woman who wants to have another child , but wants to ensure it has a better deal in life .
although the bill presented on tuesday is supported by members of all parties , it will not necessarily get majority support in the bundestag .
opponents , including those who will sponsor the other two drafts , fear that screening to remove undesirable genes , however serious , could eventually have an adverse impact on the way society treats people with disabilities .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 21.12.2010 eu tightens emissions restrictions for light trucks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : light trucks will be allowed to emit 147 grams co2 per kilometer from 2020 the eu 's environment ministers have agreed on emissions and mileage regulations for small vans and other utility vehicles .
but environmentalists say the new rules were largely influenced by germany 's strong car lobby . germany and the european union 's executive are praising an agreement among eu countries to tighten emissions rules for vehicles , but environmentalists are less convinced .
new regulations agreed on monday require vans and other utility vehicles to reduce their rate of carbon emissions per kilometre over the next decade , in a bid to drive down the transport sector 's share of greenhouse gasses .
european union environment ministers stipulated that from 2020 onwards , vehicles weighing up to 3.5 tons will only be allowed to emit 147 grams of co2 per kilometer , which translates into some 5.6 liters of diesel per kilometer .
today , light trucks are allowed to emit 200 grams per kilometer .
" it 's a very good compromise on something that was a source of debate for a long time , " said norbert roettgen , germany 's environment minister , adding that the new regulations will help the environment without placing too much of a burden on the car industry .
hopes are that the decision will help create new jobs .
demand for fuel-saving engines will be on the rise over the next decade because of rising petrol prices , says claudia kemfert from the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- . " in times of globalization a country 's competitive edge will depend on their ability to build energy-saving products and vehicles , " kemfert told deutsche welle .
" so germany and europe can gain a competitive advantage by launching these technologies first . "
ending a heated debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's environment minister says the new rules are a ' good compromise ' the issue has long been a point of conflict within the bloc , with germany pushing for regulations not to go below 150 grams of co2 per kilometer .
together with the eu 's two other major car-producing countries france and italy , germany had opposed stricter suggestions by the eu 's executive , the european commission .
the commission had demanded limitations of 135 grams of co2 per kilometer for light trucks , yet the eu 's climate chief , connie hedegaard , also described the compromise as a step forward .
" we have got things that are definitely more ambitious than what the industry and the sector claimed that they could do , " she said at a press conference .
the european parliament still has to approve the decision , with a vote expected in mid-january .
the new regulations could increase prices for small trucks by several thousand euros .
producers whose vehicles exceed the 147 grams per kilometer will have to pay a fine of 95 euros per gram per vehicle .
the regulations are staggered , so that by 2014 emissions for light trucks are supposed to go down to 175 grams of co2 per kilometer .
currently regulations are only in place for private cars .
their emissions are supposed to fall below 130 grams of co2 per kilometer by 2012 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists say germany 's car lobby has again shown its strength german car lobby environmentalists complained that the decision watered down what the european commission proposed in 2009 .
" it 's very disappointing and yet another example of germany preventing more progressive politics from being put in place " , wolfgang lohbeck from greenpeace told deutsche welle .
" it shows that the german car lobby is very strong . "
" you could argue that -lrb- monday 's -rrb- decision was in fact not that important , " said lohbeck , adding that small vans and other utility vehicles only make up about eight percent of all cars on german roads .
according to the german environment ministry , these vehicles are responsible for some six percent of co2 emissions caused by traffic .
environmentalists are now concerned , lohbeck told deutsche welle , that the car lobby will continue to resist future decisions .
the regulations for cars , which were introduced last year , will soon be reviewed again by the eu .
" i hope that monday 's decision was not a bad premonition for what they 'll decide there , " lohbeck said .

his attorney argues that the issue of isp liability should remain the key issue in the case . carl lundstrom , one of the four defendants in the pirate bay website trial , has formally appealed to the swedish supreme court against the denial of the party 's previous appeal in late november .
he is one of the founders of the pirate bay - a website that provides links to bittorrent files that can be used to share unauthorized copies of films , music files and software .
in an interview with sveriges radio 's p3 news program , lundstrom 's attorney , per e samuelsson , said that his client does not accept the sentence of four months of jail time for himself , and a collective fine for him and the three other defendants of 46 million swedish kronor -lrb- 5.1 million euros -rrb- .
the four had been previously found guilty of copyright infringement .
however , members of the defense argued that the site , which began in 2003 , does not actually host any copyrighted material , but rather provides links to those files .
" we do not accept the appeal court 's ruling , " samuelsson told swedish public radio .
" my client carl lundstrom delivered internet capacity to the pirate bay , " he added .
" different people around the world use the pirate bay services .
we think it is completely wrong that someone who delivered power to a website should pay damages and sit in prison for what users of the website do with it . "

in an interview with the swedish business newspaper realtid.se , samuelsson further argued that because his client was providing bandwidth to the pirate bay , that therefore rix telecom was also its internet service provider , or isp .
" assessing the criminal responsibility of isps should be the target key precedent in this case , " he said , pointing out that to his knowledge , up until now , no one in sweden has ever been found guilty on this basis .

she wants a much clearer outline of citizen rights with respect to how their data is used . european union justice commissioner , viviane reding , has slammed the american government for not showing a serious interest in data protection rights .
the united states and eu are at odds over washington 's drive for increased access to european citizens ' bank and flight records .
european authorities do n't believe that their us counterparts are adequately protecting consumer rights .
" from the outset , we have noted an apparent lack of interest on the us side to talk seriously about data protection , " reding said in a statement released on monday , just two weeks after holding talks with high-level american officials , including with us attorney general eric holder and janet napolitano , the secretary of homeland security .
in the same statement , reding described those officials as " unprepared " and " uninterested " in data privacy issues .
" they have not even appointed a negotiator , " she added in the statement , but noted that she " expects " the telephone number of the negotiator before year 's end .
meanwhile , the european union has designated françoise le bail , the director general of the commission 's department for justice , as its negotiator .

earlier this month , the eu 's 27 justice ministers gave the bloc 's executive the green light to negotiate a " personal data protection agreement " with washington .
the agreement would aim to prevent the abuse of europeans ' privacy as authorities share information in the struggle against terrorism and other crimes .
the eu is seeking " more proportionate " use of this data as well as the right for eu citizens to modify and delete information and take the government to court over abuses of their data .
reding also is encouraging the americans to create an independent data protection supervisory position , which exists in all eu member states .
in a press conference in brussels on monday , the american ambassador to the european union dismissed reding 's statement .
" i disagree - we 're moving ahead , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 21.12.2010 german researchers develop ice-free windshield großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has been hit unusually early with winter this year it 's what most european drivers are dreaming of these days : a farewell to ice-scraping .
but drivers need some patience : the new technology is not ready for the market yet , the german researchers say . with snow continuing to fall and temperatures often below zero degree celsius -lrb- 32 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in many parts of the continent , many europeans currently have to get up earlier than usual to scrape off the ice covering the windshields of their cars before they can actually drive off .
that may soon be a thing of the past , according to german researchers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not ready for mass-production yet in recent months , scientists at the fraunhofer institute for surface technology -lrb- ist -rrb- in braunschweig , in north-central germany , have announced a new car window glass which they claim does not allow an ice layer to form in the first place - even at temperatures as low as minus 18 celsius .
last month , volkswagen joined the project , hoping to turn this research into a feature on its cars .
" -lsb- the window -rsb- has been well-understood on a laboratory scale , but now needs to be implemented for large-scale operation , " said harthmuth hoffmann , a volkswagen spokesperson , in an e-mail sent to deutsche welle .
the problem is that this coating can interfere with radio and mobile phone reception .
heat ca n't radiate skyward the new glass works differently from a heated window - it is based on a physical principle : a wafer-thin transparent coating of indium tin oxide is applied to the window .
" we call this a ' low-e ' -lrb- low thermal emissivity -rrb- coating , " said thomas drescher of volkswagen development , in an interview with the dpa news service .
" applied to the outer glazing , it prevents heat from radiating skyward . "
the conductive " low-e coating " protects the glass from cooling .
that way , water on the outer surface does not condense or freeze and there is no ice film in the first place because radiative heat loss to the cold sky is minimised and this prevents or delays cooling of the glass surface to below the dew point .
scientists have worked on similar projects for some 50 years , andreas klein from technical university of darmstadt told deutsche welle .
" the challenge here is that they 're creating a coating which is applied externally rather than inside .
so the mechanism will have to be able to withstand adverse weather conditions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : driving in winter could just become this little bit easier older systems work with layers made from tin oxide .
but these are far from perfect - both from a practical and an esthetical point of view , the researchers found .
when glass is bent , for instance , the old layers will break because the temperatures get too high .
" our new layer is extremely stable , " said bernd szyszka , an ist researcher , in a statement published on the fraunhofer institute 's website .
" temperatures of up to 900 degrees celsius are no problem .
even if you bend the layer extensively it stays the way it is . "
when the layer is used in windshields , of course , weather conditions such as cloudiness , relative humidity and wind can affect the windows ' condensation behaviour .
" the ' low-e coating ' can not prevent ice formation or condensation entirely , but it can significantly reduce the likelihood of it happening , " drescher added .
ice-free windshield still not ready for the mass market for now , one drawback with the system as it is is that the new coating limits radio traffic in the car , which can impair radio and mobile phone reception , added harthmuth hoffmann , the volkswagen spokesperson .
as such , it remains unclear as to when the first cars equipped with the new wind screen can roll out from volkswagen 's assembly lines .
" it will take some time before the ice-free car windscreen is market-ready , " drescher noted , " but we are working intensively toward this goal . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 21.12.2010 german researchers develop ice-free windshield großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has been hit unusually early with winter this year it 's what most european drivers are dreaming of these days : a farewell to ice-scraping .
but drivers need some patience : the new technology is not ready for the market yet , the german researchers say . with snow continuing to fall and temperatures often below zero degree celsius -lrb- 32 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in many parts of the continent , many europeans currently have to get up earlier than usual to scrape off the ice covering the windshields of their cars before they can actually drive off .
that may soon be a thing of the past , according to german researchers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not ready for mass-production yet in recent months , scientists at the fraunhofer institute for surface technology -lrb- ist -rrb- in braunschweig , in north-central germany , have announced a new car window glass which they claim does not allow an ice layer to form in the first place - even at temperatures as low as minus 18 celsius .
last month , volkswagen joined the project , hoping to turn this research into a feature on its cars .
" -lsb- the window -rsb- has been well-understood on a laboratory scale , but now needs to be implemented for large-scale operation , " said harthmuth hoffmann , a volkswagen spokesperson , in an e-mail sent to deutsche welle .
the problem is that this coating can interfere with radio and mobile phone reception .
heat ca n't radiate skyward the new glass works differently from a heated window - it is based on a physical principle : a wafer-thin transparent coating of indium tin oxide is applied to the window .
" we call this a ' low-e ' -lrb- low thermal emissivity -rrb- coating , " said thomas drescher of volkswagen development , in an interview with the dpa news service .
" applied to the outer glazing , it prevents heat from radiating skyward . "
the conductive " low-e coating " protects the glass from cooling .
that way , water on the outer surface does not condense or freeze and there is no ice film in the first place because radiative heat loss to the cold sky is minimised and this prevents or delays cooling of the glass surface to below the dew point .
scientists have worked on similar projects for some 50 years , andreas klein from technical university of darmstadt told deutsche welle .
" the challenge here is that they 're creating a coating which is applied externally rather than inside .
so the mechanism will have to be able to withstand adverse weather conditions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : driving in winter could just become this little bit easier older systems work with layers made from tin oxide .
but these are far from perfect - both from a practical and an esthetical point of view , the researchers found .
when glass is bent , for instance , the old layers will break because the temperatures get too high .
" our new layer is extremely stable , " said bernd szyszka , an ist researcher , in a statement published on the fraunhofer institute 's website .
" temperatures of up to 900 degrees celsius are no problem .
even if you bend the layer extensively it stays the way it is . "
when the layer is used in windshields , of course , weather conditions such as cloudiness , relative humidity and wind can affect the windows ' condensation behaviour .
" the ' low-e coating ' can not prevent ice formation or condensation entirely , but it can significantly reduce the likelihood of it happening , " drescher added .
ice-free windshield still not ready for the mass market for now , one drawback with the system as it is is that the new coating limits radio traffic in the car , which can impair radio and mobile phone reception , added harthmuth hoffmann , the volkswagen spokesperson .
as such , it remains unclear as to when the first cars equipped with the new wind screen can roll out from volkswagen 's assembly lines .
" it will take some time before the ice-free car windscreen is market-ready , " drescher noted , " but we are working intensively toward this goal . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 21.12.2010 opinion : improve trade regulations to curb resource squeeze großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " china uses unconventional methods to secure access to raw materials in africa " a new global challenge is threatening the german economy : many raw materials are in short supply .
it 's not because deposits are empty , but because international trade mechanisms are outdated , writes juergen wiemann . industrial companies in germany are complaining about the rising prices of rare minerals and metals needed for electromobility and photovoltaics .
one in two , according to a poll conducted by the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , even worries whether it will get the critical raw materials at all .
yet , geologists say all metals will be available in sufficient quantities in the earth 's crust for the foreseeable future .
at worst , oil may become scarce .
geology is , however , responsible for the concentration of deposits on just a few of the world 's regions and countries .
this leaves the way open for the formation of cartels and for monopolistic behaviour , especially as global production of raw materials is below the " geological production possibility " .
this is due to a political environment in many developing countries with major reserves which is anything but inviting for mining investment .
and that is no coincidence : rare and strategically important natural resources simply attract war and civil war .
demand on the rise worldwide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if one raw material is not available , the whole value chain is in danger " german industry 's acute fear of a resource squeeze is aggravated by the coincidence of rising world demand and the reluctance shown by a number of countries to supply their natural resources : high-tech industries are processing more and more new minerals and rare metals .
if only one of these substances is not available in sufficient quantity , the whole value chain is in danger .
but that is exactly what is likely to happen , because with their rapid industrialisation , emerging economies , too , are developing a growing need for industrial raw materials .
it is no wonder that they are inclined to limit exports of their raw materials or to impose export taxes on them so as to give their own industries a competitive edge .
only recently , china has demonstrated this kind of self-assertive industrial policy with its restrictions on the export of rare earths , startling the old industrialised countries .
furthermore , the emerging economies are trying to secure direct access to the raw materials of other developing countries , especially in africa .
in the process , they are using some quite unconventional instruments .
chinese state-owned enterprises , for example , are providing development assistance for complementary infrastructure development .
thus , the concern about the supply of raw materials is entirely justified .
consequently , the german government and the european commission are taking the matter seriously .
a report by the european commission judges the supply situation to be critical in the case of 14 materials .
governments get involved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wto headquarters in geneva , switzerland with its ' raw materials initiative ' , the commission intends to face up to the emerging supply risks and to encourage joint action by the eu member states to reduce dependence on external raw materials through increased materials efficiency , recycling and a search for alternatives .
the german economics minister , too , is suggesting that a ' german raw materials corporation ' should act as a demand cartel and challenge the supply power of china and other commodity exporters .
for a liberal economics minister , this is anything but a matter of course .
according to his ' weltanschauung ' , it is best left to the individual enterprise to worry about its supplies of raw materials , while government takes responsibility for the functioning of open world markets in compliance with the rules of the multilateral trading system .
yet it must be asked whether invoking the wto rules against aggressive trade policies will be effective in the case of china .
the wto itself does not have any ' hard power ' to impose sanctions for infringements of its rules ; it can do no more than award the victor in a dispute settlement the right to take retaliatory measures with a similar effect to that of the infringement committed by the loser .
but as china 's economic weight in the world grows and its industries become increasingly integrated into international value chains , the leverage exercised by punitive european tariffs on imports from china dwindles .
subsidies in developed nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european countries protect their agricultural products through subsidies yet , through the sheer existence of the multilateral trading system , wto members tend to follow the rules most of the time , even without formal dispute settlement .
when referring to the ' soft power ' of the wto , member states such as europeans and americans , however , have felt no compunction in defending their agriculture against imports from more competitive developing countries and to subsidise their own agricultural exports .
therefore , not only notorious critics of globalisation discern an asymmetrical distribution of power in the world economic institutions between industrialised and developing countries , which should at least have been corrected in the wto during the current development round .
but after nearly ten years of negotiations in the doha -lrb- development -rrb- round the promise has still not been kept .
beyond ritualised commitments in every g7 / g8 / g20 summit communiqué , neither the eu nor the u.s. has made a convincing effort to cut the gordian knot of the mutually obstructive agricultural interests of industrialised and developing nations with a general offer to open their markets and reduce their export subsidies .
improved management and trade regulations further evidence of the half-hearted nature of the europeans ' commitment to the world trade order , with its implications for the trade and economic policies of all the member countries , is the little attention paid to this year 's ' world trade report ' of the wto on ' trade in natural resources ' .
based on the state of art in economic theory and citing numerous empirical examples , the ' world trade report 2010 ' describes the specific mechanisms and perils of natural resource markets and the exploitation of natural resources in a finite world .
in his foreword , wto director general pascal lamy even questions the “ standard prescriptions for greater trade openness ” for natural resources markets , according to which free trade will always produce the best result for all participating countries .
he argues that the developing countries ' management of natural resources should be improved to prevent over-exploitation and that the wto should adopt further and more precise rules on the world trade in natural resources with a view to defusing the emerging conflicts between producing and consuming countries .
lamy therefore rightly calls for a “ prompt closure of the doha round ” , so that the new challenges and conflicts in the international natural resources trade may be dealt with under the wto umbrella . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. jürgen wiemann is head of the research project ' multilateral trading system and development cooperation ' at deutsche gesellschaft für technische zusammenarbeit -lrb- gtz -rrb- and former deputy director of the german development institute -lrb- die -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 21.12.2010 opinion : improve trade regulations to curb resource squeeze großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " china uses unconventional methods to secure access to raw materials in africa " a new global challenge is threatening the german economy : many raw materials are in short supply .
it 's not because deposits are empty , but because international trade mechanisms are outdated , writes juergen wiemann . industrial companies in germany are complaining about the rising prices of rare minerals and metals needed for electromobility and photovoltaics .
one in two , according to a poll conducted by the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , even worries whether it will get the critical raw materials at all .
yet , geologists say all metals will be available in sufficient quantities in the earth 's crust for the foreseeable future .
at worst , oil may become scarce .
geology is , however , responsible for the concentration of deposits on just a few of the world 's regions and countries .
this leaves the way open for the formation of cartels and for monopolistic behaviour , especially as global production of raw materials is below the " geological production possibility " .
this is due to a political environment in many developing countries with major reserves which is anything but inviting for mining investment .
and that is no coincidence : rare and strategically important natural resources simply attract war and civil war .
demand on the rise worldwide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if one raw material is not available , the whole value chain is in danger " german industry 's acute fear of a resource squeeze is aggravated by the coincidence of rising world demand and the reluctance shown by a number of countries to supply their natural resources : high-tech industries are processing more and more new minerals and rare metals .
if only one of these substances is not available in sufficient quantity , the whole value chain is in danger .
but that is exactly what is likely to happen , because with their rapid industrialisation , emerging economies , too , are developing a growing need for industrial raw materials .
it is no wonder that they are inclined to limit exports of their raw materials or to impose export taxes on them so as to give their own industries a competitive edge .
only recently , china has demonstrated this kind of self-assertive industrial policy with its restrictions on the export of rare earths , startling the old industrialised countries .
furthermore , the emerging economies are trying to secure direct access to the raw materials of other developing countries , especially in africa .
in the process , they are using some quite unconventional instruments .
chinese state-owned enterprises , for example , are providing development assistance for complementary infrastructure development .
thus , the concern about the supply of raw materials is entirely justified .
consequently , the german government and the european commission are taking the matter seriously .
a report by the european commission judges the supply situation to be critical in the case of 14 materials .
governments get involved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wto headquarters in geneva , switzerland with its ' raw materials initiative ' , the commission intends to face up to the emerging supply risks and to encourage joint action by the eu member states to reduce dependence on external raw materials through increased materials efficiency , recycling and a search for alternatives .
the german economics minister , too , is suggesting that a ' german raw materials corporation ' should act as a demand cartel and challenge the supply power of china and other commodity exporters .
for a liberal economics minister , this is anything but a matter of course .
according to his ' weltanschauung ' , it is best left to the individual enterprise to worry about its supplies of raw materials , while government takes responsibility for the functioning of open world markets in compliance with the rules of the multilateral trading system .
yet it must be asked whether invoking the wto rules against aggressive trade policies will be effective in the case of china .
the wto itself does not have any ' hard power ' to impose sanctions for infringements of its rules ; it can do no more than award the victor in a dispute settlement the right to take retaliatory measures with a similar effect to that of the infringement committed by the loser .
but as china 's economic weight in the world grows and its industries become increasingly integrated into international value chains , the leverage exercised by punitive european tariffs on imports from china dwindles .
subsidies in developed nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european countries protect their agricultural products through subsidies yet , through the sheer existence of the multilateral trading system , wto members tend to follow the rules most of the time , even without formal dispute settlement .

they start over and again until they have the piece pitch perfect .
it 's part of the workshop atmosphere at the barenboim-said foundation 's music academy in the center of ramallah .
martin koegel , oboist with the german chamber ensemble polyphonia - a subgroup of the deutsche symphonie orchester berlin - is more than happy with the students at the palestinian music school .
he and his fellow musicians have come to offer some additional training .
" for us , it 's about meeting the kids where they are .
we have young people here who began playing just a year ago and others that have five years experience , " koegel told deutsche welle .
" with the more experienced players , we work on pieces together in small ensembles that we 'll present in concert .
and with the beginners , we are trying lay a foundation to help them play together and learn what 's important in the process . "
making music inside the academy , music from all manner of instruments streams out of practice rooms into the halls .
even the offices are full of young musicians hard at work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hard at play yara khawaja practices cello under the watchful eyes of cellist thomas roesseler .
the 11 year-old palestinian player can scarcely be seen behind her instrument , which she has now been learning for two years .
she says it took her a little while to get used to being in the presence of more experienced musicians .
" i was a little nervous at the beginning , " yara said .
" but it 's a great opportunity to be able to play with these professionals .
a rare opportunity the school , which opened in 2006 , is sponsored by the barenboim-said foundation and is one of the few place in the palestinian west bank which teaches classical music .
the foundation itself is largely financed by the andalusian regional government in spain .
nabeel abboud ashkar is director of the academy and stresses the importance of visits such as those from polyphonia .
" workshops with international musicians open doors - not just to the world of classical music , but also in terms of cultural dialogue , " he said , adding that it is particularly important in conflict zones .
martin koegle also believes in the validity of working cross-culturally .
" people here are interested in classical music , " he said , " but they do n't have all the training and educational opportunities we have in europe , for instance .
and we want to do what we can to help . "
future professionals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students take to the stage in ramallah polyphonia musicians have already offered similar workshops in other countries , most recently in algeria and morocco .
then , as now , the projects were financed by the german foreign office and organized by deutsche welle .
as the ramallah workshop comes to a close , the young players shift their attention to the three concerts they will give to show what they have learned .
the more accomplished musicians will play on stage alongside their tutors from germany .
but even for those at the beginning of their musical training , the concerts are an invaluable way of gaining valuable experience .

he is one of the founders of the pirate bay - a website that provides links to bittorrent files that can be used to share unauthorized copies of films , music files and software .
in an interview with sveriges radio 's p3 news program , lundstrom 's attorney , per e samuelsson , said that his client does not accept the sentence of four months of jail time for himself , and a collective fine for him and the three other defendants of 46 million swedish kronor -lrb- 5.1 million euros -rrb- .

his attorney argues that the issue of isp liability should remain the key issue in the case . carl lundstrom , one of the four defendants in the pirate bay website trial , has formally appealed to the swedish supreme court against the denial of the party 's previous appeal in late november .
he is one of the founders of the pirate bay - a website that provides links to bittorrent files that can be used to share unauthorized copies of films , music files and software .
in an interview with sveriges radio 's p3 news program , lundstrom 's attorney , per e samuelsson , said that his client does not accept the sentence of four months of jail time for himself , and a collective fine for him and the three other defendants of 46 million swedish kronor -lrb- 5.1 million euros -rrb- .
the four had been previously found guilty of copyright infringement .
however , members of the defense argued that the site , which began in 2003 , does not actually host any copyrighted material , but rather provides links to those files .
" we do not accept the appeal court 's ruling , " samuelsson told swedish public radio .
" my client carl lundstrom delivered internet capacity to the pirate bay , " he added .
" different people around the world use the pirate bay services .
we think it is completely wrong that someone who delivered power to a website should pay damages and sit in prison for what users of the website do with it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter sunde is another of the pirate bay 's defendants isp liability should be the " target key precedent " lundstrom , through his company rix telecom , is implicated by having provided computers , bandwidth and server rackspace for the site in the early years after its founding .
in an interview with the swedish business newspaper realtid.se , samuelsson further argued that because his client was providing bandwidth to the pirate bay , that therefore rix telecom was also its internet service provider , or isp .
" assessing the criminal responsibility of isps should be the target key precedent in this case , " he said , pointing out that to his knowledge , up until now , no one in sweden has ever been found guilty on this basis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 21.12.2010 eu tightens emissions restrictions for light trucks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : light trucks will be allowed to emit 147 grams co2 per kilometer from 2020 the eu 's environment ministers have agreed on emissions and mileage regulations for small vans and other utility vehicles .
but environmentalists say the new rules were largely influenced by germany 's strong car lobby . germany and the european union 's executive are praising an agreement among eu countries to tighten emissions rules for vehicles , but environmentalists are less convinced .
new regulations agreed on monday require vans and other utility vehicles to reduce their rate of carbon emissions per kilometre over the next decade , in a bid to drive down the transport sector 's share of greenhouse gasses .
european union environment ministers stipulated that from 2020 onwards , vehicles weighing up to 3.5 tons will only be allowed to emit 147 grams of co2 per kilometer , which translates into some 5.6 liters of diesel per kilometer .
today , light trucks are allowed to emit 200 grams per kilometer .
" it 's a very good compromise on something that was a source of debate for a long time , " said norbert roettgen , germany 's environment minister , adding that the new regulations will help the environment without placing too much of a burden on the car industry .
hopes are that the decision will help create new jobs .
demand for fuel-saving engines will be on the rise over the next decade because of rising petrol prices , says claudia kemfert from the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- . " in times of globalization a country 's competitive edge will depend on their ability to build energy-saving products and vehicles , " kemfert told deutsche welle .
" so germany and europe can gain a competitive advantage by launching these technologies first . "
ending a heated debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's environment minister says the new rules are a ' good compromise ' the issue has long been a point of conflict within the bloc , with germany pushing for regulations not to go below 150 grams of co2 per kilometer .
together with the eu 's two other major car-producing countries france and italy , germany had opposed stricter suggestions by the eu 's executive , the european commission .
the commission had demanded limitations of 135 grams of co2 per kilometer for light trucks , yet the eu 's climate chief , connie hedegaard , also described the compromise as a step forward .
" we have got things that are definitely more ambitious than what the industry and the sector claimed that they could do , " she said at a press conference .
the european parliament still has to approve the decision , with a vote expected in mid-january .
the new regulations could increase prices for small trucks by several thousand euros .
producers whose vehicles exceed the 147 grams per kilometer will have to pay a fine of 95 euros per gram per vehicle .
the regulations are staggered , so that by 2014 emissions for light trucks are supposed to go down to 175 grams of co2 per kilometer .
currently regulations are only in place for private cars .
their emissions are supposed to fall below 130 grams of co2 per kilometer by 2012 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists say germany 's car lobby has again shown its strength german car lobby environmentalists complained that the decision watered down what the european commission proposed in 2009 .
" it 's very disappointing and yet another example of germany preventing more progressive politics from being put in place " , wolfgang lohbeck from greenpeace told deutsche welle .
" it shows that the german car lobby is very strong . "
" you could argue that -lrb- monday 's -rrb- decision was in fact not that important , " said lohbeck , adding that small vans and other utility vehicles only make up about eight percent of all cars on german roads .
according to the german environment ministry , these vehicles are responsible for some six percent of co2 emissions caused by traffic .
environmentalists are now concerned , lohbeck told deutsche welle , that the car lobby will continue to resist future decisions .
the regulations for cars , which were introduced last year , will soon be reviewed again by the eu .
" i hope that monday 's decision was not a bad premonition for what they 'll decide there , " lohbeck said .

that goes too far for many lawmakers . parliamentarians from all german mainstream parties joined on tuesday to present a draft bill which would allow embryo screening - also known as pre-implantation genetic diagnosis or pgd - in narrowly defined situations .
two other draft bills are on the way , both taking an even more restrictive line .
the new bills are a response to a decision by the federal court of justice in july , that ruled that a total and unconditional ban of pgd would not be in line with the constitution .
one of the main proponents of the current bill , ulrike flach of the junior coalition partner in chancellor angela merkel 's government , the liberal free democrats , emphasized that it was not intended to open any floodgates .
" pre-implantation genetic diagnosis will , in general , still be banned , " she said .
" but it will be allowed under very special circumstances . "
those circumstances include cases where one parent suffers from a severe hereditary condition which could be passed on to the child and would lead to severe disease , stillbirth or miscarriage .
avoiding abortions peter hintze of angela merkel 's christian democrats , said that the kind of cases they were talking about could lead to late abortions , since pre-natal diagnosis for such conditions is legal .
" our bill focuses on the situation of the women affected , " he said .
" we want to keep them free of conflicts over pregnancy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel is one of the conservatives who oppose pgd on principle the bill would set up an ethics commission to decide which genetic conditions would justify the use of screening .
the commission would be able to respond to scientific developments , removing diseases from the list should cures become available .
pgd raises ethical questions because it also has the potential to screen for genetic characteristics unrelated to medical necessity .
anxieties about " designer babies " are not new , prompting jerzy montag of the opposition green party to try to calm any such fears " i 'm not thinking of parents who 'd like to have a musically gifted child , or one with blue eyes , or one that does n't suffer from obesity , " he said .
" but i 'm thinking for instance of a woman who already has a child suffering from a severe congenital disease , a woman who wants to have another child , but wants to ensure it has a better deal in life .
although the bill presented on tuesday is supported by members of all parties , it will not necessarily get majority support in the bundestag .
opponents , including those who will sponsor the other two drafts , fear that screening to remove undesirable genes , however serious , could eventually have an adverse impact on the way society treats people with disabilities .

that goes too far for many lawmakers . parliamentarians from all german mainstream parties joined on tuesday to present a draft bill which would allow embryo screening - also known as pre-implantation genetic diagnosis or pgd - in narrowly defined situations .
two other draft bills are on the way , both taking an even more restrictive line .
the new bills are a response to a decision by the federal court of justice in july , that ruled that a total and unconditional ban of pgd would not be in line with the constitution .
one of the main proponents of the current bill , ulrike flach of the junior coalition partner in chancellor angela merkel 's government , the liberal free democrats , emphasized that it was not intended to open any floodgates .
" pre-implantation genetic diagnosis will , in general , still be banned , " she said .
" but it will be allowed under very special circumstances . "
those circumstances include cases where one parent suffers from a severe hereditary condition which could be passed on to the child and would lead to severe disease , stillbirth or miscarriage .

they seized propaganda in the homes of some former members of a group that was outlawed in 2009 . police raided homes of suspected neo-nazis in four german states on tuesday in an effort to prevent a meeting of right-wing extremists from across the country from being held .
the homes in question are said to have belonged to members of the successor organization to the outlawed union of german youth faithful to the homeland -lrb- hdj -rrb- .
the state criminal police office in the northern city of hanover said in a statemet that police had seized right-wing extremist propoganda that members of the group allegedly planned to hand out to minors in youth camps .
just like hitler youth 's camps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hdj organization ran camps in the style of the hitler youth the hdj was banned by the then german interior minister , wolfgang schaeuble in march of 2009 , because the group had run camps based on the model of the hitler youth , teaching children as young as six that foreigners and jews were a threat to the nation .
according to police , after the hdj was banned , former members continued their work in the guise of the young national democrats .
police said there was a danger that the neo-nazis would have broken laws at their planned get-together , including incitement to racial hatred and wearing banned uniforms .
in addition to lower saxony , where hanover is the state capital , raids were carried out in berlin , rhineland-palatinate and baden-wuerttemberg .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 21.12.2010 german researchers develop ice-free windshield großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has been hit unusually early with winter this year it 's what most european drivers are dreaming of these days : a farewell to ice-scraping .
but drivers need some patience : the new technology is not ready for the market yet , the german researchers say . with snow continuing to fall and temperatures often below zero degree celsius -lrb- 32 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in many parts of the continent , many europeans currently have to get up earlier than usual to scrape off the ice covering the windshields of their cars before they can actually drive off .
that may soon be a thing of the past , according to german researchers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not ready for mass-production yet in recent months , scientists at the fraunhofer institute for surface technology -lrb- ist -rrb- in braunschweig , in north-central germany , have announced a new car window glass which they claim does not allow an ice layer to form in the first place - even at temperatures as low as minus 18 celsius .
last month , volkswagen joined the project , hoping to turn this research into a feature on its cars .
" -lsb- the window -rsb- has been well-understood on a laboratory scale , but now needs to be implemented for large-scale operation , " said harthmuth hoffmann , a volkswagen spokesperson , in an e-mail sent to deutsche welle .
the problem is that this coating can interfere with radio and mobile phone reception .
heat ca n't radiate skyward the new glass works differently from a heated window - it is based on a physical principle : a wafer-thin transparent coating of indium tin oxide is applied to the window .
" we call this a ' low-e ' -lrb- low thermal emissivity -rrb- coating , " said thomas drescher of volkswagen development , in an interview with the dpa news service .
" applied to the outer glazing , it prevents heat from radiating skyward . "
the conductive " low-e coating " protects the glass from cooling .
that way , water on the outer surface does not condense or freeze and there is no ice film in the first place because radiative heat loss to the cold sky is minimised and this prevents or delays cooling of the glass surface to below the dew point .
scientists have worked on similar projects for some 50 years , andreas klein from technical university of darmstadt told deutsche welle .
" the challenge here is that they 're creating a coating which is applied externally rather than inside .
so the mechanism will have to be able to withstand adverse weather conditions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : driving in winter could just become this little bit easier older systems work with layers made from tin oxide .
but these are far from perfect - both from a practical and an esthetical point of view , the researchers found .
when glass is bent , for instance , the old layers will break because the temperatures get too high .
" our new layer is extremely stable , " said bernd szyszka , an ist researcher , in a statement published on the fraunhofer institute 's website .
" temperatures of up to 900 degrees celsius are no problem .
even if you bend the layer extensively it stays the way it is . "
when the layer is used in windshields , of course , weather conditions such as cloudiness , relative humidity and wind can affect the windows ' condensation behaviour .
" the ' low-e coating ' can not prevent ice formation or condensation entirely , but it can significantly reduce the likelihood of it happening , " drescher added .
ice-free windshield still not ready for the mass market for now , one drawback with the system as it is is that the new coating limits radio traffic in the car , which can impair radio and mobile phone reception , added harthmuth hoffmann , the volkswagen spokesperson .
as such , it remains unclear as to when the first cars equipped with the new wind screen can roll out from volkswagen 's assembly lines .
" it will take some time before the ice-free car windscreen is market-ready , " drescher noted , " but we are working intensively toward this goal . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 21.12.2010 no presents this year in corporate germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cash gifts are absolutely off limits in germany a major german industry association is urging managers to rethink corporate christmas gifts this year .
it does n't want to spoil the cheer , but reminds everybody of the dangers of corruption . christmas is just around the corner , and people are scrambling to find the perfect presents to stack under the tree .
but one organization is n't feeling the festive spirit and wants to do away with presents entirely – at least in the world of business .
the german association of materials management , purchasing and logistics -lrb- ammpl -rrb- says gifts have no place in business and that a good supplier wo n't need them to keep its customers .
the association represents some 8,000 members , and in 2008 established a ' code of conduct ' which covers corporate gift giving .
but it 's not always easy to draw a line between a small token of appreciation and a gift that could open the door to a host of ethical dilemmas .
that 's why sebastian schroeder , an ammpl compliance expert , says the code of conduct drafted by his organization lets companies decide what limits are acceptable .
comparable business dinners in london , hamburg or shanghai come at very different prices , he pointed out .
" ultimately it is up to the individual employee of a company to determine if a present has been made in good faith , " he told deutsche welle .
" we did n't set a limit to the value of presents . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airport operator fraport says its staff know what 's acceptable despite their clean-cut reputation , german managers have gone astray on numerous occasions .
in recent years , corruption scandals have rocked companies including siemens , man , daimler , and volkswagen .
intercultural challenge in a globalized business environment , there 's always the issue of differing cultural expectations .
representatives from asian , middle eastern and south american companies are likely to expect a tighter bond with business partners than many germans are used to , schroeder said .
" they close deals based more on personal trust , " he said .
" and sometimes a german buyer shows up and wants to get right to the deal and sign a contract , only to find there are certain limitations . "
in china , for instance , monetary gifts are not at all uncommon , although they are " clearly not acceptable in europe and the united states , " schroeder said .
companies may be reluctant to insult their business partners by returning a gift , giving rise to the challenge of different cultural expectations .
wariness of owing favors clemens von stockert , a manager in the compliance department of fraport airport in frankfurt , says his company deals with potential problems by banning gifts like airline tickets , car shares , and inexpensive credit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the thought that counts : dinner comes at a different price depending on the city a dinner out is fine – it 's gone after having been eaten .
but anything over 35 euros should be internally documented , according to von stockert .
" the important thing is that people do n't put themselves in a position of dependency , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have clear rules that money and anything with monetary value are not to be accepted . "
gift giving has decreased in volume during recent years , according to von stockert , but occasionally someone in the company will receive a present .
if it ca n't be given back without jeopardizing a business relationship , then it 's likely to end up going to charity ... and the company has to pay taxes on it .
" nowadays more companies are keeping these regulations in mind when it comes to accepting gifts and giving them , " von stockert said .
sebastian schroeder of ammpl added the idea is n't to spoil christmas fun , but to foster an environment where companies work together " fairly and in a spirit of partnership . "
" it is true that christmas and similar holidays are used as an opportunity to intensify existing relationships between companies , " he said .

while in goethe 's day , singing was an integral part of life in germany , the collective choir of the nation has since fallen rather silent .
christmas can go some way to restarting a passion . rudolph tiersch grew up in a world of song .
when he was a child , friends would come and visit his family on sundays and would sit in the kitchen , drink tea , chat and laugh .
as televisions were still a rarity in those days , it was only ever a matter of time before someone would pick up a guitar and the assembled company would burst into song .
for tiersch , who is now 50 years old , they are happy memories .
and not only for what they were , but for what he describes as their ability to unite people .
" it brings people together and gives them a home singing about their religion or their country , " tiersch told deutsche welle .
" chanting is the simplest way to bring people together .
you always have a voice with you .
not everyone can play the guitar or the piano , but everyone can sing . "
a long healthy tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinmar the minnesinger the basic german volkslied has its roots in the 12th century , which gave birth to minnesingers , who largely sung of love .
over time , the songs came to deal with other important issues such as religion , social conditions , and the soul of the people .
by the 19th century it had been turned into an art form , laden with bourgeois expression .
when the nazis seized power in 1933 , they used the national tradition of folk to promote what they claimed to be pure and german .
they wrote new songs to the tune of national socialism , successfully using them as instruments for manipulation and propaganda .
once the war was over , the east german communist regime continued to manipulate the masses through music , as tiersch recalls .
" i recall a song called unsere heimat which poetically describes the beauty of the country set to a lyrical melody , " he said .
" the underlying message was that socialism made it possible . "
from passion to profession although much in germany has changed in the twenty years since reunification , too many decades of state-decreed singing appears to have robbed many people of their lust for letting it all out .
not so tiersch , whose love of song is so profound that he is a professional choirmaster .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the frankfurt / oder singing academy he is the head of the singakademie in the eastern german town of frankfurt / oder , which comprises a children 's , a youth , a concert and a chamber-choir .
the choirmaster has been awarded germany 's federal cross of merit for his efforts to bring singing back into everyday life .
he says he sees his choirs as a social network .
" it 's like a little society inside society , " the choirmaster said .
" you 've got the judge on that side and the salesman there , but they sing together , they 're talking together , maybe they drink beer together . "
seeing a mixed bag of people united through song pleases tiersch greatly , and as choir member antonia brill explains , there are plenty of benefits to being part of a group with music at its core .
" it helps you .
when you 're sad , you think about moments when you sang together with everyone and it feels good , or when you 're singing on your own at home , you feel better , " the 19-year-old said .
re-igniting the fire but antonia is not necessarily the rule .
rudolph tiersch says it is becoming increasingly difficult to encourage young germans to sing , a state of affairs which he finds alarming .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when better to sing than at christmas ?
" it has been scientifically proven that singing activates parts of the brain which otherwise lie idle , " he said .
" children who hear their parents sing before they are three years old are better at school than their classmates who have only consumed music in the media . "
he believes the over-emphasis of individual freedom in society as we know it today often leads to social isolation , and is keen to point out the sense of community which comes from singing together .
particularly at this time of year .
" christmas is becoming more and more commercial in germany , too , " he said .
" with prosperity we are moving away from the religious traditions which are part of every society .
but christmas singing takes us back to our roots . "
and to prove his point , he has his singers working on bach 's christmas oratorio , which he explains is all about bringing love into the world .
as his singing academy is based in the former gdr , where the state opposed the church , many of his choir members are not familiar with the religious concepts which the music conveys .
to set that right , they discuss the work as a group , the aim always being to give the audience goose-bumps .
" if we do n't , we 've done something wrong , " the choirmaster said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 21.12.2010 no presents this year in corporate germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cash gifts are absolutely off limits in germany a major german industry association is urging managers to rethink corporate christmas gifts this year .
it does n't want to spoil the cheer , but reminds everybody of the dangers of corruption . christmas is just around the corner , and people are scrambling to find the perfect presents to stack under the tree .
but one organization is n't feeling the festive spirit and wants to do away with presents entirely – at least in the world of business .
the german association of materials management , purchasing and logistics -lrb- ammpl -rrb- says gifts have no place in business and that a good supplier wo n't need them to keep its customers .
the association represents some 8,000 members , and in 2008 established a ' code of conduct ' which covers corporate gift giving .
but it 's not always easy to draw a line between a small token of appreciation and a gift that could open the door to a host of ethical dilemmas .
that 's why sebastian schroeder , an ammpl compliance expert , says the code of conduct drafted by his organization lets companies decide what limits are acceptable .
comparable business dinners in london , hamburg or shanghai come at very different prices , he pointed out .
" ultimately it is up to the individual employee of a company to determine if a present has been made in good faith , " he told deutsche welle .
" we did n't set a limit to the value of presents . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airport operator fraport says its staff know what 's acceptable despite their clean-cut reputation , german managers have gone astray on numerous occasions .
in recent years , corruption scandals have rocked companies including siemens , man , daimler , and volkswagen .
intercultural challenge in a globalized business environment , there 's always the issue of differing cultural expectations .
representatives from asian , middle eastern and south american companies are likely to expect a tighter bond with business partners than many germans are used to , schroeder said .
" they close deals based more on personal trust , " he said .
" and sometimes a german buyer shows up and wants to get right to the deal and sign a contract , only to find there are certain limitations . "
in china , for instance , monetary gifts are not at all uncommon , although they are " clearly not acceptable in europe and the united states , " schroeder said .
companies may be reluctant to insult their business partners by returning a gift , giving rise to the challenge of different cultural expectations .
wariness of owing favors clemens von stockert , a manager in the compliance department of fraport airport in frankfurt , says his company deals with potential problems by banning gifts like airline tickets , car shares , and inexpensive credit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the thought that counts : dinner comes at a different price depending on the city a dinner out is fine – it 's gone after having been eaten .
but anything over 35 euros should be internally documented , according to von stockert .
" the important thing is that people do n't put themselves in a position of dependency , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have clear rules that money and anything with monetary value are not to be accepted . "
gift giving has decreased in volume during recent years , according to von stockert , but occasionally someone in the company will receive a present .
if it ca n't be given back without jeopardizing a business relationship , then it 's likely to end up going to charity ... and the company has to pay taxes on it .
" nowadays more companies are keeping these regulations in mind when it comes to accepting gifts and giving them , " von stockert said .
sebastian schroeder of ammpl added the idea is n't to spoil christmas fun , but to foster an environment where companies work together " fairly and in a spirit of partnership . "
" it is true that christmas and similar holidays are used as an opportunity to intensify existing relationships between companies , " he said .

he told monday 's berliner zeitung newspaper , " the welfare of the child must be the first consideration .
it 's not so much an issue of whether the adults want to live as a happy family .
i do n't believe that children want to grow up in a homosexual partnership . "
uta kehr , spokeswoman for the association of lesbians and gays in germany , said that kauder was encouraging prejudices against homosexual parents who care for children .
but worse still was the fact that he was humiliating homosexual parents in the eyes of their children .
" how will the 15-year-old son of a lesbian couple feel , for example , if he reads such things in the paper ? " she said .
children in " rainbow " families just as happy her position was backed up by leaders of the green party , who also pointed out that the german ministry for family affairs had recently published a study showing children who lived in so-called " rainbow " families felt just as well-looked-after and were just as successful as children of the same age in conventional families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker kauder has met with sharp criticism for his remarks kauder made his comment in remarks on pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- , a procedure which allows genetic control of artificially inseminated embryos before they are placed in the mother 's womb .
the german parliament is to have a free vote on proposals to allow highly restricted access to pgd in cases where there are good grounds to fear that the unborn child could suffer from a serious genetic disease .
kauder argued in the interview that " pgd opens the door to the temptation to select and manipulate life . "
but , he said , there was no " right to a child . "

it does n't want to spoil the cheer , but reminds everybody of the dangers of corruption . christmas is just around the corner , and people are scrambling to find the perfect presents to stack under the tree .
but one organization is n't feeling the festive spirit and wants to do away with presents entirely – at least in the world of business .
the german association of materials management , purchasing and logistics -lrb- ammpl -rrb- says gifts have no place in business and that a good supplier wo n't need them to keep its customers .
the association represents some 8,000 members , and in 2008 established a ' code of conduct ' which covers corporate gift giving .
but it 's not always easy to draw a line between a small token of appreciation and a gift that could open the door to a host of ethical dilemmas .
that 's why sebastian schroeder , an ammpl compliance expert , says the code of conduct drafted by his organization lets companies decide what limits are acceptable .
comparable business dinners in london , hamburg or shanghai come at very different prices , he pointed out .
" ultimately it is up to the individual employee of a company to determine if a present has been made in good faith , " he told deutsche welle .
" we did n't set a limit to the value of presents . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airport operator fraport says its staff know what 's acceptable despite their clean-cut reputation , german managers have gone astray on numerous occasions .
in recent years , corruption scandals have rocked companies including siemens , man , daimler , and volkswagen .
intercultural challenge in a globalized business environment , there 's always the issue of differing cultural expectations .
representatives from asian , middle eastern and south american companies are likely to expect a tighter bond with business partners than many germans are used to , schroeder said .
" they close deals based more on personal trust , " he said .
" and sometimes a german buyer shows up and wants to get right to the deal and sign a contract , only to find there are certain limitations . "
in china , for instance , monetary gifts are not at all uncommon , although they are " clearly not acceptable in europe and the united states , " schroeder said .
companies may be reluctant to insult their business partners by returning a gift , giving rise to the challenge of different cultural expectations .
wariness of owing favors clemens von stockert , a manager in the compliance department of fraport airport in frankfurt , says his company deals with potential problems by banning gifts like airline tickets , car shares , and inexpensive credit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the thought that counts : dinner comes at a different price depending on the city a dinner out is fine – it 's gone after having been eaten .
but anything over 35 euros should be internally documented , according to von stockert .
" the important thing is that people do n't put themselves in a position of dependency , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have clear rules that money and anything with monetary value are not to be accepted . "
gift giving has decreased in volume during recent years , according to von stockert , but occasionally someone in the company will receive a present .
if it ca n't be given back without jeopardizing a business relationship , then it 's likely to end up going to charity ... and the company has to pay taxes on it .
" nowadays more companies are keeping these regulations in mind when it comes to accepting gifts and giving them , " von stockert said .
sebastian schroeder of ammpl added the idea is n't to spoil christmas fun , but to foster an environment where companies work together " fairly and in a spirit of partnership . "
" it is true that christmas and similar holidays are used as an opportunity to intensify existing relationships between companies , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 21.12.2010 campaigners target sandblasted jeans on health grounds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fine particles of sand can scar the lungs of blasting workers campaigners are eager to put an end to the practice of sandblasting jeans because of a link with the disease silicosis .
in turkey , where the practice is now banned , thousands of ex-workers are thought to be suffering . consumers looking for a pair of jeans with that special worn look might want to check the label , according to campaigners .
the clean clothes campaign -lrb- ccc -rrb- is calling for a global ban on the practice of sandblasting , in which denim is sprayed with sand at high pressure to give the material a distressed look .
sandblasting is associated with the disease silicosis - a lung disease caused by fine particles of sand thrown into the air during the process .
turkey was a major producer of sandblasted garments before a ban on the process was implemented in 2009 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sandblasted jeans are popular on the high street around 10,000 people have been employed in sandblasting , according to yesim yasin , from the istanbul-based solidarity committee of sandblasting laborers .
" unfortunately many studies reveal the fact that almost 50 percent of the total number of employees are expected to contract this disease , silicosis , " yasin said .
" silicosis has always been and still is incurable .
the workers are sick , but as they have worked in the informal sector they have no basic legal rights . "
effort to persuade big firms the committee and the ccc have started a campaign for turkey to recognize that victims of sandblasting are victims of an industrial disease .
this would enable the families of 46 workers who have already died to receive benefits and support .
the groups also say that silicosis sufferers who are still alive are in need of help .
one of them is 39-year-old mehmet basak ; doctors predict he has about a year to live .
" i am having difficulty while walking , especially when i have to climb up a hill or even stairs i am totally out of breath , i can not breathe , " basak told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey was a center for sandblasting until the ban " i used to work from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.
dust would build up all over my body , you could n't even recognize me or my co-workers until we showered . "
the clean clothes campaign says that the garment industry is getting around the turkish prohibition by shifting the work to subcontractors in developing countries ; they argue that this is immoral on health grounds .
the group - an alliance of organizations in 15 european countries - is trying to persuade jeans makers to abandon the practice altogether .
" a number of big jeans producers like levis strauss and h & m have all said they would stop sandblasting with almost immediate effect , or by the end of this year , " said wyger wentholdt from the ccc .
" there are a couple of jeans brands who have not wanted to react to our approach at all . "
wendholt warned that , after lobbying , a name and shame campaign could follow against firms that persist in using the material .

in turkey , where the practice is now banned , thousands of ex-workers are thought to be suffering . consumers looking for a pair of jeans with that special worn look might want to check the label , according to campaigners .
the clean clothes campaign -lrb- ccc -rrb- is calling for a global ban on the practice of sandblasting , in which denim is sprayed with sand at high pressure to give the material a distressed look .
sandblasting is associated with the disease silicosis - a lung disease caused by fine particles of sand thrown into the air during the process .
turkey was a major producer of sandblasted garments before a ban on the process was implemented in 2009 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sandblasted jeans are popular on the high street around 10,000 people have been employed in sandblasting , according to yesim yasin , from the istanbul-based solidarity committee of sandblasting laborers .
" unfortunately many studies reveal the fact that almost 50 percent of the total number of employees are expected to contract this disease , silicosis , " yasin said .
" silicosis has always been and still is incurable .
the workers are sick , but as they have worked in the informal sector they have no basic legal rights . "
effort to persuade big firms the committee and the ccc have started a campaign for turkey to recognize that victims of sandblasting are victims of an industrial disease .
this would enable the families of 46 workers who have already died to receive benefits and support .
the groups also say that silicosis sufferers who are still alive are in need of help .
one of them is 39-year-old mehmet basak ; doctors predict he has about a year to live .
" i am having difficulty while walking , especially when i have to climb up a hill or even stairs i am totally out of breath , i can not breathe , " basak told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey was a center for sandblasting until the ban " i used to work from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.
dust would build up all over my body , you could n't even recognize me or my co-workers until we showered . "
the clean clothes campaign says that the garment industry is getting around the turkish prohibition by shifting the work to subcontractors in developing countries ; they argue that this is immoral on health grounds .
the group - an alliance of organizations in 15 european countries - is trying to persuade jeans makers to abandon the practice altogether .
" a number of big jeans producers like levis strauss and h & m have all said they would stop sandblasting with almost immediate effect , or by the end of this year , " said wyger wentholdt from the ccc .
" there are a couple of jeans brands who have not wanted to react to our approach at all . "
wendholt warned that , after lobbying , a name and shame campaign could follow against firms that persist in using the material .

this year , the only fights were over how many dortmund players we could include . nick , ben and jefferson are all great admirers of what juergen klopp has done at dortmund , but matt has obviously come down with a serious case of yellow-and-black fever .
left to his own devices , he would have included no fewer than eight dortmund players in his top 11 .
in the end , the rest of us applied the restraints -lrb- that is , we tied him to his bed -rrb- , so that a few players from other teams got the credit they deserved as well .
we begin with a pair of excellent african strikers .
bildunterschrift : cisse has carried a huge load for freiburg fantastic forwards one player we all agreed on , even matt , was freiburg 's papiss demba cisse .
with his 13 goals , the senegalese striker has the small southwestern german club sniffing the rarefied air at seldom experienced elevations in the table .
matt put it best : " cisse is from another planet - one where one man is enough to propel a team like freiburg up to sixth . "
not shabby for a player who came from the french second division .
chapeau !
on numbers alone , frankfurt 's theofanis gekas would have been a logical choice , but we all felt that he has gotten a number of lucky goals .
matt wanted dortmund 's lukas barrios , while nick preferred schalke 's klaas-jan huntelaar , but jefferson and ben went for didier ya konan .
how important is he to hanover ?
consider this .
since he joined the club in 2009 , hanover have n't earned a single point with him out of the starting line-up .
that 's truly a most valuable player .
majestic midfield no arguments at all about where to start in midfield : dortmund 's nuri sahin and shinji kagawa .
but what can be said about this dynamic duo that has n't been said thousands of times before ?
well how about this ?
sahin is the smartest player in german football .
to watch him is to see a player who seems to know exactly what 's happening in all areas of the pitch at all times .
that 's the definition of a rudder , and you can bet lots of huge european clubs will be vying for his services in the summer .
there 's room for improvement , though - from the spot .
sahin failed to convert the two penalties he took this season , about the only thing he did wrong in the latter half of 2010 .
moving on to kagawa , the three things most often mentioned are 1 -rrb- he 's from japan , 2 -rrb- he only cost 300,000 euros and 3 -rrb- he runs around a lot .
that 's all true but being japanese and cheap hardly guarantees footballing success , and lots of players run around lots without posting eight goals as he has .
what 's often neglected is his fantastic on-the-ball technique .
when he cuts into the middle of the pitch , the only player who 's more dangerous from medium range is arjen robben .
bildunterschrift : this man 's spectacular goals have fans saying " play it again , sam " matt went purely dortmund for the rest of midfield , but the aesthetes among us agreed that we just had to have leverkusen 's sidney sam .
it 's not just that the 22-year-old sam has scored six goals - it 's the way he 's scored them .
for example , his 20-meter-plus volley against kaiserslautern .
or his curling left-footer against hoffenheim .
or ... oh , just go to youtube , and check them out for yourselves .
he 's joined by teammate arturo vidal . six of his eight goals may have come on penalties , but nerves count in football , and the chilean converted all his attempts .
and they were n't meaningless ones either .
they resulted in seven points .
vidal is a main reason perennial unstable leverkusen are playing with consistency and are the only team with a slight chance of overtaking dortmund .
dependable defenders and one great goalkeeper dortmund have by far and away the best defense in the league , so it 's no surprise that mats hummels and marcel schmelzer were unanimous choices .
bildunterschrift : it 's been mighty hard getting by hummels hummels is quite simply the best defender at the moment in germany .
bayern 's uli hoeness is man of few regrets , but he surely must rue the decision to let hummels go in 2008 .
-lrb- there are rumors , terrifying to dortmund fans , that there 's a buy-back clause in the defender 's contract . -rrb-
schmelzer , meanwhile , makes the squad because he excels at the position , left back , that most teams struggle to fill .
his ability to get forward make dortmund ambidextrous , so to speak , and that 's one reason why only two teams this season succeeded in stopping them .
bildunterschrift : the new lahm is an ochs at right back , you could pencil in philipp lahm most years , but this time round the honors go to frankfurt 's captain patrick ochs .
never heard of him ?
you 're not alone , but for years now he 's been one of the bundesliga 's best value-for-money players , equally adapt at protecting the back and going forward .
he 's also versatile , sometimes moving up to midfield , and dependable , having played all but a handful of minutes in frankfurt 's matches .
the other central defender was the trickiest .
nick and matt were in the majority , preferring dortmund 's neven subotic , and ben had the funniest argument for hanover 's emanuel pogatetz : " no team should be without a mad austrian bastard . "
but jefferson intervened , dictatorially , because he felt someone from mainz had to be included .
and since mainz coach thomas tuchel rotates all other positions , that man had to be their captain nikolce noveski .
the 31-year-old noveski has n't missed a single minute , and while lewis holtby and andre schuerrle have grabbed the press attention , mainz have the second-best defense in the league - and the second-best spot in the standings .
last but by no means least , there 's schalke 's manuel neuer .
a homegrown product , he kept the royal blues within striking distance during their horrid start - without him , schalke would almost certainly be in the relegation zone .
and his first-half performance in schalke 's 2-0 win over bayern was truly heroic , as he turned away shot after shot .
best goalkeeper in germany ?
no question about that - even dortmund-phile matt put him on the list .
best goalkeeper in the world ?
maybe .
and that 's a mark of just how good our bundesliga top xi is at the back .

that 's all true but being japanese and cheap hardly guarantees footballing success , and lots of players run around lots without posting eight goals as he has .
what 's often neglected is his fantastic on-the-ball technique .
when he cuts into the middle of the pitch , the only player who 's more dangerous from medium range is arjen robben .
bildunterschrift : this man 's spectacular goals have fans saying " play it again , sam " matt went purely dortmund for the rest of midfield , but the aesthetes among us agreed that we just had to have leverkusen 's sidney sam .
it 's not just that the 22-year-old sam has scored six goals - it 's the way he 's scored them .
for example , his 20-meter-plus volley against kaiserslautern .
or his curling left-footer against hoffenheim .
or ... oh , just go to youtube , and check them out for yourselves .
he 's joined by teammate arturo vidal . six of his eight goals may have come on penalties , but nerves count in football , and the chilean converted all his attempts .
and they were n't meaningless ones either .
they resulted in seven points .
vidal is a main reason perennial unstable leverkusen are playing with consistency and are the only team with a slight chance of overtaking dortmund .
dependable defenders and one great goalkeeper dortmund have by far and away the best defense in the league , so it 's no surprise that mats hummels and marcel schmelzer were unanimous choices .
bildunterschrift : it 's been mighty hard getting by hummels hummels is quite simply the best defender at the moment in germany .
bayern 's uli hoeness is man of few regrets , but he surely must rue the decision to let hummels go in 2008 .
-lrb- there are rumors , terrifying to dortmund fans , that there 's a buy-back clause in the defender 's contract . -rrb-
schmelzer , meanwhile , makes the squad because he excels at the position , left back , that most teams struggle to fill .
his ability to get forward make dortmund ambidextrous , so to speak , and that 's one reason why only two teams this season succeeded in stopping them .
bildunterschrift : the new lahm is an ochs at right back , you could pencil in philipp lahm most years , but this time round the honors go to frankfurt 's captain patrick ochs .
never heard of him ?
you 're not alone , but for years now he 's been one of the bundesliga 's best value-for-money players , equally adapt at protecting the back and going forward .
he 's also versatile , sometimes moving up to midfield , and dependable , having played all but a handful of minutes in frankfurt 's matches .
the other central defender was the trickiest .
nick and matt were in the majority , preferring dortmund 's neven subotic , and ben had the funniest argument for hanover 's emanuel pogatetz : " no team should be without a mad austrian bastard . "
but jefferson intervened , dictatorially , because he felt someone from mainz had to be included .
and since mainz coach thomas tuchel rotates all other positions , that man had to be their captain nikolce noveski .
the 31-year-old noveski has n't missed a single minute , and while lewis holtby and andre schuerrle have grabbed the press attention , mainz have the second-best defense in the league - and the second-best spot in the standings .
last but by no means least , there 's schalke 's manuel neuer .
a homegrown product , he kept the royal blues within striking distance during their horrid start - without him , schalke would almost certainly be in the relegation zone .
and his first-half performance in schalke 's 2-0 win over bayern was truly heroic , as he turned away shot after shot .
best goalkeeper in germany ?
no question about that - even dortmund-phile matt put him on the list .
best goalkeeper in the world ?
maybe .

this year , the only fights were over how many dortmund players we could include . nick , ben and jefferson are all great admirers of what juergen klopp has done at dortmund , but matt has obviously come down with a serious case of yellow-and-black fever .
left to his own devices , he would have included no fewer than eight dortmund players in his top 11 .
in the end , the rest of us applied the restraints -lrb- that is , we tied him to his bed -rrb- , so that a few players from other teams got the credit they deserved as well .
we begin with a pair of excellent african strikers .
bildunterschrift : cisse has carried a huge load for freiburg fantastic forwards one player we all agreed on , even matt , was freiburg 's papiss demba cisse .
with his 13 goals , the senegalese striker has the small southwestern german club sniffing the rarefied air at seldom experienced elevations in the table .
matt put it best : " cisse is from another planet - one where one man is enough to propel a team like freiburg up to sixth . "
not shabby for a player who came from the french second division .
chapeau !
on numbers alone , frankfurt 's theofanis gekas would have been a logical choice , but we all felt that he has gotten a number of lucky goals .
matt wanted dortmund 's lukas barrios , while nick preferred schalke 's klaas-jan huntelaar , but jefferson and ben went for didier ya konan .
how important is he to hanover ?
consider this .
since he joined the club in 2009 , hanover have n't earned a single point with him out of the starting line-up .
that 's truly a most valuable player .
majestic midfield no arguments at all about where to start in midfield : dortmund 's nuri sahin and shinji kagawa .
but what can be said about this dynamic duo that has n't been said thousands of times before ?
well how about this ?
sahin is the smartest player in german football .
to watch him is to see a player who seems to know exactly what 's happening in all areas of the pitch at all times .
that 's the definition of a rudder , and you can bet lots of huge european clubs will be vying for his services in the summer .
there 's room for improvement , though - from the spot .
sahin failed to convert the two penalties he took this season , about the only thing he did wrong in the latter half of 2010 .
moving on to kagawa , the three things most often mentioned are 1 -rrb- he 's from japan , 2 -rrb- he only cost 300,000 euros and 3 -rrb- he runs around a lot .
that 's all true but being japanese and cheap hardly guarantees footballing success , and lots of players run around lots without posting eight goals as he has .

an increasing number of holidaymakers are opting for eco-tourism which aims to protect travel destinations and their natural surroundings . it 's a scene emblematic of global mass tourism .
at 8 in the morning , the early risers have already spread out their towels on the sun loungers by the pool .
by 11 , the first jug of sangria has been ordered and the all-you-can-eat buffet is getting ready to open . and even though the hotel is on the sunny spanish island of mallorca , the staff all speak german , and are ready to cater to the every need of holidaymakers who 've spent 287 euros -lrb- $ 378 -rrb- a head for a week-long package tour , flights and cocktails included .
it might seem like a low-cost way of escaping the grim german winter , but the environmental cost is high .
mass tourism often takes a heavy toll on nature .
on the island of mallorca , the consequences of five decades of unchecked tourism include a water shortage and a concrete jungle along the coastline .
even the once unspoilt beaches of the balearic island are now lined with yacht harbors .
traveling with a good conscience bildunterschrift : mallorca is no longer an insider tip but the situation does n't need to get any worse .
the alternative to mass tourism is ‘ soft ' or green tourism – also known as environmentally-friendly tourism , gentle tourism , sustainable tourism and ecotourism .
essentially , the aim is to leave travel destinations unspoiled or unchanged by tourism . " ecotourism is a responsible form of travel that contributes to environmental protection and the wellbeing of local communities , ” explains ayako ezaki from the international ecotourism society -lrb- ties -rrb- .
" both the environment and the populations visited should benefit in cultural , economic and environmental terms from tourism . "
so , why is n't everyone doing it ?
mainly , because ecotourism is considerably more expensive than a package trip – and to many , snagging a bargain still matters more than having a clear conscience .
responsible travel is a concept that has yet to sink in on a broader scale , despite the galloping pace of climate change .
not so very long ago , international travel was prohibitively costly , so only a privileged few could afford to see the world .
but recent decades have seen low-cost tourism boom – at least for the developed world .
some 900 million people a year take advantage of no-frills travel options every year , and the knock-on effect is a rapid rise in co2 levels .
growing awareness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in laos , tourists can stay overnight high up in centuries-old trees nevertheless , increasing numbers of travellers are realizing that it 's not okay to use liters of water every time they take a shower when locals lack access to a clean drinking water supply .
according to ties , the ecotourism sector has been growing by 34 percent each year since 1990 .
jonathan tourtellot from the national geographic center for sustainable destinations attributes the trend to increased awareness of environmental issues and the need to curb climate change .
" moreover , there 's also a growing interest in ' authentic ' destinations , " he says .
this means that tourists do n't just hole up in sterile hotels but get to actually explore their environment in all its natural beauty .
but even ecotourists tend to fly to their destinations , thereby adding to global co2 emissions .
and with their swimming pools , air conditioning , restaurants and cafés that remain lit up into the early hours of the morning , tourist centres all over the world consume high levels of energy .
by switching to renewable energies , hotels can also do their bit to make sustainable tourism a viable alternative .
one hotel on the island kho khao in thailnd has done just that .
the kho khao beach resort now meets most of its energy needs through a combination of solar and wind power units .
the hotel owners hope to cut the island 's carbon emissions by 20 percent , and in the long run , they hope that kho khao will provide a model for sustainable tourism in thailand .
putting the brakes on climate change is one aspect of green travel , and protecting natural habitats from the ravages of mass tourism is another .
kho khao is home to ocean turtles , dolphins and rare birds , and these will only survive if the local tourism industry develops at a gentle pace .
the economics of tourism bildunterschrift : getting to know the local population is one aspect of ecotourism yet another aspect of responsible tourism is the role it plays in the economies of developing nations .
ayako ekazi from ties explains that ecotourism should ideally help tackle local poverty and promote growth .
moreover , tourists can talk to locals and learn something about the country they are visiting – exchange of information and communication is inevitably constructive and educational .
" ecotourism is not a one-way street , ” says ezaki .
" these days it is often cited as an opportunity for growth in developing nations , but that does n't mean it does n't exist in the richer nations . ”
the national geographic center for sustainable destinations , for example , is currently working on an initiative in the douro valley in portugal to promote gentle tourism .
and even mallorca is not yet a lost cause : it 's home to numerous projects aimed at preserving the island 's countryside .
and after the spanish property crash of 2007 , the government put a stop to further hotel construction in many regions .

thousands have been spending their nights in airports hoping their flights will take off . fresh snowfall overnight caused further setbacks at frankfurt airport , with no planes taking off or landing on tuesday morning .
around 130 departures , and a further 130 arrivals , were canceled at germany 's biggest air terminal .
one of the airport 's three runaways was reopened , allowing the first plane of the day to land at 8:28 a.m.
brussels airport and london heathrow , the world 's busiest airport , continued to experience disruption .
it was running a reduced number of flights on tuesday .
eurostar services from london to paris and brussels had also been hit .
speed restrictions mean that fewer trains were running .
eurostar asked " all customers booked to travel before christmas to refund or exchange their tickets free of charge , if their travel is not essential . "
thousands of passengers spent monday night waiting in airports and train stations , as the countdown to christmas shortens .
airports struggle airports were experiencing a backlog of passengers after hundreds of flights were cancelled over the weekend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : december is one of the most popular times to travel at frankfurt , some 340 of the 1,340 takeoffs and landings were canceled on monday , while at london heathrow , europe 's busiest airport , a very limited service began again on monday after a weekend of almost total standstill .
many other airports opened for a few hours before closing again .
the berlin airport operators said they did not expect services to return to normal before christmas .
the german transport minister , peter ramsauer , has suggested to local authorities that they allow flights at night , in order to clear the backlog of passengers .
the british authorities have already withdrawn the ban on night-flights until december 24 , christmas eve .
trains disrupted trains around berlin were seriously delayed on monday due to heavy snowfalls in the region .
throughout the country , frozen switches led to considerable problems .
a number of trains were canceled and , among those that ran , delays of over an hour were frequent .
speed limits were introduced on high-speed tracks to prevent damage to train undercarriages from blocks of ice .
the company operating almost all of germany 's long-distance trains , deutsche bahn , continued to warn passengers that trains were likely to be very crowded .
" there are likely to be considerable bottlenecks on major lines because of the cancelation of flights , " they wrote on their website .
throughout much of europe , railways were similarly disrupted .
even in southern sweden , which is used to heavy snow , 100 of 350 train journeys were cancelled on monday .
restrictions on the roads bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting around on foot has been the only option for many people on the roads too , the weather has caused serious disruption .
the authorities imposed a travel ban on buses and trucks in paris .
in parts of germany trucks weighing more than 7.5 tons were at times banned from freeways after a series of accidents in which tractor-trailers skidded and blocked the carriageway .
in the western state of north rhine-westphalia , there were 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- of traffic jams during the monday morning rush hour .
the police have been complaining that many drivers are still using summer tires , in spite of the icy conditions .
the chief executive of the association of local authorities , gerd landsberg , told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper that , after the costs of last year 's heavy winter , local governments would have to cut back on clearing the roads .
he said drivers would have to get used to driving on snowy roads , as they do in scandinavia .
although it 's expected that the weather will warm on thursday , another cold spell is forecast in time for christmas , although it is not expected to bring much snow .

while in goethe 's day , singing was an integral part of life in germany , the collective choir of the nation has since fallen rather silent .
christmas can go some way to restarting a passion . rudolph tiersch grew up in a world of song .
when he was a child , friends would come and visit his family on sundays and would sit in the kitchen , drink tea , chat and laugh .
as televisions were still a rarity in those days , it was only ever a matter of time before someone would pick up a guitar and the assembled company would burst into song .
for tiersch , who is now 50 years old , they are happy memories .
and not only for what they were , but for what he describes as their ability to unite people .
" it brings people together and gives them a home singing about their religion or their country , " tiersch told deutsche welle .
" chanting is the simplest way to bring people together .
you always have a voice with you .
not everyone can play the guitar or the piano , but everyone can sing . "
a long healthy tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinmar the minnesinger the basic german volkslied has its roots in the 12th century , which gave birth to minnesingers , who largely sung of love .
over time , the songs came to deal with other important issues such as religion , social conditions , and the soul of the people .
by the 19th century it had been turned into an art form , laden with bourgeois expression .
when the nazis seized power in 1933 , they used the national tradition of folk to promote what they claimed to be pure and german .
they wrote new songs to the tune of national socialism , successfully using them as instruments for manipulation and propaganda .
once the war was over , the east german communist regime continued to manipulate the masses through music , as tiersch recalls .
" i recall a song called unsere heimat which poetically describes the beauty of the country set to a lyrical melody , " he said .
" the underlying message was that socialism made it possible . "
from passion to profession although much in germany has changed in the twenty years since reunification , too many decades of state-decreed singing appears to have robbed many people of their lust for letting it all out .
not so tiersch , whose love of song is so profound that he is a professional choirmaster .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the frankfurt / oder singing academy he is the head of the singakademie in the eastern german town of frankfurt / oder , which comprises a children 's , a youth , a concert and a chamber-choir .
the choirmaster has been awarded germany 's federal cross of merit for his efforts to bring singing back into everyday life .
he says he sees his choirs as a social network .
" it 's like a little society inside society , " the choirmaster said .
" you 've got the judge on that side and the salesman there , but they sing together , they 're talking together , maybe they drink beer together . "
seeing a mixed bag of people united through song pleases tiersch greatly , and as choir member antonia brill explains , there are plenty of benefits to being part of a group with music at its core .
" it helps you .
when you 're sad , you think about moments when you sang together with everyone and it feels good , or when you 're singing on your own at home , you feel better , " the 19-year-old said .
re-igniting the fire but antonia is not necessarily the rule .
rudolph tiersch says it is becoming increasingly difficult to encourage young germans to sing , a state of affairs which he finds alarming .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when better to sing than at christmas ?
" it has been scientifically proven that singing activates parts of the brain which otherwise lie idle , " he said .
" children who hear their parents sing before they are three years old are better at school than their classmates who have only consumed music in the media . "
he believes the over-emphasis of individual freedom in society as we know it today often leads to social isolation , and is keen to point out the sense of community which comes from singing together .
particularly at this time of year .
" christmas is becoming more and more commercial in germany , too , " he said .
" with prosperity we are moving away from the religious traditions which are part of every society .
but christmas singing takes us back to our roots . "
and to prove his point , he has his singers working on bach 's christmas oratorio , which he explains is all about bringing love into the world .
as his singing academy is based in the former gdr , where the state opposed the church , many of his choir members are not familiar with the religious concepts which the music conveys .
to set that right , they discuss the work as a group , the aim always being to give the audience goose-bumps .
" if we do n't , we 've done something wrong , " the choirmaster said .

this year , the only fights were over how many dortmund players we could include . nick , ben and jefferson are all great admirers of what juergen klopp has done at dortmund , but matt has obviously come down with a serious case of yellow-and-black fever .
left to his own devices , he would have included no fewer than eight dortmund players in his top 11 .
in the end , the rest of us applied the restraints -lrb- that is , we tied him to his bed -rrb- , so that a few players from other teams got the credit they deserved as well .
we begin with a pair of excellent african strikers .
bildunterschrift : cisse has carried a huge load for freiburg fantastic forwards one player we all agreed on , even matt , was freiburg 's papiss demba cisse .
with his 13 goals , the senegalese striker has the small southwestern german club sniffing the rarefied air at seldom experienced elevations in the table .
matt put it best : " cisse is from another planet - one where one man is enough to propel a team like freiburg up to sixth . "
not shabby for a player who came from the french second division .
chapeau !
on numbers alone , frankfurt 's theofanis gekas would have been a logical choice , but we all felt that he has gotten a number of lucky goals .
matt wanted dortmund 's lukas barrios , while nick preferred schalke 's klaas-jan huntelaar , but jefferson and ben went for didier ya konan .
how important is he to hanover ?
consider this .
since he joined the club in 2009 , hanover have n't earned a single point with him out of the starting line-up .
that 's truly a most valuable player .
majestic midfield no arguments at all about where to start in midfield : dortmund 's nuri sahin and shinji kagawa .
but what can be said about this dynamic duo that has n't been said thousands of times before ?
well how about this ?
sahin is the smartest player in german football .
to watch him is to see a player who seems to know exactly what 's happening in all areas of the pitch at all times .
that 's the definition of a rudder , and you can bet lots of huge european clubs will be vying for his services in the summer .
there 's room for improvement , though - from the spot .
sahin failed to convert the two penalties he took this season , about the only thing he did wrong in the latter half of 2010 .
moving on to kagawa , the three things most often mentioned are 1 -rrb- he 's from japan , 2 -rrb- he only cost 300,000 euros and 3 -rrb- he runs around a lot .
that 's all true but being japanese and cheap hardly guarantees footballing success , and lots of players run around lots without posting eight goals as he has .
what 's often neglected is his fantastic on-the-ball technique .
when he cuts into the middle of the pitch , the only player who 's more dangerous from medium range is arjen robben .
bildunterschrift : this man 's spectacular goals have fans saying " play it again , sam " matt went purely dortmund for the rest of midfield , but the aesthetes among us agreed that we just had to have leverkusen 's sidney sam .
it 's not just that the 22-year-old sam has scored six goals - it 's the way he 's scored them .
for example , his 20-meter-plus volley against kaiserslautern .
or his curling left-footer against hoffenheim .
or ... oh , just go to youtube , and check them out for yourselves .
he 's joined by teammate arturo vidal . six of his eight goals may have come on penalties , but nerves count in football , and the chilean converted all his attempts .
and they were n't meaningless ones either .
they resulted in seven points .
vidal is a main reason perennial unstable leverkusen are playing with consistency and are the only team with a slight chance of overtaking dortmund .
dependable defenders and one great goalkeeper dortmund have by far and away the best defense in the league , so it 's no surprise that mats hummels and marcel schmelzer were unanimous choices .
bildunterschrift : it 's been mighty hard getting by hummels hummels is quite simply the best defender at the moment in germany .
bayern 's uli hoeness is man of few regrets , but he surely must rue the decision to let hummels go in 2008 .
-lrb- there are rumors , terrifying to dortmund fans , that there 's a buy-back clause in the defender 's contract . -rrb-
schmelzer , meanwhile , makes the squad because he excels at the position , left back , that most teams struggle to fill .
his ability to get forward make dortmund ambidextrous , so to speak , and that 's one reason why only two teams this season succeeded in stopping them .
bildunterschrift : the new lahm is an ochs at right back , you could pencil in philipp lahm most years , but this time round the honors go to frankfurt 's captain patrick ochs .
never heard of him ?
you 're not alone , but for years now he 's been one of the bundesliga 's best value-for-money players , equally adapt at protecting the back and going forward .
he 's also versatile , sometimes moving up to midfield , and dependable , having played all but a handful of minutes in frankfurt 's matches .
the other central defender was the trickiest .
nick and matt were in the majority , preferring dortmund 's neven subotic , and ben had the funniest argument for hanover 's emanuel pogatetz : " no team should be without a mad austrian bastard . "
but jefferson intervened , dictatorially , because he felt someone from mainz had to be included .
and since mainz coach thomas tuchel rotates all other positions , that man had to be their captain nikolce noveski .
the 31-year-old noveski has n't missed a single minute , and while lewis holtby and andre schuerrle have grabbed the press attention , mainz have the second-best defense in the league - and the second-best spot in the standings .
last but by no means least , there 's schalke 's manuel neuer .
a homegrown product , he kept the royal blues within striking distance during their horrid start - without him , schalke would almost certainly be in the relegation zone .
and his first-half performance in schalke 's 2-0 win over bayern was truly heroic , as he turned away shot after shot .
best goalkeeper in germany ?
no question about that - even dortmund-phile matt put him on the list .
best goalkeeper in the world ?
maybe .
and that 's a mark of just how good our bundesliga top xi is at the back .

he told monday 's berliner zeitung newspaper , " the welfare of the child must be the first consideration .
it 's not so much an issue of whether the adults want to live as a happy family .
i do n't believe that children want to grow up in a homosexual partnership . "
uta kehr , spokeswoman for the association of lesbians and gays in germany , said that kauder was encouraging prejudices against homosexual parents who care for children .
but worse still was the fact that he was humiliating homosexual parents in the eyes of their children .
" how will the 15-year-old son of a lesbian couple feel , for example , if he reads such things in the paper ? " she said .
children in " rainbow " families just as happy her position was backed up by leaders of the green party , who also pointed out that the german ministry for family affairs had recently published a study showing children who lived in so-called " rainbow " families felt just as well-looked-after and were just as successful as children of the same age in conventional families .

kauder argued in the interview that " pgd opens the door to the temptation to select and manipulate life . "

thousands have been spending their nights in airports hoping their flights will take off . fresh snowfall overnight caused further setbacks at frankfurt airport , with no planes taking off or landing on tuesday morning .
around 130 departures , and a further 130 arrivals , were canceled at germany 's biggest air terminal .
one of the airport 's three runaways was reopened , allowing the first plane of the day to land at 8:28 a.m.
brussels airport and london heathrow , the world 's busiest airport , continued to experience disruption .
it was running a reduced number of flights on tuesday .
eurostar services from london to paris and brussels had also been hit .
speed restrictions mean that fewer trains were running .
eurostar asked " all customers booked to travel before christmas to refund or exchange their tickets free of charge , if their travel is not essential . "
thousands of passengers spent monday night waiting in airports and train stations , as the countdown to christmas shortens .
airports struggle airports were experiencing a backlog of passengers after hundreds of flights were cancelled over the weekend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : december is one of the most popular times to travel at frankfurt , some 340 of the 1,340 takeoffs and landings were canceled on monday , while at london heathrow , europe 's busiest airport , a very limited service began again on monday after a weekend of almost total standstill .
many other airports opened for a few hours before closing again .
the berlin airport operators said they did not expect services to return to normal before christmas .
the german transport minister , peter ramsauer , has suggested to local authorities that they allow flights at night , in order to clear the backlog of passengers .
the british authorities have already withdrawn the ban on night-flights until december 24 , christmas eve .
trains disrupted trains around berlin were seriously delayed on monday due to heavy snowfalls in the region .
throughout the country , frozen switches led to considerable problems .
a number of trains were canceled and , among those that ran , delays of over an hour were frequent .
speed limits were introduced on high-speed tracks to prevent damage to train undercarriages from blocks of ice .
the company operating almost all of germany 's long-distance trains , deutsche bahn , continued to warn passengers that trains were likely to be very crowded .
" there are likely to be considerable bottlenecks on major lines because of the cancelation of flights , " they wrote on their website .
throughout much of europe , railways were similarly disrupted .
even in southern sweden , which is used to heavy snow , 100 of 350 train journeys were cancelled on monday .
restrictions on the roads bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting around on foot has been the only option for many people on the roads too , the weather has caused serious disruption .
the authorities imposed a travel ban on buses and trucks in paris .
in parts of germany trucks weighing more than 7.5 tons were at times banned from freeways after a series of accidents in which tractor-trailers skidded and blocked the carriageway .
in the western state of north rhine-westphalia , there were 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- of traffic jams during the monday morning rush hour .
the police have been complaining that many drivers are still using summer tires , in spite of the icy conditions .
the chief executive of the association of local authorities , gerd landsberg , told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper that , after the costs of last year 's heavy winter , local governments would have to cut back on clearing the roads .
he said drivers would have to get used to driving on snowy roads , as they do in scandinavia .
although it 's expected that the weather will warm on thursday , another cold spell is forecast in time for christmas , although it is not expected to bring much snow .

thousands have been spending their nights in airports hoping their flights will take off . fresh snowfall overnight caused further setbacks at frankfurt airport , with no planes taking off or landing on tuesday morning .
around 130 departures , and a further 130 arrivals , were canceled at germany 's biggest air terminal .
one of the airport 's three runaways was reopened , allowing the first plane of the day to land at 8:28 a.m.
brussels airport and london heathrow , the world 's busiest airport , continued to experience disruption .
it was running a reduced number of flights on tuesday .
eurostar services from london to paris and brussels had also been hit .
speed restrictions mean that fewer trains were running .
eurostar asked " all customers booked to travel before christmas to refund or exchange their tickets free of charge , if their travel is not essential . "
thousands of passengers spent monday night waiting in airports and train stations , as the countdown to christmas shortens .
airports struggle airports were experiencing a backlog of passengers after hundreds of flights were cancelled over the weekend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : december is one of the most popular times to travel at frankfurt , some 340 of the 1,340 takeoffs and landings were canceled on monday , while at london heathrow , europe 's busiest airport , a very limited service began again on monday after a weekend of almost total standstill .
many other airports opened for a few hours before closing again .
the berlin airport operators said they did not expect services to return to normal before christmas .
the german transport minister , peter ramsauer , has suggested to local authorities that they allow flights at night , in order to clear the backlog of passengers .
the british authorities have already withdrawn the ban on night-flights until december 24 , christmas eve .
trains disrupted trains around berlin were seriously delayed on monday due to heavy snowfalls in the region .
throughout the country , frozen switches led to considerable problems .
a number of trains were canceled and , among those that ran , delays of over an hour were frequent .
speed limits were introduced on high-speed tracks to prevent damage to train undercarriages from blocks of ice .
the company operating almost all of germany 's long-distance trains , deutsche bahn , continued to warn passengers that trains were likely to be very crowded .
" there are likely to be considerable bottlenecks on major lines because of the cancelation of flights , " they wrote on their website .
throughout much of europe , railways were similarly disrupted .
even in southern sweden , which is used to heavy snow , 100 of 350 train journeys were cancelled on monday .
restrictions on the roads bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting around on foot has been the only option for many people on the roads too , the weather has caused serious disruption .
the authorities imposed a travel ban on buses and trucks in paris .
in parts of germany trucks weighing more than 7.5 tons were at times banned from freeways after a series of accidents in which tractor-trailers skidded and blocked the carriageway .
in the western state of north rhine-westphalia , there were 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- of traffic jams during the monday morning rush hour .
the police have been complaining that many drivers are still using summer tires , in spite of the icy conditions .
the chief executive of the association of local authorities , gerd landsberg , told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper that , after the costs of last year 's heavy winter , local governments would have to cut back on clearing the roads .
he said drivers would have to get used to driving on snowy roads , as they do in scandinavia .
although it 's expected that the weather will warm on thursday , another cold spell is forecast in time for christmas , although it is not expected to bring much snow .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 21.12.2010 opinion : improve trade regulations to curb resource squeeze großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " china uses unconventional methods to secure access to raw materials in africa " a new global challenge is threatening the german economy : many raw materials are in short supply .
it 's not because deposits are empty , but because international trade mechanisms are outdated , writes juergen wiemann . industrial companies in germany are complaining about the rising prices of rare minerals and metals needed for electromobility and photovoltaics .
one in two , according to a poll conducted by the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , even worries whether it will get the critical raw materials at all .
yet , geologists say all metals will be available in sufficient quantities in the earth 's crust for the foreseeable future .
at worst , oil may become scarce .
geology is , however , responsible for the concentration of deposits on just a few of the world 's regions and countries .
this leaves the way open for the formation of cartels and for monopolistic behaviour , especially as global production of raw materials is below the " geological production possibility " .
this is due to a political environment in many developing countries with major reserves which is anything but inviting for mining investment .
and that is no coincidence : rare and strategically important natural resources simply attract war and civil war .
demand on the rise worldwide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if one raw material is not available , the whole value chain is in danger " german industry 's acute fear of a resource squeeze is aggravated by the coincidence of rising world demand and the reluctance shown by a number of countries to supply their natural resources : high-tech industries are processing more and more new minerals and rare metals .
if only one of these substances is not available in sufficient quantity , the whole value chain is in danger .
but that is exactly what is likely to happen , because with their rapid industrialisation , emerging economies , too , are developing a growing need for industrial raw materials .
it is no wonder that they are inclined to limit exports of their raw materials or to impose export taxes on them so as to give their own industries a competitive edge .
only recently , china has demonstrated this kind of self-assertive industrial policy with its restrictions on the export of rare earths , startling the old industrialised countries .
furthermore , the emerging economies are trying to secure direct access to the raw materials of other developing countries , especially in africa .
in the process , they are using some quite unconventional instruments .
chinese state-owned enterprises , for example , are providing development assistance for complementary infrastructure development .
thus , the concern about the supply of raw materials is entirely justified .
consequently , the german government and the european commission are taking the matter seriously .
a report by the european commission judges the supply situation to be critical in the case of 14 materials .
governments get involved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wto headquarters in geneva , switzerland with its ' raw materials initiative ' , the commission intends to face up to the emerging supply risks and to encourage joint action by the eu member states to reduce dependence on external raw materials through increased materials efficiency , recycling and a search for alternatives .
the german economics minister , too , is suggesting that a ' german raw materials corporation ' should act as a demand cartel and challenge the supply power of china and other commodity exporters .
for a liberal economics minister , this is anything but a matter of course .
according to his ' weltanschauung ' , it is best left to the individual enterprise to worry about its supplies of raw materials , while government takes responsibility for the functioning of open world markets in compliance with the rules of the multilateral trading system .
yet it must be asked whether invoking the wto rules against aggressive trade policies will be effective in the case of china .
the wto itself does not have any ' hard power ' to impose sanctions for infringements of its rules ; it can do no more than award the victor in a dispute settlement the right to take retaliatory measures with a similar effect to that of the infringement committed by the loser .
but as china 's economic weight in the world grows and its industries become increasingly integrated into international value chains , the leverage exercised by punitive european tariffs on imports from china dwindles .
subsidies in developed nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european countries protect their agricultural products through subsidies yet , through the sheer existence of the multilateral trading system , wto members tend to follow the rules most of the time , even without formal dispute settlement .
when referring to the ' soft power ' of the wto , member states such as europeans and americans , however , have felt no compunction in defending their agriculture against imports from more competitive developing countries and to subsidise their own agricultural exports .
therefore , not only notorious critics of globalisation discern an asymmetrical distribution of power in the world economic institutions between industrialised and developing countries , which should at least have been corrected in the wto during the current development round .
but after nearly ten years of negotiations in the doha -lrb- development -rrb- round the promise has still not been kept .
beyond ritualised commitments in every g7 / g8 / g20 summit communiqué , neither the eu nor the u.s. has made a convincing effort to cut the gordian knot of the mutually obstructive agricultural interests of industrialised and developing nations with a general offer to open their markets and reduce their export subsidies .
improved management and trade regulations further evidence of the half-hearted nature of the europeans ' commitment to the world trade order , with its implications for the trade and economic policies of all the member countries , is the little attention paid to this year 's ' world trade report ' of the wto on ' trade in natural resources ' .
based on the state of art in economic theory and citing numerous empirical examples , the ' world trade report 2010 ' describes the specific mechanisms and perils of natural resource markets and the exploitation of natural resources in a finite world .
in his foreword , wto director general pascal lamy even questions the “ standard prescriptions for greater trade openness ” for natural resources markets , according to which free trade will always produce the best result for all participating countries .
he argues that the developing countries ' management of natural resources should be improved to prevent over-exploitation and that the wto should adopt further and more precise rules on the world trade in natural resources with a view to defusing the emerging conflicts between producing and consuming countries .
lamy therefore rightly calls for a “ prompt closure of the doha round ” , so that the new challenges and conflicts in the international natural resources trade may be dealt with under the wto umbrella . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. jürgen wiemann is head of the research project ' multilateral trading system and development cooperation ' at deutsche gesellschaft für technische zusammenarbeit -lrb- gtz -rrb- and former deputy director of the german development institute -lrb- die -rrb- .
die is one of the leading think tanks for development policy world-wide .
die draws together the knowledge of development research available worldwide , dedicating its work to key issues facing the future of development policy .
the unique research profile of the die is the result of the cooperation between research , consulting and professional training .

that goes too far for many lawmakers . parliamentarians from all german mainstream parties joined on tuesday to present a draft bill which would allow embryo screening - also known as pre-implantation genetic diagnosis or pgd - in narrowly defined situations .
two other draft bills are on the way , both taking an even more restrictive line .
the new bills are a response to a decision by the federal court of justice in july , that ruled that a total and unconditional ban of pgd would not be in line with the constitution .
one of the main proponents of the current bill , ulrike flach of the junior coalition partner in chancellor angela merkel 's government , the liberal free democrats , emphasized that it was not intended to open any floodgates .
" pre-implantation genetic diagnosis will , in general , still be banned , " she said .
" but it will be allowed under very special circumstances . "
those circumstances include cases where one parent suffers from a severe hereditary condition which could be passed on to the child and would lead to severe disease , stillbirth or miscarriage .
avoiding abortions peter hintze of angela merkel 's christian democrats , said that the kind of cases they were talking about could lead to late abortions , since pre-natal diagnosis for such conditions is legal .
" our bill focuses on the situation of the women affected , " he said .
" we want to keep them free of conflicts over pregnancy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel is one of the conservatives who oppose pgd on principle the bill would set up an ethics commission to decide which genetic conditions would justify the use of screening .
the commission would be able to respond to scientific developments , removing diseases from the list should cures become available .
pgd raises ethical questions because it also has the potential to screen for genetic characteristics unrelated to medical necessity .
anxieties about " designer babies " are not new , prompting jerzy montag of the opposition green party to try to calm any such fears " i 'm not thinking of parents who 'd like to have a musically gifted child , or one with blue eyes , or one that does n't suffer from obesity , " he said .
" but i 'm thinking for instance of a woman who already has a child suffering from a severe congenital disease , a woman who wants to have another child , but wants to ensure it has a better deal in life .
although the bill presented on tuesday is supported by members of all parties , it will not necessarily get majority support in the bundestag .
opponents , including those who will sponsor the other two drafts , fear that screening to remove undesirable genes , however serious , could eventually have an adverse impact on the way society treats people with disabilities .

" but i 'm thinking for instance of a woman who already has a child suffering from a severe congenital disease , a woman who wants to have another child , but wants to ensure it has a better deal in life .
although the bill presented on tuesday is supported by members of all parties , it will not necessarily get majority support in the bundestag .
opponents , including those who will sponsor the other two drafts , fear that screening to remove undesirable genes , however serious , could eventually have an adverse impact on the way society treats people with disabilities .

but racial tension in the russian capital is not a new phenomenon . the latest escalation of violence between russian ultra-nationalists and caucasians was triggered on december 4 , when a spartak moscow soccer fan was shot in the head during a fight with caucasians from mainly muslim southern russia .
five suspects were arrested in connection with the killing , but four were later released , adding fuel to the fire of ethnic clashes in moscow .
for two weeks now , attacks against minorities have been a regular occurrence .
over the weekend , around 1,300 people who had gathered to stage demonstrations in moscow were arrested in an effort to prevent further violence .
many of those arrested were of high school age .
not a new problem while the murder of soccer fan yegor sviridov may have sparked the latest fights in and around moscow , ethnic tension in russia is nothing new .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of arrests were made over the weekend xenophobic attacks have been on the rise in russia for a number of years now , and yevgeni volk from moscow 's yeltsin foundation says the government is losing its grip on the ultra-nationalists .
" it 's really clear that the ultra-nationalist forces , which were explicitly supported by the government for many years as a counter balance to the democratic opposition , have really increased their clout in the country , " he told deutsche welle .
" now it looks like the government has lost control of these radical xenophobic forces inside russia .
i believe it 's really a very dangerous phenomenon which could backfire on the authorities themselves . "
pulling the strings for some observers , the remarkable thing about the mostly young ultra-nationalists is the thought and planning that goes into their demonstrations .
following the arrests over the weekend , anatoli kucherena , a leading lawyer and member of russia 's public chamber told deutsche welle that there was no doubt that the protest was being orchestrated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow 's riot police have been kept busy " someone is definitely behind it , there is some sort of puppeteer who directs the youths and calls for them to hit the streets and fight , " he said .
kantemir hurtayev , deputy chairman of the russian congress of caucasian peoples , agrees that someone is pulling the strings behind the scenes .
" to get about 5,000 demonstrators to gather on manege square -lsb- in moscow -rsb- is not easy .
only about 30 people come to demos against xenophobia in the media or against nationalism in general , " hurtayev told deutsche welle .
" i 'm convinced that there is a lot of work done in advance to mobilize these young people and stage this chaos .
the youths may not have completely figured it out , but they are the henchmen of a provocateur . "
lack of coherent strategy some say the nationalists ' ability to organize themselves only makes the government 's shortcomings more apparent .
the police can quickly sweep up hundreds of potentially violent demonstrators when they gather for a protest , but critics argue that this does n't help deal with the problem of racism in the longer term .
" i think -lsb- the kremlin has -rsb- a strategy , but the strategy is too weak and is not effective enough , " alexander rahr from the german council on foreign relations told deutsche welle .
" a lot of words and no real deeds . "
rahr added that frustration in russia about worsening economic and social problems , as well as a feeling of helplessness by those in the lower class about their ability to change things , translates into aggression .
" that is now being directed toward migrants , who are being blamed for all these shortcomings in the economic and social system , " he said .
new demos planned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin has vowed a severe response to the violence russian prime minister vladimir putin has vowed to " respond severely " to the violence .
but recent opinion polls show that muscovites are growing increasingly anxious about the number of non-ethnic russians in the city .
at the same time , a wave of anti-nationalist rhetoric has emerged in the russian segment of the internet , dividing the society into two camps .
another massive nationalist gathering under the slogan “ screw the caucasus ” is scheduled for december 25th .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 21.12.2010 german researchers develop ice-free windshield großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has been hit unusually early with winter this year it 's what most european drivers are dreaming of these days : a farewell to ice-scraping .
but drivers need some patience : the new technology is not ready for the market yet , the german researchers say . with snow continuing to fall and temperatures often below zero degree celsius -lrb- 32 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in many parts of the continent , many europeans currently have to get up earlier than usual to scrape off the ice covering the windshields of their cars before they can actually drive off .
that may soon be a thing of the past , according to german researchers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not ready for mass-production yet in recent months , scientists at the fraunhofer institute for surface technology -lrb- ist -rrb- in braunschweig , in north-central germany , have announced a new car window glass which they claim does not allow an ice layer to form in the first place - even at temperatures as low as minus 18 celsius .
last month , volkswagen joined the project , hoping to turn this research into a feature on its cars .
" -lsb- the window -rsb- has been well-understood on a laboratory scale , but now needs to be implemented for large-scale operation , " said harthmuth hoffmann , a volkswagen spokesperson , in an e-mail sent to deutsche welle .
the problem is that this coating can interfere with radio and mobile phone reception .
heat ca n't radiate skyward the new glass works differently from a heated window - it is based on a physical principle : a wafer-thin transparent coating of indium tin oxide is applied to the window .
" we call this a ' low-e ' -lrb- low thermal emissivity -rrb- coating , " said thomas drescher of volkswagen development , in an interview with the dpa news service .
" applied to the outer glazing , it prevents heat from radiating skyward . "
the conductive " low-e coating " protects the glass from cooling .
that way , water on the outer surface does not condense or freeze and there is no ice film in the first place because radiative heat loss to the cold sky is minimised and this prevents or delays cooling of the glass surface to below the dew point .
scientists have worked on similar projects for some 50 years , andreas klein from technical university of darmstadt told deutsche welle .
" the challenge here is that they 're creating a coating which is applied externally rather than inside .
so the mechanism will have to be able to withstand adverse weather conditions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : driving in winter could just become this little bit easier older systems work with layers made from tin oxide .
but these are far from perfect - both from a practical and an esthetical point of view , the researchers found .
when glass is bent , for instance , the old layers will break because the temperatures get too high .
" our new layer is extremely stable , " said bernd szyszka , an ist researcher , in a statement published on the fraunhofer institute 's website .
" temperatures of up to 900 degrees celsius are no problem .
even if you bend the layer extensively it stays the way it is . "
when the layer is used in windshields , of course , weather conditions such as cloudiness , relative humidity and wind can affect the windows ' condensation behaviour .
" the ' low-e coating ' can not prevent ice formation or condensation entirely , but it can significantly reduce the likelihood of it happening , " drescher added .
ice-free windshield still not ready for the mass market for now , one drawback with the system as it is is that the new coating limits radio traffic in the car , which can impair radio and mobile phone reception , added harthmuth hoffmann , the volkswagen spokesperson .
as such , it remains unclear as to when the first cars equipped with the new wind screen can roll out from volkswagen 's assembly lines .
" it will take some time before the ice-free car windscreen is market-ready , " drescher noted , " but we are working intensively toward this goal . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 21.12.2010 german researchers develop ice-free windshield großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has been hit unusually early with winter this year it 's what most european drivers are dreaming of these days : a farewell to ice-scraping .
but drivers need some patience : the new technology is not ready for the market yet , the german researchers say . with snow continuing to fall and temperatures often below zero degree celsius -lrb- 32 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in many parts of the continent , many europeans currently have to get up earlier than usual to scrape off the ice covering the windshields of their cars before they can actually drive off .
that may soon be a thing of the past , according to german researchers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not ready for mass-production yet in recent months , scientists at the fraunhofer institute for surface technology -lrb- ist -rrb- in braunschweig , in north-central germany , have announced a new car window glass which they claim does not allow an ice layer to form in the first place - even at temperatures as low as minus 18 celsius .
last month , volkswagen joined the project , hoping to turn this research into a feature on its cars .
" -lsb- the window -rsb- has been well-understood on a laboratory scale , but now needs to be implemented for large-scale operation , " said harthmuth hoffmann , a volkswagen spokesperson , in an e-mail sent to deutsche welle .
the problem is that this coating can interfere with radio and mobile phone reception .
heat ca n't radiate skyward the new glass works differently from a heated window - it is based on a physical principle : a wafer-thin transparent coating of indium tin oxide is applied to the window .
" we call this a ' low-e ' -lrb- low thermal emissivity -rrb- coating , " said thomas drescher of volkswagen development , in an interview with the dpa news service .
" applied to the outer glazing , it prevents heat from radiating skyward . "
the conductive " low-e coating " protects the glass from cooling .
that way , water on the outer surface does not condense or freeze and there is no ice film in the first place because radiative heat loss to the cold sky is minimised and this prevents or delays cooling of the glass surface to below the dew point .
scientists have worked on similar projects for some 50 years , andreas klein from technical university of darmstadt told deutsche welle .
" the challenge here is that they 're creating a coating which is applied externally rather than inside .
so the mechanism will have to be able to withstand adverse weather conditions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : driving in winter could just become this little bit easier older systems work with layers made from tin oxide .
but these are far from perfect - both from a practical and an esthetical point of view , the researchers found .
when glass is bent , for instance , the old layers will break because the temperatures get too high .
" our new layer is extremely stable , " said bernd szyszka , an ist researcher , in a statement published on the fraunhofer institute 's website .
" temperatures of up to 900 degrees celsius are no problem .
even if you bend the layer extensively it stays the way it is . "
when the layer is used in windshields , of course , weather conditions such as cloudiness , relative humidity and wind can affect the windows ' condensation behaviour .
" the ' low-e coating ' can not prevent ice formation or condensation entirely , but it can significantly reduce the likelihood of it happening , " drescher added .
ice-free windshield still not ready for the mass market for now , one drawback with the system as it is is that the new coating limits radio traffic in the car , which can impair radio and mobile phone reception , added harthmuth hoffmann , the volkswagen spokesperson .
as such , it remains unclear as to when the first cars equipped with the new wind screen can roll out from volkswagen 's assembly lines .
" it will take some time before the ice-free car windscreen is market-ready , " drescher noted , " but we are working intensively toward this goal . "

in the same statement , reding described those officials as " unprepared " and " uninterested " in data privacy issues .
" they have not even appointed a negotiator , " she added in the statement , but noted that she " expects " the telephone number of the negotiator before year 's end .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de justice -pipe- 21.12.2010 the pirate bay defendant appeals to swedish supreme court großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pirate bay defendants lost the appeal in november carl lundstrom lost the earlier appeals trial , and has been ordered to pay 5.1 million euros .
his attorney argues that the issue of isp liability should remain the key issue in the case . carl lundstrom , one of the four defendants in the pirate bay website trial , has formally appealed to the swedish supreme court against the denial of the party 's previous appeal in late november .
he is one of the founders of the pirate bay - a website that provides links to bittorrent files that can be used to share unauthorized copies of films , music files and software .
in an interview with sveriges radio 's p3 news program , lundstrom 's attorney , per e samuelsson , said that his client does not accept the sentence of four months of jail time for himself , and a collective fine for him and the three other defendants of 46 million swedish kronor -lrb- 5.1 million euros -rrb- .
the four had been previously found guilty of copyright infringement .
however , members of the defense argued that the site , which began in 2003 , does not actually host any copyrighted material , but rather provides links to those files .
" we do not accept the appeal court 's ruling , " samuelsson told swedish public radio .
" my client carl lundstrom delivered internet capacity to the pirate bay , " he added .
" different people around the world use the pirate bay services .
we think it is completely wrong that someone who delivered power to a website should pay damages and sit in prison for what users of the website do with it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter sunde is another of the pirate bay 's defendants isp liability should be the " target key precedent " lundstrom , through his company rix telecom , is implicated by having provided computers , bandwidth and server rackspace for the site in the early years after its founding .
in an interview with the swedish business newspaper realtid.se , samuelsson further argued that because his client was providing bandwidth to the pirate bay , that therefore rix telecom was also its internet service provider , or isp .
" assessing the criminal responsibility of isps should be the target key precedent in this case , " he said , pointing out that to his knowledge , up until now , no one in sweden has ever been found guilty on this basis .

his attorney argues that the issue of isp liability should remain the key issue in the case . carl lundstrom , one of the four defendants in the pirate bay website trial , has formally appealed to the swedish supreme court against the denial of the party 's previous appeal in late november .
he is one of the founders of the pirate bay - a website that provides links to bittorrent files that can be used to share unauthorized copies of films , music files and software .
in an interview with sveriges radio 's p3 news program , lundstrom 's attorney , per e samuelsson , said that his client does not accept the sentence of four months of jail time for himself , and a collective fine for him and the three other defendants of 46 million swedish kronor -lrb- 5.1 million euros -rrb- .
the four had been previously found guilty of copyright infringement .
however , members of the defense argued that the site , which began in 2003 , does not actually host any copyrighted material , but rather provides links to those files .
" we do not accept the appeal court 's ruling , " samuelsson told swedish public radio .
" my client carl lundstrom delivered internet capacity to the pirate bay , " he added .
" different people around the world use the pirate bay services .
we think it is completely wrong that someone who delivered power to a website should pay damages and sit in prison for what users of the website do with it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter sunde is another of the pirate bay 's defendants isp liability should be the " target key precedent " lundstrom , through his company rix telecom , is implicated by having provided computers , bandwidth and server rackspace for the site in the early years after its founding .
in an interview with the swedish business newspaper realtid.se , samuelsson further argued that because his client was providing bandwidth to the pirate bay , that therefore rix telecom was also its internet service provider , or isp .
" assessing the criminal responsibility of isps should be the target key precedent in this case , " he said , pointing out that to his knowledge , up until now , no one in sweden has ever been found guilty on this basis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 21.12.2010 eu tightens emissions restrictions for light trucks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : light trucks will be allowed to emit 147 grams co2 per kilometer from 2020 the eu 's environment ministers have agreed on emissions and mileage regulations for small vans and other utility vehicles .
but environmentalists say the new rules were largely influenced by germany 's strong car lobby . germany and the european union 's executive are praising an agreement among eu countries to tighten emissions rules for vehicles , but environmentalists are less convinced .
new regulations agreed on monday require vans and other utility vehicles to reduce their rate of carbon emissions per kilometre over the next decade , in a bid to drive down the transport sector 's share of greenhouse gasses .
european union environment ministers stipulated that from 2020 onwards , vehicles weighing up to 3.5 tons will only be allowed to emit 147 grams of co2 per kilometer , which translates into some 5.6 liters of diesel per kilometer .
today , light trucks are allowed to emit 200 grams per kilometer .
" it 's a very good compromise on something that was a source of debate for a long time , " said norbert roettgen , germany 's environment minister , adding that the new regulations will help the environment without placing too much of a burden on the car industry .
hopes are that the decision will help create new jobs .
demand for fuel-saving engines will be on the rise over the next decade because of rising petrol prices , says claudia kemfert from the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- . " in times of globalization a country 's competitive edge will depend on their ability to build energy-saving products and vehicles , " kemfert told deutsche welle .
" so germany and europe can gain a competitive advantage by launching these technologies first . "
ending a heated debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's environment minister says the new rules are a ' good compromise ' the issue has long been a point of conflict within the bloc , with germany pushing for regulations not to go below 150 grams of co2 per kilometer .
together with the eu 's two other major car-producing countries france and italy , germany had opposed stricter suggestions by the eu 's executive , the european commission .
the commission had demanded limitations of 135 grams of co2 per kilometer for light trucks , yet the eu 's climate chief , connie hedegaard , also described the compromise as a step forward .
" we have got things that are definitely more ambitious than what the industry and the sector claimed that they could do , " she said at a press conference .
the european parliament still has to approve the decision , with a vote expected in mid-january .
the new regulations could increase prices for small trucks by several thousand euros .
producers whose vehicles exceed the 147 grams per kilometer will have to pay a fine of 95 euros per gram per vehicle .
the regulations are staggered , so that by 2014 emissions for light trucks are supposed to go down to 175 grams of co2 per kilometer .
currently regulations are only in place for private cars .
their emissions are supposed to fall below 130 grams of co2 per kilometer by 2012 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists say germany 's car lobby has again shown its strength german car lobby environmentalists complained that the decision watered down what the european commission proposed in 2009 .
" it 's very disappointing and yet another example of germany preventing more progressive politics from being put in place " , wolfgang lohbeck from greenpeace told deutsche welle .
" it shows that the german car lobby is very strong . "
" you could argue that -lrb- monday 's -rrb- decision was in fact not that important , " said lohbeck , adding that small vans and other utility vehicles only make up about eight percent of all cars on german roads .
according to the german environment ministry , these vehicles are responsible for some six percent of co2 emissions caused by traffic .
environmentalists are now concerned , lohbeck told deutsche welle , that the car lobby will continue to resist future decisions .
the regulations for cars , which were introduced last year , will soon be reviewed again by the eu .
" i hope that monday 's decision was not a bad premonition for what they 'll decide there , " lohbeck said .

they seized propaganda in the homes of some former members of a group that was outlawed in 2009 . police raided homes of suspected neo-nazis in four german states on tuesday in an effort to prevent a meeting of right-wing extremists from across the country from being held .
the homes in question are said to have belonged to members of the successor organization to the outlawed union of german youth faithful to the homeland -lrb- hdj -rrb- .
the state criminal police office in the northern city of hanover said in a statemet that police had seized right-wing extremist propoganda that members of the group allegedly planned to hand out to minors in youth camps .
just like hitler youth 's camps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hdj organization ran camps in the style of the hitler youth the hdj was banned by the then german interior minister , wolfgang schaeuble in march of 2009 , because the group had run camps based on the model of the hitler youth , teaching children as young as six that foreigners and jews were a threat to the nation .
according to police , after the hdj was banned , former members continued their work in the guise of the young national democrats .
police said there was a danger that the neo-nazis would have broken laws at their planned get-together , including incitement to racial hatred and wearing banned uniforms .
in addition to lower saxony , where hanover is the state capital , raids were carried out in berlin , rhineland-palatinate and baden-wuerttemberg .

they seized propaganda in the homes of some former members of a group that was outlawed in 2009 . police raided homes of suspected neo-nazis in four german states on tuesday in an effort to prevent a meeting of right-wing extremists from across the country from being held .
the homes in question are said to have belonged to members of the successor organization to the outlawed union of german youth faithful to the homeland -lrb- hdj -rrb- .
the state criminal police office in the northern city of hanover said in a statemet that police had seized right-wing extremist propoganda that members of the group allegedly planned to hand out to minors in youth camps .
just like hitler youth 's camps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hdj organization ran camps in the style of the hitler youth the hdj was banned by the then german interior minister , wolfgang schaeuble in march of 2009 , because the group had run camps based on the model of the hitler youth , teaching children as young as six that foreigners and jews were a threat to the nation .
according to police , after the hdj was banned , former members continued their work in the guise of the young national democrats .
police said there was a danger that the neo-nazis would have broken laws at their planned get-together , including incitement to racial hatred and wearing banned uniforms .
in addition to lower saxony , where hanover is the state capital , raids were carried out in berlin , rhineland-palatinate and baden-wuerttemberg .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 21.12.2010 opinion : improve trade regulations to curb resource squeeze großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " china uses unconventional methods to secure access to raw materials in africa " a new global challenge is threatening the german economy : many raw materials are in short supply .
it 's not because deposits are empty , but because international trade mechanisms are outdated , writes juergen wiemann . industrial companies in germany are complaining about the rising prices of rare minerals and metals needed for electromobility and photovoltaics .
one in two , according to a poll conducted by the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , even worries whether it will get the critical raw materials at all .
yet , geologists say all metals will be available in sufficient quantities in the earth 's crust for the foreseeable future .
at worst , oil may become scarce .
geology is , however , responsible for the concentration of deposits on just a few of the world 's regions and countries .
this leaves the way open for the formation of cartels and for monopolistic behaviour , especially as global production of raw materials is below the " geological production possibility " .
this is due to a political environment in many developing countries with major reserves which is anything but inviting for mining investment .
and that is no coincidence : rare and strategically important natural resources simply attract war and civil war .
demand on the rise worldwide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if one raw material is not available , the whole value chain is in danger " german industry 's acute fear of a resource squeeze is aggravated by the coincidence of rising world demand and the reluctance shown by a number of countries to supply their natural resources : high-tech industries are processing more and more new minerals and rare metals .
if only one of these substances is not available in sufficient quantity , the whole value chain is in danger .
but that is exactly what is likely to happen , because with their rapid industrialisation , emerging economies , too , are developing a growing need for industrial raw materials .
it is no wonder that they are inclined to limit exports of their raw materials or to impose export taxes on them so as to give their own industries a competitive edge .
only recently , china has demonstrated this kind of self-assertive industrial policy with its restrictions on the export of rare earths , startling the old industrialised countries .
furthermore , the emerging economies are trying to secure direct access to the raw materials of other developing countries , especially in africa .
in the process , they are using some quite unconventional instruments .
chinese state-owned enterprises , for example , are providing development assistance for complementary infrastructure development .
thus , the concern about the supply of raw materials is entirely justified .
consequently , the german government and the european commission are taking the matter seriously .
a report by the european commission judges the supply situation to be critical in the case of 14 materials .
governments get involved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wto headquarters in geneva , switzerland with its ' raw materials initiative ' , the commission intends to face up to the emerging supply risks and to encourage joint action by the eu member states to reduce dependence on external raw materials through increased materials efficiency , recycling and a search for alternatives .
the german economics minister , too , is suggesting that a ' german raw materials corporation ' should act as a demand cartel and challenge the supply power of china and other commodity exporters .
for a liberal economics minister , this is anything but a matter of course .
according to his ' weltanschauung ' , it is best left to the individual enterprise to worry about its supplies of raw materials , while government takes responsibility for the functioning of open world markets in compliance with the rules of the multilateral trading system .
yet it must be asked whether invoking the wto rules against aggressive trade policies will be effective in the case of china .
the wto itself does not have any ' hard power ' to impose sanctions for infringements of its rules ; it can do no more than award the victor in a dispute settlement the right to take retaliatory measures with a similar effect to that of the infringement committed by the loser .
but as china 's economic weight in the world grows and its industries become increasingly integrated into international value chains , the leverage exercised by punitive european tariffs on imports from china dwindles .
subsidies in developed nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european countries protect their agricultural products through subsidies yet , through the sheer existence of the multilateral trading system , wto members tend to follow the rules most of the time , even without formal dispute settlement .
when referring to the ' soft power ' of the wto , member states such as europeans and americans , however , have felt no compunction in defending their agriculture against imports from more competitive developing countries and to subsidise their own agricultural exports .
therefore , not only notorious critics of globalisation discern an asymmetrical distribution of power in the world economic institutions between industrialised and developing countries , which should at least have been corrected in the wto during the current development round .
but after nearly ten years of negotiations in the doha -lrb- development -rrb- round the promise has still not been kept .
beyond ritualised commitments in every g7 / g8 / g20 summit communiqué , neither the eu nor the u.s. has made a convincing effort to cut the gordian knot of the mutually obstructive agricultural interests of industrialised and developing nations with a general offer to open their markets and reduce their export subsidies .
improved management and trade regulations further evidence of the half-hearted nature of the europeans ' commitment to the world trade order , with its implications for the trade and economic policies of all the member countries , is the little attention paid to this year 's ' world trade report ' of the wto on ' trade in natural resources ' .
based on the state of art in economic theory and citing numerous empirical examples , the ' world trade report 2010 ' describes the specific mechanisms and perils of natural resource markets and the exploitation of natural resources in a finite world .
in his foreword , wto director general pascal lamy even questions the “ standard prescriptions for greater trade openness ” for natural resources markets , according to which free trade will always produce the best result for all participating countries .
he argues that the developing countries ' management of natural resources should be improved to prevent over-exploitation and that the wto should adopt further and more precise rules on the world trade in natural resources with a view to defusing the emerging conflicts between producing and consuming countries .
lamy therefore rightly calls for a “ prompt closure of the doha round ” , so that the new challenges and conflicts in the international natural resources trade may be dealt with under the wto umbrella . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. jürgen wiemann is head of the research project ' multilateral trading system and development cooperation ' at deutsche gesellschaft für technische zusammenarbeit -lrb- gtz -rrb- and former deputy director of the german development institute -lrb- die -rrb- .

they start over and again until they have the piece pitch perfect .
it 's part of the workshop atmosphere at the barenboim-said foundation 's music academy in the center of ramallah .
martin koegel , oboist with the german chamber ensemble polyphonia - a subgroup of the deutsche symphonie orchester berlin - is more than happy with the students at the palestinian music school .
he and his fellow musicians have come to offer some additional training .
" for us , it 's about meeting the kids where they are .
we have young people here who began playing just a year ago and others that have five years experience , " koegel told deutsche welle .
" with the more experienced players , we work on pieces together in small ensembles that we 'll present in concert .
and with the beginners , we are trying lay a foundation to help them play together and learn what 's important in the process . "
making music inside the academy , music from all manner of instruments streams out of practice rooms into the halls .
even the offices are full of young musicians hard at work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hard at play yara khawaja practices cello under the watchful eyes of cellist thomas roesseler .
the 11 year-old palestinian player can scarcely be seen behind her instrument , which she has now been learning for two years .
she says it took her a little while to get used to being in the presence of more experienced musicians .
" i was a little nervous at the beginning , " yara said .
" but it 's a great opportunity to be able to play with these professionals .
a rare opportunity the school , which opened in 2006 , is sponsored by the barenboim-said foundation and is one of the few place in the palestinian west bank which teaches classical music .
the foundation itself is largely financed by the andalusian regional government in spain .
nabeel abboud ashkar is director of the academy and stresses the importance of visits such as those from polyphonia .
" workshops with international musicians open doors - not just to the world of classical music , but also in terms of cultural dialogue , " he said , adding that it is particularly important in conflict zones .
martin koegle also believes in the validity of working cross-culturally .
" people here are interested in classical music , " he said , " but they do n't have all the training and educational opportunities we have in europe , for instance .
and we want to do what we can to help . "
future professionals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students take to the stage in ramallah polyphonia musicians have already offered similar workshops in other countries , most recently in algeria and morocco .
then , as now , the projects were financed by the german foreign office and organized by deutsche welle .
as the ramallah workshop comes to a close , the young players shift their attention to the three concerts they will give to show what they have learned .
the more accomplished musicians will play on stage alongside their tutors from germany .
but even for those at the beginning of their musical training , the concerts are an invaluable way of gaining valuable experience .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 21.12.2010 german researchers develop ice-free windshield großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has been hit unusually early with winter this year it 's what most european drivers are dreaming of these days : a farewell to ice-scraping .
but drivers need some patience : the new technology is not ready for the market yet , the german researchers say . with snow continuing to fall and temperatures often below zero degree celsius -lrb- 32 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in many parts of the continent , many europeans currently have to get up earlier than usual to scrape off the ice covering the windshields of their cars before they can actually drive off .
that may soon be a thing of the past , according to german researchers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not ready for mass-production yet in recent months , scientists at the fraunhofer institute for surface technology -lrb- ist -rrb- in braunschweig , in north-central germany , have announced a new car window glass which they claim does not allow an ice layer to form in the first place - even at temperatures as low as minus 18 celsius .
last month , volkswagen joined the project , hoping to turn this research into a feature on its cars .
" -lsb- the window -rsb- has been well-understood on a laboratory scale , but now needs to be implemented for large-scale operation , " said harthmuth hoffmann , a volkswagen spokesperson , in an e-mail sent to deutsche welle .
the problem is that this coating can interfere with radio and mobile phone reception .
heat ca n't radiate skyward the new glass works differently from a heated window - it is based on a physical principle : a wafer-thin transparent coating of indium tin oxide is applied to the window .
" we call this a ' low-e ' -lrb- low thermal emissivity -rrb- coating , " said thomas drescher of volkswagen development , in an interview with the dpa news service .
" applied to the outer glazing , it prevents heat from radiating skyward . "
the conductive " low-e coating " protects the glass from cooling .
that way , water on the outer surface does not condense or freeze and there is no ice film in the first place because radiative heat loss to the cold sky is minimised and this prevents or delays cooling of the glass surface to below the dew point .
scientists have worked on similar projects for some 50 years , andreas klein from technical university of darmstadt told deutsche welle .
" the challenge here is that they 're creating a coating which is applied externally rather than inside .
so the mechanism will have to be able to withstand adverse weather conditions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : driving in winter could just become this little bit easier older systems work with layers made from tin oxide .
but these are far from perfect - both from a practical and an esthetical point of view , the researchers found .
when glass is bent , for instance , the old layers will break because the temperatures get too high .
" our new layer is extremely stable , " said bernd szyszka , an ist researcher , in a statement published on the fraunhofer institute 's website .
" temperatures of up to 900 degrees celsius are no problem .
even if you bend the layer extensively it stays the way it is . "
when the layer is used in windshields , of course , weather conditions such as cloudiness , relative humidity and wind can affect the windows ' condensation behaviour .
" the ' low-e coating ' can not prevent ice formation or condensation entirely , but it can significantly reduce the likelihood of it happening , " drescher added .
ice-free windshield still not ready for the mass market for now , one drawback with the system as it is is that the new coating limits radio traffic in the car , which can impair radio and mobile phone reception , added harthmuth hoffmann , the volkswagen spokesperson .
as such , it remains unclear as to when the first cars equipped with the new wind screen can roll out from volkswagen 's assembly lines .
" it will take some time before the ice-free car windscreen is market-ready , " drescher noted , " but we are working intensively toward this goal . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 21.12.2010 german researchers develop ice-free windshield großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has been hit unusually early with winter this year it 's what most european drivers are dreaming of these days : a farewell to ice-scraping .
but drivers need some patience : the new technology is not ready for the market yet , the german researchers say . with snow continuing to fall and temperatures often below zero degree celsius -lrb- 32 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in many parts of the continent , many europeans currently have to get up earlier than usual to scrape off the ice covering the windshields of their cars before they can actually drive off .
that may soon be a thing of the past , according to german researchers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not ready for mass-production yet in recent months , scientists at the fraunhofer institute for surface technology -lrb- ist -rrb- in braunschweig , in north-central germany , have announced a new car window glass which they claim does not allow an ice layer to form in the first place - even at temperatures as low as minus 18 celsius .
last month , volkswagen joined the project , hoping to turn this research into a feature on its cars .
" -lsb- the window -rsb- has been well-understood on a laboratory scale , but now needs to be implemented for large-scale operation , " said harthmuth hoffmann , a volkswagen spokesperson , in an e-mail sent to deutsche welle .
the problem is that this coating can interfere with radio and mobile phone reception .
heat ca n't radiate skyward the new glass works differently from a heated window - it is based on a physical principle : a wafer-thin transparent coating of indium tin oxide is applied to the window .
" we call this a ' low-e ' -lrb- low thermal emissivity -rrb- coating , " said thomas drescher of volkswagen development , in an interview with the dpa news service .
" applied to the outer glazing , it prevents heat from radiating skyward . "
the conductive " low-e coating " protects the glass from cooling .
that way , water on the outer surface does not condense or freeze and there is no ice film in the first place because radiative heat loss to the cold sky is minimised and this prevents or delays cooling of the glass surface to below the dew point .
scientists have worked on similar projects for some 50 years , andreas klein from technical university of darmstadt told deutsche welle .
" the challenge here is that they 're creating a coating which is applied externally rather than inside .
so the mechanism will have to be able to withstand adverse weather conditions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : driving in winter could just become this little bit easier older systems work with layers made from tin oxide .
but these are far from perfect - both from a practical and an esthetical point of view , the researchers found .
when glass is bent , for instance , the old layers will break because the temperatures get too high .
" our new layer is extremely stable , " said bernd szyszka , an ist researcher , in a statement published on the fraunhofer institute 's website .
" temperatures of up to 900 degrees celsius are no problem .
even if you bend the layer extensively it stays the way it is . "
when the layer is used in windshields , of course , weather conditions such as cloudiness , relative humidity and wind can affect the windows ' condensation behaviour .
" the ' low-e coating ' can not prevent ice formation or condensation entirely , but it can significantly reduce the likelihood of it happening , " drescher added .
ice-free windshield still not ready for the mass market for now , one drawback with the system as it is is that the new coating limits radio traffic in the car , which can impair radio and mobile phone reception , added harthmuth hoffmann , the volkswagen spokesperson .
as such , it remains unclear as to when the first cars equipped with the new wind screen can roll out from volkswagen 's assembly lines .
" it will take some time before the ice-free car windscreen is market-ready , " drescher noted , " but we are working intensively toward this goal . "

his attorney argues that the issue of isp liability should remain the key issue in the case . carl lundstrom , one of the four defendants in the pirate bay website trial , has formally appealed to the swedish supreme court against the denial of the party 's previous appeal in late november .
he is one of the founders of the pirate bay - a website that provides links to bittorrent files that can be used to share unauthorized copies of films , music files and software .
in an interview with sveriges radio 's p3 news program , lundstrom 's attorney , per e samuelsson , said that his client does not accept the sentence of four months of jail time for himself , and a collective fine for him and the three other defendants of 46 million swedish kronor -lrb- 5.1 million euros -rrb- .
the four had been previously found guilty of copyright infringement .
however , members of the defense argued that the site , which began in 2003 , does not actually host any copyrighted material , but rather provides links to those files .
" we do not accept the appeal court 's ruling , " samuelsson told swedish public radio .
" my client carl lundstrom delivered internet capacity to the pirate bay , " he added .
" different people around the world use the pirate bay services .

in an interview with the swedish business newspaper realtid.se , samuelsson further argued that because his client was providing bandwidth to the pirate bay , that therefore rix telecom was also its internet service provider , or isp .
" assessing the criminal responsibility of isps should be the target key precedent in this case , " he said , pointing out that to his knowledge , up until now , no one in sweden has ever been found guilty on this basis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 21.12.2010 eu tightens emissions restrictions for light trucks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : light trucks will be allowed to emit 147 grams co2 per kilometer from 2020 the eu 's environment ministers have agreed on emissions and mileage regulations for small vans and other utility vehicles .
but environmentalists say the new rules were largely influenced by germany 's strong car lobby . germany and the european union 's executive are praising an agreement among eu countries to tighten emissions rules for vehicles , but environmentalists are less convinced .
new regulations agreed on monday require vans and other utility vehicles to reduce their rate of carbon emissions per kilometre over the next decade , in a bid to drive down the transport sector 's share of greenhouse gasses .
european union environment ministers stipulated that from 2020 onwards , vehicles weighing up to 3.5 tons will only be allowed to emit 147 grams of co2 per kilometer , which translates into some 5.6 liters of diesel per kilometer .
today , light trucks are allowed to emit 200 grams per kilometer .
" it 's a very good compromise on something that was a source of debate for a long time , " said norbert roettgen , germany 's environment minister , adding that the new regulations will help the environment without placing too much of a burden on the car industry .
hopes are that the decision will help create new jobs .
demand for fuel-saving engines will be on the rise over the next decade because of rising petrol prices , says claudia kemfert from the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- . " in times of globalization a country 's competitive edge will depend on their ability to build energy-saving products and vehicles , " kemfert told deutsche welle .
" so germany and europe can gain a competitive advantage by launching these technologies first . "
ending a heated debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's environment minister says the new rules are a ' good compromise ' the issue has long been a point of conflict within the bloc , with germany pushing for regulations not to go below 150 grams of co2 per kilometer .
together with the eu 's two other major car-producing countries france and italy , germany had opposed stricter suggestions by the eu 's executive , the european commission .
the commission had demanded limitations of 135 grams of co2 per kilometer for light trucks , yet the eu 's climate chief , connie hedegaard , also described the compromise as a step forward .
" we have got things that are definitely more ambitious than what the industry and the sector claimed that they could do , " she said at a press conference .
the european parliament still has to approve the decision , with a vote expected in mid-january .
the new regulations could increase prices for small trucks by several thousand euros .
producers whose vehicles exceed the 147 grams per kilometer will have to pay a fine of 95 euros per gram per vehicle .
the regulations are staggered , so that by 2014 emissions for light trucks are supposed to go down to 175 grams of co2 per kilometer .
currently regulations are only in place for private cars .
their emissions are supposed to fall below 130 grams of co2 per kilometer by 2012 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists say germany 's car lobby has again shown its strength german car lobby environmentalists complained that the decision watered down what the european commission proposed in 2009 .
" it 's very disappointing and yet another example of germany preventing more progressive politics from being put in place " , wolfgang lohbeck from greenpeace told deutsche welle .
" it shows that the german car lobby is very strong . "
" you could argue that -lrb- monday 's -rrb- decision was in fact not that important , " said lohbeck , adding that small vans and other utility vehicles only make up about eight percent of all cars on german roads .
according to the german environment ministry , these vehicles are responsible for some six percent of co2 emissions caused by traffic .
environmentalists are now concerned , lohbeck told deutsche welle , that the car lobby will continue to resist future decisions .
the regulations for cars , which were introduced last year , will soon be reviewed again by the eu .
" i hope that monday 's decision was not a bad premonition for what they 'll decide there , " lohbeck said .

demand for fuel-saving engines will be on the rise over the next decade because of rising petrol prices , says claudia kemfert from the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- . " in times of globalization a country 's competitive edge will depend on their ability to build energy-saving products and vehicles , " kemfert told deutsche welle .
" so germany and europe can gain a competitive advantage by launching these technologies first . "
ending a heated debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's environment minister says the new rules are a ' good compromise ' the issue has long been a point of conflict within the bloc , with germany pushing for regulations not to go below 150 grams of co2 per kilometer .
together with the eu 's two other major car-producing countries france and italy , germany had opposed stricter suggestions by the eu 's executive , the european commission .
the commission had demanded limitations of 135 grams of co2 per kilometer for light trucks , yet the eu 's climate chief , connie hedegaard , also described the compromise as a step forward .
" we have got things that are definitely more ambitious than what the industry and the sector claimed that they could do , " she said at a press conference .
the european parliament still has to approve the decision , with a vote expected in mid-january .
the new regulations could increase prices for small trucks by several thousand euros .
producers whose vehicles exceed the 147 grams per kilometer will have to pay a fine of 95 euros per gram per vehicle .
the regulations are staggered , so that by 2014 emissions for light trucks are supposed to go down to 175 grams of co2 per kilometer .
currently regulations are only in place for private cars .
their emissions are supposed to fall below 130 grams of co2 per kilometer by 2012 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists say germany 's car lobby has again shown its strength german car lobby environmentalists complained that the decision watered down what the european commission proposed in 2009 .
" it 's very disappointing and yet another example of germany preventing more progressive politics from being put in place " , wolfgang lohbeck from greenpeace told deutsche welle .
" it shows that the german car lobby is very strong . "
" you could argue that -lrb- monday 's -rrb- decision was in fact not that important , " said lohbeck , adding that small vans and other utility vehicles only make up about eight percent of all cars on german roads .
according to the german environment ministry , these vehicles are responsible for some six percent of co2 emissions caused by traffic .
environmentalists are now concerned , lohbeck told deutsche welle , that the car lobby will continue to resist future decisions .
the regulations for cars , which were introduced last year , will soon be reviewed again by the eu .
" i hope that monday 's decision was not a bad premonition for what they 'll decide there , " lohbeck said .

she wants a much clearer outline of citizen rights with respect to how their data is used . european union justice commissioner , viviane reding , has slammed the american government for not showing a serious interest in data protection rights .
the united states and eu are at odds over washington 's drive for increased access to european citizens ' bank and flight records .
european authorities do n't believe that their us counterparts are adequately protecting consumer rights .
" from the outset , we have noted an apparent lack of interest on the us side to talk seriously about data protection , " reding said in a statement released on monday , just two weeks after holding talks with high-level american officials , including with us attorney general eric holder and janet napolitano , the secretary of homeland security .
in the same statement , reding described those officials as " unprepared " and " uninterested " in data privacy issues .
" they have not even appointed a negotiator , " she added in the statement , but noted that she " expects " the telephone number of the negotiator before year 's end .
meanwhile , the european union has designated françoise le bail , the director general of the commission 's department for justice , as its negotiator .
eu pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american ambassador to the eu , william e. kennard disagrees with reding 's charges brussels is pushing washington for a document that would clearly outline the basis of future data-sharing agreements .
earlier this month , the eu 's 27 justice ministers gave the bloc 's executive the green light to negotiate a " personal data protection agreement " with washington .
the agreement would aim to prevent the abuse of europeans ' privacy as authorities share information in the struggle against terrorism and other crimes .
the eu is seeking " more proportionate " use of this data as well as the right for eu citizens to modify and delete information and take the government to court over abuses of their data .
reding also is encouraging the americans to create an independent data protection supervisory position , which exists in all eu member states .
in a press conference in brussels on monday , the american ambassador to the european union dismissed reding 's statement .
" i disagree - we 're moving ahead , " he said .

that goes too far for many lawmakers . parliamentarians from all german mainstream parties joined on tuesday to present a draft bill which would allow embryo screening - also known as pre-implantation genetic diagnosis or pgd - in narrowly defined situations .
two other draft bills are on the way , both taking an even more restrictive line .
the new bills are a response to a decision by the federal court of justice in july , that ruled that a total and unconditional ban of pgd would not be in line with the constitution .
one of the main proponents of the current bill , ulrike flach of the junior coalition partner in chancellor angela merkel 's government , the liberal free democrats , emphasized that it was not intended to open any floodgates .
" pre-implantation genetic diagnosis will , in general , still be banned , " she said .
" but it will be allowed under very special circumstances . "
those circumstances include cases where one parent suffers from a severe hereditary condition which could be passed on to the child and would lead to severe disease , stillbirth or miscarriage .
avoiding abortions peter hintze of angela merkel 's christian democrats , said that the kind of cases they were talking about could lead to late abortions , since pre-natal diagnosis for such conditions is legal .
" our bill focuses on the situation of the women affected , " he said .
" we want to keep them free of conflicts over pregnancy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel is one of the conservatives who oppose pgd on principle the bill would set up an ethics commission to decide which genetic conditions would justify the use of screening .
the commission would be able to respond to scientific developments , removing diseases from the list should cures become available .
pgd raises ethical questions because it also has the potential to screen for genetic characteristics unrelated to medical necessity .
anxieties about " designer babies " are not new , prompting jerzy montag of the opposition green party to try to calm any such fears " i 'm not thinking of parents who 'd like to have a musically gifted child , or one with blue eyes , or one that does n't suffer from obesity , " he said .
" but i 'm thinking for instance of a woman who already has a child suffering from a severe congenital disease , a woman who wants to have another child , but wants to ensure it has a better deal in life .
although the bill presented on tuesday is supported by members of all parties , it will not necessarily get majority support in the bundestag .
opponents , including those who will sponsor the other two drafts , fear that screening to remove undesirable genes , however serious , could eventually have an adverse impact on the way society treats people with disabilities .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 21.12.2010 new german bill proposed for limited embryo screening großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bill 's backers want pgd only to prevent serious disease german members of parliament have presented draft legislation that would allow the screening of implanted embryos , but only to identify serious genetic diseases .
that goes too far for many lawmakers . parliamentarians from all german mainstream parties joined on tuesday to present a draft bill which would allow embryo screening - also known as pre-implantation genetic diagnosis or pgd - in narrowly defined situations .
two other draft bills are on the way , both taking an even more restrictive line .
the new bills are a response to a decision by the federal court of justice in july , that ruled that a total and unconditional ban of pgd would not be in line with the constitution .
one of the main proponents of the current bill , ulrike flach of the junior coalition partner in chancellor angela merkel 's government , the liberal free democrats , emphasized that it was not intended to open any floodgates .
" pre-implantation genetic diagnosis will , in general , still be banned , " she said .
" but it will be allowed under very special circumstances . "
those circumstances include cases where one parent suffers from a severe hereditary condition which could be passed on to the child and would lead to severe disease , stillbirth or miscarriage .
avoiding abortions peter hintze of angela merkel 's christian democrats , said that the kind of cases they were talking about could lead to late abortions , since pre-natal diagnosis for such conditions is legal .
" our bill focuses on the situation of the women affected , " he said .
" we want to keep them free of conflicts over pregnancy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel is one of the conservatives who oppose pgd on principle the bill would set up an ethics commission to decide which genetic conditions would justify the use of screening .
the commission would be able to respond to scientific developments , removing diseases from the list should cures become available .
pgd raises ethical questions because it also has the potential to screen for genetic characteristics unrelated to medical necessity .
anxieties about " designer babies " are not new , prompting jerzy montag of the opposition green party to try to calm any such fears " i 'm not thinking of parents who 'd like to have a musically gifted child , or one with blue eyes , or one that does n't suffer from obesity , " he said .
" but i 'm thinking for instance of a woman who already has a child suffering from a severe congenital disease , a woman who wants to have another child , but wants to ensure it has a better deal in life .
although the bill presented on tuesday is supported by members of all parties , it will not necessarily get majority support in the bundestag .
opponents , including those who will sponsor the other two drafts , fear that screening to remove undesirable genes , however serious , could eventually have an adverse impact on the way society treats people with disabilities .

but racial tension in the russian capital is not a new phenomenon . the latest escalation of violence between russian ultra-nationalists and caucasians was triggered on december 4 , when a spartak moscow soccer fan was shot in the head during a fight with caucasians from mainly muslim southern russia .
five suspects were arrested in connection with the killing , but four were later released , adding fuel to the fire of ethnic clashes in moscow .
for two weeks now , attacks against minorities have been a regular occurrence .
over the weekend , around 1,300 people who had gathered to stage demonstrations in moscow were arrested in an effort to prevent further violence .
many of those arrested were of high school age .
not a new problem while the murder of soccer fan yegor sviridov may have sparked the latest fights in and around moscow , ethnic tension in russia is nothing new .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of arrests were made over the weekend xenophobic attacks have been on the rise in russia for a number of years now , and yevgeni volk from moscow 's yeltsin foundation says the government is losing its grip on the ultra-nationalists .
" it 's really clear that the ultra-nationalist forces , which were explicitly supported by the government for many years as a counter balance to the democratic opposition , have really increased their clout in the country , " he told deutsche welle .
" now it looks like the government has lost control of these radical xenophobic forces inside russia .
i believe it 's really a very dangerous phenomenon which could backfire on the authorities themselves . "
pulling the strings for some observers , the remarkable thing about the mostly young ultra-nationalists is the thought and planning that goes into their demonstrations .
following the arrests over the weekend , anatoli kucherena , a leading lawyer and member of russia 's public chamber told deutsche welle that there was no doubt that the protest was being orchestrated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow 's riot police have been kept busy " someone is definitely behind it , there is some sort of puppeteer who directs the youths and calls for them to hit the streets and fight , " he said .
kantemir hurtayev , deputy chairman of the russian congress of caucasian peoples , agrees that someone is pulling the strings behind the scenes .
" to get about 5,000 demonstrators to gather on manege square -lsb- in moscow -rsb- is not easy .
only about 30 people come to demos against xenophobia in the media or against nationalism in general , " hurtayev told deutsche welle .
" i 'm convinced that there is a lot of work done in advance to mobilize these young people and stage this chaos .
the youths may not have completely figured it out , but they are the henchmen of a provocateur . "
lack of coherent strategy some say the nationalists ' ability to organize themselves only makes the government 's shortcomings more apparent .
the police can quickly sweep up hundreds of potentially violent demonstrators when they gather for a protest , but critics argue that this does n't help deal with the problem of racism in the longer term .
" i think -lsb- the kremlin has -rsb- a strategy , but the strategy is too weak and is not effective enough , " alexander rahr from the german council on foreign relations told deutsche welle .
" a lot of words and no real deeds . "
rahr added that frustration in russia about worsening economic and social problems , as well as a feeling of helplessness by those in the lower class about their ability to change things , translates into aggression .
" that is now being directed toward migrants , who are being blamed for all these shortcomings in the economic and social system , " he said .
new demos planned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin has vowed a severe response to the violence russian prime minister vladimir putin has vowed to " respond severely " to the violence .
but recent opinion polls show that muscovites are growing increasingly anxious about the number of non-ethnic russians in the city .
at the same time , a wave of anti-nationalist rhetoric has emerged in the russian segment of the internet , dividing the society into two camps .
another massive nationalist gathering under the slogan “ screw the caucasus ” is scheduled for december 25th .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 21.12.2010 opinion : improve trade regulations to curb resource squeeze großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " china uses unconventional methods to secure access to raw materials in africa " a new global challenge is threatening the german economy : many raw materials are in short supply .
it 's not because deposits are empty , but because international trade mechanisms are outdated , writes juergen wiemann . industrial companies in germany are complaining about the rising prices of rare minerals and metals needed for electromobility and photovoltaics .
one in two , according to a poll conducted by the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , even worries whether it will get the critical raw materials at all .
yet , geologists say all metals will be available in sufficient quantities in the earth 's crust for the foreseeable future .
at worst , oil may become scarce .
geology is , however , responsible for the concentration of deposits on just a few of the world 's regions and countries .
this leaves the way open for the formation of cartels and for monopolistic behaviour , especially as global production of raw materials is below the " geological production possibility " .
this is due to a political environment in many developing countries with major reserves which is anything but inviting for mining investment .
and that is no coincidence : rare and strategically important natural resources simply attract war and civil war .
demand on the rise worldwide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if one raw material is not available , the whole value chain is in danger " german industry 's acute fear of a resource squeeze is aggravated by the coincidence of rising world demand and the reluctance shown by a number of countries to supply their natural resources : high-tech industries are processing more and more new minerals and rare metals .
if only one of these substances is not available in sufficient quantity , the whole value chain is in danger .
but that is exactly what is likely to happen , because with their rapid industrialisation , emerging economies , too , are developing a growing need for industrial raw materials .
it is no wonder that they are inclined to limit exports of their raw materials or to impose export taxes on them so as to give their own industries a competitive edge .
only recently , china has demonstrated this kind of self-assertive industrial policy with its restrictions on the export of rare earths , startling the old industrialised countries .
furthermore , the emerging economies are trying to secure direct access to the raw materials of other developing countries , especially in africa .
in the process , they are using some quite unconventional instruments .
chinese state-owned enterprises , for example , are providing development assistance for complementary infrastructure development .
thus , the concern about the supply of raw materials is entirely justified .
consequently , the german government and the european commission are taking the matter seriously .
a report by the european commission judges the supply situation to be critical in the case of 14 materials .
governments get involved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wto headquarters in geneva , switzerland with its ' raw materials initiative ' , the commission intends to face up to the emerging supply risks and to encourage joint action by the eu member states to reduce dependence on external raw materials through increased materials efficiency , recycling and a search for alternatives .
the german economics minister , too , is suggesting that a ' german raw materials corporation ' should act as a demand cartel and challenge the supply power of china and other commodity exporters .
for a liberal economics minister , this is anything but a matter of course .
according to his ' weltanschauung ' , it is best left to the individual enterprise to worry about its supplies of raw materials , while government takes responsibility for the functioning of open world markets in compliance with the rules of the multilateral trading system .
yet it must be asked whether invoking the wto rules against aggressive trade policies will be effective in the case of china .
the wto itself does not have any ' hard power ' to impose sanctions for infringements of its rules ; it can do no more than award the victor in a dispute settlement the right to take retaliatory measures with a similar effect to that of the infringement committed by the loser .
but as china 's economic weight in the world grows and its industries become increasingly integrated into international value chains , the leverage exercised by punitive european tariffs on imports from china dwindles .
subsidies in developed nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european countries protect their agricultural products through subsidies yet , through the sheer existence of the multilateral trading system , wto members tend to follow the rules most of the time , even without formal dispute settlement .
when referring to the ' soft power ' of the wto , member states such as europeans and americans , however , have felt no compunction in defending their agriculture against imports from more competitive developing countries and to subsidise their own agricultural exports .
therefore , not only notorious critics of globalisation discern an asymmetrical distribution of power in the world economic institutions between industrialised and developing countries , which should at least have been corrected in the wto during the current development round .
but after nearly ten years of negotiations in the doha -lrb- development -rrb- round the promise has still not been kept .
beyond ritualised commitments in every g7 / g8 / g20 summit communiqué , neither the eu nor the u.s. has made a convincing effort to cut the gordian knot of the mutually obstructive agricultural interests of industrialised and developing nations with a general offer to open their markets and reduce their export subsidies .

it 's not because deposits are empty , but because international trade mechanisms are outdated , writes juergen wiemann . industrial companies in germany are complaining about the rising prices of rare minerals and metals needed for electromobility and photovoltaics .
one in two , according to a poll conducted by the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , even worries whether it will get the critical raw materials at all .
yet , geologists say all metals will be available in sufficient quantities in the earth 's crust for the foreseeable future .
at worst , oil may become scarce .
geology is , however , responsible for the concentration of deposits on just a few of the world 's regions and countries .
this leaves the way open for the formation of cartels and for monopolistic behaviour , especially as global production of raw materials is below the " geological production possibility " .
this is due to a political environment in many developing countries with major reserves which is anything but inviting for mining investment .
and that is no coincidence : rare and strategically important natural resources simply attract war and civil war .
demand on the rise worldwide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if one raw material is not available , the whole value chain is in danger " german industry 's acute fear of a resource squeeze is aggravated by the coincidence of rising world demand and the reluctance shown by a number of countries to supply their natural resources : high-tech industries are processing more and more new minerals and rare metals .
if only one of these substances is not available in sufficient quantity , the whole value chain is in danger .
but that is exactly what is likely to happen , because with their rapid industrialisation , emerging economies , too , are developing a growing need for industrial raw materials .
it is no wonder that they are inclined to limit exports of their raw materials or to impose export taxes on them so as to give their own industries a competitive edge .
only recently , china has demonstrated this kind of self-assertive industrial policy with its restrictions on the export of rare earths , startling the old industrialised countries .
furthermore , the emerging economies are trying to secure direct access to the raw materials of other developing countries , especially in africa .
in the process , they are using some quite unconventional instruments .
chinese state-owned enterprises , for example , are providing development assistance for complementary infrastructure development .
thus , the concern about the supply of raw materials is entirely justified .
consequently , the german government and the european commission are taking the matter seriously .
a report by the european commission judges the supply situation to be critical in the case of 14 materials .
governments get involved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wto headquarters in geneva , switzerland with its ' raw materials initiative ' , the commission intends to face up to the emerging supply risks and to encourage joint action by the eu member states to reduce dependence on external raw materials through increased materials efficiency , recycling and a search for alternatives .
the german economics minister , too , is suggesting that a ' german raw materials corporation ' should act as a demand cartel and challenge the supply power of china and other commodity exporters .
for a liberal economics minister , this is anything but a matter of course .
according to his ' weltanschauung ' , it is best left to the individual enterprise to worry about its supplies of raw materials , while government takes responsibility for the functioning of open world markets in compliance with the rules of the multilateral trading system .
yet it must be asked whether invoking the wto rules against aggressive trade policies will be effective in the case of china .
the wto itself does not have any ' hard power ' to impose sanctions for infringements of its rules ; it can do no more than award the victor in a dispute settlement the right to take retaliatory measures with a similar effect to that of the infringement committed by the loser .
but as china 's economic weight in the world grows and its industries become increasingly integrated into international value chains , the leverage exercised by punitive european tariffs on imports from china dwindles .
subsidies in developed nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european countries protect their agricultural products through subsidies yet , through the sheer existence of the multilateral trading system , wto members tend to follow the rules most of the time , even without formal dispute settlement .
when referring to the ' soft power ' of the wto , member states such as europeans and americans , however , have felt no compunction in defending their agriculture against imports from more competitive developing countries and to subsidise their own agricultural exports .
therefore , not only notorious critics of globalisation discern an asymmetrical distribution of power in the world economic institutions between industrialised and developing countries , which should at least have been corrected in the wto during the current development round .
but after nearly ten years of negotiations in the doha -lrb- development -rrb- round the promise has still not been kept .
beyond ritualised commitments in every g7 / g8 / g20 summit communiqué , neither the eu nor the u.s. has made a convincing effort to cut the gordian knot of the mutually obstructive agricultural interests of industrialised and developing nations with a general offer to open their markets and reduce their export subsidies .
improved management and trade regulations further evidence of the half-hearted nature of the europeans ' commitment to the world trade order , with its implications for the trade and economic policies of all the member countries , is the little attention paid to this year 's ' world trade report ' of the wto on ' trade in natural resources ' .

it 's not because deposits are empty , but because international trade mechanisms are outdated , writes juergen wiemann . industrial companies in germany are complaining about the rising prices of rare minerals and metals needed for electromobility and photovoltaics .
one in two , according to a poll conducted by the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , even worries whether it will get the critical raw materials at all .
yet , geologists say all metals will be available in sufficient quantities in the earth 's crust for the foreseeable future .
at worst , oil may become scarce .
geology is , however , responsible for the concentration of deposits on just a few of the world 's regions and countries .
this leaves the way open for the formation of cartels and for monopolistic behaviour , especially as global production of raw materials is below the " geological production possibility " .
this is due to a political environment in many developing countries with major reserves which is anything but inviting for mining investment .
and that is no coincidence : rare and strategically important natural resources simply attract war and civil war .
demand on the rise worldwide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if one raw material is not available , the whole value chain is in danger " german industry 's acute fear of a resource squeeze is aggravated by the coincidence of rising world demand and the reluctance shown by a number of countries to supply their natural resources : high-tech industries are processing more and more new minerals and rare metals .
if only one of these substances is not available in sufficient quantity , the whole value chain is in danger .
but that is exactly what is likely to happen , because with their rapid industrialisation , emerging economies , too , are developing a growing need for industrial raw materials .
it is no wonder that they are inclined to limit exports of their raw materials or to impose export taxes on them so as to give their own industries a competitive edge .
only recently , china has demonstrated this kind of self-assertive industrial policy with its restrictions on the export of rare earths , startling the old industrialised countries .
furthermore , the emerging economies are trying to secure direct access to the raw materials of other developing countries , especially in africa .
in the process , they are using some quite unconventional instruments .
chinese state-owned enterprises , for example , are providing development assistance for complementary infrastructure development .
thus , the concern about the supply of raw materials is entirely justified .
consequently , the german government and the european commission are taking the matter seriously .
a report by the european commission judges the supply situation to be critical in the case of 14 materials .
governments get involved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wto headquarters in geneva , switzerland with its ' raw materials initiative ' , the commission intends to face up to the emerging supply risks and to encourage joint action by the eu member states to reduce dependence on external raw materials through increased materials efficiency , recycling and a search for alternatives .
the german economics minister , too , is suggesting that a ' german raw materials corporation ' should act as a demand cartel and challenge the supply power of china and other commodity exporters .
for a liberal economics minister , this is anything but a matter of course .
according to his ' weltanschauung ' , it is best left to the individual enterprise to worry about its supplies of raw materials , while government takes responsibility for the functioning of open world markets in compliance with the rules of the multilateral trading system .
yet it must be asked whether invoking the wto rules against aggressive trade policies will be effective in the case of china .
the wto itself does not have any ' hard power ' to impose sanctions for infringements of its rules ; it can do no more than award the victor in a dispute settlement the right to take retaliatory measures with a similar effect to that of the infringement committed by the loser .
but as china 's economic weight in the world grows and its industries become increasingly integrated into international value chains , the leverage exercised by punitive european tariffs on imports from china dwindles .
subsidies in developed nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european countries protect their agricultural products through subsidies yet , through the sheer existence of the multilateral trading system , wto members tend to follow the rules most of the time , even without formal dispute settlement .
when referring to the ' soft power ' of the wto , member states such as europeans and americans , however , have felt no compunction in defending their agriculture against imports from more competitive developing countries and to subsidise their own agricultural exports .
therefore , not only notorious critics of globalisation discern an asymmetrical distribution of power in the world economic institutions between industrialised and developing countries , which should at least have been corrected in the wto during the current development round .
but after nearly ten years of negotiations in the doha -lrb- development -rrb- round the promise has still not been kept .
beyond ritualised commitments in every g7 / g8 / g20 summit communiqué , neither the eu nor the u.s. has made a convincing effort to cut the gordian knot of the mutually obstructive agricultural interests of industrialised and developing nations with a general offer to open their markets and reduce their export subsidies .
improved management and trade regulations further evidence of the half-hearted nature of the europeans ' commitment to the world trade order , with its implications for the trade and economic policies of all the member countries , is the little attention paid to this year 's ' world trade report ' of the wto on ' trade in natural resources ' .
based on the state of art in economic theory and citing numerous empirical examples , the ' world trade report 2010 ' describes the specific mechanisms and perils of natural resource markets and the exploitation of natural resources in a finite world .
in his foreword , wto director general pascal lamy even questions the “ standard prescriptions for greater trade openness ” for natural resources markets , according to which free trade will always produce the best result for all participating countries .
he argues that the developing countries ' management of natural resources should be improved to prevent over-exploitation and that the wto should adopt further and more precise rules on the world trade in natural resources with a view to defusing the emerging conflicts between producing and consuming countries .
lamy therefore rightly calls for a “ prompt closure of the doha round ” , so that the new challenges and conflicts in the international natural resources trade may be dealt with under the wto umbrella . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. jürgen wiemann is head of the research project ' multilateral trading system and development cooperation ' at deutsche gesellschaft für technische zusammenarbeit -lrb- gtz -rrb- and former deputy director of the german development institute -lrb- die -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de justice -pipe- 21.12.2010 the pirate bay defendant appeals to swedish supreme court großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pirate bay defendants lost the appeal in november carl lundstrom lost the earlier appeals trial , and has been ordered to pay 5.1 million euros .
his attorney argues that the issue of isp liability should remain the key issue in the case . carl lundstrom , one of the four defendants in the pirate bay website trial , has formally appealed to the swedish supreme court against the denial of the party 's previous appeal in late november .
he is one of the founders of the pirate bay - a website that provides links to bittorrent files that can be used to share unauthorized copies of films , music files and software .
in an interview with sveriges radio 's p3 news program , lundstrom 's attorney , per e samuelsson , said that his client does not accept the sentence of four months of jail time for himself , and a collective fine for him and the three other defendants of 46 million swedish kronor -lrb- 5.1 million euros -rrb- .
the four had been previously found guilty of copyright infringement .
however , members of the defense argued that the site , which began in 2003 , does not actually host any copyrighted material , but rather provides links to those files .
" we do not accept the appeal court 's ruling , " samuelsson told swedish public radio .
" my client carl lundstrom delivered internet capacity to the pirate bay , " he added .
" different people around the world use the pirate bay services .
we think it is completely wrong that someone who delivered power to a website should pay damages and sit in prison for what users of the website do with it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter sunde is another of the pirate bay 's defendants isp liability should be the " target key precedent " lundstrom , through his company rix telecom , is implicated by having provided computers , bandwidth and server rackspace for the site in the early years after its founding .
in an interview with the swedish business newspaper realtid.se , samuelsson further argued that because his client was providing bandwidth to the pirate bay , that therefore rix telecom was also its internet service provider , or isp .
" assessing the criminal responsibility of isps should be the target key precedent in this case , " he said , pointing out that to his knowledge , up until now , no one in sweden has ever been found guilty on this basis .

improved management and trade regulations further evidence of the half-hearted nature of the europeans ' commitment to the world trade order , with its implications for the trade and economic policies of all the member countries , is the little attention paid to this year 's ' world trade report ' of the wto on ' trade in natural resources ' .
based on the state of art in economic theory and citing numerous empirical examples , the ' world trade report 2010 ' describes the specific mechanisms and perils of natural resource markets and the exploitation of natural resources in a finite world .
in his foreword , wto director general pascal lamy even questions the “ standard prescriptions for greater trade openness ” for natural resources markets , according to which free trade will always produce the best result for all participating countries .
he argues that the developing countries ' management of natural resources should be improved to prevent over-exploitation and that the wto should adopt further and more precise rules on the world trade in natural resources with a view to defusing the emerging conflicts between producing and consuming countries .
lamy therefore rightly calls for a “ prompt closure of the doha round ” , so that the new challenges and conflicts in the international natural resources trade may be dealt with under the wto umbrella . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. jürgen wiemann is head of the research project ' multilateral trading system and development cooperation ' at deutsche gesellschaft für technische zusammenarbeit -lrb- gtz -rrb- and former deputy director of the german development institute -lrb- die -rrb- .

but environmentalists say the new rules were largely influenced by germany 's strong car lobby . germany and the european union 's executive are praising an agreement among eu countries to tighten emissions rules for vehicles , but environmentalists are less convinced .
new regulations agreed on monday require vans and other utility vehicles to reduce their rate of carbon emissions per kilometre over the next decade , in a bid to drive down the transport sector 's share of greenhouse gasses .
european union environment ministers stipulated that from 2020 onwards , vehicles weighing up to 3.5 tons will only be allowed to emit 147 grams of co2 per kilometer , which translates into some 5.6 liters of diesel per kilometer .
today , light trucks are allowed to emit 200 grams per kilometer .
" it 's a very good compromise on something that was a source of debate for a long time , " said norbert roettgen , germany 's environment minister , adding that the new regulations will help the environment without placing too much of a burden on the car industry .
hopes are that the decision will help create new jobs .
demand for fuel-saving engines will be on the rise over the next decade because of rising petrol prices , says claudia kemfert from the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- . " in times of globalization a country 's competitive edge will depend on their ability to build energy-saving products and vehicles , " kemfert told deutsche welle .
" so germany and europe can gain a competitive advantage by launching these technologies first . "
ending a heated debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's environment minister says the new rules are a ' good compromise ' the issue has long been a point of conflict within the bloc , with germany pushing for regulations not to go below 150 grams of co2 per kilometer .
together with the eu 's two other major car-producing countries france and italy , germany had opposed stricter suggestions by the eu 's executive , the european commission .
the commission had demanded limitations of 135 grams of co2 per kilometer for light trucks , yet the eu 's climate chief , connie hedegaard , also described the compromise as a step forward .
" we have got things that are definitely more ambitious than what the industry and the sector claimed that they could do , " she said at a press conference .
the european parliament still has to approve the decision , with a vote expected in mid-january .
the new regulations could increase prices for small trucks by several thousand euros .
producers whose vehicles exceed the 147 grams per kilometer will have to pay a fine of 95 euros per gram per vehicle .
the regulations are staggered , so that by 2014 emissions for light trucks are supposed to go down to 175 grams of co2 per kilometer .
currently regulations are only in place for private cars .
their emissions are supposed to fall below 130 grams of co2 per kilometer by 2012 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists say germany 's car lobby has again shown its strength german car lobby environmentalists complained that the decision watered down what the european commission proposed in 2009 .
" it 's very disappointing and yet another example of germany preventing more progressive politics from being put in place " , wolfgang lohbeck from greenpeace told deutsche welle .
" it shows that the german car lobby is very strong . "
" you could argue that -lrb- monday 's -rrb- decision was in fact not that important , " said lohbeck , adding that small vans and other utility vehicles only make up about eight percent of all cars on german roads .
according to the german environment ministry , these vehicles are responsible for some six percent of co2 emissions caused by traffic .
environmentalists are now concerned , lohbeck told deutsche welle , that the car lobby will continue to resist future decisions .
the regulations for cars , which were introduced last year , will soon be reviewed again by the eu .
" i hope that monday 's decision was not a bad premonition for what they 'll decide there , " lohbeck said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 21.12.2010 german researchers develop ice-free windshield großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has been hit unusually early with winter this year it 's what most european drivers are dreaming of these days : a farewell to ice-scraping .
but drivers need some patience : the new technology is not ready for the market yet , the german researchers say . with snow continuing to fall and temperatures often below zero degree celsius -lrb- 32 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in many parts of the continent , many europeans currently have to get up earlier than usual to scrape off the ice covering the windshields of their cars before they can actually drive off .
that may soon be a thing of the past , according to german researchers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not ready for mass-production yet in recent months , scientists at the fraunhofer institute for surface technology -lrb- ist -rrb- in braunschweig , in north-central germany , have announced a new car window glass which they claim does not allow an ice layer to form in the first place - even at temperatures as low as minus 18 celsius .
last month , volkswagen joined the project , hoping to turn this research into a feature on its cars .
" -lsb- the window -rsb- has been well-understood on a laboratory scale , but now needs to be implemented for large-scale operation , " said harthmuth hoffmann , a volkswagen spokesperson , in an e-mail sent to deutsche welle .
the problem is that this coating can interfere with radio and mobile phone reception .
heat ca n't radiate skyward the new glass works differently from a heated window - it is based on a physical principle : a wafer-thin transparent coating of indium tin oxide is applied to the window .
" we call this a ' low-e ' -lrb- low thermal emissivity -rrb- coating , " said thomas drescher of volkswagen development , in an interview with the dpa news service .
" applied to the outer glazing , it prevents heat from radiating skyward . "
the conductive " low-e coating " protects the glass from cooling .
that way , water on the outer surface does not condense or freeze and there is no ice film in the first place because radiative heat loss to the cold sky is minimised and this prevents or delays cooling of the glass surface to below the dew point .
scientists have worked on similar projects for some 50 years , andreas klein from technical university of darmstadt told deutsche welle .
" the challenge here is that they 're creating a coating which is applied externally rather than inside .
so the mechanism will have to be able to withstand adverse weather conditions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : driving in winter could just become this little bit easier older systems work with layers made from tin oxide .
but these are far from perfect - both from a practical and an esthetical point of view , the researchers found .
when glass is bent , for instance , the old layers will break because the temperatures get too high .
" our new layer is extremely stable , " said bernd szyszka , an ist researcher , in a statement published on the fraunhofer institute 's website .

when the layer is used in windshields , of course , weather conditions such as cloudiness , relative humidity and wind can affect the windows ' condensation behaviour .

ice-free windshield still not ready for the mass market for now , one drawback with the system as it is is that the new coating limits radio traffic in the car , which can impair radio and mobile phone reception , added harthmuth hoffmann , the volkswagen spokesperson .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 21.12.2010 new german bill proposed for limited embryo screening großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bill 's backers want pgd only to prevent serious disease german members of parliament have presented draft legislation that would allow the screening of implanted embryos , but only to identify serious genetic diseases .
that goes too far for many lawmakers . parliamentarians from all german mainstream parties joined on tuesday to present a draft bill which would allow embryo screening - also known as pre-implantation genetic diagnosis or pgd - in narrowly defined situations .
two other draft bills are on the way , both taking an even more restrictive line .
the new bills are a response to a decision by the federal court of justice in july , that ruled that a total and unconditional ban of pgd would not be in line with the constitution .
one of the main proponents of the current bill , ulrike flach of the junior coalition partner in chancellor angela merkel 's government , the liberal free democrats , emphasized that it was not intended to open any floodgates .
" pre-implantation genetic diagnosis will , in general , still be banned , " she said .
" but it will be allowed under very special circumstances . "
those circumstances include cases where one parent suffers from a severe hereditary condition which could be passed on to the child and would lead to severe disease , stillbirth or miscarriage .
avoiding abortions peter hintze of angela merkel 's christian democrats , said that the kind of cases they were talking about could lead to late abortions , since pre-natal diagnosis for such conditions is legal .
" our bill focuses on the situation of the women affected , " he said .
" we want to keep them free of conflicts over pregnancy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel is one of the conservatives who oppose pgd on principle the bill would set up an ethics commission to decide which genetic conditions would justify the use of screening .
the commission would be able to respond to scientific developments , removing diseases from the list should cures become available .
pgd raises ethical questions because it also has the potential to screen for genetic characteristics unrelated to medical necessity .
anxieties about " designer babies " are not new , prompting jerzy montag of the opposition green party to try to calm any such fears " i 'm not thinking of parents who 'd like to have a musically gifted child , or one with blue eyes , or one that does n't suffer from obesity , " he said .
" but i 'm thinking for instance of a woman who already has a child suffering from a severe congenital disease , a woman who wants to have another child , but wants to ensure it has a better deal in life .
although the bill presented on tuesday is supported by members of all parties , it will not necessarily get majority support in the bundestag .
opponents , including those who will sponsor the other two drafts , fear that screening to remove undesirable genes , however serious , could eventually have an adverse impact on the way society treats people with disabilities .

but drivers need some patience : the new technology is not ready for the market yet , the german researchers say . with snow continuing to fall and temperatures often below zero degree celsius -lrb- 32 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in many parts of the continent , many europeans currently have to get up earlier than usual to scrape off the ice covering the windshields of their cars before they can actually drive off .
that may soon be a thing of the past , according to german researchers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not ready for mass-production yet in recent months , scientists at the fraunhofer institute for surface technology -lrb- ist -rrb- in braunschweig , in north-central germany , have announced a new car window glass which they claim does not allow an ice layer to form in the first place - even at temperatures as low as minus 18 celsius .
last month , volkswagen joined the project , hoping to turn this research into a feature on its cars .
" -lsb- the window -rsb- has been well-understood on a laboratory scale , but now needs to be implemented for large-scale operation , " said harthmuth hoffmann , a volkswagen spokesperson , in an e-mail sent to deutsche welle .
the problem is that this coating can interfere with radio and mobile phone reception .
heat ca n't radiate skyward the new glass works differently from a heated window - it is based on a physical principle : a wafer-thin transparent coating of indium tin oxide is applied to the window .
" we call this a ' low-e ' -lrb- low thermal emissivity -rrb- coating , " said thomas drescher of volkswagen development , in an interview with the dpa news service .
" applied to the outer glazing , it prevents heat from radiating skyward . "
the conductive " low-e coating " protects the glass from cooling .

scientists have worked on similar projects for some 50 years , andreas klein from technical university of darmstadt told deutsche welle .
" the challenge here is that they 're creating a coating which is applied externally rather than inside .
so the mechanism will have to be able to withstand adverse weather conditions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : driving in winter could just become this little bit easier older systems work with layers made from tin oxide .
but these are far from perfect - both from a practical and an esthetical point of view , the researchers found .
when glass is bent , for instance , the old layers will break because the temperatures get too high .
" our new layer is extremely stable , " said bernd szyszka , an ist researcher , in a statement published on the fraunhofer institute 's website .
" temperatures of up to 900 degrees celsius are no problem .
even if you bend the layer extensively it stays the way it is . "
when the layer is used in windshields , of course , weather conditions such as cloudiness , relative humidity and wind can affect the windows ' condensation behaviour .
" the ' low-e coating ' can not prevent ice formation or condensation entirely , but it can significantly reduce the likelihood of it happening , " drescher added .
ice-free windshield still not ready for the mass market for now , one drawback with the system as it is is that the new coating limits radio traffic in the car , which can impair radio and mobile phone reception , added harthmuth hoffmann , the volkswagen spokesperson .
as such , it remains unclear as to when the first cars equipped with the new wind screen can roll out from volkswagen 's assembly lines .
" it will take some time before the ice-free car windscreen is market-ready , " drescher noted , " but we are working intensively toward this goal . "

but racial tension in the russian capital is not a new phenomenon . the latest escalation of violence between russian ultra-nationalists and caucasians was triggered on december 4 , when a spartak moscow soccer fan was shot in the head during a fight with caucasians from mainly muslim southern russia .
five suspects were arrested in connection with the killing , but four were later released , adding fuel to the fire of ethnic clashes in moscow .
for two weeks now , attacks against minorities have been a regular occurrence .
over the weekend , around 1,300 people who had gathered to stage demonstrations in moscow were arrested in an effort to prevent further violence .
many of those arrested were of high school age .
not a new problem while the murder of soccer fan yegor sviridov may have sparked the latest fights in and around moscow , ethnic tension in russia is nothing new .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of arrests were made over the weekend xenophobic attacks have been on the rise in russia for a number of years now , and yevgeni volk from moscow 's yeltsin foundation says the government is losing its grip on the ultra-nationalists .
" it 's really clear that the ultra-nationalist forces , which were explicitly supported by the government for many years as a counter balance to the democratic opposition , have really increased their clout in the country , " he told deutsche welle .
" now it looks like the government has lost control of these radical xenophobic forces inside russia .
i believe it 's really a very dangerous phenomenon which could backfire on the authorities themselves . "
pulling the strings for some observers , the remarkable thing about the mostly young ultra-nationalists is the thought and planning that goes into their demonstrations .
following the arrests over the weekend , anatoli kucherena , a leading lawyer and member of russia 's public chamber told deutsche welle that there was no doubt that the protest was being orchestrated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow 's riot police have been kept busy " someone is definitely behind it , there is some sort of puppeteer who directs the youths and calls for them to hit the streets and fight , " he said .
kantemir hurtayev , deputy chairman of the russian congress of caucasian peoples , agrees that someone is pulling the strings behind the scenes .
" to get about 5,000 demonstrators to gather on manege square -lsb- in moscow -rsb- is not easy .
only about 30 people come to demos against xenophobia in the media or against nationalism in general , " hurtayev told deutsche welle .
" i 'm convinced that there is a lot of work done in advance to mobilize these young people and stage this chaos .
the youths may not have completely figured it out , but they are the henchmen of a provocateur . "
lack of coherent strategy some say the nationalists ' ability to organize themselves only makes the government 's shortcomings more apparent .
the police can quickly sweep up hundreds of potentially violent demonstrators when they gather for a protest , but critics argue that this does n't help deal with the problem of racism in the longer term .
" i think -lsb- the kremlin has -rsb- a strategy , but the strategy is too weak and is not effective enough , " alexander rahr from the german council on foreign relations told deutsche welle .
" a lot of words and no real deeds . "
rahr added that frustration in russia about worsening economic and social problems , as well as a feeling of helplessness by those in the lower class about their ability to change things , translates into aggression .
" that is now being directed toward migrants , who are being blamed for all these shortcomings in the economic and social system , " he said .
new demos planned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin has vowed a severe response to the violence russian prime minister vladimir putin has vowed to " respond severely " to the violence .
but recent opinion polls show that muscovites are growing increasingly anxious about the number of non-ethnic russians in the city .
at the same time , a wave of anti-nationalist rhetoric has emerged in the russian segment of the internet , dividing the society into two camps .
another massive nationalist gathering under the slogan “ screw the caucasus ” is scheduled for december 25th .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 21.12.2010 opinion : improve trade regulations to curb resource squeeze großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " china uses unconventional methods to secure access to raw materials in africa " a new global challenge is threatening the german economy : many raw materials are in short supply .
it 's not because deposits are empty , but because international trade mechanisms are outdated , writes juergen wiemann . industrial companies in germany are complaining about the rising prices of rare minerals and metals needed for electromobility and photovoltaics .
one in two , according to a poll conducted by the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , even worries whether it will get the critical raw materials at all .
yet , geologists say all metals will be available in sufficient quantities in the earth 's crust for the foreseeable future .
at worst , oil may become scarce .
geology is , however , responsible for the concentration of deposits on just a few of the world 's regions and countries .
this leaves the way open for the formation of cartels and for monopolistic behaviour , especially as global production of raw materials is below the " geological production possibility " .
this is due to a political environment in many developing countries with major reserves which is anything but inviting for mining investment .
and that is no coincidence : rare and strategically important natural resources simply attract war and civil war .
demand on the rise worldwide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if one raw material is not available , the whole value chain is in danger " german industry 's acute fear of a resource squeeze is aggravated by the coincidence of rising world demand and the reluctance shown by a number of countries to supply their natural resources : high-tech industries are processing more and more new minerals and rare metals .
if only one of these substances is not available in sufficient quantity , the whole value chain is in danger .
but that is exactly what is likely to happen , because with their rapid industrialisation , emerging economies , too , are developing a growing need for industrial raw materials .
it is no wonder that they are inclined to limit exports of their raw materials or to impose export taxes on them so as to give their own industries a competitive edge .
only recently , china has demonstrated this kind of self-assertive industrial policy with its restrictions on the export of rare earths , startling the old industrialised countries .
furthermore , the emerging economies are trying to secure direct access to the raw materials of other developing countries , especially in africa .
in the process , they are using some quite unconventional instruments .
chinese state-owned enterprises , for example , are providing development assistance for complementary infrastructure development .
thus , the concern about the supply of raw materials is entirely justified .
consequently , the german government and the european commission are taking the matter seriously .
a report by the european commission judges the supply situation to be critical in the case of 14 materials .
governments get involved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wto headquarters in geneva , switzerland with its ' raw materials initiative ' , the commission intends to face up to the emerging supply risks and to encourage joint action by the eu member states to reduce dependence on external raw materials through increased materials efficiency , recycling and a search for alternatives .
the german economics minister , too , is suggesting that a ' german raw materials corporation ' should act as a demand cartel and challenge the supply power of china and other commodity exporters .
for a liberal economics minister , this is anything but a matter of course .
according to his ' weltanschauung ' , it is best left to the individual enterprise to worry about its supplies of raw materials , while government takes responsibility for the functioning of open world markets in compliance with the rules of the multilateral trading system .
yet it must be asked whether invoking the wto rules against aggressive trade policies will be effective in the case of china .
the wto itself does not have any ' hard power ' to impose sanctions for infringements of its rules ; it can do no more than award the victor in a dispute settlement the right to take retaliatory measures with a similar effect to that of the infringement committed by the loser .
but as china 's economic weight in the world grows and its industries become increasingly integrated into international value chains , the leverage exercised by punitive european tariffs on imports from china dwindles .
subsidies in developed nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european countries protect their agricultural products through subsidies yet , through the sheer existence of the multilateral trading system , wto members tend to follow the rules most of the time , even without formal dispute settlement .
when referring to the ' soft power ' of the wto , member states such as europeans and americans , however , have felt no compunction in defending their agriculture against imports from more competitive developing countries and to subsidise their own agricultural exports .
therefore , not only notorious critics of globalisation discern an asymmetrical distribution of power in the world economic institutions between industrialised and developing countries , which should at least have been corrected in the wto during the current development round .
but after nearly ten years of negotiations in the doha -lrb- development -rrb- round the promise has still not been kept .
beyond ritualised commitments in every g7 / g8 / g20 summit communiqué , neither the eu nor the u.s. has made a convincing effort to cut the gordian knot of the mutually obstructive agricultural interests of industrialised and developing nations with a general offer to open their markets and reduce their export subsidies .
improved management and trade regulations further evidence of the half-hearted nature of the europeans ' commitment to the world trade order , with its implications for the trade and economic policies of all the member countries , is the little attention paid to this year 's ' world trade report ' of the wto on ' trade in natural resources ' .
based on the state of art in economic theory and citing numerous empirical examples , the ' world trade report 2010 ' describes the specific mechanisms and perils of natural resource markets and the exploitation of natural resources in a finite world .
in his foreword , wto director general pascal lamy even questions the “ standard prescriptions for greater trade openness ” for natural resources markets , according to which free trade will always produce the best result for all participating countries .
he argues that the developing countries ' management of natural resources should be improved to prevent over-exploitation and that the wto should adopt further and more precise rules on the world trade in natural resources with a view to defusing the emerging conflicts between producing and consuming countries .
lamy therefore rightly calls for a “ prompt closure of the doha round ” , so that the new challenges and conflicts in the international natural resources trade may be dealt with under the wto umbrella . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. jürgen wiemann is head of the research project ' multilateral trading system and development cooperation ' at deutsche gesellschaft für technische zusammenarbeit -lrb- gtz -rrb- and former deputy director of the german development institute -lrb- die -rrb- .

his attorney argues that the issue of isp liability should remain the key issue in the case . carl lundstrom , one of the four defendants in the pirate bay website trial , has formally appealed to the swedish supreme court against the denial of the party 's previous appeal in late november .
he is one of the founders of the pirate bay - a website that provides links to bittorrent files that can be used to share unauthorized copies of films , music files and software .
in an interview with sveriges radio 's p3 news program , lundstrom 's attorney , per e samuelsson , said that his client does not accept the sentence of four months of jail time for himself , and a collective fine for him and the three other defendants of 46 million swedish kronor -lrb- 5.1 million euros -rrb- .
the four had been previously found guilty of copyright infringement .
however , members of the defense argued that the site , which began in 2003 , does not actually host any copyrighted material , but rather provides links to those files .

" my client carl lundstrom delivered internet capacity to the pirate bay , " he added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 21.12.2010 no presents this year in corporate germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cash gifts are absolutely off limits in germany a major german industry association is urging managers to rethink corporate christmas gifts this year .
it does n't want to spoil the cheer , but reminds everybody of the dangers of corruption . christmas is just around the corner , and people are scrambling to find the perfect presents to stack under the tree .
but one organization is n't feeling the festive spirit and wants to do away with presents entirely – at least in the world of business .
the german association of materials management , purchasing and logistics -lrb- ammpl -rrb- says gifts have no place in business and that a good supplier wo n't need them to keep its customers .
the association represents some 8,000 members , and in 2008 established a ' code of conduct ' which covers corporate gift giving .
but it 's not always easy to draw a line between a small token of appreciation and a gift that could open the door to a host of ethical dilemmas .
that 's why sebastian schroeder , an ammpl compliance expert , says the code of conduct drafted by his organization lets companies decide what limits are acceptable .
comparable business dinners in london , hamburg or shanghai come at very different prices , he pointed out .
" ultimately it is up to the individual employee of a company to determine if a present has been made in good faith , " he told deutsche welle .
" we did n't set a limit to the value of presents . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airport operator fraport says its staff know what 's acceptable despite their clean-cut reputation , german managers have gone astray on numerous occasions .
in recent years , corruption scandals have rocked companies including siemens , man , daimler , and volkswagen .
intercultural challenge in a globalized business environment , there 's always the issue of differing cultural expectations .
representatives from asian , middle eastern and south american companies are likely to expect a tighter bond with business partners than many germans are used to , schroeder said .
" they close deals based more on personal trust , " he said .
" and sometimes a german buyer shows up and wants to get right to the deal and sign a contract , only to find there are certain limitations . "
in china , for instance , monetary gifts are not at all uncommon , although they are " clearly not acceptable in europe and the united states , " schroeder said .
companies may be reluctant to insult their business partners by returning a gift , giving rise to the challenge of different cultural expectations .
wariness of owing favors clemens von stockert , a manager in the compliance department of fraport airport in frankfurt , says his company deals with potential problems by banning gifts like airline tickets , car shares , and inexpensive credit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the thought that counts : dinner comes at a different price depending on the city a dinner out is fine – it 's gone after having been eaten .
but anything over 35 euros should be internally documented , according to von stockert .
" the important thing is that people do n't put themselves in a position of dependency , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have clear rules that money and anything with monetary value are not to be accepted . "
gift giving has decreased in volume during recent years , according to von stockert , but occasionally someone in the company will receive a present .
if it ca n't be given back without jeopardizing a business relationship , then it 's likely to end up going to charity ... and the company has to pay taxes on it .
" nowadays more companies are keeping these regulations in mind when it comes to accepting gifts and giving them , " von stockert said .
sebastian schroeder of ammpl added the idea is n't to spoil christmas fun , but to foster an environment where companies work together " fairly and in a spirit of partnership . "
" it is true that christmas and similar holidays are used as an opportunity to intensify existing relationships between companies , " he said .

it does n't want to spoil the cheer , but reminds everybody of the dangers of corruption . christmas is just around the corner , and people are scrambling to find the perfect presents to stack under the tree .
but one organization is n't feeling the festive spirit and wants to do away with presents entirely – at least in the world of business .
the german association of materials management , purchasing and logistics -lrb- ammpl -rrb- says gifts have no place in business and that a good supplier wo n't need them to keep its customers .
the association represents some 8,000 members , and in 2008 established a ' code of conduct ' which covers corporate gift giving .
but it 's not always easy to draw a line between a small token of appreciation and a gift that could open the door to a host of ethical dilemmas .
that 's why sebastian schroeder , an ammpl compliance expert , says the code of conduct drafted by his organization lets companies decide what limits are acceptable .
comparable business dinners in london , hamburg or shanghai come at very different prices , he pointed out .
" ultimately it is up to the individual employee of a company to determine if a present has been made in good faith , " he told deutsche welle .
" we did n't set a limit to the value of presents . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airport operator fraport says its staff know what 's acceptable despite their clean-cut reputation , german managers have gone astray on numerous occasions .
in recent years , corruption scandals have rocked companies including siemens , man , daimler , and volkswagen .
intercultural challenge in a globalized business environment , there 's always the issue of differing cultural expectations .
representatives from asian , middle eastern and south american companies are likely to expect a tighter bond with business partners than many germans are used to , schroeder said .
" they close deals based more on personal trust , " he said .
" and sometimes a german buyer shows up and wants to get right to the deal and sign a contract , only to find there are certain limitations . "
in china , for instance , monetary gifts are not at all uncommon , although they are " clearly not acceptable in europe and the united states , " schroeder said .
companies may be reluctant to insult their business partners by returning a gift , giving rise to the challenge of different cultural expectations .
wariness of owing favors clemens von stockert , a manager in the compliance department of fraport airport in frankfurt , says his company deals with potential problems by banning gifts like airline tickets , car shares , and inexpensive credit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the thought that counts : dinner comes at a different price depending on the city a dinner out is fine – it 's gone after having been eaten .
but anything over 35 euros should be internally documented , according to von stockert .
" the important thing is that people do n't put themselves in a position of dependency , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have clear rules that money and anything with monetary value are not to be accepted . "
gift giving has decreased in volume during recent years , according to von stockert , but occasionally someone in the company will receive a present .
if it ca n't be given back without jeopardizing a business relationship , then it 's likely to end up going to charity ... and the company has to pay taxes on it .
" nowadays more companies are keeping these regulations in mind when it comes to accepting gifts and giving them , " von stockert said .
sebastian schroeder of ammpl added the idea is n't to spoil christmas fun , but to foster an environment where companies work together " fairly and in a spirit of partnership . "
" it is true that christmas and similar holidays are used as an opportunity to intensify existing relationships between companies , " he said .
