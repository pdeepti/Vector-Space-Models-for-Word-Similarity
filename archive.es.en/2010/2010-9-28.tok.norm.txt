in november 2008 , he returned to iran and was subsequently arrested .
he was sentenced to 19.5 years in jail . an iranian court has sentenced iranian-canadian blogger hossein derakhshan to 19.5 years in prison , according to iranian media .
the conservative website , mashreghnews.ir , which is close to iran 's presidential office , said derakhshan was convicted on charges of cooperation with hostile countries , spreading propaganda against the ruling establishment , promotion of counterrevolutionary groups and insulting islamic thoughts and religious figures .
verdict can be appealed he was also given a five years ' ban from membership in political parties and activities in the media , and was sentenced to returning received funds in the amount of 30,750 euros , $ 2,900 , and 200 british pounds .
derakhshan can appeal , the report added .
before the verdict , immediate family members as well as reporters without borders had feared hossein derakhshan may be threatened with death penalty .
the iranian blogging pioneer has been held in a tehran prison for nearly two years and has been given little , if any , access to legal representation and no consular access to canadian authorities .
in recent days , family members had said that the prosecutor was seeking the death penalty for derakhshan .
a blogging leader ten years ago , hossein derakhshan moved from iran to canada to study .
that 's where he met his wife , who is also from iran , and became a canadian citizen .
in 2001 , from his base in toronto , derakhshan penned an online guide teaching iranians how to blog in their own language and championed persian blogging from both inside and outside of his homeland .
dubbed by some as " the blogfather , " derakhshan was frequently interviewed by western media outlets about the nascent iranian blogging community and his blogs in both english and persian .
as he continued at the time , he also became an outspoken critic of iran 's religious leadership .
blogging from toronto , and later paris and london , under the pen name " hoder , " derakhshan criticized iran 's elite as being inflexible and unwilling to engage in reform , while attacking ayatollah khamenei directly in his writing .
in 2005 , he served as a jury member in deutsche welle 's best of the blogs awards .
the following year , he made a very public trip to israel , which is normally forbidden for iranian citizens .
" i 'm going to israel as a citizen journalist and a peace activist , ” he wrote on his english blog at the time .
" i 'm a citizen of canada and i have the right to visit any country i want . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : derakhshan defended iran 's nuclear program in the face of protests a change of views later that year , derakhshan suddenly switched his political perspective and became a staunch nationalist and defender of the islamic republic .
in 2006 , derakhshan wrote an opinion piece defending iran 's nuclear program in the washington post .
he also began to attack activists and former friends on his blogs and in other media .
later he told the guardian newspaper in vehement words that if the united states attacked iran , he would return and fight for his homeland .
after visiting israel , derakhshan moved to london to pursue graduate studies . that 's when he went from making oppositional statements to outright supporting the new president .
he went on rhetorical rampages against many who had previously been his friends and colleagues and later was even sued for libel in the united states in 2007 .
in the fall of 2008 , before derakhshan returned to iran , he asked his friends to not take a public stance if he was arrested .
derakhshan had returned to iran in late 2008 , apparently having secured a job offer at press tv , the country 's english-language news service , but was arrested two weeks after his arrival .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad himself asked for a swift resolution to the case .
arrested after two weeks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahmoud ahmadinejad called for a swift resolution to derakhshan 's case however , little is known about his current situation .
a brief statement made three months ago by tehran accuses him of insulting the prophet muhammad along with iran 's spiritual leader and president , as well as disseminating " anti-revolutionary propaganda " and spying for israel .
derakhshan 's mother told an expatriate iranian news website , kamtarin.com , that she has visited her son in prison .
his physical and mental conditions are worrisome .
canadian citizenship not accepted unlike other possible death penalty cases in iran , the customary wave of popular solidarity failed to materialize behind derakhshan , although there has been some attention online and in the canadian media .
even the mayor of paris , bertrand delanoe , rallied to his support in a statement on his website .
" in the name of paris , i solemnly call upon the judicial authorities of tehran to not condemn hossein derakhshan to death , " he wrote last week . " and i invite the mobilization of all of our energies to save this honorable , courageous and dignified life . "
but derakhshan 's political stance and relationship to ahmadinejad remains clouded .
iranian authorities have not accepted derakhshan efforts to invoke his rights as a canadian citizen .
" despite the iranian government ’ s position , we consider mr. derakhshan to be a canadian citizen , " wrote lisa monette , a spokesperson from the canadian department of foreign affairs and international trade , in a statement sent to deutsche welle .
" we will continue to press the iranian authorities for access , as we have in similar cases involving dual nationals in other jurisdictions .
canada continues to urge iran to fully respect all of its human rights obligations , both in law and in practice . "
iranian authorities have arrested numerous bloggers in recent years in a bid to clamp down on internet dissent .

he talked with dw about what might be his last record as a solo artist . it 's easy to see why phil collins is ready to call it quits on solo work .
after eight grammy awards , an oscar for " best original song , " a golden globe , 100 million albums sold -lrb- 250 million counting his work with rock band genesis -rrb- , there 's just not much ground left for the drummer-turned-singer to cover . collins has also made a name for himself as a soundtrack composer , producer and big band leader . featuring cover versions of 1960 ’ s motown songs , " going back " is phil collins ' eighth studio album .
deutsche welle spoke with collins about what could well be his last solo record . click on the link below to listen to dw-radio ’ s hits in germany , featuring phil collins . deutsche welle : although you had previously announced the end of your solo career , you recently released " going back , " an album of motown cover versions .
what 's the story ?
phil collins : i 'm not sure i like what phil collins became , so i 've kind of written myself out of the story .
like if i was the writer of a book , i 've just written the main character out .
he suddenly died mysteriously and now the police are trying to find the murderer !
i 'm very proud of everything i 've done , but i do n't think i 'm ready to launch myself back into it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : collins ' cd " going back " was number two in the german charts after its release this record is something i ’ ve always wanted to do .
to me it 's almost like not part of phil collins ' career .
phil collins ' career is over .
this is something i needed to do and always wanted to do , which is to sing some of my favorite songs that i grew up with in the 60 's .
so this is a special case . so did recording it feel like taking a trip down memory lane ? there was one group called the action who played all these songs on the record .
the record is pretty much their set list .
i used to go and see them every time they played -lsb- in the london club -rsb- the marquee .
i 'd go out the next day and buy the originals .
they did versions of all those songs .
that turned me on to the original versions .
that 's why i paid them a lot of respect in the sleeve notes .
in fact , the drummer was my biggest hero , and he 's now one of my best friends .
so , i picture it very well - standing there and listening to this music being played live and what effect it had on my life . in terms of being near the end of a career - deliberately - it was a perfect circle . this music is what i started off listening to , and this is where i am now , doing the same thing .
it 's a beautiful journey . are you truly convinced that your solo career is over ?
i will always write music .
because of the way i write - in my little studio on my own at home - i will always make the demos , which are like painting the pictures .
i love doing that .
i 'm just not sure that i would necessarily say to a record company , " here 's my new record .
let 's put it out . " that lights a fuse that means you have to do a lot of other things . but it 's not because i feel old .
i mean , i am 59 , but it 's not anything to do with that or feeling tired .
i just feel like i want to be in control of my own life and help bring my kids up .
plus , i have other interests that i 'm very excited about . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the singer sees texas history and the lore of the american west in his future such as ?
i know it sounds boring or strange to fans , but i 've had this lifelong fascination with texas history , mainly because of davy crockett and the disney films in the early 50 's and then john wayne 's film " the alamo . "
i started to collect letters and documents , cannonballs , rifles , knives and swords from that whole period .
i 've also just co-authored a book on the subject .
it will be out in a year .
so , i can see myself getting more involved in that as a hobby . you 've been suffering from a painful spinal injury in recent years .
how are you now ?
mentally , i 'm okay .
i 've just got a few physical problems that i 'm trying to win over .
i have a problem with my arm .
at the moment i ca n't play the drums and piano , and i 'm not convinced that i ever will be able to again .

can you put a figure to what a single bee yields in its lifetime ?
what ’ s the actual value of the role played by mangroves in protecting coastlines and marine life ?
questions like these have never really been asked until now , with nature ’ s services taken largely for granted and therefore never precisely quantified .
but it 's a way of thinking that 's been gathering pace ever since the group of eight industrialized nations commissioned a report in 2007 from the united nations environment program .
the aim was to draw attention to the global benefits of biodiversity , and to the social and economic costs of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation .
the precursor to the teeb study -lrb- the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity -rrb- was the stern review compiled by british economist nicholas stern , chair of the grantham research institute on climate change and the environment at the london school of economics .
this 2006 report was one of the first in-depth studies of the effects of global warming on the world economy .
" with teeb , we want to spell out how much natural capital is worth , " said christoph schroeter-schlaack from the helmholtz center for environmental research -lrb- ufz -rrb- in leipzig , who worked on the study .
" we also want to ensure that the financial value of the environment is taken into greater consideration during the process of political and economic decision-making . "
funds to save forests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harvesting rubber does n't have to damage the environment but still brings farmers a good yield the final teeb synthesis report will be released in october at the 10th conference of parties to the convention of biological diversity meeting in nagoya , japan .
then , in december , environmental economics will be topping the agenda at the un climate summit in cancún , when experts will be calling for sustainable management of forest resources to be integrated into international climate agreements .
environment ministers will also be discussing a forest protection fund which would award subsidies to developing nations that protect their forests instead of selling them off to clear land that can then be used for agriculture , for example .
a number of south american countries will be bringing their own ideas to the table , including brazil , ecuador , guyana and costa rica , which is currently playing a pioneering role in terms of forest protection .
enormous value bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mangroves serve as natural dykes clearly , it has grasped the significance of forest economics . forests have a huge financial value .
as the teeb study shows , deforestation costs the world between $ 2 and 5 trillion worth of natural capital a year – whereas it would cost a mere $ 60 billion to conserve threatened forests .
the smaller the eco-system , the more precise the studies .
according to the ufz , one hectare of wood in the middle of the southwestern city of freiburg is worth almost 13,000 euros across a period of 100 years .
it acts as an air and water filter , a carbon sink , a supplier of timber and an employer for lumberjacks and a service provider for locals who come here in their leisure time – and save money , since these services are free .
factors contributing to the studies include the role played by biodiversity in boosting the efficiency of an eco-system .
estuaries and mangroves are especially valuable types of landscape because flood protection and fishing opportunities are just some of the services they provide .
in vietnam , planting and protecting nearly 12,000 hectares of mangroves cost $ 1.1 million but saved annual expenditures on dyke maintenance of $ 7.3 million .
investment in dyke building is absorbed into vietnam ’ s gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , but the economic contribution of the mangroves is never quantified .
in fact , their very destruction is seen as boosting gdp – much to the dismay of environmental economists .
a new mindset bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say illegal fishing is destroying valuable coral reefs they are keen to promote the idea of environmental indicators of growth and a new mindset : us ecological economist robert costanza has proposed that businesses pay into a precautionary fund when embarking on high-risk ventures , and can claim their payment back only if the project proves to cause little or no environmental damage .
bp would have had to pay up over 25 percent of the entire value of the company before it began drilling for oil in the gulf of mexico , constanza said .
" what would have happened then ? " he asks .
" either it would ’ ve decided not to drill , or it would have looked into ways to reduce the risk and increased its investments in safe technology . "
the recent oil disaster in the us is a perfect illustration of how quickly precautionary environmental protection can pay off .
the global fishing industry would also stand to profit .
a detailed study has yet to be carried out , but the world bank estimates that the fishing industry loses an annual $ 50 billion because of smaller catches despite rising expenditure on ships and equipment .
stephan lutter is an expert on fishing with the world wildlife fund , and stressed that the costs incurred by the destruction of valuable coral reefs by trawl nets , by-catches and illegal fishing have yet to be calculated .
" the fishing frenzy means that right now , everyone is a loser , " he said .
a rethink is long overdue .
studies such as teeb can help bring it about – and unlike the value of nature ’ s services , their message can be quantified .
ultimately , the economics of nature are based on a 1:100 ratio : nature pays back an average 100 euros for every euro invested in environmental protection – with services whose value has been overlooked for too long .

canadian citizenship not accepted unlike other possible death penalty cases in iran , the customary wave of popular solidarity failed to materialize behind derakhshan , although there has been some attention online and in the canadian media .
even the mayor of paris , bertrand delanoe , rallied to his support in a statement on his website .
" in the name of paris , i solemnly call upon the judicial authorities of tehran to not condemn hossein derakhshan to death , " he wrote last week . " and i invite the mobilization of all of our energies to save this honorable , courageous and dignified life . "
but derakhshan 's political stance and relationship to ahmadinejad remains clouded .
iranian authorities have not accepted derakhshan efforts to invoke his rights as a canadian citizen .
" despite the iranian government ’ s position , we consider mr. derakhshan to be a canadian citizen , " wrote lisa monette , a spokesperson from the canadian department of foreign affairs and international trade , in a statement sent to deutsche welle .
" we will continue to press the iranian authorities for access , as we have in similar cases involving dual nationals in other jurisdictions .
canada continues to urge iran to fully respect all of its human rights obligations , both in law and in practice . "
iranian authorities have arrested numerous bloggers in recent years in a bid to clamp down on internet dissent .

the organization called for a halt to the practice . the international human rights organization amnesty international has released a damning report which says european union -lrb- eu -rrb- countries have been quietly deporting roma gypsies back to kosovo for over a year .
the report , titled " not welcome anywhere : stop the forced return of roma to kosovo " , singles out germany as a chief perpetrator , alleging many of the gypsies are being forcibly removed from their homes at early hours in the morning with nothing more than the clothes on their back .
amnesty says that many of the roma are made to sign statements attesting their deportation is voluntary .
the report calculates that almost 10,000 roma are legally obliged to leave the country and are therefore at risk of forcible return to kosovo from germany alone .
it says the roma deportations began during negotiations of a bilateral readmission agreement between germany and kosovo in 2009 , which was finally signed on april 14 , 2010 , and came into force on september 1 , 2010 .
roma discrimination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic albanians were the driving force behind kosovo 's independence sian jones , amnesty 's kosovo expert , said eu countries risked breaking international law by sending roma back " to places where they are at risk of persecution , or other serious harm . "
discrimination against roma in kosovo is " widespread and systematic compounded by their perceived association with kosovo serbs , " said amnesty .
" the eu should instead continue to provide international protection for roma and other minorities in kosovo until they can return there safely , " added sian jones .
" the kosovo authorities must also ensure that roma and other minorities can return voluntarily and reintegrate fully in society . "
the london-based rights group said few roma receive help on their return to kosovo , meaning many face problems in obtaining access to education , healthcare , housing and social benefits .
deportations from germany are organized by the individual states , and there are wide differences between the strictness with which they are carried out , with some states having imposed a virtual moratorium .
roma clampdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding issued a sharp rebuke of french policy on roma a recent report by the united nations children 's organization , unicef , indicates that nearly 40 percent of the roma returned from germany are stateless , and that as many as 50 percent who are legally obliged to leave are children .
it also states that almost two-thirds of them are born and educated in germany .
the partially-recognized republic of kosovo declared itself independent from serbia in 2008 .
so far , the independence of the albanian-majority state has been recognized by 70 countries .
the amnesty report comes amid international outrage at a clampdown on roma in france , which has seen hundreds of them sent back to romania and bulgaria since the beginning of august despite eu legislation on the free movement of people .
eu justice commissioner viviane reding threatened to take legal action against france over the deportations .

one company says it is ready to deploy the technology , but locals are fighting plans to bury the carbon under their town . energy giant vattenfall is currently testing its procedure for carbon capture and storage -lrb- ccs -rrb- in a part of eastern germany known as lausitz .
" we 're working on a process to remove co2 from waste gas .
that way we 're hoping to make the process of generating electricity from brown coal climate-friendlier " , said vattenfall 's lutz picard who shows visitors around daily to explain how the company wants to make coal production green .
the company says some 55 million tons of lignite , also known as brown coal , are still produced here every year .
the pilot facility , at vattenfall 's schwarze pumpe brown-coal power plant , is trialing a technique which the company calls ' oxyfuel ' because it involves adding large amounts of oxygen to the coal-burning process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oxygen is added when burning coal to extract the co2 half the equation " we add oxygen when we burn the coal " , said vattenfall 's lutz picard .
" that 's how we 're able to remove co2 from the waste gas because the concentration of co2 at the cauldron 's mouthpiece is higher . "
after it has been cleaned in several steps , the company says it is able to extract almost pure co2 .
at the moment , however , the co2 that is being extracted is simply being released back into the atmosphere , because the company is still waiting for a new law which would allow it to pump the gas underground .
germany 's government is expected to give the green light to ccs technology , in line with its recently-announced energy concept for the next 40 years , which aims to promote a massive expansion of renewable energies while keeping energy prices stable through " bridge " technologies like nuclear power .
at vattenfall 's schwarze pumpe site , this would mean trucks and pipelines would be used to transport co2 to the small town of beeskow nearby , where it would be pressed 1,000 meters below the surface .
vattenfall is confident of securing the necessary legislation , but it has since hit another snag : local resistance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beeskow 's inhabitants are against the plans to store co2 below their town guinea pigs the inhabitants of beeskow are against the plans and have put up big yellow crosses all along the road .
the pictures are reminiscent of the protest carried out by the anti-nuclear movement in other parts of germany , where energy giants are planning to build repositories for nuclear waste .
beeskow 's inhabitants say there has n't been enough investigation of the potential impact of pumping the carbon below their town , and they do n't want to be used as " guinea pigs . " many are afraid that the carbon might not be as clean as promised by vattenfall , and that sulfur and heavy metals like arsenic could get into the drinking water via the ground water .
even if the gas were clean , underground storage could lead to another problem , said activist hardy feldmann , because the liquid co2 would be pressed into porous sand stone which contains very salty water , or brine .
" the brine would have to make space for the co2 " , feldmann said .
" that would mean it would end up in the ground water .
so we would have high levels of salt in the ground water . "
so far , the city of beeskow has vetoed vattenfall 's plans to conduct geological research on the brine layers , and has attacked federal authorities for allowing vattenfall to proceed with its plans despite the absence of a law on the technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the co2 extracted be pure enough to be stored underground ?
export opportunity but these concerns are not shared at vattenfall .
lutz picard stresses that his company will do everything it can to purify the greenhouse gas and make the underground storage facility as secure as possible .
for him the technology is inevitable .
" in germany you may argue about where coal ranks as a source of energy " , picard said .
" but in countries like china or india you ca n't .
there , coal is available and people will use it .
and then the only question is : how do you use coal in a climate-friendly way ? "
for vattenfall , capturing and storing carbon dioxide could mean a big export opportunity – and perhaps one of it 's last in the coal mining industry , considering that in 40 years ' time , germany is supposed to end to its own coal production .

can you put a figure to what a single bee yields in its lifetime ?
what ’ s the actual value of the role played by mangroves in protecting coastlines and marine life ?
questions like these have never really been asked until now , with nature ’ s services taken largely for granted and therefore never precisely quantified .
but it 's a way of thinking that 's been gathering pace ever since the group of eight industrialized nations commissioned a report in 2007 from the united nations environment program .
the aim was to draw attention to the global benefits of biodiversity , and to the social and economic costs of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation .
the precursor to the teeb study -lrb- the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity -rrb- was the stern review compiled by british economist nicholas stern , chair of the grantham research institute on climate change and the environment at the london school of economics .
this 2006 report was one of the first in-depth studies of the effects of global warming on the world economy .
" with teeb , we want to spell out how much natural capital is worth , " said christoph schroeter-schlaack from the helmholtz center for environmental research -lrb- ufz -rrb- in leipzig , who worked on the study .
" we also want to ensure that the financial value of the environment is taken into greater consideration during the process of political and economic decision-making . "
funds to save forests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harvesting rubber does n't have to damage the environment but still brings farmers a good yield the final teeb synthesis report will be released in october at the 10th conference of parties to the convention of biological diversity meeting in nagoya , japan .
then , in december , environmental economics will be topping the agenda at the un climate summit in cancún , when experts will be calling for sustainable management of forest resources to be integrated into international climate agreements .
environment ministers will also be discussing a forest protection fund which would award subsidies to developing nations that protect their forests instead of selling them off to clear land that can then be used for agriculture , for example .
a number of south american countries will be bringing their own ideas to the table , including brazil , ecuador , guyana and costa rica , which is currently playing a pioneering role in terms of forest protection .
enormous value bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mangroves serve as natural dykes clearly , it has grasped the significance of forest economics . forests have a huge financial value .
as the teeb study shows , deforestation costs the world between $ 2 and 5 trillion worth of natural capital a year – whereas it would cost a mere $ 60 billion to conserve threatened forests .
the smaller the eco-system , the more precise the studies .
according to the ufz , one hectare of wood in the middle of the southwestern city of freiburg is worth almost 13,000 euros across a period of 100 years .
it acts as an air and water filter , a carbon sink , a supplier of timber and an employer for lumberjacks and a service provider for locals who come here in their leisure time – and save money , since these services are free .
factors contributing to the studies include the role played by biodiversity in boosting the efficiency of an eco-system .
estuaries and mangroves are especially valuable types of landscape because flood protection and fishing opportunities are just some of the services they provide .
in vietnam , planting and protecting nearly 12,000 hectares of mangroves cost $ 1.1 million but saved annual expenditures on dyke maintenance of $ 7.3 million .
investment in dyke building is absorbed into vietnam ’ s gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , but the economic contribution of the mangroves is never quantified .
in fact , their very destruction is seen as boosting gdp – much to the dismay of environmental economists .
a new mindset bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say illegal fishing is destroying valuable coral reefs they are keen to promote the idea of environmental indicators of growth and a new mindset : us ecological economist robert costanza has proposed that businesses pay into a precautionary fund when embarking on high-risk ventures , and can claim their payment back only if the project proves to cause little or no environmental damage .
bp would have had to pay up over 25 percent of the entire value of the company before it began drilling for oil in the gulf of mexico , constanza said .
" what would have happened then ? " he asks .
" either it would ’ ve decided not to drill , or it would have looked into ways to reduce the risk and increased its investments in safe technology . "
the recent oil disaster in the us is a perfect illustration of how quickly precautionary environmental protection can pay off .
the global fishing industry would also stand to profit .
a detailed study has yet to be carried out , but the world bank estimates that the fishing industry loses an annual $ 50 billion because of smaller catches despite rising expenditure on ships and equipment .
stephan lutter is an expert on fishing with the world wildlife fund , and stressed that the costs incurred by the destruction of valuable coral reefs by trawl nets , by-catches and illegal fishing have yet to be calculated .
" the fishing frenzy means that right now , everyone is a loser , " he said .
a rethink is long overdue .
studies such as teeb can help bring it about – and unlike the value of nature ’ s services , their message can be quantified .

opposition leaders say it ’ s a blow to the growing renewable energy sector . cabinet ministers in berlin on tuesday presented a new energy concept which they called exemplary and unmatched in the world , and which includes a controversial extension to germany 's nuclear power plants .
" the concept is not just a vision , " said environment minister norbert roettgen in berlin .
" by 2050 , about 80 percent of all energy consumed in this country will come from renewable sources , but on the way to this age we need nuclear power for an interim period to make this happen . "
under the new plan , the deadline to shut down germany 's nuclear power plants would be extended by an average of 12 years , with the last one running until 2036 .
merkel and her government say the extension is needed to keep germany running until renewable energy sources can supply the country with enough energy to replace what is produced by nuclear plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's cabinet insists the extension is necessary " a longer lifespan for nuclear power plants will help us keep energy prices affordable for both private consumers and industry , " said economics minister rainer bruederle .
" and it 'll be easier for us to reduce harmful gas emissions . "
effects on renewable energy that 's an argument that the opposition reject .
both sigmar gabriel , chairman of the spd , and juergen trittin , co-chairman of the greens , said the government 's plan would hurt the renewable energy industry with providers having to compete with nuclear energy to get a foothold in the market .
both trittin and gabriel are former environment ministers under previous coalition governments .
" with its energy plan , the government is about to block the creation of 300,000 new jobs in the renewables sector , " gabriel told german public broadcaster ard .
" many small and medium-sized firms involved in generating renewable energy are now being put under increasing pressure . "
the new plan also includes a tax on uranium fuel rods that bruederle said would generate 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- in government revenue annually .
a renewable energy fund would also be established that would collect 300 million euros from power companies each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without a majority in the bundesrat , merkel hopes to bypass the upper house constitutional court battle brewing the opposition is also displeased by suggestions from the government that the plan only needs the approval of the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , and not the bundesrat , the upper house , which represents the country 's 16 states .
merkel 's coalition of conservative christian democrats , their bavarian sister party , the christian social union and the liberal free democrats argues that the nuclear plant deadline is a federal issue , not a state matter .
the governing coalition lost its majority in the bundesrat in the state election in north rhine-westphalia in may .
it still has a majority in the bundestag .
the opposition has said if the government does bypass the bundesrat , it will go to the country 's constitutional court .

after unification , the west german government advisory body , the council of science and humanities was tasked with evaluating east german research facilities , according to karl ulrich mayer , a west german sociologist at yale university in the united states .
" a whole number of institutes were closed down , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle , nearly two decades after the official reunification date of october 3 , 1990 .
" -lsb- mainly -rsb- because it was assumed that they were too much of the party line , " he added .
mayer is now also president of the leibniz association , which comprises of 86 research institutions across germany , including many in the former east germany , like the leibniz institute for plant biochemistry outside of leipzig . he added that the hard sciences too , were not immune to cuts and layoffs .

in jena there was a big academy of science institutes in the area of penicillin research , that was reduced to about 550 people from 1,000 , " said mayer , " and these 550 people were then distributed among two leibniz institutes and a few university institutes . "

in the gdr , women were given the same opportunities as men to work and study .
despite such advances , nickel found herself increasingly disillusioned with a system that censored findings it did n't want to hear .
" i think we did really good research on the youth in gdr and we could see how they feel in the end of the 70s , 80s , that they want to leave the gdr , " said nickel , " but nobody wanted to know it and we could n't publish it . "

and economists , among others , are happy : consumer spending has long been a weak point in the country 's economic performance . german consumer confidence continues to climb as the economy strengthens and unemployment falls , boosting income expectations , according to a survey .
the gfk market research institute said tuesday that its forward-looking consumer confidence index for october rose to 4.9 points , up from a revised 4.3 in september , representing a three-year high .
" the decisive factor in the strong sentiment among consumers is the extremely positive development of the employment market , " gfk said in a statement .
falling unemployment germany 's unemployment rate was 7.6 percent last month .
that was approximately the level at which it was when the us investment bank lehman brothers collapsed two years ago , fueling a global financial crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling unemployment is bolstering consumer confidence although the german economy is showing signs of slower growth in the second half of the year , the federal labor agency 's iab research institute expects unemployment to drop slightly below 3 million people in 2011 to a nine-year low .
low inflation gfk also pointed to the low level of inflation , currently at around 1 percent , as another factor increasing consumer purchasing power .
the market researcher added that consumers in germany are already experiencing an improved income situation ; according to new data from the federal statistical office , gross monthly income after living expenses increased by 2.3 percent in the second quarter . germany , europe 's biggest economy , has enjoyed strong export-led growth this year .
its massive 2.2 percent growth in the second quarter over the previous three-month period has helped the 16-nation eurozone outperform the us .

the aim was to draw attention to the global benefits of biodiversity , and to the social and economic costs of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation .
the precursor to the teeb study -lrb- the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity -rrb- was the stern review compiled by british economist nicholas stern , chair of the grantham research institute on climate change and the environment at the london school of economics .
this 2006 report was one of the first in-depth studies of the effects of global warming on the world economy .
" with teeb , we want to spell out how much natural capital is worth , " said christoph schroeter-schlaack from the helmholtz center for environmental research -lrb- ufz -rrb- in leipzig , who worked on the study .
" we also want to ensure that the financial value of the environment is taken into greater consideration during the process of political and economic decision-making . "
funds to save forests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harvesting rubber does n't have to damage the environment but still brings farmers a good yield the final teeb synthesis report will be released in october at the 10th conference of parties to the convention of biological diversity meeting in nagoya , japan .
then , in december , environmental economics will be topping the agenda at the un climate summit in cancún , when experts will be calling for sustainable management of forest resources to be integrated into international climate agreements .
environment ministers will also be discussing a forest protection fund which would award subsidies to developing nations that protect their forests instead of selling them off to clear land that can then be used for agriculture , for example .
a number of south american countries will be bringing their own ideas to the table , including brazil , ecuador , guyana and costa rica , which is currently playing a pioneering role in terms of forest protection .
enormous value bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mangroves serve as natural dykes clearly , it has grasped the significance of forest economics . forests have a huge financial value .
as the teeb study shows , deforestation costs the world between $ 2 and 5 trillion worth of natural capital a year – whereas it would cost a mere $ 60 billion to conserve threatened forests .
the smaller the eco-system , the more precise the studies .
according to the ufz , one hectare of wood in the middle of the southwestern city of freiburg is worth almost 13,000 euros across a period of 100 years .
it acts as an air and water filter , a carbon sink , a supplier of timber and an employer for lumberjacks and a service provider for locals who come here in their leisure time – and save money , since these services are free .
factors contributing to the studies include the role played by biodiversity in boosting the efficiency of an eco-system .
estuaries and mangroves are especially valuable types of landscape because flood protection and fishing opportunities are just some of the services they provide .
in vietnam , planting and protecting nearly 12,000 hectares of mangroves cost $ 1.1 million but saved annual expenditures on dyke maintenance of $ 7.3 million .
investment in dyke building is absorbed into vietnam ’ s gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , but the economic contribution of the mangroves is never quantified .
in fact , their very destruction is seen as boosting gdp – much to the dismay of environmental economists .
a new mindset bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say illegal fishing is destroying valuable coral reefs they are keen to promote the idea of environmental indicators of growth and a new mindset : us ecological economist robert costanza has proposed that businesses pay into a precautionary fund when embarking on high-risk ventures , and can claim their payment back only if the project proves to cause little or no environmental damage .
bp would have had to pay up over 25 percent of the entire value of the company before it began drilling for oil in the gulf of mexico , constanza said .
" what would have happened then ? " he asks .
" either it would ’ ve decided not to drill , or it would have looked into ways to reduce the risk and increased its investments in safe technology . "
the recent oil disaster in the us is a perfect illustration of how quickly precautionary environmental protection can pay off .
the global fishing industry would also stand to profit .
a detailed study has yet to be carried out , but the world bank estimates that the fishing industry loses an annual $ 50 billion because of smaller catches despite rising expenditure on ships and equipment .
stephan lutter is an expert on fishing with the world wildlife fund , and stressed that the costs incurred by the destruction of valuable coral reefs by trawl nets , by-catches and illegal fishing have yet to be calculated .
" the fishing frenzy means that right now , everyone is a loser , " he said .
a rethink is long overdue .
studies such as teeb can help bring it about – and unlike the value of nature ’ s services , their message can be quantified .
ultimately , the economics of nature are based on a 1:100 ratio : nature pays back an average 100 euros for every euro invested in environmental protection – with services whose value has been overlooked for too long .

the organization called for a halt to the practice . the international human rights organization amnesty international has released a damning report which says european union -lrb- eu -rrb- countries have been quietly deporting roma gypsies back to kosovo for over a year .
the report , titled " not welcome anywhere : stop the forced return of roma to kosovo " , singles out germany as a chief perpetrator , alleging many of the gypsies are being forcibly removed from their homes at early hours in the morning with nothing more than the clothes on their back .
amnesty says that many of the roma are made to sign statements attesting their deportation is voluntary .
the report calculates that almost 10,000 roma are legally obliged to leave the country and are therefore at risk of forcible return to kosovo from germany alone .
it says the roma deportations began during negotiations of a bilateral readmission agreement between germany and kosovo in 2009 , which was finally signed on april 14 , 2010 , and came into force on september 1 , 2010 .
roma discrimination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic albanians were the driving force behind kosovo 's independence sian jones , amnesty 's kosovo expert , said eu countries risked breaking international law by sending roma back " to places where they are at risk of persecution , or other serious harm . "
discrimination against roma in kosovo is " widespread and systematic compounded by their perceived association with kosovo serbs , " said amnesty .
" the eu should instead continue to provide international protection for roma and other minorities in kosovo until they can return there safely , " added sian jones .
" the kosovo authorities must also ensure that roma and other minorities can return voluntarily and reintegrate fully in society . "
the london-based rights group said few roma receive help on their return to kosovo , meaning many face problems in obtaining access to education , healthcare , housing and social benefits .
deportations from germany are organized by the individual states , and there are wide differences between the strictness with which they are carried out , with some states having imposed a virtual moratorium .
roma clampdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding issued a sharp rebuke of french policy on roma a recent report by the united nations children 's organization , unicef , indicates that nearly 40 percent of the roma returned from germany are stateless , and that as many as 50 percent who are legally obliged to leave are children .
it also states that almost two-thirds of them are born and educated in germany .
the partially-recognized republic of kosovo declared itself independent from serbia in 2008 .
so far , the independence of the albanian-majority state has been recognized by 70 countries .
the amnesty report comes amid international outrage at a clampdown on roma in france , which has seen hundreds of them sent back to romania and bulgaria since the beginning of august despite eu legislation on the free movement of people .
eu justice commissioner viviane reding threatened to take legal action against france over the deportations .

opposition leaders say it ’ s a blow to the growing renewable energy sector . cabinet ministers in berlin on tuesday presented a new energy concept which they called exemplary and unmatched in the world , and which includes a controversial extension to germany 's nuclear power plants .
" the concept is not just a vision , " said environment minister norbert roettgen in berlin .
" by 2050 , about 80 percent of all energy consumed in this country will come from renewable sources , but on the way to this age we need nuclear power for an interim period to make this happen . "
under the new plan , the deadline to shut down germany 's nuclear power plants would be extended by an average of 12 years , with the last one running until 2036 .
merkel and her government say the extension is needed to keep germany running until renewable energy sources can supply the country with enough energy to replace what is produced by nuclear plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's cabinet insists the extension is necessary " a longer lifespan for nuclear power plants will help us keep energy prices affordable for both private consumers and industry , " said economics minister rainer bruederle .
" and it 'll be easier for us to reduce harmful gas emissions . "
effects on renewable energy that 's an argument that the opposition reject .
both sigmar gabriel , chairman of the spd , and juergen trittin , co-chairman of the greens , said the government 's plan would hurt the renewable energy industry with providers having to compete with nuclear energy to get a foothold in the market .
both trittin and gabriel are former environment ministers under previous coalition governments .
" with its energy plan , the government is about to block the creation of 300,000 new jobs in the renewables sector , " gabriel told german public broadcaster ard .
" many small and medium-sized firms involved in generating renewable energy are now being put under increasing pressure . "
the new plan also includes a tax on uranium fuel rods that bruederle said would generate 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- in government revenue annually .
a renewable energy fund would also be established that would collect 300 million euros from power companies each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without a majority in the bundesrat , merkel hopes to bypass the upper house constitutional court battle brewing the opposition is also displeased by suggestions from the government that the plan only needs the approval of the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , and not the bundesrat , the upper house , which represents the country 's 16 states .
merkel 's coalition of conservative christian democrats , their bavarian sister party , the christian social union and the liberal free democrats argues that the nuclear plant deadline is a federal issue , not a state matter .
the governing coalition lost its majority in the bundesrat in the state election in north rhine-westphalia in may .
it still has a majority in the bundestag .
the opposition has said if the government does bypass the bundesrat , it will go to the country 's constitutional court .

one company says it is ready to deploy the technology , but locals are fighting plans to bury the carbon under their town . energy giant vattenfall is currently testing its procedure for carbon capture and storage -lrb- ccs -rrb- in a part of eastern germany known as lausitz .
" we 're working on a process to remove co2 from waste gas .
that way we 're hoping to make the process of generating electricity from brown coal climate-friendlier " , said vattenfall 's lutz picard who shows visitors around daily to explain how the company wants to make coal production green .
the company says some 55 million tons of lignite , also known as brown coal , are still produced here every year .
the pilot facility , at vattenfall 's schwarze pumpe brown-coal power plant , is trialing a technique which the company calls ' oxyfuel ' because it involves adding large amounts of oxygen to the coal-burning process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oxygen is added when burning coal to extract the co2 half the equation " we add oxygen when we burn the coal " , said vattenfall 's lutz picard .
" that 's how we 're able to remove co2 from the waste gas because the concentration of co2 at the cauldron 's mouthpiece is higher . "
after it has been cleaned in several steps , the company says it is able to extract almost pure co2 .
at the moment , however , the co2 that is being extracted is simply being released back into the atmosphere , because the company is still waiting for a new law which would allow it to pump the gas underground .
germany 's government is expected to give the green light to ccs technology , in line with its recently-announced energy concept for the next 40 years , which aims to promote a massive expansion of renewable energies while keeping energy prices stable through " bridge " technologies like nuclear power .
at vattenfall 's schwarze pumpe site , this would mean trucks and pipelines would be used to transport co2 to the small town of beeskow nearby , where it would be pressed 1,000 meters below the surface .
vattenfall is confident of securing the necessary legislation , but it has since hit another snag : local resistance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beeskow 's inhabitants are against the plans to store co2 below their town guinea pigs the inhabitants of beeskow are against the plans and have put up big yellow crosses all along the road .
the pictures are reminiscent of the protest carried out by the anti-nuclear movement in other parts of germany , where energy giants are planning to build repositories for nuclear waste .
beeskow 's inhabitants say there has n't been enough investigation of the potential impact of pumping the carbon below their town , and they do n't want to be used as " guinea pigs . " many are afraid that the carbon might not be as clean as promised by vattenfall , and that sulfur and heavy metals like arsenic could get into the drinking water via the ground water .
even if the gas were clean , underground storage could lead to another problem , said activist hardy feldmann , because the liquid co2 would be pressed into porous sand stone which contains very salty water , or brine .
" the brine would have to make space for the co2 " , feldmann said .
" that would mean it would end up in the ground water .
so we would have high levels of salt in the ground water . "
so far , the city of beeskow has vetoed vattenfall 's plans to conduct geological research on the brine layers , and has attacked federal authorities for allowing vattenfall to proceed with its plans despite the absence of a law on the technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the co2 extracted be pure enough to be stored underground ?
export opportunity but these concerns are not shared at vattenfall .
lutz picard stresses that his company will do everything it can to purify the greenhouse gas and make the underground storage facility as secure as possible .
for him the technology is inevitable .
" in germany you may argue about where coal ranks as a source of energy " , picard said .
" but in countries like china or india you ca n't .
there , coal is available and people will use it .
and then the only question is : how do you use coal in a climate-friendly way ? "
for vattenfall , capturing and storing carbon dioxide could mean a big export opportunity – and perhaps one of it 's last in the coal mining industry , considering that in 40 years ' time , germany is supposed to end to its own coal production .

for some it was easier than others , as older faculty were often forced out , and younger faculty found opportunities in the west . while the rest of the country was trying to figure how to integrate two governments , two currencies and two of nearly everything else , the sciences were no different .
after unification , the west german government advisory body , the council of science and humanities was tasked with evaluating east german research facilities , according to karl ulrich mayer , a west german sociologist at yale university in the united states .
" a whole number of institutes were closed down , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle , nearly two decades after the official reunification date of october 3 , 1990 .
" -lsb- mainly -rsb- because it was assumed that they were too much of the party line , " he added .
mayer is now also president of the leibniz association , which comprises of 86 research institutions across germany , including many in the former east germany , like the leibniz institute for plant biochemistry outside of leipzig . he added that the hard sciences too , were not immune to cuts and layoffs . "
in jena there was a big academy of science institutes in the area of penicillin research , that was reduced to about 550 people from 1,000 , " said mayer , " and these 550 people were then distributed among two leibniz institutes and a few university institutes . "
while some east german institutes were absorbed into existing west german facilities , the max planck society refused to do this , which gave them the opportunity to found new research institutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1964 , this was the office of the famed east german biochemist karl mothes , the ipb 's first director publication restrictions for east german research the german democratic republic , or gdr as it was known in english , focused on other hard sciences , including chemistry , biotechnology and nuclear science .
the gdr received reactor technology from the soviet union .
while research studies from the hard sciences had the chance to be published in western journals , it was much tougher for the social sciences and humanities , according to dieter hoffman , a fellow at the max planck institute for the history of science in berlin .
before the wall came down , hoffmann worked at the east german academy of sciences in the institute for theory and the history of science . "
it was not possible for me for instance , to publish in western journals , " said hoffmann , " and also i could not go to west to visit colleagues or conferences and to present there my scientific research . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people who worked at the ipb during the east german period lost their jobs or were forced to retire scientists who did n't toe the party line , or who were suspected of criticizing the regime quickly found their work censored or not published at all .
still , there were some instances that proved to be beneficial for young scientists under the gdr .
hildegard maria nickel worked as a sociologist at the academy of educational sciences in east germany .
she says now that she would never have had the opportunity to become a professor if she had n't grown up in east germany because of her background .
born to working class parents , nickel 's father was a migrant and she was one of eight children .
in the gdr , women were given the same opportunities as men to work and study .
despite such advances , nickel found herself increasingly disillusioned with a system that censored findings it did n't want to hear .
" i think we did really good research on the youth in gdr and we could see how they feel in the end of the 70s , 80s , that they want to leave the gdr , " said nickel , " but nobody wanted to know it and we could n't publish it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before the wall came down , dieter hoffmann worked at the east german academy of sciences in the institute for theory and the history of science .
unification brought new opportunities when the wall came down , nickel and hoffmann were able to find jobs in a unified germany , easily travel and freely publish .
but many older faculty , found themselves demoted or pushed out . "
some people went to an early retirement .
some people could start a new scientific career or continue their career in a new location or institute and some people became unemployed , " said hoffman .
one of the prime examples of scientists finding a new career under a unified germany was , of course angela merkel , germany 's current chancellor .
before she entered politics , merkel studied , worked and eventually earned her doctorate in quantum chemistry in east berlin .
while integrating east and west german science research centres was a difficult process for many , hoffmann added that in a unified germany today there are plenty of exciting areas of research .
after all , he observed , the city of jena is a world leader in optics and home to companies like carl zeiss , schott and jenoptik .
dresden specializes in material sciences , and freiberg in saxony is known for solar power manufacturing . "
i think what you find now on the landscape -lsb- is -rsb- very often amazing , " he said . " for instance here in berlin , this institute for laser physics - max-born institute - that 's one of the worldwide leading institutes in this field . "

opposition leaders say it ’ s a blow to the growing renewable energy sector . cabinet ministers in berlin on tuesday presented a new energy concept which they called exemplary and unmatched in the world , and which includes a controversial extension to germany 's nuclear power plants .
" the concept is not just a vision , " said environment minister norbert roettgen in berlin .
" by 2050 , about 80 percent of all energy consumed in this country will come from renewable sources , but on the way to this age we need nuclear power for an interim period to make this happen . "
under the new plan , the deadline to shut down germany 's nuclear power plants would be extended by an average of 12 years , with the last one running until 2036 .
merkel and her government say the extension is needed to keep germany running until renewable energy sources can supply the country with enough energy to replace what is produced by nuclear plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's cabinet insists the extension is necessary " a longer lifespan for nuclear power plants will help us keep energy prices affordable for both private consumers and industry , " said economics minister rainer bruederle .
" and it 'll be easier for us to reduce harmful gas emissions . "
effects on renewable energy that 's an argument that the opposition reject .
both sigmar gabriel , chairman of the spd , and juergen trittin , co-chairman of the greens , said the government 's plan would hurt the renewable energy industry with providers having to compete with nuclear energy to get a foothold in the market .
both trittin and gabriel are former environment ministers under previous coalition governments .
" with its energy plan , the government is about to block the creation of 300,000 new jobs in the renewables sector , " gabriel told german public broadcaster ard .
" many small and medium-sized firms involved in generating renewable energy are now being put under increasing pressure . "
the new plan also includes a tax on uranium fuel rods that bruederle said would generate 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- in government revenue annually .
a renewable energy fund would also be established that would collect 300 million euros from power companies each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without a majority in the bundesrat , merkel hopes to bypass the upper house constitutional court battle brewing the opposition is also displeased by suggestions from the government that the plan only needs the approval of the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , and not the bundesrat , the upper house , which represents the country 's 16 states .
merkel 's coalition of conservative christian democrats , their bavarian sister party , the christian social union and the liberal free democrats argues that the nuclear plant deadline is a federal issue , not a state matter .
the governing coalition lost its majority in the bundesrat in the state election in north rhine-westphalia in may .
it still has a majority in the bundestag .
the opposition has said if the government does bypass the bundesrat , it will go to the country 's constitutional court .

opposition leaders say it ’ s a blow to the growing renewable energy sector . cabinet ministers in berlin on tuesday presented a new energy concept which they called exemplary and unmatched in the world , and which includes a controversial extension to germany 's nuclear power plants .
" the concept is not just a vision , " said environment minister norbert roettgen in berlin .
" by 2050 , about 80 percent of all energy consumed in this country will come from renewable sources , but on the way to this age we need nuclear power for an interim period to make this happen . "
under the new plan , the deadline to shut down germany 's nuclear power plants would be extended by an average of 12 years , with the last one running until 2036 .
merkel and her government say the extension is needed to keep germany running until renewable energy sources can supply the country with enough energy to replace what is produced by nuclear plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's cabinet insists the extension is necessary " a longer lifespan for nuclear power plants will help us keep energy prices affordable for both private consumers and industry , " said economics minister rainer bruederle .
" and it 'll be easier for us to reduce harmful gas emissions . "
effects on renewable energy that 's an argument that the opposition reject .
both sigmar gabriel , chairman of the spd , and juergen trittin , co-chairman of the greens , said the government 's plan would hurt the renewable energy industry with providers having to compete with nuclear energy to get a foothold in the market .
both trittin and gabriel are former environment ministers under previous coalition governments .
" with its energy plan , the government is about to block the creation of 300,000 new jobs in the renewables sector , " gabriel told german public broadcaster ard .
" many small and medium-sized firms involved in generating renewable energy are now being put under increasing pressure . "
the new plan also includes a tax on uranium fuel rods that bruederle said would generate 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- in government revenue annually .
a renewable energy fund would also be established that would collect 300 million euros from power companies each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without a majority in the bundesrat , merkel hopes to bypass the upper house constitutional court battle brewing the opposition is also displeased by suggestions from the government that the plan only needs the approval of the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , and not the bundesrat , the upper house , which represents the country 's 16 states .
merkel 's coalition of conservative christian democrats , their bavarian sister party , the christian social union and the liberal free democrats argues that the nuclear plant deadline is a federal issue , not a state matter .
the governing coalition lost its majority in the bundesrat in the state election in north rhine-westphalia in may .
it still has a majority in the bundestag .
the opposition has said if the government does bypass the bundesrat , it will go to the country 's constitutional court .

in november 2008 , he returned to iran and was subsequently arrested .
he was sentenced to 19.5 years in jail . an iranian court has sentenced iranian-canadian blogger hossein derakhshan to 19.5 years in prison , according to iranian media .
the conservative website , mashreghnews.ir , which is close to iran 's presidential office , said derakhshan was convicted on charges of cooperation with hostile countries , spreading propaganda against the ruling establishment , promotion of counterrevolutionary groups and insulting islamic thoughts and religious figures .
verdict can be appealed he was also given a five years ' ban from membership in political parties and activities in the media , and was sentenced to returning received funds in the amount of 30,750 euros , $ 2,900 , and 200 british pounds .
derakhshan can appeal , the report added .
before the verdict , immediate family members as well as reporters without borders had feared hossein derakhshan may be threatened with death penalty .
the iranian blogging pioneer has been held in a tehran prison for nearly two years and has been given little , if any , access to legal representation and no consular access to canadian authorities .
in recent days , family members had said that the prosecutor was seeking the death penalty for derakhshan .
a blogging leader ten years ago , hossein derakhshan moved from iran to canada to study .
that 's where he met his wife , who is also from iran , and became a canadian citizen .
in 2001 , from his base in toronto , derakhshan penned an online guide teaching iranians how to blog in their own language and championed persian blogging from both inside and outside of his homeland .
dubbed by some as " the blogfather , " derakhshan was frequently interviewed by western media outlets about the nascent iranian blogging community and his blogs in both english and persian .
as he continued at the time , he also became an outspoken critic of iran 's religious leadership .
blogging from toronto , and later paris and london , under the pen name " hoder , " derakhshan criticized iran 's elite as being inflexible and unwilling to engage in reform , while attacking ayatollah khamenei directly in his writing .
in 2005 , he served as a jury member in deutsche welle 's best of the blogs awards .
the following year , he made a very public trip to israel , which is normally forbidden for iranian citizens .
" i 'm going to israel as a citizen journalist and a peace activist , ” he wrote on his english blog at the time .
" i 'm a citizen of canada and i have the right to visit any country i want . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : derakhshan defended iran 's nuclear program in the face of protests a change of views later that year , derakhshan suddenly switched his political perspective and became a staunch nationalist and defender of the islamic republic .
in 2006 , derakhshan wrote an opinion piece defending iran 's nuclear program in the washington post .
he also began to attack activists and former friends on his blogs and in other media .
later he told the guardian newspaper in vehement words that if the united states attacked iran , he would return and fight for his homeland .
after visiting israel , derakhshan moved to london to pursue graduate studies . that 's when he went from making oppositional statements to outright supporting the new president .
he went on rhetorical rampages against many who had previously been his friends and colleagues and later was even sued for libel in the united states in 2007 .
in the fall of 2008 , before derakhshan returned to iran , he asked his friends to not take a public stance if he was arrested .
derakhshan had returned to iran in late 2008 , apparently having secured a job offer at press tv , the country 's english-language news service , but was arrested two weeks after his arrival .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad himself asked for a swift resolution to the case .
arrested after two weeks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahmoud ahmadinejad called for a swift resolution to derakhshan 's case however , little is known about his current situation .
a brief statement made three months ago by tehran accuses him of insulting the prophet muhammad along with iran 's spiritual leader and president , as well as disseminating " anti-revolutionary propaganda " and spying for israel .
derakhshan 's mother told an expatriate iranian news website , kamtarin.com , that she has visited her son in prison .
his physical and mental conditions are worrisome .
canadian citizenship not accepted unlike other possible death penalty cases in iran , the customary wave of popular solidarity failed to materialize behind derakhshan , although there has been some attention online and in the canadian media .
even the mayor of paris , bertrand delanoe , rallied to his support in a statement on his website .
" in the name of paris , i solemnly call upon the judicial authorities of tehran to not condemn hossein derakhshan to death , " he wrote last week . " and i invite the mobilization of all of our energies to save this honorable , courageous and dignified life . "
but derakhshan 's political stance and relationship to ahmadinejad remains clouded .
iranian authorities have not accepted derakhshan efforts to invoke his rights as a canadian citizen .
" despite the iranian government ’ s position , we consider mr. derakhshan to be a canadian citizen , " wrote lisa monette , a spokesperson from the canadian department of foreign affairs and international trade , in a statement sent to deutsche welle .
" we will continue to press the iranian authorities for access , as we have in similar cases involving dual nationals in other jurisdictions .
canada continues to urge iran to fully respect all of its human rights obligations , both in law and in practice . "
iranian authorities have arrested numerous bloggers in recent years in a bid to clamp down on internet dissent .

he was sentenced to 19.5 years in jail . an iranian court has sentenced iranian-canadian blogger hossein derakhshan to 19.5 years in prison , according to iranian media .
the conservative website , mashreghnews.ir , which is close to iran 's presidential office , said derakhshan was convicted on charges of cooperation with hostile countries , spreading propaganda against the ruling establishment , promotion of counterrevolutionary groups and insulting islamic thoughts and religious figures .
verdict can be appealed he was also given a five years ' ban from membership in political parties and activities in the media , and was sentenced to returning received funds in the amount of 30,750 euros , $ 2,900 , and 200 british pounds .
derakhshan can appeal , the report added .
before the verdict , immediate family members as well as reporters without borders had feared hossein derakhshan may be threatened with death penalty .
the iranian blogging pioneer has been held in a tehran prison for nearly two years and has been given little , if any , access to legal representation and no consular access to canadian authorities .

a blogging leader ten years ago , hossein derakhshan moved from iran to canada to study .
that 's where he met his wife , who is also from iran , and became a canadian citizen .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern germany -pipe- 28.09.2010 east german scientists faced opportunities and disappointment during reunification großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leibniz institute for plant biochemistry was one of east germany 's premiere scientific laboratories as in other fields , east german science struggled to find its place in a unified germany .
for some it was easier than others , as older faculty were often forced out , and younger faculty found opportunities in the west . while the rest of the country was trying to figure how to integrate two governments , two currencies and two of nearly everything else , the sciences were no different .
after unification , the west german government advisory body , the council of science and humanities was tasked with evaluating east german research facilities , according to karl ulrich mayer , a west german sociologist at yale university in the united states .
" a whole number of institutes were closed down , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle , nearly two decades after the official reunification date of october 3 , 1990 .
" -lsb- mainly -rsb- because it was assumed that they were too much of the party line , " he added .
mayer is now also president of the leibniz association , which comprises of 86 research institutions across germany , including many in the former east germany , like the leibniz institute for plant biochemistry outside of leipzig . he added that the hard sciences too , were not immune to cuts and layoffs . "
in jena there was a big academy of science institutes in the area of penicillin research , that was reduced to about 550 people from 1,000 , " said mayer , " and these 550 people were then distributed among two leibniz institutes and a few university institutes . "
while some east german institutes were absorbed into existing west german facilities , the max planck society refused to do this , which gave them the opportunity to found new research institutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1964 , this was the office of the famed east german biochemist karl mothes , the ipb 's first director publication restrictions for east german research the german democratic republic , or gdr as it was known in english , focused on other hard sciences , including chemistry , biotechnology and nuclear science .
the gdr received reactor technology from the soviet union .
while research studies from the hard sciences had the chance to be published in western journals , it was much tougher for the social sciences and humanities , according to dieter hoffman , a fellow at the max planck institute for the history of science in berlin .
before the wall came down , hoffmann worked at the east german academy of sciences in the institute for theory and the history of science . "
it was not possible for me for instance , to publish in western journals , " said hoffmann , " and also i could not go to west to visit colleagues or conferences and to present there my scientific research . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people who worked at the ipb during the east german period lost their jobs or were forced to retire scientists who did n't toe the party line , or who were suspected of criticizing the regime quickly found their work censored or not published at all .
still , there were some instances that proved to be beneficial for young scientists under the gdr .
hildegard maria nickel worked as a sociologist at the academy of educational sciences in east germany .
she says now that she would never have had the opportunity to become a professor if she had n't grown up in east germany because of her background .
born to working class parents , nickel 's father was a migrant and she was one of eight children .
in the gdr , women were given the same opportunities as men to work and study .
despite such advances , nickel found herself increasingly disillusioned with a system that censored findings it did n't want to hear .
" i think we did really good research on the youth in gdr and we could see how they feel in the end of the 70s , 80s , that they want to leave the gdr , " said nickel , " but nobody wanted to know it and we could n't publish it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before the wall came down , dieter hoffmann worked at the east german academy of sciences in the institute for theory and the history of science .
unification brought new opportunities when the wall came down , nickel and hoffmann were able to find jobs in a unified germany , easily travel and freely publish .
but many older faculty , found themselves demoted or pushed out . "
some people went to an early retirement .
some people could start a new scientific career or continue their career in a new location or institute and some people became unemployed , " said hoffman .
one of the prime examples of scientists finding a new career under a unified germany was , of course angela merkel , germany 's current chancellor .
before she entered politics , merkel studied , worked and eventually earned her doctorate in quantum chemistry in east berlin .
while integrating east and west german science research centres was a difficult process for many , hoffmann added that in a unified germany today there are plenty of exciting areas of research .
after all , he observed , the city of jena is a world leader in optics and home to companies like carl zeiss , schott and jenoptik .
dresden specializes in material sciences , and freiberg in saxony is known for solar power manufacturing . "
i think what you find now on the landscape -lsb- is -rsb- very often amazing , " he said . " for instance here in berlin , this institute for laser physics - max-born institute - that 's one of the worldwide leading institutes in this field . "

a public spat between the two men became the writing on the wall for luzhkov . the kremlin 's website said on tuesday that russian president dmitry medvedev had signed a decree firing moscow mayor yury luzkhov after 18 years on the job .
the sacking comes after months of minor scandals and open mudslinging from both men .
the kremlin said the 74-year-old luzkhov was " dismissed from the position of moscow mayor because he has lost the confidence of the russian president . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow boomed under luzhkov , but major problems remained luzkhov was first appointed in 1992 by boris yeltsin in the wake of the collapse of the soviet union .
he oversaw the transformation of the russian capital from a gray , sleepy city into a glitzy and gleaming economic powerhouse , funneling petrodollars into massive construction projects .
he had long faced allegations of corruption over the business activities of his wife , construction billionaire yelena baturina , and had been accused by preservationists of destroying important historic buildings in the city center .
but a summer of missteps finally cost him his job .
a tough summer the construction boom has left the city with some of the world 's worst traffic and an overextended power grid .
luzhkov was criticized this july when repairs on the main highway leading to the city 's international airport led to lengthy delays .
he struck back over medvedev 's decision to suspend the construction of a highway through a forest outside the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : residents suffered through the smoke without their mayor in august he lost more points with muscovites when he continued his vacation in austria as forest and peat-bog fires filled the city with acrid smoke for weeks .
the kremlin publicly criticized his decision to stay away .
after his initial appointment , luzhkov was reelected in 1996 , 1999 and 2003 .
he was appointed for another four-year term by then-president vladimir putin after elections for regional governors and mayors of the country 's biggest cities were scrapped .
now luzhkov has become a victim of the kremlin 's shakeup of regional leaders .
diminishing popularity luzhkov was known for his bellicose manner and his flat , working man 's caps .
his socially conservative rhetoric targeted gay pride parades , which his police regularly broke up .
he riled progressives further when he allowed billboards with stalin 's image to be used in anniversary celebrations of the world war ii victory this last may .
his popularity had dropped with just 36 percent of respondents to a september opinion poll by the independent levada center saying he was doing a good job .
that was down from 40 percent in july and 65 percent in 2001 .
luzhkov said on television on monday that we would not step down voluntarily .
that was not necessary in the end , and he has now been replaced by his deputy , vladimir resin .

can you put a figure to what a single bee yields in its lifetime ?
what ’ s the actual value of the role played by mangroves in protecting coastlines and marine life ?
questions like these have never really been asked until now , with nature ’ s services taken largely for granted and therefore never precisely quantified .
but it 's a way of thinking that 's been gathering pace ever since the group of eight industrialized nations commissioned a report in 2007 from the united nations environment program .
the aim was to draw attention to the global benefits of biodiversity , and to the social and economic costs of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation .
the precursor to the teeb study -lrb- the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity -rrb- was the stern review compiled by british economist nicholas stern , chair of the grantham research institute on climate change and the environment at the london school of economics .
this 2006 report was one of the first in-depth studies of the effects of global warming on the world economy .
" with teeb , we want to spell out how much natural capital is worth , " said christoph schroeter-schlaack from the helmholtz center for environmental research -lrb- ufz -rrb- in leipzig , who worked on the study .
" we also want to ensure that the financial value of the environment is taken into greater consideration during the process of political and economic decision-making . "
funds to save forests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harvesting rubber does n't have to damage the environment but still brings farmers a good yield the final teeb synthesis report will be released in october at the 10th conference of parties to the convention of biological diversity meeting in nagoya , japan .
then , in december , environmental economics will be topping the agenda at the un climate summit in cancún , when experts will be calling for sustainable management of forest resources to be integrated into international climate agreements .
environment ministers will also be discussing a forest protection fund which would award subsidies to developing nations that protect their forests instead of selling them off to clear land that can then be used for agriculture , for example .
a number of south american countries will be bringing their own ideas to the table , including brazil , ecuador , guyana and costa rica , which is currently playing a pioneering role in terms of forest protection .
enormous value bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mangroves serve as natural dykes clearly , it has grasped the significance of forest economics . forests have a huge financial value .
as the teeb study shows , deforestation costs the world between $ 2 and 5 trillion worth of natural capital a year – whereas it would cost a mere $ 60 billion to conserve threatened forests .
the smaller the eco-system , the more precise the studies .
according to the ufz , one hectare of wood in the middle of the southwestern city of freiburg is worth almost 13,000 euros across a period of 100 years .
it acts as an air and water filter , a carbon sink , a supplier of timber and an employer for lumberjacks and a service provider for locals who come here in their leisure time – and save money , since these services are free .
factors contributing to the studies include the role played by biodiversity in boosting the efficiency of an eco-system .
estuaries and mangroves are especially valuable types of landscape because flood protection and fishing opportunities are just some of the services they provide .
in vietnam , planting and protecting nearly 12,000 hectares of mangroves cost $ 1.1 million but saved annual expenditures on dyke maintenance of $ 7.3 million .
investment in dyke building is absorbed into vietnam ’ s gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , but the economic contribution of the mangroves is never quantified .
in fact , their very destruction is seen as boosting gdp – much to the dismay of environmental economists .
a new mindset bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say illegal fishing is destroying valuable coral reefs they are keen to promote the idea of environmental indicators of growth and a new mindset : us ecological economist robert costanza has proposed that businesses pay into a precautionary fund when embarking on high-risk ventures , and can claim their payment back only if the project proves to cause little or no environmental damage .
bp would have had to pay up over 25 percent of the entire value of the company before it began drilling for oil in the gulf of mexico , constanza said .
" what would have happened then ? " he asks .
" either it would ’ ve decided not to drill , or it would have looked into ways to reduce the risk and increased its investments in safe technology . "
the recent oil disaster in the us is a perfect illustration of how quickly precautionary environmental protection can pay off .
the global fishing industry would also stand to profit .
a detailed study has yet to be carried out , but the world bank estimates that the fishing industry loses an annual $ 50 billion because of smaller catches despite rising expenditure on ships and equipment .
stephan lutter is an expert on fishing with the world wildlife fund , and stressed that the costs incurred by the destruction of valuable coral reefs by trawl nets , by-catches and illegal fishing have yet to be calculated .
" the fishing frenzy means that right now , everyone is a loser , " he said .
a rethink is long overdue .
studies such as teeb can help bring it about – and unlike the value of nature ’ s services , their message can be quantified .
ultimately , the economics of nature are based on a 1:100 ratio : nature pays back an average 100 euros for every euro invested in environmental protection – with services whose value has been overlooked for too long .

can you put a figure to what a single bee yields in its lifetime ?
what ’ s the actual value of the role played by mangroves in protecting coastlines and marine life ?
questions like these have never really been asked until now , with nature ’ s services taken largely for granted and therefore never precisely quantified .
but it 's a way of thinking that 's been gathering pace ever since the group of eight industrialized nations commissioned a report in 2007 from the united nations environment program .
the aim was to draw attention to the global benefits of biodiversity , and to the social and economic costs of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation .
the precursor to the teeb study -lrb- the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity -rrb- was the stern review compiled by british economist nicholas stern , chair of the grantham research institute on climate change and the environment at the london school of economics .
this 2006 report was one of the first in-depth studies of the effects of global warming on the world economy .
" with teeb , we want to spell out how much natural capital is worth , " said christoph schroeter-schlaack from the helmholtz center for environmental research -lrb- ufz -rrb- in leipzig , who worked on the study .
" we also want to ensure that the financial value of the environment is taken into greater consideration during the process of political and economic decision-making . "
funds to save forests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harvesting rubber does n't have to damage the environment but still brings farmers a good yield the final teeb synthesis report will be released in october at the 10th conference of parties to the convention of biological diversity meeting in nagoya , japan .
then , in december , environmental economics will be topping the agenda at the un climate summit in cancún , when experts will be calling for sustainable management of forest resources to be integrated into international climate agreements .
environment ministers will also be discussing a forest protection fund which would award subsidies to developing nations that protect their forests instead of selling them off to clear land that can then be used for agriculture , for example .
a number of south american countries will be bringing their own ideas to the table , including brazil , ecuador , guyana and costa rica , which is currently playing a pioneering role in terms of forest protection .
enormous value bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mangroves serve as natural dykes clearly , it has grasped the significance of forest economics . forests have a huge financial value .
as the teeb study shows , deforestation costs the world between $ 2 and 5 trillion worth of natural capital a year – whereas it would cost a mere $ 60 billion to conserve threatened forests .
the smaller the eco-system , the more precise the studies .
according to the ufz , one hectare of wood in the middle of the southwestern city of freiburg is worth almost 13,000 euros across a period of 100 years .
it acts as an air and water filter , a carbon sink , a supplier of timber and an employer for lumberjacks and a service provider for locals who come here in their leisure time – and save money , since these services are free .
factors contributing to the studies include the role played by biodiversity in boosting the efficiency of an eco-system .
estuaries and mangroves are especially valuable types of landscape because flood protection and fishing opportunities are just some of the services they provide .
in vietnam , planting and protecting nearly 12,000 hectares of mangroves cost $ 1.1 million but saved annual expenditures on dyke maintenance of $ 7.3 million .
investment in dyke building is absorbed into vietnam ’ s gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , but the economic contribution of the mangroves is never quantified .
in fact , their very destruction is seen as boosting gdp – much to the dismay of environmental economists .
a new mindset bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say illegal fishing is destroying valuable coral reefs they are keen to promote the idea of environmental indicators of growth and a new mindset : us ecological economist robert costanza has proposed that businesses pay into a precautionary fund when embarking on high-risk ventures , and can claim their payment back only if the project proves to cause little or no environmental damage .
bp would have had to pay up over 25 percent of the entire value of the company before it began drilling for oil in the gulf of mexico , constanza said .
" what would have happened then ? " he asks .
" either it would ’ ve decided not to drill , or it would have looked into ways to reduce the risk and increased its investments in safe technology . "
the recent oil disaster in the us is a perfect illustration of how quickly precautionary environmental protection can pay off .
the global fishing industry would also stand to profit .
a detailed study has yet to be carried out , but the world bank estimates that the fishing industry loses an annual $ 50 billion because of smaller catches despite rising expenditure on ships and equipment .
stephan lutter is an expert on fishing with the world wildlife fund , and stressed that the costs incurred by the destruction of valuable coral reefs by trawl nets , by-catches and illegal fishing have yet to be calculated .
" the fishing frenzy means that right now , everyone is a loser , " he said .
a rethink is long overdue .
studies such as teeb can help bring it about – and unlike the value of nature ’ s services , their message can be quantified .
ultimately , the economics of nature are based on a 1:100 ratio : nature pays back an average 100 euros for every euro invested in environmental protection – with services whose value has been overlooked for too long .

factors contributing to the studies include the role played by biodiversity in boosting the efficiency of an eco-system .
estuaries and mangroves are especially valuable types of landscape because flood protection and fishing opportunities are just some of the services they provide .
in vietnam , planting and protecting nearly 12,000 hectares of mangroves cost $ 1.1 million but saved annual expenditures on dyke maintenance of $ 7.3 million .
investment in dyke building is absorbed into vietnam ’ s gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , but the economic contribution of the mangroves is never quantified .
in fact , their very destruction is seen as boosting gdp – much to the dismay of environmental economists .
a new mindset bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say illegal fishing is destroying valuable coral reefs they are keen to promote the idea of environmental indicators of growth and a new mindset : us ecological economist robert costanza has proposed that businesses pay into a precautionary fund when embarking on high-risk ventures , and can claim their payment back only if the project proves to cause little or no environmental damage .
bp would have had to pay up over 25 percent of the entire value of the company before it began drilling for oil in the gulf of mexico , constanza said .
" what would have happened then ? " he asks .
" either it would ’ ve decided not to drill , or it would have looked into ways to reduce the risk and increased its investments in safe technology . "
the recent oil disaster in the us is a perfect illustration of how quickly precautionary environmental protection can pay off .
the global fishing industry would also stand to profit .
a detailed study has yet to be carried out , but the world bank estimates that the fishing industry loses an annual $ 50 billion because of smaller catches despite rising expenditure on ships and equipment .
stephan lutter is an expert on fishing with the world wildlife fund , and stressed that the costs incurred by the destruction of valuable coral reefs by trawl nets , by-catches and illegal fishing have yet to be calculated .

a rethink is long overdue .
studies such as teeb can help bring it about – and unlike the value of nature ’ s services , their message can be quantified .

can you put a figure to what a single bee yields in its lifetime ?
what ’ s the actual value of the role played by mangroves in protecting coastlines and marine life ?
questions like these have never really been asked until now , with nature ’ s services taken largely for granted and therefore never precisely quantified .
but it 's a way of thinking that 's been gathering pace ever since the group of eight industrialized nations commissioned a report in 2007 from the united nations environment program .
the aim was to draw attention to the global benefits of biodiversity , and to the social and economic costs of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation .
the precursor to the teeb study -lrb- the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity -rrb- was the stern review compiled by british economist nicholas stern , chair of the grantham research institute on climate change and the environment at the london school of economics .
this 2006 report was one of the first in-depth studies of the effects of global warming on the world economy .
" with teeb , we want to spell out how much natural capital is worth , " said christoph schroeter-schlaack from the helmholtz center for environmental research -lrb- ufz -rrb- in leipzig , who worked on the study .
" we also want to ensure that the financial value of the environment is taken into greater consideration during the process of political and economic decision-making . "

then , in december , environmental economics will be topping the agenda at the un climate summit in cancún , when experts will be calling for sustainable management of forest resources to be integrated into international climate agreements .
environment ministers will also be discussing a forest protection fund which would award subsidies to developing nations that protect their forests instead of selling them off to clear land that can then be used for agriculture , for example .
a number of south american countries will be bringing their own ideas to the table , including brazil , ecuador , guyana and costa rica , which is currently playing a pioneering role in terms of forest protection .

as the teeb study shows , deforestation costs the world between $ 2 and 5 trillion worth of natural capital a year – whereas it would cost a mere $ 60 billion to conserve threatened forests .

can you put a figure to what a single bee yields in its lifetime ?
what ’ s the actual value of the role played by mangroves in protecting coastlines and marine life ?
questions like these have never really been asked until now , with nature ’ s services taken largely for granted and therefore never precisely quantified .
but it 's a way of thinking that 's been gathering pace ever since the group of eight industrialized nations commissioned a report in 2007 from the united nations environment program .
the aim was to draw attention to the global benefits of biodiversity , and to the social and economic costs of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation .
the precursor to the teeb study -lrb- the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity -rrb- was the stern review compiled by british economist nicholas stern , chair of the grantham research institute on climate change and the environment at the london school of economics .
this 2006 report was one of the first in-depth studies of the effects of global warming on the world economy .
" with teeb , we want to spell out how much natural capital is worth , " said christoph schroeter-schlaack from the helmholtz center for environmental research -lrb- ufz -rrb- in leipzig , who worked on the study .
" we also want to ensure that the financial value of the environment is taken into greater consideration during the process of political and economic decision-making . "
funds to save forests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harvesting rubber does n't have to damage the environment but still brings farmers a good yield the final teeb synthesis report will be released in october at the 10th conference of parties to the convention of biological diversity meeting in nagoya , japan .
then , in december , environmental economics will be topping the agenda at the un climate summit in cancún , when experts will be calling for sustainable management of forest resources to be integrated into international climate agreements .
environment ministers will also be discussing a forest protection fund which would award subsidies to developing nations that protect their forests instead of selling them off to clear land that can then be used for agriculture , for example .
a number of south american countries will be bringing their own ideas to the table , including brazil , ecuador , guyana and costa rica , which is currently playing a pioneering role in terms of forest protection .
enormous value bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mangroves serve as natural dykes clearly , it has grasped the significance of forest economics . forests have a huge financial value .
as the teeb study shows , deforestation costs the world between $ 2 and 5 trillion worth of natural capital a year – whereas it would cost a mere $ 60 billion to conserve threatened forests .
the smaller the eco-system , the more precise the studies .
according to the ufz , one hectare of wood in the middle of the southwestern city of freiburg is worth almost 13,000 euros across a period of 100 years .
it acts as an air and water filter , a carbon sink , a supplier of timber and an employer for lumberjacks and a service provider for locals who come here in their leisure time – and save money , since these services are free .
factors contributing to the studies include the role played by biodiversity in boosting the efficiency of an eco-system .
estuaries and mangroves are especially valuable types of landscape because flood protection and fishing opportunities are just some of the services they provide .
in vietnam , planting and protecting nearly 12,000 hectares of mangroves cost $ 1.1 million but saved annual expenditures on dyke maintenance of $ 7.3 million .
investment in dyke building is absorbed into vietnam ’ s gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , but the economic contribution of the mangroves is never quantified .
in fact , their very destruction is seen as boosting gdp – much to the dismay of environmental economists .
a new mindset bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say illegal fishing is destroying valuable coral reefs they are keen to promote the idea of environmental indicators of growth and a new mindset : us ecological economist robert costanza has proposed that businesses pay into a precautionary fund when embarking on high-risk ventures , and can claim their payment back only if the project proves to cause little or no environmental damage .
bp would have had to pay up over 25 percent of the entire value of the company before it began drilling for oil in the gulf of mexico , constanza said .
" what would have happened then ? " he asks .
" either it would ’ ve decided not to drill , or it would have looked into ways to reduce the risk and increased its investments in safe technology . "
the recent oil disaster in the us is a perfect illustration of how quickly precautionary environmental protection can pay off .
the global fishing industry would also stand to profit .
a detailed study has yet to be carried out , but the world bank estimates that the fishing industry loses an annual $ 50 billion because of smaller catches despite rising expenditure on ships and equipment .
stephan lutter is an expert on fishing with the world wildlife fund , and stressed that the costs incurred by the destruction of valuable coral reefs by trawl nets , by-catches and illegal fishing have yet to be calculated .
" the fishing frenzy means that right now , everyone is a loser , " he said .
a rethink is long overdue .
studies such as teeb can help bring it about – and unlike the value of nature ’ s services , their message can be quantified .
ultimately , the economics of nature are based on a 1:100 ratio : nature pays back an average 100 euros for every euro invested in environmental protection – with services whose value has been overlooked for too long .

he talked with dw about what might be his last record as a solo artist . it 's easy to see why phil collins is ready to call it quits on solo work .
after eight grammy awards , an oscar for " best original song , " a golden globe , 100 million albums sold -lrb- 250 million counting his work with rock band genesis -rrb- , there 's just not much ground left for the drummer-turned-singer to cover . collins has also made a name for himself as a soundtrack composer , producer and big band leader . featuring cover versions of 1960 ’ s motown songs , " going back " is phil collins ' eighth studio album .
deutsche welle spoke with collins about what could well be his last solo record . click on the link below to listen to dw-radio ’ s hits in germany , featuring phil collins . deutsche welle : although you had previously announced the end of your solo career , you recently released " going back , " an album of motown cover versions .
what 's the story ?
phil collins : i 'm not sure i like what phil collins became , so i 've kind of written myself out of the story .
like if i was the writer of a book , i 've just written the main character out .
he suddenly died mysteriously and now the police are trying to find the murderer !
i 'm very proud of everything i 've done , but i do n't think i 'm ready to launch myself back into it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : collins ' cd " going back " was number two in the german charts after its release this record is something i ’ ve always wanted to do .
to me it 's almost like not part of phil collins ' career .
phil collins ' career is over .
this is something i needed to do and always wanted to do , which is to sing some of my favorite songs that i grew up with in the 60 's .
so this is a special case . so did recording it feel like taking a trip down memory lane ? there was one group called the action who played all these songs on the record .
the record is pretty much their set list .
i used to go and see them every time they played -lsb- in the london club -rsb- the marquee .
i 'd go out the next day and buy the originals .
they did versions of all those songs .
that turned me on to the original versions .
that 's why i paid them a lot of respect in the sleeve notes .
in fact , the drummer was my biggest hero , and he 's now one of my best friends .
so , i picture it very well - standing there and listening to this music being played live and what effect it had on my life . in terms of being near the end of a career - deliberately - it was a perfect circle . this music is what i started off listening to , and this is where i am now , doing the same thing .
it 's a beautiful journey . are you truly convinced that your solo career is over ?
i will always write music .
because of the way i write - in my little studio on my own at home - i will always make the demos , which are like painting the pictures .
i love doing that .
i 'm just not sure that i would necessarily say to a record company , " here 's my new record .
let 's put it out . " that lights a fuse that means you have to do a lot of other things . but it 's not because i feel old .
i mean , i am 59 , but it 's not anything to do with that or feeling tired .
i just feel like i want to be in control of my own life and help bring my kids up .
plus , i have other interests that i 'm very excited about . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the singer sees texas history and the lore of the american west in his future such as ?
i know it sounds boring or strange to fans , but i 've had this lifelong fascination with texas history , mainly because of davy crockett and the disney films in the early 50 's and then john wayne 's film " the alamo . "
i started to collect letters and documents , cannonballs , rifles , knives and swords from that whole period .
i 've also just co-authored a book on the subject .
it will be out in a year .
so , i can see myself getting more involved in that as a hobby . you 've been suffering from a painful spinal injury in recent years .
how are you now ?
mentally , i 'm okay .
i 've just got a few physical problems that i 'm trying to win over .
i have a problem with my arm .

can you put a figure to what a single bee yields in its lifetime ?
what ’ s the actual value of the role played by mangroves in protecting coastlines and marine life ?
questions like these have never really been asked until now , with nature ’ s services taken largely for granted and therefore never precisely quantified .
but it 's a way of thinking that 's been gathering pace ever since the group of eight industrialized nations commissioned a report in 2007 from the united nations environment program .
the aim was to draw attention to the global benefits of biodiversity , and to the social and economic costs of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation .
the precursor to the teeb study -lrb- the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity -rrb- was the stern review compiled by british economist nicholas stern , chair of the grantham research institute on climate change and the environment at the london school of economics .
this 2006 report was one of the first in-depth studies of the effects of global warming on the world economy .
" with teeb , we want to spell out how much natural capital is worth , " said christoph schroeter-schlaack from the helmholtz center for environmental research -lrb- ufz -rrb- in leipzig , who worked on the study .
" we also want to ensure that the financial value of the environment is taken into greater consideration during the process of political and economic decision-making . "
funds to save forests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harvesting rubber does n't have to damage the environment but still brings farmers a good yield the final teeb synthesis report will be released in october at the 10th conference of parties to the convention of biological diversity meeting in nagoya , japan .
then , in december , environmental economics will be topping the agenda at the un climate summit in cancún , when experts will be calling for sustainable management of forest resources to be integrated into international climate agreements .
environment ministers will also be discussing a forest protection fund which would award subsidies to developing nations that protect their forests instead of selling them off to clear land that can then be used for agriculture , for example .
a number of south american countries will be bringing their own ideas to the table , including brazil , ecuador , guyana and costa rica , which is currently playing a pioneering role in terms of forest protection .
enormous value bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mangroves serve as natural dykes clearly , it has grasped the significance of forest economics . forests have a huge financial value .
as the teeb study shows , deforestation costs the world between $ 2 and 5 trillion worth of natural capital a year – whereas it would cost a mere $ 60 billion to conserve threatened forests .
the smaller the eco-system , the more precise the studies .
according to the ufz , one hectare of wood in the middle of the southwestern city of freiburg is worth almost 13,000 euros across a period of 100 years .
it acts as an air and water filter , a carbon sink , a supplier of timber and an employer for lumberjacks and a service provider for locals who come here in their leisure time – and save money , since these services are free .
factors contributing to the studies include the role played by biodiversity in boosting the efficiency of an eco-system .
estuaries and mangroves are especially valuable types of landscape because flood protection and fishing opportunities are just some of the services they provide .
in vietnam , planting and protecting nearly 12,000 hectares of mangroves cost $ 1.1 million but saved annual expenditures on dyke maintenance of $ 7.3 million .
investment in dyke building is absorbed into vietnam ’ s gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , but the economic contribution of the mangroves is never quantified .
in fact , their very destruction is seen as boosting gdp – much to the dismay of environmental economists .
a new mindset bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say illegal fishing is destroying valuable coral reefs they are keen to promote the idea of environmental indicators of growth and a new mindset : us ecological economist robert costanza has proposed that businesses pay into a precautionary fund when embarking on high-risk ventures , and can claim their payment back only if the project proves to cause little or no environmental damage .
bp would have had to pay up over 25 percent of the entire value of the company before it began drilling for oil in the gulf of mexico , constanza said .
" what would have happened then ? " he asks .
" either it would ’ ve decided not to drill , or it would have looked into ways to reduce the risk and increased its investments in safe technology . "
the recent oil disaster in the us is a perfect illustration of how quickly precautionary environmental protection can pay off .
the global fishing industry would also stand to profit .
a detailed study has yet to be carried out , but the world bank estimates that the fishing industry loses an annual $ 50 billion because of smaller catches despite rising expenditure on ships and equipment .
stephan lutter is an expert on fishing with the world wildlife fund , and stressed that the costs incurred by the destruction of valuable coral reefs by trawl nets , by-catches and illegal fishing have yet to be calculated .
" the fishing frenzy means that right now , everyone is a loser , " he said .
a rethink is long overdue .
studies such as teeb can help bring it about – and unlike the value of nature ’ s services , their message can be quantified .
ultimately , the economics of nature are based on a 1:100 ratio : nature pays back an average 100 euros for every euro invested in environmental protection – with services whose value has been overlooked for too long .

as the teeb study shows , deforestation costs the world between $ 2 and 5 trillion worth of natural capital a year – whereas it would cost a mere $ 60 billion to conserve threatened forests .
the smaller the eco-system , the more precise the studies .
according to the ufz , one hectare of wood in the middle of the southwestern city of freiburg is worth almost 13,000 euros across a period of 100 years .
it acts as an air and water filter , a carbon sink , a supplier of timber and an employer for lumberjacks and a service provider for locals who come here in their leisure time – and save money , since these services are free .
factors contributing to the studies include the role played by biodiversity in boosting the efficiency of an eco-system .
estuaries and mangroves are especially valuable types of landscape because flood protection and fishing opportunities are just some of the services they provide .
in vietnam , planting and protecting nearly 12,000 hectares of mangroves cost $ 1.1 million but saved annual expenditures on dyke maintenance of $ 7.3 million .
investment in dyke building is absorbed into vietnam ’ s gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , but the economic contribution of the mangroves is never quantified .
in fact , their very destruction is seen as boosting gdp – much to the dismay of environmental economists .
a new mindset bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say illegal fishing is destroying valuable coral reefs they are keen to promote the idea of environmental indicators of growth and a new mindset : us ecological economist robert costanza has proposed that businesses pay into a precautionary fund when embarking on high-risk ventures , and can claim their payment back only if the project proves to cause little or no environmental damage .
bp would have had to pay up over 25 percent of the entire value of the company before it began drilling for oil in the gulf of mexico , constanza said .
" what would have happened then ? " he asks .
" either it would ’ ve decided not to drill , or it would have looked into ways to reduce the risk and increased its investments in safe technology . "
the recent oil disaster in the us is a perfect illustration of how quickly precautionary environmental protection can pay off .
the global fishing industry would also stand to profit .
a detailed study has yet to be carried out , but the world bank estimates that the fishing industry loses an annual $ 50 billion because of smaller catches despite rising expenditure on ships and equipment .
stephan lutter is an expert on fishing with the world wildlife fund , and stressed that the costs incurred by the destruction of valuable coral reefs by trawl nets , by-catches and illegal fishing have yet to be calculated .
" the fishing frenzy means that right now , everyone is a loser , " he said .
a rethink is long overdue .
studies such as teeb can help bring it about – and unlike the value of nature ’ s services , their message can be quantified .

he talked with dw about what might be his last record as a solo artist . it 's easy to see why phil collins is ready to call it quits on solo work .
after eight grammy awards , an oscar for " best original song , " a golden globe , 100 million albums sold -lrb- 250 million counting his work with rock band genesis -rrb- , there 's just not much ground left for the drummer-turned-singer to cover . collins has also made a name for himself as a soundtrack composer , producer and big band leader . featuring cover versions of 1960 ’ s motown songs , " going back " is phil collins ' eighth studio album .
deutsche welle spoke with collins about what could well be his last solo record . click on the link below to listen to dw-radio ’ s hits in germany , featuring phil collins . deutsche welle : although you had previously announced the end of your solo career , you recently released " going back , " an album of motown cover versions .
what 's the story ?
phil collins : i 'm not sure i like what phil collins became , so i 've kind of written myself out of the story .
like if i was the writer of a book , i 've just written the main character out .
he suddenly died mysteriously and now the police are trying to find the murderer !
i 'm very proud of everything i 've done , but i do n't think i 'm ready to launch myself back into it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : collins ' cd " going back " was number two in the german charts after its release this record is something i ’ ve always wanted to do .
to me it 's almost like not part of phil collins ' career .
phil collins ' career is over .
this is something i needed to do and always wanted to do , which is to sing some of my favorite songs that i grew up with in the 60 's .
so this is a special case . so did recording it feel like taking a trip down memory lane ? there was one group called the action who played all these songs on the record .
the record is pretty much their set list .
i used to go and see them every time they played -lsb- in the london club -rsb- the marquee .
i 'd go out the next day and buy the originals .
they did versions of all those songs .
that turned me on to the original versions .
that 's why i paid them a lot of respect in the sleeve notes .
in fact , the drummer was my biggest hero , and he 's now one of my best friends .
so , i picture it very well - standing there and listening to this music being played live and what effect it had on my life . in terms of being near the end of a career - deliberately - it was a perfect circle . this music is what i started off listening to , and this is where i am now , doing the same thing .
it 's a beautiful journey . are you truly convinced that your solo career is over ?
i will always write music .
because of the way i write - in my little studio on my own at home - i will always make the demos , which are like painting the pictures .
i love doing that .
i 'm just not sure that i would necessarily say to a record company , " here 's my new record .
let 's put it out . " that lights a fuse that means you have to do a lot of other things . but it 's not because i feel old .
i mean , i am 59 , but it 's not anything to do with that or feeling tired .
i just feel like i want to be in control of my own life and help bring my kids up .
plus , i have other interests that i 'm very excited about . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the singer sees texas history and the lore of the american west in his future such as ?
i know it sounds boring or strange to fans , but i 've had this lifelong fascination with texas history , mainly because of davy crockett and the disney films in the early 50 's and then john wayne 's film " the alamo . "
i started to collect letters and documents , cannonballs , rifles , knives and swords from that whole period .
i 've also just co-authored a book on the subject .
it will be out in a year .
so , i can see myself getting more involved in that as a hobby . you 've been suffering from a painful spinal injury in recent years .
how are you now ?
mentally , i 'm okay .
i 've just got a few physical problems that i 'm trying to win over .
i have a problem with my arm .

can you put a figure to what a single bee yields in its lifetime ?
what ’ s the actual value of the role played by mangroves in protecting coastlines and marine life ?
questions like these have never really been asked until now , with nature ’ s services taken largely for granted and therefore never precisely quantified .
but it 's a way of thinking that 's been gathering pace ever since the group of eight industrialized nations commissioned a report in 2007 from the united nations environment program .
the aim was to draw attention to the global benefits of biodiversity , and to the social and economic costs of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation .
the precursor to the teeb study -lrb- the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity -rrb- was the stern review compiled by british economist nicholas stern , chair of the grantham research institute on climate change and the environment at the london school of economics .
this 2006 report was one of the first in-depth studies of the effects of global warming on the world economy .
" with teeb , we want to spell out how much natural capital is worth , " said christoph schroeter-schlaack from the helmholtz center for environmental research -lrb- ufz -rrb- in leipzig , who worked on the study .
" we also want to ensure that the financial value of the environment is taken into greater consideration during the process of political and economic decision-making . "
funds to save forests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harvesting rubber does n't have to damage the environment but still brings farmers a good yield the final teeb synthesis report will be released in october at the 10th conference of parties to the convention of biological diversity meeting in nagoya , japan .
then , in december , environmental economics will be topping the agenda at the un climate summit in cancún , when experts will be calling for sustainable management of forest resources to be integrated into international climate agreements .
environment ministers will also be discussing a forest protection fund which would award subsidies to developing nations that protect their forests instead of selling them off to clear land that can then be used for agriculture , for example .
a number of south american countries will be bringing their own ideas to the table , including brazil , ecuador , guyana and costa rica , which is currently playing a pioneering role in terms of forest protection .
enormous value bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mangroves serve as natural dykes clearly , it has grasped the significance of forest economics . forests have a huge financial value .
as the teeb study shows , deforestation costs the world between $ 2 and 5 trillion worth of natural capital a year – whereas it would cost a mere $ 60 billion to conserve threatened forests .
the smaller the eco-system , the more precise the studies .
according to the ufz , one hectare of wood in the middle of the southwestern city of freiburg is worth almost 13,000 euros across a period of 100 years .
it acts as an air and water filter , a carbon sink , a supplier of timber and an employer for lumberjacks and a service provider for locals who come here in their leisure time – and save money , since these services are free .
factors contributing to the studies include the role played by biodiversity in boosting the efficiency of an eco-system .
estuaries and mangroves are especially valuable types of landscape because flood protection and fishing opportunities are just some of the services they provide .
in vietnam , planting and protecting nearly 12,000 hectares of mangroves cost $ 1.1 million but saved annual expenditures on dyke maintenance of $ 7.3 million .
investment in dyke building is absorbed into vietnam ’ s gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , but the economic contribution of the mangroves is never quantified .
in fact , their very destruction is seen as boosting gdp – much to the dismay of environmental economists .
a new mindset bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say illegal fishing is destroying valuable coral reefs they are keen to promote the idea of environmental indicators of growth and a new mindset : us ecological economist robert costanza has proposed that businesses pay into a precautionary fund when embarking on high-risk ventures , and can claim their payment back only if the project proves to cause little or no environmental damage .
bp would have had to pay up over 25 percent of the entire value of the company before it began drilling for oil in the gulf of mexico , constanza said .
" what would have happened then ? " he asks .
" either it would ’ ve decided not to drill , or it would have looked into ways to reduce the risk and increased its investments in safe technology . "
the recent oil disaster in the us is a perfect illustration of how quickly precautionary environmental protection can pay off .
the global fishing industry would also stand to profit .
a detailed study has yet to be carried out , but the world bank estimates that the fishing industry loses an annual $ 50 billion because of smaller catches despite rising expenditure on ships and equipment .
stephan lutter is an expert on fishing with the world wildlife fund , and stressed that the costs incurred by the destruction of valuable coral reefs by trawl nets , by-catches and illegal fishing have yet to be calculated .
" the fishing frenzy means that right now , everyone is a loser , " he said .
a rethink is long overdue .
studies such as teeb can help bring it about – and unlike the value of nature ’ s services , their message can be quantified .
ultimately , the economics of nature are based on a 1:100 ratio : nature pays back an average 100 euros for every euro invested in environmental protection – with services whose value has been overlooked for too long .

according to the ufz , one hectare of wood in the middle of the southwestern city of freiburg is worth almost 13,000 euros across a period of 100 years .
it acts as an air and water filter , a carbon sink , a supplier of timber and an employer for lumberjacks and a service provider for locals who come here in their leisure time – and save money , since these services are free .
factors contributing to the studies include the role played by biodiversity in boosting the efficiency of an eco-system .
estuaries and mangroves are especially valuable types of landscape because flood protection and fishing opportunities are just some of the services they provide .
in vietnam , planting and protecting nearly 12,000 hectares of mangroves cost $ 1.1 million but saved annual expenditures on dyke maintenance of $ 7.3 million .
investment in dyke building is absorbed into vietnam ’ s gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , but the economic contribution of the mangroves is never quantified .
in fact , their very destruction is seen as boosting gdp – much to the dismay of environmental economists .
a new mindset bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say illegal fishing is destroying valuable coral reefs they are keen to promote the idea of environmental indicators of growth and a new mindset : us ecological economist robert costanza has proposed that businesses pay into a precautionary fund when embarking on high-risk ventures , and can claim their payment back only if the project proves to cause little or no environmental damage .
bp would have had to pay up over 25 percent of the entire value of the company before it began drilling for oil in the gulf of mexico , constanza said .
" what would have happened then ? " he asks .
" either it would ’ ve decided not to drill , or it would have looked into ways to reduce the risk and increased its investments in safe technology . "
the recent oil disaster in the us is a perfect illustration of how quickly precautionary environmental protection can pay off .
the global fishing industry would also stand to profit .
a detailed study has yet to be carried out , but the world bank estimates that the fishing industry loses an annual $ 50 billion because of smaller catches despite rising expenditure on ships and equipment .
stephan lutter is an expert on fishing with the world wildlife fund , and stressed that the costs incurred by the destruction of valuable coral reefs by trawl nets , by-catches and illegal fishing have yet to be calculated .
" the fishing frenzy means that right now , everyone is a loser , " he said .
a rethink is long overdue .
studies such as teeb can help bring it about – and unlike the value of nature ’ s services , their message can be quantified .
ultimately , the economics of nature are based on a 1:100 ratio : nature pays back an average 100 euros for every euro invested in environmental protection – with services whose value has been overlooked for too long .

with just two wins this season bayern are ten points adrift of league newcomers mainz 05 , who beat louis van gaal 's side 2-1 last saturday .
schweinsteiger helped bayern keep their champions league 100 percent record with a goal in the 56th minute from the penalty spot and then tapped in the winner in the last minute of regular play to secure all three points for the visitors .
the bavarians now head group e. in their opening match two weeks ago bayern munich beat as roma in their opening group match .
bildunterschrift : basel 's swiss international alexander frei scores the opening goal early lead for basel swiss international alex frei put basel ahead in the 18th minute with their first real goal opportunity .
marco streller , a former stuttgart and cologne player , picked up from a mistake by bayern defender daniel van buyten and passed to frei who slotted the ball in the right-hand corner .
bayern had 65 percent of the ball possession in the first half but failed to use their goal chances .
in the 40th minute basel , who are trained by ex-bayern munich star thorsten fink , nearly made it 2-0 , but goalie joerg butt denied xherdan shaqiri the goal .
coach van gaal reacted by bringing on mario gomez to replace hamid altintop for the start of the second half .
world cup joint top scorer thomas mueller was then brought down in the penalty area by ex-frankfurt player benjamin huggel early in the second half .
bastian schweinsteiger made no mistake taking the penalty to level the score .
it looked as if bayern were settling for a single point even though butt was tested twice in the closing moments of the match by the swiss league leaders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern coach louis van gaal has extended his contract for another year taking the three points bayern then sealed the match when holger badstuber curled in a free-kick , leaving schweinsteiger with a simple tap in with just a minute remaining on the clock .
" it was important to take three points , we had a good a start to the champions league .
when basel took the lead , it was hard , " schweinsteiger said .
" it really hurts because we had a great chance .
i 'm disappointed because the team played well , " said basel coach fink .
" that was luck : they did it again on set pieces . "

in november 2008 , he returned to iran and was subsequently arrested .
he was sentenced to 19.5 years in jail . an iranian court has sentenced iranian-canadian blogger hossein derakhshan to 19.5 years in prison , according to iranian media .
the conservative website , mashreghnews.ir , which is close to iran 's presidential office , said derakhshan was convicted on charges of cooperation with hostile countries , spreading propaganda against the ruling establishment , promotion of counterrevolutionary groups and insulting islamic thoughts and religious figures .
verdict can be appealed he was also given a five years ' ban from membership in political parties and activities in the media , and was sentenced to returning received funds in the amount of 30,750 euros , $ 2,900 , and 200 british pounds .
derakhshan can appeal , the report added .
before the verdict , immediate family members as well as reporters without borders had feared hossein derakhshan may be threatened with death penalty .
the iranian blogging pioneer has been held in a tehran prison for nearly two years and has been given little , if any , access to legal representation and no consular access to canadian authorities .
in recent days , family members had said that the prosecutor was seeking the death penalty for derakhshan .
a blogging leader ten years ago , hossein derakhshan moved from iran to canada to study .
that 's where he met his wife , who is also from iran , and became a canadian citizen .
in 2001 , from his base in toronto , derakhshan penned an online guide teaching iranians how to blog in their own language and championed persian blogging from both inside and outside of his homeland .
dubbed by some as " the blogfather , " derakhshan was frequently interviewed by western media outlets about the nascent iranian blogging community and his blogs in both english and persian .
as he continued at the time , he also became an outspoken critic of iran 's religious leadership .
blogging from toronto , and later paris and london , under the pen name " hoder , " derakhshan criticized iran 's elite as being inflexible and unwilling to engage in reform , while attacking ayatollah khamenei directly in his writing .
in 2005 , he served as a jury member in deutsche welle 's best of the blogs awards .
the following year , he made a very public trip to israel , which is normally forbidden for iranian citizens .
" i 'm going to israel as a citizen journalist and a peace activist , ” he wrote on his english blog at the time .
" i 'm a citizen of canada and i have the right to visit any country i want . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : derakhshan defended iran 's nuclear program in the face of protests a change of views later that year , derakhshan suddenly switched his political perspective and became a staunch nationalist and defender of the islamic republic .
in 2006 , derakhshan wrote an opinion piece defending iran 's nuclear program in the washington post .
he also began to attack activists and former friends on his blogs and in other media .
later he told the guardian newspaper in vehement words that if the united states attacked iran , he would return and fight for his homeland .
after visiting israel , derakhshan moved to london to pursue graduate studies . that 's when he went from making oppositional statements to outright supporting the new president .
he went on rhetorical rampages against many who had previously been his friends and colleagues and later was even sued for libel in the united states in 2007 .
in the fall of 2008 , before derakhshan returned to iran , he asked his friends to not take a public stance if he was arrested .
derakhshan had returned to iran in late 2008 , apparently having secured a job offer at press tv , the country 's english-language news service , but was arrested two weeks after his arrival .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad himself asked for a swift resolution to the case .
arrested after two weeks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahmoud ahmadinejad called for a swift resolution to derakhshan 's case however , little is known about his current situation .
a brief statement made three months ago by tehran accuses him of insulting the prophet muhammad along with iran 's spiritual leader and president , as well as disseminating " anti-revolutionary propaganda " and spying for israel .
derakhshan 's mother told an expatriate iranian news website , kamtarin.com , that she has visited her son in prison .
his physical and mental conditions are worrisome .
canadian citizenship not accepted unlike other possible death penalty cases in iran , the customary wave of popular solidarity failed to materialize behind derakhshan , although there has been some attention online and in the canadian media .
even the mayor of paris , bertrand delanoe , rallied to his support in a statement on his website .
" in the name of paris , i solemnly call upon the judicial authorities of tehran to not condemn hossein derakhshan to death , " he wrote last week . " and i invite the mobilization of all of our energies to save this honorable , courageous and dignified life . "
but derakhshan 's political stance and relationship to ahmadinejad remains clouded .
iranian authorities have not accepted derakhshan efforts to invoke his rights as a canadian citizen .
" despite the iranian government ’ s position , we consider mr. derakhshan to be a canadian citizen , " wrote lisa monette , a spokesperson from the canadian department of foreign affairs and international trade , in a statement sent to deutsche welle .
" we will continue to press the iranian authorities for access , as we have in similar cases involving dual nationals in other jurisdictions .
canada continues to urge iran to fully respect all of its human rights obligations , both in law and in practice . "
iranian authorities have arrested numerous bloggers in recent years in a bid to clamp down on internet dissent .

in november 2008 , he returned to iran and was subsequently arrested .
he was sentenced to 19.5 years in jail . an iranian court has sentenced iranian-canadian blogger hossein derakhshan to 19.5 years in prison , according to iranian media .
the conservative website , mashreghnews.ir , which is close to iran 's presidential office , said derakhshan was convicted on charges of cooperation with hostile countries , spreading propaganda against the ruling establishment , promotion of counterrevolutionary groups and insulting islamic thoughts and religious figures .
verdict can be appealed he was also given a five years ' ban from membership in political parties and activities in the media , and was sentenced to returning received funds in the amount of 30,750 euros , $ 2,900 , and 200 british pounds .
derakhshan can appeal , the report added .
before the verdict , immediate family members as well as reporters without borders had feared hossein derakhshan may be threatened with death penalty .
the iranian blogging pioneer has been held in a tehran prison for nearly two years and has been given little , if any , access to legal representation and no consular access to canadian authorities .
in recent days , family members had said that the prosecutor was seeking the death penalty for derakhshan .
a blogging leader ten years ago , hossein derakhshan moved from iran to canada to study .
that 's where he met his wife , who is also from iran , and became a canadian citizen .
in 2001 , from his base in toronto , derakhshan penned an online guide teaching iranians how to blog in their own language and championed persian blogging from both inside and outside of his homeland .
dubbed by some as " the blogfather , " derakhshan was frequently interviewed by western media outlets about the nascent iranian blogging community and his blogs in both english and persian .
as he continued at the time , he also became an outspoken critic of iran 's religious leadership .
blogging from toronto , and later paris and london , under the pen name " hoder , " derakhshan criticized iran 's elite as being inflexible and unwilling to engage in reform , while attacking ayatollah khamenei directly in his writing .
in 2005 , he served as a jury member in deutsche welle 's best of the blogs awards .
the following year , he made a very public trip to israel , which is normally forbidden for iranian citizens .
" i 'm going to israel as a citizen journalist and a peace activist , ” he wrote on his english blog at the time .
" i 'm a citizen of canada and i have the right to visit any country i want . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : derakhshan defended iran 's nuclear program in the face of protests a change of views later that year , derakhshan suddenly switched his political perspective and became a staunch nationalist and defender of the islamic republic .
in 2006 , derakhshan wrote an opinion piece defending iran 's nuclear program in the washington post .
he also began to attack activists and former friends on his blogs and in other media .
later he told the guardian newspaper in vehement words that if the united states attacked iran , he would return and fight for his homeland .
after visiting israel , derakhshan moved to london to pursue graduate studies . that 's when he went from making oppositional statements to outright supporting the new president .
he went on rhetorical rampages against many who had previously been his friends and colleagues and later was even sued for libel in the united states in 2007 .
in the fall of 2008 , before derakhshan returned to iran , he asked his friends to not take a public stance if he was arrested .
derakhshan had returned to iran in late 2008 , apparently having secured a job offer at press tv , the country 's english-language news service , but was arrested two weeks after his arrival .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad himself asked for a swift resolution to the case .
arrested after two weeks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahmoud ahmadinejad called for a swift resolution to derakhshan 's case however , little is known about his current situation .
a brief statement made three months ago by tehran accuses him of insulting the prophet muhammad along with iran 's spiritual leader and president , as well as disseminating " anti-revolutionary propaganda " and spying for israel .
derakhshan 's mother told an expatriate iranian news website , kamtarin.com , that she has visited her son in prison .
his physical and mental conditions are worrisome .
canadian citizenship not accepted unlike other possible death penalty cases in iran , the customary wave of popular solidarity failed to materialize behind derakhshan , although there has been some attention online and in the canadian media .
even the mayor of paris , bertrand delanoe , rallied to his support in a statement on his website .
" in the name of paris , i solemnly call upon the judicial authorities of tehran to not condemn hossein derakhshan to death , " he wrote last week . " and i invite the mobilization of all of our energies to save this honorable , courageous and dignified life . "
but derakhshan 's political stance and relationship to ahmadinejad remains clouded .
iranian authorities have not accepted derakhshan efforts to invoke his rights as a canadian citizen .
" despite the iranian government ’ s position , we consider mr. derakhshan to be a canadian citizen , " wrote lisa monette , a spokesperson from the canadian department of foreign affairs and international trade , in a statement sent to deutsche welle .
" we will continue to press the iranian authorities for access , as we have in similar cases involving dual nationals in other jurisdictions .
canada continues to urge iran to fully respect all of its human rights obligations , both in law and in practice . "
iranian authorities have arrested numerous bloggers in recent years in a bid to clamp down on internet dissent .

and economists , among others , are happy : consumer spending has long been a weak point in the country 's economic performance . german consumer confidence continues to climb as the economy strengthens and unemployment falls , boosting income expectations , according to a survey .
the gfk market research institute said tuesday that its forward-looking consumer confidence index for october rose to 4.9 points , up from a revised 4.3 in september , representing a three-year high .
" the decisive factor in the strong sentiment among consumers is the extremely positive development of the employment market , " gfk said in a statement .
falling unemployment germany 's unemployment rate was 7.6 percent last month .
that was approximately the level at which it was when the us investment bank lehman brothers collapsed two years ago , fueling a global financial crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling unemployment is bolstering consumer confidence although the german economy is showing signs of slower growth in the second half of the year , the federal labor agency 's iab research institute expects unemployment to drop slightly below 3 million people in 2011 to a nine-year low .
low inflation gfk also pointed to the low level of inflation , currently at around 1 percent , as another factor increasing consumer purchasing power .
the market researcher added that consumers in germany are already experiencing an improved income situation ; according to new data from the federal statistical office , gross monthly income after living expenses increased by 2.3 percent in the second quarter . germany , europe 's biggest economy , has enjoyed strong export-led growth this year .
its massive 2.2 percent growth in the second quarter over the previous three-month period has helped the 16-nation eurozone outperform the us .

the move comes as no surprise for n koreans both above and below the 38th parallel . park gun ha knows a little something about the north korean worker ’ s party – he was once a member before defecting to south korea in 2005 and now belongs to an association of formerly high-ranking refugees . he told deutsche welle that even though most north koreans back home probably did not even kim jong-un ’ s name until tuesday , they will probably not be surprised that he is on his way to taking over from his father eventually . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : n korean leader kim jong-il reportedly has kidney problems however , park also pointed out that the question of who the next leader will be is not a top concern for most north koreans .
" north koreans lost hope when kim jong-il took over and the economy went bad , ” he explained .
" now they don ’ t really care about who the successor is .
they are much more concerned with how they will survive . " he said that the pyongyang regime would justify the eventual succession of kim jong-un by stressing his plans to reform the economy .
" that ’ s the only way the north korean people will support him . " government has created a flawless cv for kim jong-un park doubted that either kim jong-un or his aunt kim kyoung hee , who was also appointed as a general on tuesday , had any real experience in the north korean military . lee sae yul , the secretary general of the north korea liberation front , an organization in seoul made up of former north korean soldiers agreed .

opposition leaders say it ’ s a blow to the growing renewable energy sector . cabinet ministers in berlin on tuesday presented a new energy concept which they called exemplary and unmatched in the world , and which includes a controversial extension to germany 's nuclear power plants .
" the concept is not just a vision , " said environment minister norbert roettgen in berlin .
" by 2050 , about 80 percent of all energy consumed in this country will come from renewable sources , but on the way to this age we need nuclear power for an interim period to make this happen . "
under the new plan , the deadline to shut down germany 's nuclear power plants would be extended by an average of 12 years , with the last one running until 2036 .
merkel and her government say the extension is needed to keep germany running until renewable energy sources can supply the country with enough energy to replace what is produced by nuclear plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's cabinet insists the extension is necessary " a longer lifespan for nuclear power plants will help us keep energy prices affordable for both private consumers and industry , " said economics minister rainer bruederle .
" and it 'll be easier for us to reduce harmful gas emissions . "
effects on renewable energy that 's an argument that the opposition reject .
both sigmar gabriel , chairman of the spd , and juergen trittin , co-chairman of the greens , said the government 's plan would hurt the renewable energy industry with providers having to compete with nuclear energy to get a foothold in the market .
both trittin and gabriel are former environment ministers under previous coalition governments .
" with its energy plan , the government is about to block the creation of 300,000 new jobs in the renewables sector , " gabriel told german public broadcaster ard .
" many small and medium-sized firms involved in generating renewable energy are now being put under increasing pressure . "
the new plan also includes a tax on uranium fuel rods that bruederle said would generate 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- in government revenue annually .
a renewable energy fund would also be established that would collect 300 million euros from power companies each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without a majority in the bundesrat , merkel hopes to bypass the upper house constitutional court battle brewing the opposition is also displeased by suggestions from the government that the plan only needs the approval of the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , and not the bundesrat , the upper house , which represents the country 's 16 states .
merkel 's coalition of conservative christian democrats , their bavarian sister party , the christian social union and the liberal free democrats argues that the nuclear plant deadline is a federal issue , not a state matter .
the governing coalition lost its majority in the bundesrat in the state election in north rhine-westphalia in may .
it still has a majority in the bundestag .

a public spat between the two men became the writing on the wall for luzhkov . the kremlin 's website said on tuesday that russian president dmitry medvedev had signed a decree firing moscow mayor yury luzkhov after 18 years on the job .
the sacking comes after months of minor scandals and open mudslinging from both men .
the kremlin said the 74-year-old luzkhov was " dismissed from the position of moscow mayor because he has lost the confidence of the russian president . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow boomed under luzhkov , but major problems remained luzkhov was first appointed in 1992 by boris yeltsin in the wake of the collapse of the soviet union .
he oversaw the transformation of the russian capital from a gray , sleepy city into a glitzy and gleaming economic powerhouse , funneling petrodollars into massive construction projects .
he had long faced allegations of corruption over the business activities of his wife , construction billionaire yelena baturina , and had been accused by preservationists of destroying important historic buildings in the city center .
but a summer of missteps finally cost him his job .
a tough summer the construction boom has left the city with some of the world 's worst traffic and an overextended power grid .
luzhkov was criticized this july when repairs on the main highway leading to the city 's international airport led to lengthy delays .
he struck back over medvedev 's decision to suspend the construction of a highway through a forest outside the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : residents suffered through the smoke without their mayor in august he lost more points with muscovites when he continued his vacation in austria as forest and peat-bog fires filled the city with acrid smoke for weeks .
the kremlin publicly criticized his decision to stay away .
after his initial appointment , luzhkov was reelected in 1996 , 1999 and 2003 .
he was appointed for another four-year term by then-president vladimir putin after elections for regional governors and mayors of the country 's biggest cities were scrapped .
now luzhkov has become a victim of the kremlin 's shakeup of regional leaders .
diminishing popularity luzhkov was known for his bellicose manner and his flat , working man 's caps .
his socially conservative rhetoric targeted gay pride parades , which his police regularly broke up .
he riled progressives further when he allowed billboards with stalin 's image to be used in anniversary celebrations of the world war ii victory this last may .
his popularity had dropped with just 36 percent of respondents to a september opinion poll by the independent levada center saying he was doing a good job .
that was down from 40 percent in july and 65 percent in 2001 .
luzhkov said on television on monday that we would not step down voluntarily .
that was not necessary in the end , and he has now been replaced by his deputy , vladimir resin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 28.09.2010 afghan music school helps kids recover from war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both girls and boys get a general and music-based education at the institute kids who once sold gum or boiled eggs on the roadside now have a shot at a classical music education , thanks to a new school in afghanistan .
institute director ahman sarmast told dw about the school 's roots and goals . afghanistan 's ministry of education established its first music school in 1973 .
the kabul-based school has had a tumultuous history , paralleling that of its home country .
since 2008 , musicologist and afghan native dr. ahmad sarmast has headed a new project at the afghanistan national institute of music -lrb- anim -rrb- that aims to help rebuild musical life in the country .
the project is sponsored in part by the world bank , the german government , the goethe institute and the german society of music merchants . dr. sarmast talked with deutsche welle about the challenges and promise of the endeavor .
deutsche welle : what does anim stand for ?
ahmad sarmast : the afghanistan national institute of music is the only music school in afghanistan .
students enroll in the fourth grade and they receive both formal and musical education .
they graduate after 10 years of continuous music education with a diploma in music .
our music department is divided into two branches : afghan traditional music and western classical music .
at the moment , we have 154 students , but eventually we will be able to host 300 .
where did the idea come from ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration is a major hurdle - but also a central goal - at the school i left my country at an early age after completing my studies in moscow .
actually , i am the first afghan with a doctorate in music .
since the collapse of najibullah 's leftist regime -lsb- in 1992 -rsb- , i have kept an eye on the evolution of music in my country .
i spent most of my time in exile in australia , and it was there that i thought about establishing a music school in my country of origin .
negotiations with the local administration and potential fundraisers began in 2007 , but the final implementation of the project took place in 2008 .
you had a comfortable life in australia .
what brought you back to afghanistan ?
one of the reasons was my background and my social status here .
my father was a well known conductor , but i also had the secret dream that i could help to change the minds of thousands of young afghans towards music .
many of those who grew up under the taliban regime were completely brainwashed against music .
in fact , kabul used to be a more cultivated and sophisticated city but most of the intellectuals and educated people of afghanistan left during the rule by the communist government and after its collapse .
kabul today is nothing but a big village , which has lost its once sophisticated and open-minded society .
you mentioned before that you have 154 students .
are all of them " street kids " ?
when i came to afghanistan my goal was to establish a music school just for street kids and orphans .
but after discussions with the ministry of education we agreed that 50 percent of the seats would be reserved for the most advantaged families of the country .
we did n't want to deprive any talented potential student from getting musical education .
at the moment , street kids still do n't make up 50 percent of the total because we have " inherited " some others that already belonged to the former school of fine arts .
today , we have 24 street kids with us .
some were selling chewing gum , plastic bags or boiled eggs in the street .
now , we give their families 30 us dollars to stay in school as a kind of compensation for their loss of income .
we are also trying to provide them with buses so they do n't need to waste any money at all on transportation .
what kind of problems do you face with this group of children ?
recently , i lost a very talented girl .
she wasn ’ t attending her classes , and i could n't contact her family .
just a few days ago , we discovered that she had been engaged .
she is only 14 .
there are also the difficulties of integrating the street kids into a basic school discipline .
we have to re-educate them , in the full meaning of the verb .
it also helps them to recover after so many years of war and destruction .
that is all that they have seen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarmast came home to afghanistan to head the music project do you have any other plans for the near future ?
once we have fully implemented the kabul center , we have plans to spread the idea to mazar-e sharif and to establish a second school there .
we are also planning a third school in herat and a fourth in jalalabad .
i have already started to gather funds for mazar-e sharif 's school , and germany is very interested .
their troops are based in the same area , in the north of the country , and berlin is investing in several other cultural projects there .
given the current situation of unrest and the apparently ever-growing power of the taliban , are n't you afraid that music might well be silenced again in the short term ?
i am a very optimistic man - otherwise , i would not be here now .
but more important is the fact that music has always been present in afghanistan .
even during the taliban regime , people would smuggle records and cassettes at the risk of their lives .
drivers would always have two kinds of music : the kind they liked , but also the muslim chants in case they ran across taliban officials and had to swap the tapes .
afghans have always loved music .

in november 2008 , he returned to iran and was subsequently arrested .
he was sentenced to 19.5 years in jail . an iranian court has sentenced iranian-canadian blogger hossein derakhshan to 19.5 years in prison , according to iranian media .
the conservative website , mashreghnews.ir , which is close to iran 's presidential office , said derakhshan was convicted on charges of cooperation with hostile countries , spreading propaganda against the ruling establishment , promotion of counterrevolutionary groups and insulting islamic thoughts and religious figures .
verdict can be appealed he was also given a five years ' ban from membership in political parties and activities in the media , and was sentenced to returning received funds in the amount of 30,750 euros , $ 2,900 , and 200 british pounds .
derakhshan can appeal , the report added .
before the verdict , immediate family members as well as reporters without borders had feared hossein derakhshan may be threatened with death penalty .
the iranian blogging pioneer has been held in a tehran prison for nearly two years and has been given little , if any , access to legal representation and no consular access to canadian authorities .
in recent days , family members had said that the prosecutor was seeking the death penalty for derakhshan .
a blogging leader ten years ago , hossein derakhshan moved from iran to canada to study .
that 's where he met his wife , who is also from iran , and became a canadian citizen .
in 2001 , from his base in toronto , derakhshan penned an online guide teaching iranians how to blog in their own language and championed persian blogging from both inside and outside of his homeland .
dubbed by some as " the blogfather , " derakhshan was frequently interviewed by western media outlets about the nascent iranian blogging community and his blogs in both english and persian .
as he continued at the time , he also became an outspoken critic of iran 's religious leadership .
blogging from toronto , and later paris and london , under the pen name " hoder , " derakhshan criticized iran 's elite as being inflexible and unwilling to engage in reform , while attacking ayatollah khamenei directly in his writing .
in 2005 , he served as a jury member in deutsche welle 's best of the blogs awards .
the following year , he made a very public trip to israel , which is normally forbidden for iranian citizens .
" i 'm going to israel as a citizen journalist and a peace activist , ” he wrote on his english blog at the time .
" i 'm a citizen of canada and i have the right to visit any country i want . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : derakhshan defended iran 's nuclear program in the face of protests a change of views later that year , derakhshan suddenly switched his political perspective and became a staunch nationalist and defender of the islamic republic .
in 2006 , derakhshan wrote an opinion piece defending iran 's nuclear program in the washington post .
he also began to attack activists and former friends on his blogs and in other media .
later he told the guardian newspaper in vehement words that if the united states attacked iran , he would return and fight for his homeland .
after visiting israel , derakhshan moved to london to pursue graduate studies . that 's when he went from making oppositional statements to outright supporting the new president .
he went on rhetorical rampages against many who had previously been his friends and colleagues and later was even sued for libel in the united states in 2007 .
in the fall of 2008 , before derakhshan returned to iran , he asked his friends to not take a public stance if he was arrested .
derakhshan had returned to iran in late 2008 , apparently having secured a job offer at press tv , the country 's english-language news service , but was arrested two weeks after his arrival .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad himself asked for a swift resolution to the case .
arrested after two weeks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahmoud ahmadinejad called for a swift resolution to derakhshan 's case however , little is known about his current situation .
a brief statement made three months ago by tehran accuses him of insulting the prophet muhammad along with iran 's spiritual leader and president , as well as disseminating " anti-revolutionary propaganda " and spying for israel .
derakhshan 's mother told an expatriate iranian news website , kamtarin.com , that she has visited her son in prison .
his physical and mental conditions are worrisome .
canadian citizenship not accepted unlike other possible death penalty cases in iran , the customary wave of popular solidarity failed to materialize behind derakhshan , although there has been some attention online and in the canadian media .
even the mayor of paris , bertrand delanoe , rallied to his support in a statement on his website .
" in the name of paris , i solemnly call upon the judicial authorities of tehran to not condemn hossein derakhshan to death , " he wrote last week . " and i invite the mobilization of all of our energies to save this honorable , courageous and dignified life . "
but derakhshan 's political stance and relationship to ahmadinejad remains clouded .
iranian authorities have not accepted derakhshan efforts to invoke his rights as a canadian citizen .
" despite the iranian government ’ s position , we consider mr. derakhshan to be a canadian citizen , " wrote lisa monette , a spokesperson from the canadian department of foreign affairs and international trade , in a statement sent to deutsche welle .
" we will continue to press the iranian authorities for access , as we have in similar cases involving dual nationals in other jurisdictions .
canada continues to urge iran to fully respect all of its human rights obligations , both in law and in practice . "
iranian authorities have arrested numerous bloggers in recent years in a bid to clamp down on internet dissent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 28.09.2010 london becoming a hub for desalination technology großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the thames river in london is now a water source for the city britain opened its first desalination plant this summer , and more recently , another british firm meanwhile said this month that its new method of desalination could transform water on a global scale . earlier this month , a british firm called modern water announced that its six-month interim results for its " manipulated osmosis " system in oman is delivering " excellent initial results . "
the company claims that it can significantly reduce cost power consumption in desalination technology .
that , combined with existing research at local universities and britain 's first desalination plant , which came online in june , are turning london into one of europe 's hubs for desalination research and development .
southeast england drier than you think bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european environment agency says that southeast england is a region of " severe water stress " that may seem a bit strange , given britain 's reputation for wet summers and rainy days , people do n't generally think of britain as a country that is short on water . but southeast england is actually classified as an area of " severe water stress " by the european environment agency , with less rain than rome and a lower annual rainfall than most of germany .
although it is an unremarkable-looking set of grey warehouses and storage tanks , the thames water plant has revolutionized water provision in the capital .
in times of drought , the company says the plant can provide a new source of clean water to up to one million people .
" with climate change threatening hotter , drier summers and an additional 700,000 people forecast to move to london by 2021 , " the company wrote in an online statement in june , " the new water works will be available to help provide the capital 's supplies for the future - whatever the weather . "
as well as being britain 's first , the thames water plant is the only one in the world to use a four-stage version of a desalination process called reverse osmosis .
reverse osmosis – the standard in water desalination – involves pumping salt water at high pressure through very fine membranes .
the water molecules are forced through the membrane , but not the salt molecules , leaving clean water the other side .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the thames water plant is the first in the world to use a four-stage reverse osmosis system unlike similar plants around the world , in the thames water plant the salty water is sent through the membranes four times , meaning that an impressive 85 percent of the intake is converted into drinking water .
and by taking water from a tidal section of the river thames , the plant needs less energy than those which use more salty sea water .
secret agents meanwhile , on the other side of london from the thames plant , a company called modern water has developed a desalination process which it says could transform water provision around the globe .
the key innovations in modern water 's system - currently undergoing commercial trials in oman - are a process called forward osmosis , combined with the use of a secret " osmotic agent . "
" on one side of our membrane we have sea water which contains not only salt but other ions , " explained the executive chairman , neil macdougall in an interview with deutsche welle .
" on the other we have fresh water with a very concentrated solution using our osmotic agent .
using the natural process of osmosis , the fresh water is pulled across . "
in the next stage , the osmotic agent - whose exact composition is carefully guarded by the company - is removed from the water to produce clean drinking water .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london-based modern water says its test of a desalination facility in al khaluf , oman has been successful forward osmosis still requires a membrane to separate the salty from the clean water , but the water does n't have to be pumped at the high pressure necessary for reverse osmosis . that difference , according to modern water , accounts for a reduction in energy costs of around 30 percent .
and since energy costs constitute around half of the running costs of a typical desalination plant , this could dramatically change the business model for desalination plants .
according to the uk-based magazine global water intelligence – which tracks the desalination industry - the mystery surrounding modern water 's osmotic agent means that it is difficult to fully evaluate the process .
but modern water itself is confident enough to set the ambitious goal of bringing down the cost of desalinating water until it is on a par with the cost of treating fresh water .
growth industry the construction of new desalination plants , and recent advances by companies like modern water have brought desalination from the driest regions of the world – like the middle east – to more temperate regions like london , and that growth is set to continue .
" the current desalination capacity in the world is 68 million cubic meters a day , " said christopher gasson , the publisher of global water intelligence magazine , " and we think that will increase to around 130m cubic meters per day by 2016 , around doubling the whole industry . "
this does little to impress environmental groups , however , who share a fundamental objection to the desalination industry .
they argue that by making available a practically unlimited source of new water from the sea , desalination discourages us from using the water we already have more wisely .
where environmentalists do agree with industry figures , however , is that with over a billion people short of water around the globe , new desalination techniques have the potential to provide water to people who otherwise would n't have it .
still , the world wildlife fund -lrb- wwf -rrb- believes that , in most cases , the easiest way to increase our water supply is simply to waste less water . " in most cases our easiest source of new water for drinking water , or for industrial or cooling is to waste less water , " said phil dickie , the author of the wwf 's 2007 report on desalination , " and the cost of wasting less is much less than that of taking sea water and going through quite energy-intensive processes to turn it into fresh drinking water .

the move comes as no surprise for n koreans both above and below the 38th parallel . park gun ha knows a little something about the north korean worker ’ s party – he was once a member before defecting to south korea in 2005 and now belongs to an association of formerly high-ranking refugees . he told deutsche welle that even though most north koreans back home probably did not even kim jong-un ’ s name until tuesday , they will probably not be surprised that he is on his way to taking over from his father eventually . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : n korean leader kim jong-il reportedly has kidney problems however , park also pointed out that the question of who the next leader will be is not a top concern for most north koreans .
" north koreans lost hope when kim jong-il took over and the economy went bad , ” he explained .
" now they don ’ t really care about who the successor is .
they are much more concerned with how they will survive . " he said that the pyongyang regime would justify the eventual succession of kim jong-un by stressing his plans to reform the economy .
" that ’ s the only way the north korean people will support him . " government has created a flawless cv for kim jong-un park doubted that either kim jong-un or his aunt kim kyoung hee , who was also appointed as a general on tuesday , had any real experience in the north korean military . lee sae yul , the secretary general of the north korea liberation front , an organization in seoul made up of former north korean soldiers agreed .
" current soldiers in the north korean army would be shocked if they found out about this inexperience but that ’ s unlikely to happen . " " the government there has flawlessly created kim jong-un ’ s education and military experience .
it would be impossible for any one to find out the truth . "
bildunterschrift : members of the ruling worker 's party gather at pyongyang station on their way to the party conference disseminating the truth across the border lee 's organization is trying to change the fact that north koreans do not know the truth by sending dvds and other media across the border with information about kim jong-il ’ s regime and about life outside of north korea .
lee hopes that this will help more and more north koreans to question their government and defect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kim jong-il was confirmed as eventual successor to his father at the last major party meeting in 1980 however , north korea liberation front ’ s director kim myoung ha said that for now , there was not much ordinary north koreans could do to express the dissatisfaction with the leadership . " things will be the same when kim jong-un becomes leader , " he said .
" people will grow to hate the government .
there ’ s not much they can do about it , but they will expect life there to get worse and worse . " he predicted that there would be few public displays of anger but hostility toward the new leader would boil under the surface . author : jason strother -lrb- seoul -rrb- editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move comes as no surprise for n koreans both above and below the 38th parallel . park gun ha knows a little something about the north korean worker ’ s party – he was once a member before defecting to south korea in 2005 and now belongs to an association of formerly high-ranking refugees . he told deutsche welle that even though most north koreans back home probably did not even kim jong-un ’ s name until tuesday , they will probably not be surprised that he is on his way to taking over from his father eventually . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : n korean leader kim jong-il reportedly has kidney problems however , park also pointed out that the question of who the next leader will be is not a top concern for most north koreans .
" north koreans lost hope when kim jong-il took over and the economy went bad , ” he explained .
" now they don ’ t really care about who the successor is .
they are much more concerned with how they will survive . " he said that the pyongyang regime would justify the eventual succession of kim jong-un by stressing his plans to reform the economy .
" that ’ s the only way the north korean people will support him . " government has created a flawless cv for kim jong-un park doubted that either kim jong-un or his aunt kim kyoung hee , who was also appointed as a general on tuesday , had any real experience in the north korean military . lee sae yul , the secretary general of the north korea liberation front , an organization in seoul made up of former north korean soldiers agreed .
" current soldiers in the north korean army would be shocked if they found out about this inexperience but that ’ s unlikely to happen . " " the government there has flawlessly created kim jong-un ’ s education and military experience .
it would be impossible for any one to find out the truth . "
bildunterschrift : members of the ruling worker 's party gather at pyongyang station on their way to the party conference disseminating the truth across the border lee 's organization is trying to change the fact that north koreans do not know the truth by sending dvds and other media across the border with information about kim jong-il ’ s regime and about life outside of north korea .
lee hopes that this will help more and more north koreans to question their government and defect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kim jong-il was confirmed as eventual successor to his father at the last major party meeting in 1980 however , north korea liberation front ’ s director kim myoung ha said that for now , there was not much ordinary north koreans could do to express the dissatisfaction with the leadership . " things will be the same when kim jong-un becomes leader , " he said .
" people will grow to hate the government .
there ’ s not much they can do about it , but they will expect life there to get worse and worse . " he predicted that there would be few public displays of anger but hostility toward the new leader would boil under the surface . author : jason strother -lrb- seoul -rrb- editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 28.09.2010 london becoming a hub for desalination technology großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the thames river in london is now a water source for the city britain opened its first desalination plant this summer , and more recently , another british firm meanwhile said this month that its new method of desalination could transform water on a global scale . earlier this month , a british firm called modern water announced that its six-month interim results for its " manipulated osmosis " system in oman is delivering " excellent initial results . "
the company claims that it can significantly reduce cost power consumption in desalination technology .
that , combined with existing research at local universities and britain 's first desalination plant , which came online in june , are turning london into one of europe 's hubs for desalination research and development .
southeast england drier than you think bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european environment agency says that southeast england is a region of " severe water stress " that may seem a bit strange , given britain 's reputation for wet summers and rainy days , people do n't generally think of britain as a country that is short on water . but southeast england is actually classified as an area of " severe water stress " by the european environment agency , with less rain than rome and a lower annual rainfall than most of germany .
although it is an unremarkable-looking set of grey warehouses and storage tanks , the thames water plant has revolutionized water provision in the capital .
in times of drought , the company says the plant can provide a new source of clean water to up to one million people .
" with climate change threatening hotter , drier summers and an additional 700,000 people forecast to move to london by 2021 , " the company wrote in an online statement in june , " the new water works will be available to help provide the capital 's supplies for the future - whatever the weather . "
as well as being britain 's first , the thames water plant is the only one in the world to use a four-stage version of a desalination process called reverse osmosis .
reverse osmosis – the standard in water desalination – involves pumping salt water at high pressure through very fine membranes .
the water molecules are forced through the membrane , but not the salt molecules , leaving clean water the other side .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the thames water plant is the first in the world to use a four-stage reverse osmosis system unlike similar plants around the world , in the thames water plant the salty water is sent through the membranes four times , meaning that an impressive 85 percent of the intake is converted into drinking water .
and by taking water from a tidal section of the river thames , the plant needs less energy than those which use more salty sea water .
secret agents meanwhile , on the other side of london from the thames plant , a company called modern water has developed a desalination process which it says could transform water provision around the globe .
the key innovations in modern water 's system - currently undergoing commercial trials in oman - are a process called forward osmosis , combined with the use of a secret " osmotic agent . "
" on one side of our membrane we have sea water which contains not only salt but other ions , " explained the executive chairman , neil macdougall in an interview with deutsche welle .
" on the other we have fresh water with a very concentrated solution using our osmotic agent .
using the natural process of osmosis , the fresh water is pulled across . "
in the next stage , the osmotic agent - whose exact composition is carefully guarded by the company - is removed from the water to produce clean drinking water .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london-based modern water says its test of a desalination facility in al khaluf , oman has been successful forward osmosis still requires a membrane to separate the salty from the clean water , but the water does n't have to be pumped at the high pressure necessary for reverse osmosis . that difference , according to modern water , accounts for a reduction in energy costs of around 30 percent .
and since energy costs constitute around half of the running costs of a typical desalination plant , this could dramatically change the business model for desalination plants .
according to the uk-based magazine global water intelligence – which tracks the desalination industry - the mystery surrounding modern water 's osmotic agent means that it is difficult to fully evaluate the process .
but modern water itself is confident enough to set the ambitious goal of bringing down the cost of desalinating water until it is on a par with the cost of treating fresh water .
growth industry the construction of new desalination plants , and recent advances by companies like modern water have brought desalination from the driest regions of the world – like the middle east – to more temperate regions like london , and that growth is set to continue .
" the current desalination capacity in the world is 68 million cubic meters a day , " said christopher gasson , the publisher of global water intelligence magazine , " and we think that will increase to around 130m cubic meters per day by 2016 , around doubling the whole industry . "
this does little to impress environmental groups , however , who share a fundamental objection to the desalination industry .
they argue that by making available a practically unlimited source of new water from the sea , desalination discourages us from using the water we already have more wisely .
where environmentalists do agree with industry figures , however , is that with over a billion people short of water around the globe , new desalination techniques have the potential to provide water to people who otherwise would n't have it .
still , the world wildlife fund -lrb- wwf -rrb- believes that , in most cases , the easiest way to increase our water supply is simply to waste less water . " in most cases our easiest source of new water for drinking water , or for industrial or cooling is to waste less water , " said phil dickie , the author of the wwf 's 2007 report on desalination , " and the cost of wasting less is much less than that of taking sea water and going through quite energy-intensive processes to turn it into fresh drinking water .

one company says it is ready to deploy the technology , but locals are fighting plans to bury the carbon under their town . energy giant vattenfall is currently testing its procedure for carbon capture and storage -lrb- ccs -rrb- in a part of eastern germany known as lausitz .
" we 're working on a process to remove co2 from waste gas .
that way we 're hoping to make the process of generating electricity from brown coal climate-friendlier " , said vattenfall 's lutz picard who shows visitors around daily to explain how the company wants to make coal production green .
the company says some 55 million tons of lignite , also known as brown coal , are still produced here every year .
the pilot facility , at vattenfall 's schwarze pumpe brown-coal power plant , is trialing a technique which the company calls ' oxyfuel ' because it involves adding large amounts of oxygen to the coal-burning process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oxygen is added when burning coal to extract the co2 half the equation " we add oxygen when we burn the coal " , said vattenfall 's lutz picard .
" that 's how we 're able to remove co2 from the waste gas because the concentration of co2 at the cauldron 's mouthpiece is higher . "
after it has been cleaned in several steps , the company says it is able to extract almost pure co2 .
at the moment , however , the co2 that is being extracted is simply being released back into the atmosphere , because the company is still waiting for a new law which would allow it to pump the gas underground .
germany 's government is expected to give the green light to ccs technology , in line with its recently-announced energy concept for the next 40 years , which aims to promote a massive expansion of renewable energies while keeping energy prices stable through " bridge " technologies like nuclear power .
at vattenfall 's schwarze pumpe site , this would mean trucks and pipelines would be used to transport co2 to the small town of beeskow nearby , where it would be pressed 1,000 meters below the surface .
vattenfall is confident of securing the necessary legislation , but it has since hit another snag : local resistance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beeskow 's inhabitants are against the plans to store co2 below their town guinea pigs the inhabitants of beeskow are against the plans and have put up big yellow crosses all along the road .
the pictures are reminiscent of the protest carried out by the anti-nuclear movement in other parts of germany , where energy giants are planning to build repositories for nuclear waste .
beeskow 's inhabitants say there has n't been enough investigation of the potential impact of pumping the carbon below their town , and they do n't want to be used as " guinea pigs . " many are afraid that the carbon might not be as clean as promised by vattenfall , and that sulfur and heavy metals like arsenic could get into the drinking water via the ground water .
even if the gas were clean , underground storage could lead to another problem , said activist hardy feldmann , because the liquid co2 would be pressed into porous sand stone which contains very salty water , or brine .
" the brine would have to make space for the co2 " , feldmann said .
" that would mean it would end up in the ground water .
so we would have high levels of salt in the ground water . "
so far , the city of beeskow has vetoed vattenfall 's plans to conduct geological research on the brine layers , and has attacked federal authorities for allowing vattenfall to proceed with its plans despite the absence of a law on the technology .

the organization called for a halt to the practice . the international human rights organization amnesty international has released a damning report which says european union -lrb- eu -rrb- countries have been quietly deporting roma gypsies back to kosovo for over a year .
the report , titled " not welcome anywhere : stop the forced return of roma to kosovo " , singles out germany as a chief perpetrator , alleging many of the gypsies are being forcibly removed from their homes at early hours in the morning with nothing more than the clothes on their back .
amnesty says that many of the roma are made to sign statements attesting their deportation is voluntary .
the report calculates that almost 10,000 roma are legally obliged to leave the country and are therefore at risk of forcible return to kosovo from germany alone .
it says the roma deportations began during negotiations of a bilateral readmission agreement between germany and kosovo in 2009 , which was finally signed on april 14 , 2010 , and came into force on september 1 , 2010 .
roma discrimination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic albanians were the driving force behind kosovo 's independence sian jones , amnesty 's kosovo expert , said eu countries risked breaking international law by sending roma back " to places where they are at risk of persecution , or other serious harm . "
discrimination against roma in kosovo is " widespread and systematic compounded by their perceived association with kosovo serbs , " said amnesty .
" the eu should instead continue to provide international protection for roma and other minorities in kosovo until they can return there safely , " added sian jones .
" the kosovo authorities must also ensure that roma and other minorities can return voluntarily and reintegrate fully in society . "
the london-based rights group said few roma receive help on their return to kosovo , meaning many face problems in obtaining access to education , healthcare , housing and social benefits .
deportations from germany are organized by the individual states , and there are wide differences between the strictness with which they are carried out , with some states having imposed a virtual moratorium .
roma clampdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding issued a sharp rebuke of french policy on roma a recent report by the united nations children 's organization , unicef , indicates that nearly 40 percent of the roma returned from germany are stateless , and that as many as 50 percent who are legally obliged to leave are children .
it also states that almost two-thirds of them are born and educated in germany .
the partially-recognized republic of kosovo declared itself independent from serbia in 2008 .
so far , the independence of the albanian-majority state has been recognized by 70 countries .
the amnesty report comes amid international outrage at a clampdown on roma in france , which has seen hundreds of them sent back to romania and bulgaria since the beginning of august despite eu legislation on the free movement of people .
eu justice commissioner viviane reding threatened to take legal action against france over the deportations .

despite the announcement , schaeuble participated in a cabinet meeting and a press conference on the government 's new energy plan on tuesday .
" the inflammation requires treatment , " spokesman michael offer told reporters in berlin on tuesday .
" the incidents earlier this year have shown that he is also able to complete his duties from the hospital . "
in a routine procedure in mid-february , doctors replaced an implant that helped regulate schaeuble 's digestive system .
he left the hospital on his own accord , but was later readmitted because the wound healed poorly .
past resignation speculation health problems have previously interfered with schaeuble 's duties in the german government .
he was hospitalized in may during a summit of european union finance ministers in brussels because of a reaction to medication .
interior minister thomas de maiziere was quickly flown in to replace him .
such incidents led to speculation that schaeuble would resign his position .
but chancellor angela merkel publicly supported schaeuble 's decision to continue in office and asked him to prioritize his health and allow himself to heal completely .
an assassination attempt by a deranged man in october 1990 left schaeuble a paraplegic .

the move comes as no surprise for n koreans both above and below the 38th parallel . park gun ha knows a little something about the north korean worker ’ s party – he was once a member before defecting to south korea in 2005 and now belongs to an association of formerly high-ranking refugees . he told deutsche welle that even though most north koreans back home probably did not even kim jong-un ’ s name until tuesday , they will probably not be surprised that he is on his way to taking over from his father eventually . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : n korean leader kim jong-il reportedly has kidney problems however , park also pointed out that the question of who the next leader will be is not a top concern for most north koreans .
" north koreans lost hope when kim jong-il took over and the economy went bad , ” he explained .
" now they don ’ t really care about who the successor is .
they are much more concerned with how they will survive . " he said that the pyongyang regime would justify the eventual succession of kim jong-un by stressing his plans to reform the economy .
" that ’ s the only way the north korean people will support him . " government has created a flawless cv for kim jong-un park doubted that either kim jong-un or his aunt kim kyoung hee , who was also appointed as a general on tuesday , had any real experience in the north korean military . lee sae yul , the secretary general of the north korea liberation front , an organization in seoul made up of former north korean soldiers agreed .
" current soldiers in the north korean army would be shocked if they found out about this inexperience but that ’ s unlikely to happen . " " the government there has flawlessly created kim jong-un ’ s education and military experience .
it would be impossible for any one to find out the truth . "
bildunterschrift : members of the ruling worker 's party gather at pyongyang station on their way to the party conference disseminating the truth across the border lee 's organization is trying to change the fact that north koreans do not know the truth by sending dvds and other media across the border with information about kim jong-il ’ s regime and about life outside of north korea .
lee hopes that this will help more and more north koreans to question their government and defect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kim jong-il was confirmed as eventual successor to his father at the last major party meeting in 1980 however , north korea liberation front ’ s director kim myoung ha said that for now , there was not much ordinary north koreans could do to express the dissatisfaction with the leadership . " things will be the same when kim jong-un becomes leader , " he said .
" people will grow to hate the government .
there ’ s not much they can do about it , but they will expect life there to get worse and worse . " he predicted that there would be few public displays of anger but hostility toward the new leader would boil under the surface . author : jason strother -lrb- seoul -rrb- editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern germany -pipe- 28.09.2010 east german scientists faced opportunities and disappointment during reunification großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leibniz institute for plant biochemistry was one of east germany 's premiere scientific laboratories as in other fields , east german science struggled to find its place in a unified germany .
for some it was easier than others , as older faculty were often forced out , and younger faculty found opportunities in the west . while the rest of the country was trying to figure how to integrate two governments , two currencies and two of nearly everything else , the sciences were no different .
after unification , the west german government advisory body , the council of science and humanities was tasked with evaluating east german research facilities , according to karl ulrich mayer , a west german sociologist at yale university in the united states .
" a whole number of institutes were closed down , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle , nearly two decades after the official reunification date of october 3 , 1990 .
" -lsb- mainly -rsb- because it was assumed that they were too much of the party line , " he added .
mayer is now also president of the leibniz association , which comprises of 86 research institutions across germany , including many in the former east germany , like the leibniz institute for plant biochemistry outside of leipzig . he added that the hard sciences too , were not immune to cuts and layoffs . "
in jena there was a big academy of science institutes in the area of penicillin research , that was reduced to about 550 people from 1,000 , " said mayer , " and these 550 people were then distributed among two leibniz institutes and a few university institutes . "
while some east german institutes were absorbed into existing west german facilities , the max planck society refused to do this , which gave them the opportunity to found new research institutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1964 , this was the office of the famed east german biochemist karl mothes , the ipb 's first director publication restrictions for east german research the german democratic republic , or gdr as it was known in english , focused on other hard sciences , including chemistry , biotechnology and nuclear science .
the gdr received reactor technology from the soviet union .
while research studies from the hard sciences had the chance to be published in western journals , it was much tougher for the social sciences and humanities , according to dieter hoffman , a fellow at the max planck institute for the history of science in berlin .
before the wall came down , hoffmann worked at the east german academy of sciences in the institute for theory and the history of science . "
it was not possible for me for instance , to publish in western journals , " said hoffmann , " and also i could not go to west to visit colleagues or conferences and to present there my scientific research . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people who worked at the ipb during the east german period lost their jobs or were forced to retire scientists who did n't toe the party line , or who were suspected of criticizing the regime quickly found their work censored or not published at all .
still , there were some instances that proved to be beneficial for young scientists under the gdr .
hildegard maria nickel worked as a sociologist at the academy of educational sciences in east germany .
she says now that she would never have had the opportunity to become a professor if she had n't grown up in east germany because of her background .
born to working class parents , nickel 's father was a migrant and she was one of eight children .
in the gdr , women were given the same opportunities as men to work and study .
despite such advances , nickel found herself increasingly disillusioned with a system that censored findings it did n't want to hear .
" i think we did really good research on the youth in gdr and we could see how they feel in the end of the 70s , 80s , that they want to leave the gdr , " said nickel , " but nobody wanted to know it and we could n't publish it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before the wall came down , dieter hoffmann worked at the east german academy of sciences in the institute for theory and the history of science .
unification brought new opportunities when the wall came down , nickel and hoffmann were able to find jobs in a unified germany , easily travel and freely publish .
but many older faculty , found themselves demoted or pushed out . "
some people went to an early retirement .
some people could start a new scientific career or continue their career in a new location or institute and some people became unemployed , " said hoffman .
one of the prime examples of scientists finding a new career under a unified germany was , of course angela merkel , germany 's current chancellor .
before she entered politics , merkel studied , worked and eventually earned her doctorate in quantum chemistry in east berlin .
while integrating east and west german science research centres was a difficult process for many , hoffmann added that in a unified germany today there are plenty of exciting areas of research .

the move comes as no surprise for n koreans both above and below the 38th parallel . park gun ha knows a little something about the north korean worker ’ s party – he was once a member before defecting to south korea in 2005 and now belongs to an association of formerly high-ranking refugees . he told deutsche welle that even though most north koreans back home probably did not even kim jong-un ’ s name until tuesday , they will probably not be surprised that he is on his way to taking over from his father eventually . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : n korean leader kim jong-il reportedly has kidney problems however , park also pointed out that the question of who the next leader will be is not a top concern for most north koreans .
" north koreans lost hope when kim jong-il took over and the economy went bad , ” he explained .
" now they don ’ t really care about who the successor is .
they are much more concerned with how they will survive . " he said that the pyongyang regime would justify the eventual succession of kim jong-un by stressing his plans to reform the economy .
" that ’ s the only way the north korean people will support him . " government has created a flawless cv for kim jong-un park doubted that either kim jong-un or his aunt kim kyoung hee , who was also appointed as a general on tuesday , had any real experience in the north korean military . lee sae yul , the secretary general of the north korea liberation front , an organization in seoul made up of former north korean soldiers agreed .
" current soldiers in the north korean army would be shocked if they found out about this inexperience but that ’ s unlikely to happen . " " the government there has flawlessly created kim jong-un ’ s education and military experience .
it would be impossible for any one to find out the truth . "
bildunterschrift : members of the ruling worker 's party gather at pyongyang station on their way to the party conference disseminating the truth across the border lee 's organization is trying to change the fact that north koreans do not know the truth by sending dvds and other media across the border with information about kim jong-il ’ s regime and about life outside of north korea .
lee hopes that this will help more and more north koreans to question their government and defect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kim jong-il was confirmed as eventual successor to his father at the last major party meeting in 1980 however , north korea liberation front ’ s director kim myoung ha said that for now , there was not much ordinary north koreans could do to express the dissatisfaction with the leadership . " things will be the same when kim jong-un becomes leader , " he said .
" people will grow to hate the government .
there ’ s not much they can do about it , but they will expect life there to get worse and worse . " he predicted that there would be few public displays of anger but hostility toward the new leader would boil under the surface . author : jason strother -lrb- seoul -rrb- editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one company says it is ready to deploy the technology , but locals are fighting plans to bury the carbon under their town . energy giant vattenfall is currently testing its procedure for carbon capture and storage -lrb- ccs -rrb- in a part of eastern germany known as lausitz .
" we 're working on a process to remove co2 from waste gas .
that way we 're hoping to make the process of generating electricity from brown coal climate-friendlier " , said vattenfall 's lutz picard who shows visitors around daily to explain how the company wants to make coal production green .
the company says some 55 million tons of lignite , also known as brown coal , are still produced here every year .
the pilot facility , at vattenfall 's schwarze pumpe brown-coal power plant , is trialing a technique which the company calls ' oxyfuel ' because it involves adding large amounts of oxygen to the coal-burning process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oxygen is added when burning coal to extract the co2 half the equation " we add oxygen when we burn the coal " , said vattenfall 's lutz picard .
" that 's how we 're able to remove co2 from the waste gas because the concentration of co2 at the cauldron 's mouthpiece is higher . "
after it has been cleaned in several steps , the company says it is able to extract almost pure co2 .
at the moment , however , the co2 that is being extracted is simply being released back into the atmosphere , because the company is still waiting for a new law which would allow it to pump the gas underground .
germany 's government is expected to give the green light to ccs technology , in line with its recently-announced energy concept for the next 40 years , which aims to promote a massive expansion of renewable energies while keeping energy prices stable through " bridge " technologies like nuclear power .
at vattenfall 's schwarze pumpe site , this would mean trucks and pipelines would be used to transport co2 to the small town of beeskow nearby , where it would be pressed 1,000 meters below the surface .
vattenfall is confident of securing the necessary legislation , but it has since hit another snag : local resistance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beeskow 's inhabitants are against the plans to store co2 below their town guinea pigs the inhabitants of beeskow are against the plans and have put up big yellow crosses all along the road .
the pictures are reminiscent of the protest carried out by the anti-nuclear movement in other parts of germany , where energy giants are planning to build repositories for nuclear waste .
beeskow 's inhabitants say there has n't been enough investigation of the potential impact of pumping the carbon below their town , and they do n't want to be used as " guinea pigs . " many are afraid that the carbon might not be as clean as promised by vattenfall , and that sulfur and heavy metals like arsenic could get into the drinking water via the ground water .
even if the gas were clean , underground storage could lead to another problem , said activist hardy feldmann , because the liquid co2 would be pressed into porous sand stone which contains very salty water , or brine .
" the brine would have to make space for the co2 " , feldmann said .
" that would mean it would end up in the ground water .
so we would have high levels of salt in the ground water . "
so far , the city of beeskow has vetoed vattenfall 's plans to conduct geological research on the brine layers , and has attacked federal authorities for allowing vattenfall to proceed with its plans despite the absence of a law on the technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the co2 extracted be pure enough to be stored underground ?
export opportunity but these concerns are not shared at vattenfall .
lutz picard stresses that his company will do everything it can to purify the greenhouse gas and make the underground storage facility as secure as possible .
for him the technology is inevitable .
" in germany you may argue about where coal ranks as a source of energy " , picard said .
" but in countries like china or india you ca n't .
there , coal is available and people will use it .
and then the only question is : how do you use coal in a climate-friendly way ? "
for vattenfall , capturing and storing carbon dioxide could mean a big export opportunity – and perhaps one of it 's last in the coal mining industry , considering that in 40 years ' time , germany is supposed to end to its own coal production .

the organization called for a halt to the practice . the international human rights organization amnesty international has released a damning report which says european union -lrb- eu -rrb- countries have been quietly deporting roma gypsies back to kosovo for over a year .
the report , titled " not welcome anywhere : stop the forced return of roma to kosovo " , singles out germany as a chief perpetrator , alleging many of the gypsies are being forcibly removed from their homes at early hours in the morning with nothing more than the clothes on their back .
amnesty says that many of the roma are made to sign statements attesting their deportation is voluntary .
the report calculates that almost 10,000 roma are legally obliged to leave the country and are therefore at risk of forcible return to kosovo from germany alone .
it says the roma deportations began during negotiations of a bilateral readmission agreement between germany and kosovo in 2009 , which was finally signed on april 14 , 2010 , and came into force on september 1 , 2010 .
roma discrimination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic albanians were the driving force behind kosovo 's independence sian jones , amnesty 's kosovo expert , said eu countries risked breaking international law by sending roma back " to places where they are at risk of persecution , or other serious harm . "
discrimination against roma in kosovo is " widespread and systematic compounded by their perceived association with kosovo serbs , " said amnesty .
" the eu should instead continue to provide international protection for roma and other minorities in kosovo until they can return there safely , " added sian jones .
" the kosovo authorities must also ensure that roma and other minorities can return voluntarily and reintegrate fully in society . "
the london-based rights group said few roma receive help on their return to kosovo , meaning many face problems in obtaining access to education , healthcare , housing and social benefits .
deportations from germany are organized by the individual states , and there are wide differences between the strictness with which they are carried out , with some states having imposed a virtual moratorium .
roma clampdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding issued a sharp rebuke of french policy on roma a recent report by the united nations children 's organization , unicef , indicates that nearly 40 percent of the roma returned from germany are stateless , and that as many as 50 percent who are legally obliged to leave are children .
it also states that almost two-thirds of them are born and educated in germany .
the partially-recognized republic of kosovo declared itself independent from serbia in 2008 .
so far , the independence of the albanian-majority state has been recognized by 70 countries .
the amnesty report comes amid international outrage at a clampdown on roma in france , which has seen hundreds of them sent back to romania and bulgaria since the beginning of august despite eu legislation on the free movement of people .
eu justice commissioner viviane reding threatened to take legal action against france over the deportations .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the remodeled jawaharlal nehru stadium is where the opening and closing ceremonies are due to take place several athletes from australia and the uk have already withdrawn from the games due to health and safety concerns . difficult situation from the start the crisis for games organizers started long ago with several deadlines for completion of sporting venues and infrastructure being missed . " we inherited a very difficult situation , " said sheila dikshit , the chief minister of delhi , who has been monitoring the preparations .
" but it is improving almost by the hour .
of course there have been some seepages that the builders should have looked at earlier but we will finish whatever we can and do whatever is possible . " but recent events have cast doubt on whether it is really possible to improve matters considerably .
a snake was found in a south african athlete 's room at the games village and a cobra was recovered from the r k khanna tennis stadium . bildunterschrift : many migrant workers have been sleeping on the streets of delhi mark doyle , an australian athlete , tried to downplay the incident however .
" i think we are okay from the snake point of view .
we are australians and used to dealing with the most venomous , so a couple of snakes is not going to be an issue for us . " after initially staying in hotels , more than 1,000 athletes , including 36 from australia , have now moved to the athletes ' village . blame game in full swing however , the blame game is in full swing and the knives are clearly sharpening for some accountability .

" i have just come back from the village and i had lunch with all the athletes .
all of them love the village and said they had never seen such a village anywhere .
it is true that the cleanliness part was not maintained but this is because we got the venue late .
there was a big fight between the builder of the place and the contractor .
for three months , there was no work going on there .
i am ready to take all the blame - i will accept all the blame , " he said .
already organizers have overshot their budget by nine , spending at least $ 4.6 billion upgrading stadiums , refurbishing roads and building power and water utilities .

opposition leaders say it ’ s a blow to the growing renewable energy sector . cabinet ministers in berlin on tuesday presented a new energy concept which they called exemplary and unmatched in the world , and which includes a controversial extension to germany 's nuclear power plants .
" the concept is not just a vision , " said environment minister norbert roettgen in berlin .
" by 2050 , about 80 percent of all energy consumed in this country will come from renewable sources , but on the way to this age we need nuclear power for an interim period to make this happen . "
under the new plan , the deadline to shut down germany 's nuclear power plants would be extended by an average of 12 years , with the last one running until 2036 .
merkel and her government say the extension is needed to keep germany running until renewable energy sources can supply the country with enough energy to replace what is produced by nuclear plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's cabinet insists the extension is necessary " a longer lifespan for nuclear power plants will help us keep energy prices affordable for both private consumers and industry , " said economics minister rainer bruederle .
" and it 'll be easier for us to reduce harmful gas emissions . "
effects on renewable energy that 's an argument that the opposition reject .
both sigmar gabriel , chairman of the spd , and juergen trittin , co-chairman of the greens , said the government 's plan would hurt the renewable energy industry with providers having to compete with nuclear energy to get a foothold in the market .
both trittin and gabriel are former environment ministers under previous coalition governments .
" with its energy plan , the government is about to block the creation of 300,000 new jobs in the renewables sector , " gabriel told german public broadcaster ard .
" many small and medium-sized firms involved in generating renewable energy are now being put under increasing pressure . "
the new plan also includes a tax on uranium fuel rods that bruederle said would generate 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- in government revenue annually .
a renewable energy fund would also be established that would collect 300 million euros from power companies each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without a majority in the bundesrat , merkel hopes to bypass the upper house constitutional court battle brewing the opposition is also displeased by suggestions from the government that the plan only needs the approval of the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , and not the bundesrat , the upper house , which represents the country 's 16 states .
merkel 's coalition of conservative christian democrats , their bavarian sister party , the christian social union and the liberal free democrats argues that the nuclear plant deadline is a federal issue , not a state matter .
the governing coalition lost its majority in the bundesrat in the state election in north rhine-westphalia in may .
it still has a majority in the bundestag .
the opposition has said if the government does bypass the bundesrat , it will go to the country 's constitutional court .

even some members of the ruling party are calling for it to be toned down . debate over a controversial bill to reform immigration and citizenship regulations began in the french parliament on tuesday , with members of both the ruling and opposition parties offering criticism .
the bill is france 's fifth piece of immigration legislation in seven years , and would , among other things , make it easier for the government to revoke french nationality from citizens who have been naturalized for less than 10 years and who have been convicted of killing or attacking a policeman or any public official .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bill also simplifies entry for highly qualified immigrants immigration minister eric besson , who first proposed the legislation , said in an interview with le parisien newspaper that he wanted his ministry to be " a machine to produce good french citizens . "
" last year we gave french nationality to 108,000 foreigners , " the newspaper quoted him as saying .
" being a ' good french person ' does n't mean denying your history , your roots or your french culture . "
besson 's original bill took a more moderate approach before president nicolas sarkozy and interior minister brice hortefeux toughened it during cabinet debate .
opposition on both sides in addition to the citizenship regulations , the bill would allow france to deport foreigners , including eu citizens , for theft , aggressive begging or abusing the right to remain in france for 30 days without permission by leaving and re-entering the country to renew that right . at the same time if would speed up entry procedures for highly qualified immigrants .
sarkozy 's government argues that the legislation would bring france into line with european union immigration directives , but critics have accused him of twisting those directives to fit a populist , anti-immigrant agenda , possibly to attract far-right voters ahead of presidential elections in 2012 .

etienne pinte , a member of parliament from sarkozy 's own conservative ump party , said the bill was an attempt to bring in votes in the far-right national front party .
he said he would seek up to 40 amendments to " humanize " the bill , or vote against it .
new york-based human rights watch has urged parliament to reject the bill and tied it in with france 's mass roma expulsions , the legality of which is currently the subject of debate in the european commission .
" it is shocking that the french government is pushing for measures that clearly target roma , " said hrw 's judith sunderland . " it smacks of a populist move at the expense of the most discriminated against and vulnerable people in europe today . "

even some members of the ruling party are calling for it to be toned down . debate over a controversial bill to reform immigration and citizenship regulations began in the french parliament on tuesday , with members of both the ruling and opposition parties offering criticism .
the bill is france 's fifth piece of immigration legislation in seven years , and would , among other things , make it easier for the government to revoke french nationality from citizens who have been naturalized for less than 10 years and who have been convicted of killing or attacking a policeman or any public official .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bill also simplifies entry for highly qualified immigrants immigration minister eric besson , who first proposed the legislation , said in an interview with le parisien newspaper that he wanted his ministry to be " a machine to produce good french citizens . "
" last year we gave french nationality to 108,000 foreigners , " the newspaper quoted him as saying .
" being a ' good french person ' does n't mean denying your history , your roots or your french culture . "
besson 's original bill took a more moderate approach before president nicolas sarkozy and interior minister brice hortefeux toughened it during cabinet debate .
opposition on both sides in addition to the citizenship regulations , the bill would allow france to deport foreigners , including eu citizens , for theft , aggressive begging or abusing the right to remain in france for 30 days without permission by leaving and re-entering the country to renew that right . at the same time if would speed up entry procedures for highly qualified immigrants .
sarkozy 's government argues that the legislation would bring france into line with european union immigration directives , but critics have accused him of twisting those directives to fit a populist , anti-immigrant agenda , possibly to attract far-right voters ahead of presidential elections in 2012 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics like the bill to france 's expulsions of roma opposition socialist spokesman bruno le roux said if passed into law , the bill would amount to " another step taken in the deterioration of republican principles . "
etienne pinte , a member of parliament from sarkozy 's own conservative ump party , said the bill was an attempt to bring in votes in the far-right national front party .
he said he would seek up to 40 amendments to " humanize " the bill , or vote against it .
new york-based human rights watch has urged parliament to reject the bill and tied it in with france 's mass roma expulsions , the legality of which is currently the subject of debate in the european commission .
" it is shocking that the french government is pushing for measures that clearly target roma , " said hrw 's judith sunderland . " it smacks of a populist move at the expense of the most discriminated against and vulnerable people in europe today . "

opposition leaders say it ’ s a blow to the growing renewable energy sector . cabinet ministers in berlin on tuesday presented a new energy concept which they called exemplary and unmatched in the world , and which includes a controversial extension to germany 's nuclear power plants .
" the concept is not just a vision , " said environment minister norbert roettgen in berlin .
" by 2050 , about 80 percent of all energy consumed in this country will come from renewable sources , but on the way to this age we need nuclear power for an interim period to make this happen . "
under the new plan , the deadline to shut down germany 's nuclear power plants would be extended by an average of 12 years , with the last one running until 2036 .
merkel and her government say the extension is needed to keep germany running until renewable energy sources can supply the country with enough energy to replace what is produced by nuclear plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's cabinet insists the extension is necessary " a longer lifespan for nuclear power plants will help us keep energy prices affordable for both private consumers and industry , " said economics minister rainer bruederle .
" and it 'll be easier for us to reduce harmful gas emissions . "
effects on renewable energy that 's an argument that the opposition reject .
both sigmar gabriel , chairman of the spd , and juergen trittin , co-chairman of the greens , said the government 's plan would hurt the renewable energy industry with providers having to compete with nuclear energy to get a foothold in the market .
both trittin and gabriel are former environment ministers under previous coalition governments .
" with its energy plan , the government is about to block the creation of 300,000 new jobs in the renewables sector , " gabriel told german public broadcaster ard .
" many small and medium-sized firms involved in generating renewable energy are now being put under increasing pressure . "
the new plan also includes a tax on uranium fuel rods that bruederle said would generate 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- in government revenue annually .
a renewable energy fund would also be established that would collect 300 million euros from power companies each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without a majority in the bundesrat , merkel hopes to bypass the upper house constitutional court battle brewing the opposition is also displeased by suggestions from the government that the plan only needs the approval of the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , and not the bundesrat , the upper house , which represents the country 's 16 states .
merkel 's coalition of conservative christian democrats , their bavarian sister party , the christian social union and the liberal free democrats argues that the nuclear plant deadline is a federal issue , not a state matter .
the governing coalition lost its majority in the bundesrat in the state election in north rhine-westphalia in may .
it still has a majority in the bundestag .
the opposition has said if the government does bypass the bundesrat , it will go to the country 's constitutional court .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern germany -pipe- 28.09.2010 east german scientists faced opportunities and disappointment during reunification großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leibniz institute for plant biochemistry was one of east germany 's premiere scientific laboratories as in other fields , east german science struggled to find its place in a unified germany .
for some it was easier than others , as older faculty were often forced out , and younger faculty found opportunities in the west . while the rest of the country was trying to figure how to integrate two governments , two currencies and two of nearly everything else , the sciences were no different .
after unification , the west german government advisory body , the council of science and humanities was tasked with evaluating east german research facilities , according to karl ulrich mayer , a west german sociologist at yale university in the united states .
" a whole number of institutes were closed down , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle , nearly two decades after the official reunification date of october 3 , 1990 .
" -lsb- mainly -rsb- because it was assumed that they were too much of the party line , " he added .
mayer is now also president of the leibniz association , which comprises of 86 research institutions across germany , including many in the former east germany , like the leibniz institute for plant biochemistry outside of leipzig . he added that the hard sciences too , were not immune to cuts and layoffs . "
in jena there was a big academy of science institutes in the area of penicillin research , that was reduced to about 550 people from 1,000 , " said mayer , " and these 550 people were then distributed among two leibniz institutes and a few university institutes . "
while some east german institutes were absorbed into existing west german facilities , the max planck society refused to do this , which gave them the opportunity to found new research institutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1964 , this was the office of the famed east german biochemist karl mothes , the ipb 's first director publication restrictions for east german research the german democratic republic , or gdr as it was known in english , focused on other hard sciences , including chemistry , biotechnology and nuclear science .
the gdr received reactor technology from the soviet union .
while research studies from the hard sciences had the chance to be published in western journals , it was much tougher for the social sciences and humanities , according to dieter hoffman , a fellow at the max planck institute for the history of science in berlin .
before the wall came down , hoffmann worked at the east german academy of sciences in the institute for theory and the history of science . "
it was not possible for me for instance , to publish in western journals , " said hoffmann , " and also i could not go to west to visit colleagues or conferences and to present there my scientific research . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people who worked at the ipb during the east german period lost their jobs or were forced to retire scientists who did n't toe the party line , or who were suspected of criticizing the regime quickly found their work censored or not published at all .
still , there were some instances that proved to be beneficial for young scientists under the gdr .
hildegard maria nickel worked as a sociologist at the academy of educational sciences in east germany .
she says now that she would never have had the opportunity to become a professor if she had n't grown up in east germany because of her background .
born to working class parents , nickel 's father was a migrant and she was one of eight children .
in the gdr , women were given the same opportunities as men to work and study .
despite such advances , nickel found herself increasingly disillusioned with a system that censored findings it did n't want to hear .
" i think we did really good research on the youth in gdr and we could see how they feel in the end of the 70s , 80s , that they want to leave the gdr , " said nickel , " but nobody wanted to know it and we could n't publish it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before the wall came down , dieter hoffmann worked at the east german academy of sciences in the institute for theory and the history of science .
unification brought new opportunities when the wall came down , nickel and hoffmann were able to find jobs in a unified germany , easily travel and freely publish .
but many older faculty , found themselves demoted or pushed out . "
some people went to an early retirement .
some people could start a new scientific career or continue their career in a new location or institute and some people became unemployed , " said hoffman .
one of the prime examples of scientists finding a new career under a unified germany was , of course angela merkel , germany 's current chancellor .
before she entered politics , merkel studied , worked and eventually earned her doctorate in quantum chemistry in east berlin .
while integrating east and west german science research centres was a difficult process for many , hoffmann added that in a unified germany today there are plenty of exciting areas of research .
after all , he observed , the city of jena is a world leader in optics and home to companies like carl zeiss , schott and jenoptik .
dresden specializes in material sciences , and freiberg in saxony is known for solar power manufacturing . "
i think what you find now on the landscape -lsb- is -rsb- very often amazing , " he said . " for instance here in berlin , this institute for laser physics - max-born institute - that 's one of the worldwide leading institutes in this field . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 28.09.2010 london becoming a hub for desalination technology großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the thames river in london is now a water source for the city britain opened its first desalination plant this summer , and more recently , another british firm meanwhile said this month that its new method of desalination could transform water on a global scale . earlier this month , a british firm called modern water announced that its six-month interim results for its " manipulated osmosis " system in oman is delivering " excellent initial results . "
the company claims that it can significantly reduce cost power consumption in desalination technology .
that , combined with existing research at local universities and britain 's first desalination plant , which came online in june , are turning london into one of europe 's hubs for desalination research and development .
southeast england drier than you think bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european environment agency says that southeast england is a region of " severe water stress " that may seem a bit strange , given britain 's reputation for wet summers and rainy days , people do n't generally think of britain as a country that is short on water . but southeast england is actually classified as an area of " severe water stress " by the european environment agency , with less rain than rome and a lower annual rainfall than most of germany .
although it is an unremarkable-looking set of grey warehouses and storage tanks , the thames water plant has revolutionized water provision in the capital .
in times of drought , the company says the plant can provide a new source of clean water to up to one million people .
" with climate change threatening hotter , drier summers and an additional 700,000 people forecast to move to london by 2021 , " the company wrote in an online statement in june , " the new water works will be available to help provide the capital 's supplies for the future - whatever the weather . "
as well as being britain 's first , the thames water plant is the only one in the world to use a four-stage version of a desalination process called reverse osmosis .
reverse osmosis – the standard in water desalination – involves pumping salt water at high pressure through very fine membranes .
the water molecules are forced through the membrane , but not the salt molecules , leaving clean water the other side .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the thames water plant is the first in the world to use a four-stage reverse osmosis system unlike similar plants around the world , in the thames water plant the salty water is sent through the membranes four times , meaning that an impressive 85 percent of the intake is converted into drinking water .
and by taking water from a tidal section of the river thames , the plant needs less energy than those which use more salty sea water .
secret agents meanwhile , on the other side of london from the thames plant , a company called modern water has developed a desalination process which it says could transform water provision around the globe .
the key innovations in modern water 's system - currently undergoing commercial trials in oman - are a process called forward osmosis , combined with the use of a secret " osmotic agent . "
" on one side of our membrane we have sea water which contains not only salt but other ions , " explained the executive chairman , neil macdougall in an interview with deutsche welle .
" on the other we have fresh water with a very concentrated solution using our osmotic agent .
using the natural process of osmosis , the fresh water is pulled across . "
in the next stage , the osmotic agent - whose exact composition is carefully guarded by the company - is removed from the water to produce clean drinking water .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london-based modern water says its test of a desalination facility in al khaluf , oman has been successful forward osmosis still requires a membrane to separate the salty from the clean water , but the water does n't have to be pumped at the high pressure necessary for reverse osmosis . that difference , according to modern water , accounts for a reduction in energy costs of around 30 percent .
and since energy costs constitute around half of the running costs of a typical desalination plant , this could dramatically change the business model for desalination plants .
according to the uk-based magazine global water intelligence – which tracks the desalination industry - the mystery surrounding modern water 's osmotic agent means that it is difficult to fully evaluate the process .
but modern water itself is confident enough to set the ambitious goal of bringing down the cost of desalinating water until it is on a par with the cost of treating fresh water .
growth industry the construction of new desalination plants , and recent advances by companies like modern water have brought desalination from the driest regions of the world – like the middle east – to more temperate regions like london , and that growth is set to continue .

"
the company claims that it can significantly reduce cost power consumption in desalination technology .
that , combined with existing research at local universities and britain 's first desalination plant , which came online in june , are turning london into one of europe 's hubs for desalination research and development .
southeast england drier than you think bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european environment agency says that southeast england is a region of " severe water stress " that may seem a bit strange , given britain 's reputation for wet summers and rainy days , people do n't generally think of britain as a country that is short on water . but southeast england is actually classified as an area of " severe water stress " by the european environment agency , with less rain than rome and a lower annual rainfall than most of germany .
although it is an unremarkable-looking set of grey warehouses and storage tanks , the thames water plant has revolutionized water provision in the capital .
in times of drought , the company says the plant can provide a new source of clean water to up to one million people .
" with climate change threatening hotter , drier summers and an additional 700,000 people forecast to move to london by 2021 , " the company wrote in an online statement in june , " the new water works will be available to help provide the capital 's supplies for the future - whatever the weather . "
as well as being britain 's first , the thames water plant is the only one in the world to use a four-stage version of a desalination process called reverse osmosis .
reverse osmosis – the standard in water desalination – involves pumping salt water at high pressure through very fine membranes .
the water molecules are forced through the membrane , but not the salt molecules , leaving clean water the other side .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the thames water plant is the first in the world to use a four-stage reverse osmosis system unlike similar plants around the world , in the thames water plant the salty water is sent through the membranes four times , meaning that an impressive 85 percent of the intake is converted into drinking water .
and by taking water from a tidal section of the river thames , the plant needs less energy than those which use more salty sea water .
secret agents meanwhile , on the other side of london from the thames plant , a company called modern water has developed a desalination process which it says could transform water provision around the globe .
the key innovations in modern water 's system - currently undergoing commercial trials in oman - are a process called forward osmosis , combined with the use of a secret " osmotic agent . "
" on one side of our membrane we have sea water which contains not only salt but other ions , " explained the executive chairman , neil macdougall in an interview with deutsche welle .
" on the other we have fresh water with a very concentrated solution using our osmotic agent .
using the natural process of osmosis , the fresh water is pulled across . "
in the next stage , the osmotic agent - whose exact composition is carefully guarded by the company - is removed from the water to produce clean drinking water .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london-based modern water says its test of a desalination facility in al khaluf , oman has been successful forward osmosis still requires a membrane to separate the salty from the clean water , but the water does n't have to be pumped at the high pressure necessary for reverse osmosis . that difference , according to modern water , accounts for a reduction in energy costs of around 30 percent .
and since energy costs constitute around half of the running costs of a typical desalination plant , this could dramatically change the business model for desalination plants .
according to the uk-based magazine global water intelligence – which tracks the desalination industry - the mystery surrounding modern water 's osmotic agent means that it is difficult to fully evaluate the process .
but modern water itself is confident enough to set the ambitious goal of bringing down the cost of desalinating water until it is on a par with the cost of treating fresh water .
growth industry the construction of new desalination plants , and recent advances by companies like modern water have brought desalination from the driest regions of the world – like the middle east – to more temperate regions like london , and that growth is set to continue .
" the current desalination capacity in the world is 68 million cubic meters a day , " said christopher gasson , the publisher of global water intelligence magazine , " and we think that will increase to around 130m cubic meters per day by 2016 , around doubling the whole industry . "
this does little to impress environmental groups , however , who share a fundamental objection to the desalination industry .

" in most cases our easiest source of new water for drinking water , or for industrial or cooling is to waste less water , " said phil dickie , the author of the wwf 's 2007 report on desalination , " and the cost of wasting less is much less than that of taking sea water and going through quite energy-intensive processes to turn it into fresh drinking water .

in november 2008 , he returned to iran and was subsequently arrested .
he was sentenced to 19.5 years in jail . an iranian court has sentenced iranian-canadian blogger hossein derakhshan to 19.5 years in prison , according to iranian media .
the conservative website , mashreghnews.ir , which is close to iran 's presidential office , said derakhshan was convicted on charges of cooperation with hostile countries , spreading propaganda against the ruling establishment , promotion of counterrevolutionary groups and insulting islamic thoughts and religious figures .
verdict can be appealed he was also given a five years ' ban from membership in political parties and activities in the media , and was sentenced to returning received funds in the amount of 30,750 euros , $ 2,900 , and 200 british pounds .
derakhshan can appeal , the report added .
before the verdict , immediate family members as well as reporters without borders had feared hossein derakhshan may be threatened with death penalty .
the iranian blogging pioneer has been held in a tehran prison for nearly two years and has been given little , if any , access to legal representation and no consular access to canadian authorities .
in recent days , family members had said that the prosecutor was seeking the death penalty for derakhshan .
a blogging leader ten years ago , hossein derakhshan moved from iran to canada to study .
that 's where he met his wife , who is also from iran , and became a canadian citizen .
in 2001 , from his base in toronto , derakhshan penned an online guide teaching iranians how to blog in their own language and championed persian blogging from both inside and outside of his homeland .
dubbed by some as " the blogfather , " derakhshan was frequently interviewed by western media outlets about the nascent iranian blogging community and his blogs in both english and persian .
as he continued at the time , he also became an outspoken critic of iran 's religious leadership .
blogging from toronto , and later paris and london , under the pen name " hoder , " derakhshan criticized iran 's elite as being inflexible and unwilling to engage in reform , while attacking ayatollah khamenei directly in his writing .
in 2005 , he served as a jury member in deutsche welle 's best of the blogs awards .
the following year , he made a very public trip to israel , which is normally forbidden for iranian citizens .
" i 'm going to israel as a citizen journalist and a peace activist , ” he wrote on his english blog at the time .
" i 'm a citizen of canada and i have the right to visit any country i want . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : derakhshan defended iran 's nuclear program in the face of protests a change of views later that year , derakhshan suddenly switched his political perspective and became a staunch nationalist and defender of the islamic republic .
in 2006 , derakhshan wrote an opinion piece defending iran 's nuclear program in the washington post .
he also began to attack activists and former friends on his blogs and in other media .
later he told the guardian newspaper in vehement words that if the united states attacked iran , he would return and fight for his homeland .
after visiting israel , derakhshan moved to london to pursue graduate studies . that 's when he went from making oppositional statements to outright supporting the new president .
he went on rhetorical rampages against many who had previously been his friends and colleagues and later was even sued for libel in the united states in 2007 .
in the fall of 2008 , before derakhshan returned to iran , he asked his friends to not take a public stance if he was arrested .
derakhshan had returned to iran in late 2008 , apparently having secured a job offer at press tv , the country 's english-language news service , but was arrested two weeks after his arrival .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad himself asked for a swift resolution to the case .
arrested after two weeks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahmoud ahmadinejad called for a swift resolution to derakhshan 's case however , little is known about his current situation .
a brief statement made three months ago by tehran accuses him of insulting the prophet muhammad along with iran 's spiritual leader and president , as well as disseminating " anti-revolutionary propaganda " and spying for israel .
derakhshan 's mother told an expatriate iranian news website , kamtarin.com , that she has visited her son in prison .
his physical and mental conditions are worrisome .
canadian citizenship not accepted unlike other possible death penalty cases in iran , the customary wave of popular solidarity failed to materialize behind derakhshan , although there has been some attention online and in the canadian media .
even the mayor of paris , bertrand delanoe , rallied to his support in a statement on his website .
" in the name of paris , i solemnly call upon the judicial authorities of tehran to not condemn hossein derakhshan to death , " he wrote last week . " and i invite the mobilization of all of our energies to save this honorable , courageous and dignified life . "
but derakhshan 's political stance and relationship to ahmadinejad remains clouded .
iranian authorities have not accepted derakhshan efforts to invoke his rights as a canadian citizen .
" despite the iranian government ’ s position , we consider mr. derakhshan to be a canadian citizen , " wrote lisa monette , a spokesperson from the canadian department of foreign affairs and international trade , in a statement sent to deutsche welle .
" we will continue to press the iranian authorities for access , as we have in similar cases involving dual nationals in other jurisdictions .
canada continues to urge iran to fully respect all of its human rights obligations , both in law and in practice . "
iranian authorities have arrested numerous bloggers in recent years in a bid to clamp down on internet dissent .

can you put a figure to what a single bee yields in its lifetime ?
what ’ s the actual value of the role played by mangroves in protecting coastlines and marine life ?
questions like these have never really been asked until now , with nature ’ s services taken largely for granted and therefore never precisely quantified .
but it 's a way of thinking that 's been gathering pace ever since the group of eight industrialized nations commissioned a report in 2007 from the united nations environment program .
the aim was to draw attention to the global benefits of biodiversity , and to the social and economic costs of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation .
the precursor to the teeb study -lrb- the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity -rrb- was the stern review compiled by british economist nicholas stern , chair of the grantham research institute on climate change and the environment at the london school of economics .
this 2006 report was one of the first in-depth studies of the effects of global warming on the world economy .
" with teeb , we want to spell out how much natural capital is worth , " said christoph schroeter-schlaack from the helmholtz center for environmental research -lrb- ufz -rrb- in leipzig , who worked on the study .
" we also want to ensure that the financial value of the environment is taken into greater consideration during the process of political and economic decision-making . "
funds to save forests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harvesting rubber does n't have to damage the environment but still brings farmers a good yield the final teeb synthesis report will be released in october at the 10th conference of parties to the convention of biological diversity meeting in nagoya , japan .
then , in december , environmental economics will be topping the agenda at the un climate summit in cancún , when experts will be calling for sustainable management of forest resources to be integrated into international climate agreements .
environment ministers will also be discussing a forest protection fund which would award subsidies to developing nations that protect their forests instead of selling them off to clear land that can then be used for agriculture , for example .
a number of south american countries will be bringing their own ideas to the table , including brazil , ecuador , guyana and costa rica , which is currently playing a pioneering role in terms of forest protection .
enormous value bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mangroves serve as natural dykes clearly , it has grasped the significance of forest economics . forests have a huge financial value .
as the teeb study shows , deforestation costs the world between $ 2 and 5 trillion worth of natural capital a year – whereas it would cost a mere $ 60 billion to conserve threatened forests .
the smaller the eco-system , the more precise the studies .
according to the ufz , one hectare of wood in the middle of the southwestern city of freiburg is worth almost 13,000 euros across a period of 100 years .
it acts as an air and water filter , a carbon sink , a supplier of timber and an employer for lumberjacks and a service provider for locals who come here in their leisure time – and save money , since these services are free .
factors contributing to the studies include the role played by biodiversity in boosting the efficiency of an eco-system .
estuaries and mangroves are especially valuable types of landscape because flood protection and fishing opportunities are just some of the services they provide .
in vietnam , planting and protecting nearly 12,000 hectares of mangroves cost $ 1.1 million but saved annual expenditures on dyke maintenance of $ 7.3 million .
investment in dyke building is absorbed into vietnam ’ s gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , but the economic contribution of the mangroves is never quantified .
in fact , their very destruction is seen as boosting gdp – much to the dismay of environmental economists .
a new mindset bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say illegal fishing is destroying valuable coral reefs they are keen to promote the idea of environmental indicators of growth and a new mindset : us ecological economist robert costanza has proposed that businesses pay into a precautionary fund when embarking on high-risk ventures , and can claim their payment back only if the project proves to cause little or no environmental damage .
bp would have had to pay up over 25 percent of the entire value of the company before it began drilling for oil in the gulf of mexico , constanza said .
" what would have happened then ? " he asks .
" either it would ’ ve decided not to drill , or it would have looked into ways to reduce the risk and increased its investments in safe technology . "
the recent oil disaster in the us is a perfect illustration of how quickly precautionary environmental protection can pay off .
the global fishing industry would also stand to profit .
a detailed study has yet to be carried out , but the world bank estimates that the fishing industry loses an annual $ 50 billion because of smaller catches despite rising expenditure on ships and equipment .
stephan lutter is an expert on fishing with the world wildlife fund , and stressed that the costs incurred by the destruction of valuable coral reefs by trawl nets , by-catches and illegal fishing have yet to be calculated .
" the fishing frenzy means that right now , everyone is a loser , " he said .
a rethink is long overdue .
studies such as teeb can help bring it about – and unlike the value of nature ’ s services , their message can be quantified .
ultimately , the economics of nature are based on a 1:100 ratio : nature pays back an average 100 euros for every euro invested in environmental protection – with services whose value has been overlooked for too long .

the precursor to the teeb study -lrb- the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity -rrb- was the stern review compiled by british economist nicholas stern , chair of the grantham research institute on climate change and the environment at the london school of economics .
this 2006 report was one of the first in-depth studies of the effects of global warming on the world economy .
" with teeb , we want to spell out how much natural capital is worth , " said christoph schroeter-schlaack from the helmholtz center for environmental research -lrb- ufz -rrb- in leipzig , who worked on the study .
" we also want to ensure that the financial value of the environment is taken into greater consideration during the process of political and economic decision-making . "
funds to save forests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harvesting rubber does n't have to damage the environment but still brings farmers a good yield the final teeb synthesis report will be released in october at the 10th conference of parties to the convention of biological diversity meeting in nagoya , japan .
then , in december , environmental economics will be topping the agenda at the un climate summit in cancún , when experts will be calling for sustainable management of forest resources to be integrated into international climate agreements .
environment ministers will also be discussing a forest protection fund which would award subsidies to developing nations that protect their forests instead of selling them off to clear land that can then be used for agriculture , for example .
a number of south american countries will be bringing their own ideas to the table , including brazil , ecuador , guyana and costa rica , which is currently playing a pioneering role in terms of forest protection .
enormous value bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mangroves serve as natural dykes clearly , it has grasped the significance of forest economics . forests have a huge financial value .
as the teeb study shows , deforestation costs the world between $ 2 and 5 trillion worth of natural capital a year – whereas it would cost a mere $ 60 billion to conserve threatened forests .
the smaller the eco-system , the more precise the studies .
according to the ufz , one hectare of wood in the middle of the southwestern city of freiburg is worth almost 13,000 euros across a period of 100 years .
it acts as an air and water filter , a carbon sink , a supplier of timber and an employer for lumberjacks and a service provider for locals who come here in their leisure time – and save money , since these services are free .
factors contributing to the studies include the role played by biodiversity in boosting the efficiency of an eco-system .
estuaries and mangroves are especially valuable types of landscape because flood protection and fishing opportunities are just some of the services they provide .
in vietnam , planting and protecting nearly 12,000 hectares of mangroves cost $ 1.1 million but saved annual expenditures on dyke maintenance of $ 7.3 million .
investment in dyke building is absorbed into vietnam ’ s gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , but the economic contribution of the mangroves is never quantified .
in fact , their very destruction is seen as boosting gdp – much to the dismay of environmental economists .
a new mindset bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say illegal fishing is destroying valuable coral reefs they are keen to promote the idea of environmental indicators of growth and a new mindset : us ecological economist robert costanza has proposed that businesses pay into a precautionary fund when embarking on high-risk ventures , and can claim their payment back only if the project proves to cause little or no environmental damage .
bp would have had to pay up over 25 percent of the entire value of the company before it began drilling for oil in the gulf of mexico , constanza said .
" what would have happened then ? " he asks .
" either it would ’ ve decided not to drill , or it would have looked into ways to reduce the risk and increased its investments in safe technology . "
the recent oil disaster in the us is a perfect illustration of how quickly precautionary environmental protection can pay off .
the global fishing industry would also stand to profit .
a detailed study has yet to be carried out , but the world bank estimates that the fishing industry loses an annual $ 50 billion because of smaller catches despite rising expenditure on ships and equipment .
stephan lutter is an expert on fishing with the world wildlife fund , and stressed that the costs incurred by the destruction of valuable coral reefs by trawl nets , by-catches and illegal fishing have yet to be calculated .
" the fishing frenzy means that right now , everyone is a loser , " he said .
a rethink is long overdue .
studies such as teeb can help bring it about – and unlike the value of nature ’ s services , their message can be quantified .
ultimately , the economics of nature are based on a 1:100 ratio : nature pays back an average 100 euros for every euro invested in environmental protection – with services whose value has been overlooked for too long .

he talked with dw about what might be his last record as a solo artist . it 's easy to see why phil collins is ready to call it quits on solo work .
after eight grammy awards , an oscar for " best original song , " a golden globe , 100 million albums sold -lrb- 250 million counting his work with rock band genesis -rrb- , there 's just not much ground left for the drummer-turned-singer to cover . collins has also made a name for himself as a soundtrack composer , producer and big band leader . featuring cover versions of 1960 ’ s motown songs , " going back " is phil collins ' eighth studio album .
deutsche welle spoke with collins about what could well be his last solo record . click on the link below to listen to dw-radio ’ s hits in germany , featuring phil collins . deutsche welle : although you had previously announced the end of your solo career , you recently released " going back , " an album of motown cover versions .
what 's the story ?
phil collins : i 'm not sure i like what phil collins became , so i 've kind of written myself out of the story .
like if i was the writer of a book , i 've just written the main character out .
he suddenly died mysteriously and now the police are trying to find the murderer !
i 'm very proud of everything i 've done , but i do n't think i 'm ready to launch myself back into it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : collins ' cd " going back " was number two in the german charts after its release this record is something i ’ ve always wanted to do .
to me it 's almost like not part of phil collins ' career .
phil collins ' career is over .
this is something i needed to do and always wanted to do , which is to sing some of my favorite songs that i grew up with in the 60 's .
so this is a special case . so did recording it feel like taking a trip down memory lane ? there was one group called the action who played all these songs on the record .
the record is pretty much their set list .
i used to go and see them every time they played -lsb- in the london club -rsb- the marquee .
i 'd go out the next day and buy the originals .
they did versions of all those songs .
that turned me on to the original versions .
that 's why i paid them a lot of respect in the sleeve notes .
in fact , the drummer was my biggest hero , and he 's now one of my best friends .
so , i picture it very well - standing there and listening to this music being played live and what effect it had on my life . in terms of being near the end of a career - deliberately - it was a perfect circle . this music is what i started off listening to , and this is where i am now , doing the same thing .
it 's a beautiful journey . are you truly convinced that your solo career is over ?
i will always write music .
because of the way i write - in my little studio on my own at home - i will always make the demos , which are like painting the pictures .
i love doing that .
i 'm just not sure that i would necessarily say to a record company , " here 's my new record .
let 's put it out . " that lights a fuse that means you have to do a lot of other things . but it 's not because i feel old .
i mean , i am 59 , but it 's not anything to do with that or feeling tired .
i just feel like i want to be in control of my own life and help bring my kids up .
plus , i have other interests that i 'm very excited about . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the singer sees texas history and the lore of the american west in his future such as ?
i know it sounds boring or strange to fans , but i 've had this lifelong fascination with texas history , mainly because of davy crockett and the disney films in the early 50 's and then john wayne 's film " the alamo . "
i started to collect letters and documents , cannonballs , rifles , knives and swords from that whole period .
i 've also just co-authored a book on the subject .
it will be out in a year .
so , i can see myself getting more involved in that as a hobby . you 've been suffering from a painful spinal injury in recent years .
how are you now ?
mentally , i 'm okay .
i 've just got a few physical problems that i 'm trying to win over .
i have a problem with my arm .
at the moment i ca n't play the drums and piano , and i 'm not convinced that i ever will be able to again .
i 've had all the operations that i could have .
so we wait and see . interview : reinhold hoenle -lrb- df -rrb- editor : rick fulker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

can you put a figure to what a single bee yields in its lifetime ?
what ’ s the actual value of the role played by mangroves in protecting coastlines and marine life ?
questions like these have never really been asked until now , with nature ’ s services taken largely for granted and therefore never precisely quantified .
but it 's a way of thinking that 's been gathering pace ever since the group of eight industrialized nations commissioned a report in 2007 from the united nations environment program .
the aim was to draw attention to the global benefits of biodiversity , and to the social and economic costs of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation .
the precursor to the teeb study -lrb- the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity -rrb- was the stern review compiled by british economist nicholas stern , chair of the grantham research institute on climate change and the environment at the london school of economics .
this 2006 report was one of the first in-depth studies of the effects of global warming on the world economy .
" with teeb , we want to spell out how much natural capital is worth , " said christoph schroeter-schlaack from the helmholtz center for environmental research -lrb- ufz -rrb- in leipzig , who worked on the study .
" we also want to ensure that the financial value of the environment is taken into greater consideration during the process of political and economic decision-making . "
funds to save forests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harvesting rubber does n't have to damage the environment but still brings farmers a good yield the final teeb synthesis report will be released in october at the 10th conference of parties to the convention of biological diversity meeting in nagoya , japan .
then , in december , environmental economics will be topping the agenda at the un climate summit in cancún , when experts will be calling for sustainable management of forest resources to be integrated into international climate agreements .
environment ministers will also be discussing a forest protection fund which would award subsidies to developing nations that protect their forests instead of selling them off to clear land that can then be used for agriculture , for example .
a number of south american countries will be bringing their own ideas to the table , including brazil , ecuador , guyana and costa rica , which is currently playing a pioneering role in terms of forest protection .
enormous value bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mangroves serve as natural dykes clearly , it has grasped the significance of forest economics . forests have a huge financial value .
as the teeb study shows , deforestation costs the world between $ 2 and 5 trillion worth of natural capital a year – whereas it would cost a mere $ 60 billion to conserve threatened forests .
the smaller the eco-system , the more precise the studies .
according to the ufz , one hectare of wood in the middle of the southwestern city of freiburg is worth almost 13,000 euros across a period of 100 years .
it acts as an air and water filter , a carbon sink , a supplier of timber and an employer for lumberjacks and a service provider for locals who come here in their leisure time – and save money , since these services are free .
factors contributing to the studies include the role played by biodiversity in boosting the efficiency of an eco-system .
estuaries and mangroves are especially valuable types of landscape because flood protection and fishing opportunities are just some of the services they provide .
in vietnam , planting and protecting nearly 12,000 hectares of mangroves cost $ 1.1 million but saved annual expenditures on dyke maintenance of $ 7.3 million .
investment in dyke building is absorbed into vietnam ’ s gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , but the economic contribution of the mangroves is never quantified .
in fact , their very destruction is seen as boosting gdp – much to the dismay of environmental economists .
a new mindset bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say illegal fishing is destroying valuable coral reefs they are keen to promote the idea of environmental indicators of growth and a new mindset : us ecological economist robert costanza has proposed that businesses pay into a precautionary fund when embarking on high-risk ventures , and can claim their payment back only if the project proves to cause little or no environmental damage .
bp would have had to pay up over 25 percent of the entire value of the company before it began drilling for oil in the gulf of mexico , constanza said .
" what would have happened then ? " he asks .
" either it would ’ ve decided not to drill , or it would have looked into ways to reduce the risk and increased its investments in safe technology . "
the recent oil disaster in the us is a perfect illustration of how quickly precautionary environmental protection can pay off .
the global fishing industry would also stand to profit .
a detailed study has yet to be carried out , but the world bank estimates that the fishing industry loses an annual $ 50 billion because of smaller catches despite rising expenditure on ships and equipment .
stephan lutter is an expert on fishing with the world wildlife fund , and stressed that the costs incurred by the destruction of valuable coral reefs by trawl nets , by-catches and illegal fishing have yet to be calculated .
" the fishing frenzy means that right now , everyone is a loser , " he said .
a rethink is long overdue .
studies such as teeb can help bring it about – and unlike the value of nature ’ s services , their message can be quantified .
ultimately , the economics of nature are based on a 1:100 ratio : nature pays back an average 100 euros for every euro invested in environmental protection – with services whose value has been overlooked for too long .

it acts as an air and water filter , a carbon sink , a supplier of timber and an employer for lumberjacks and a service provider for locals who come here in their leisure time – and save money , since these services are free .
factors contributing to the studies include the role played by biodiversity in boosting the efficiency of an eco-system .
estuaries and mangroves are especially valuable types of landscape because flood protection and fishing opportunities are just some of the services they provide .
in vietnam , planting and protecting nearly 12,000 hectares of mangroves cost $ 1.1 million but saved annual expenditures on dyke maintenance of $ 7.3 million .
investment in dyke building is absorbed into vietnam ’ s gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , but the economic contribution of the mangroves is never quantified .
in fact , their very destruction is seen as boosting gdp – much to the dismay of environmental economists .
a new mindset bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say illegal fishing is destroying valuable coral reefs they are keen to promote the idea of environmental indicators of growth and a new mindset : us ecological economist robert costanza has proposed that businesses pay into a precautionary fund when embarking on high-risk ventures , and can claim their payment back only if the project proves to cause little or no environmental damage .
bp would have had to pay up over 25 percent of the entire value of the company before it began drilling for oil in the gulf of mexico , constanza said .
" what would have happened then ? " he asks .
" either it would ’ ve decided not to drill , or it would have looked into ways to reduce the risk and increased its investments in safe technology . "
the recent oil disaster in the us is a perfect illustration of how quickly precautionary environmental protection can pay off .
the global fishing industry would also stand to profit .
a detailed study has yet to be carried out , but the world bank estimates that the fishing industry loses an annual $ 50 billion because of smaller catches despite rising expenditure on ships and equipment .
stephan lutter is an expert on fishing with the world wildlife fund , and stressed that the costs incurred by the destruction of valuable coral reefs by trawl nets , by-catches and illegal fishing have yet to be calculated .
" the fishing frenzy means that right now , everyone is a loser , " he said .
a rethink is long overdue .
studies such as teeb can help bring it about – and unlike the value of nature ’ s services , their message can be quantified .
ultimately , the economics of nature are based on a 1:100 ratio : nature pays back an average 100 euros for every euro invested in environmental protection – with services whose value has been overlooked for too long .

can you put a figure to what a single bee yields in its lifetime ?
what ’ s the actual value of the role played by mangroves in protecting coastlines and marine life ?
questions like these have never really been asked until now , with nature ’ s services taken largely for granted and therefore never precisely quantified .
but it 's a way of thinking that 's been gathering pace ever since the group of eight industrialized nations commissioned a report in 2007 from the united nations environment program .
the aim was to draw attention to the global benefits of biodiversity , and to the social and economic costs of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation .
the precursor to the teeb study -lrb- the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity -rrb- was the stern review compiled by british economist nicholas stern , chair of the grantham research institute on climate change and the environment at the london school of economics .
this 2006 report was one of the first in-depth studies of the effects of global warming on the world economy .
" with teeb , we want to spell out how much natural capital is worth , " said christoph schroeter-schlaack from the helmholtz center for environmental research -lrb- ufz -rrb- in leipzig , who worked on the study .
" we also want to ensure that the financial value of the environment is taken into greater consideration during the process of political and economic decision-making . "
funds to save forests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harvesting rubber does n't have to damage the environment but still brings farmers a good yield the final teeb synthesis report will be released in october at the 10th conference of parties to the convention of biological diversity meeting in nagoya , japan .
then , in december , environmental economics will be topping the agenda at the un climate summit in cancún , when experts will be calling for sustainable management of forest resources to be integrated into international climate agreements .
environment ministers will also be discussing a forest protection fund which would award subsidies to developing nations that protect their forests instead of selling them off to clear land that can then be used for agriculture , for example .
a number of south american countries will be bringing their own ideas to the table , including brazil , ecuador , guyana and costa rica , which is currently playing a pioneering role in terms of forest protection .
enormous value bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mangroves serve as natural dykes clearly , it has grasped the significance of forest economics . forests have a huge financial value .
as the teeb study shows , deforestation costs the world between $ 2 and 5 trillion worth of natural capital a year – whereas it would cost a mere $ 60 billion to conserve threatened forests .
the smaller the eco-system , the more precise the studies .
according to the ufz , one hectare of wood in the middle of the southwestern city of freiburg is worth almost 13,000 euros across a period of 100 years .
it acts as an air and water filter , a carbon sink , a supplier of timber and an employer for lumberjacks and a service provider for locals who come here in their leisure time – and save money , since these services are free .

opposition leaders say it ’ s a blow to the growing renewable energy sector . cabinet ministers in berlin on tuesday presented a new energy concept which they called exemplary and unmatched in the world , and which includes a controversial extension to germany 's nuclear power plants .
" the concept is not just a vision , " said environment minister norbert roettgen in berlin .
" by 2050 , about 80 percent of all energy consumed in this country will come from renewable sources , but on the way to this age we need nuclear power for an interim period to make this happen . "
under the new plan , the deadline to shut down germany 's nuclear power plants would be extended by an average of 12 years , with the last one running until 2036 .
merkel and her government say the extension is needed to keep germany running until renewable energy sources can supply the country with enough energy to replace what is produced by nuclear plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's cabinet insists the extension is necessary " a longer lifespan for nuclear power plants will help us keep energy prices affordable for both private consumers and industry , " said economics minister rainer bruederle .
" and it 'll be easier for us to reduce harmful gas emissions . "
effects on renewable energy that 's an argument that the opposition reject .
both sigmar gabriel , chairman of the spd , and juergen trittin , co-chairman of the greens , said the government 's plan would hurt the renewable energy industry with providers having to compete with nuclear energy to get a foothold in the market .
both trittin and gabriel are former environment ministers under previous coalition governments .
" with its energy plan , the government is about to block the creation of 300,000 new jobs in the renewables sector , " gabriel told german public broadcaster ard .
" many small and medium-sized firms involved in generating renewable energy are now being put under increasing pressure . "
the new plan also includes a tax on uranium fuel rods that bruederle said would generate 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- in government revenue annually .
a renewable energy fund would also be established that would collect 300 million euros from power companies each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without a majority in the bundesrat , merkel hopes to bypass the upper house constitutional court battle brewing the opposition is also displeased by suggestions from the government that the plan only needs the approval of the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , and not the bundesrat , the upper house , which represents the country 's 16 states .
merkel 's coalition of conservative christian democrats , their bavarian sister party , the christian social union and the liberal free democrats argues that the nuclear plant deadline is a federal issue , not a state matter .
the governing coalition lost its majority in the bundesrat in the state election in north rhine-westphalia in may .
it still has a majority in the bundestag .
the opposition has said if the government does bypass the bundesrat , it will go to the country 's constitutional court .

after unification , the west german government advisory body , the council of science and humanities was tasked with evaluating east german research facilities , according to karl ulrich mayer , a west german sociologist at yale university in the united states .
" a whole number of institutes were closed down , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle , nearly two decades after the official reunification date of october 3 , 1990 .
" -lsb- mainly -rsb- because it was assumed that they were too much of the party line , " he added .
mayer is now also president of the leibniz association , which comprises of 86 research institutions across germany , including many in the former east germany , like the leibniz institute for plant biochemistry outside of leipzig . he added that the hard sciences too , were not immune to cuts and layoffs .

in the gdr , women were given the same opportunities as men to work and study .
despite such advances , nickel found herself increasingly disillusioned with a system that censored findings it did n't want to hear .
" i think we did really good research on the youth in gdr and we could see how they feel in the end of the 70s , 80s , that they want to leave the gdr , " said nickel , " but nobody wanted to know it and we could n't publish it . "

for some it was easier than others , as older faculty were often forced out , and younger faculty found opportunities in the west . while the rest of the country was trying to figure how to integrate two governments , two currencies and two of nearly everything else , the sciences were no different .
after unification , the west german government advisory body , the council of science and humanities was tasked with evaluating east german research facilities , according to karl ulrich mayer , a west german sociologist at yale university in the united states .
" a whole number of institutes were closed down , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle , nearly two decades after the official reunification date of october 3 , 1990 .
" -lsb- mainly -rsb- because it was assumed that they were too much of the party line , " he added .
mayer is now also president of the leibniz association , which comprises of 86 research institutions across germany , including many in the former east germany , like the leibniz institute for plant biochemistry outside of leipzig . he added that the hard sciences too , were not immune to cuts and layoffs . "
in jena there was a big academy of science institutes in the area of penicillin research , that was reduced to about 550 people from 1,000 , " said mayer , " and these 550 people were then distributed among two leibniz institutes and a few university institutes . "
while some east german institutes were absorbed into existing west german facilities , the max planck society refused to do this , which gave them the opportunity to found new research institutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1964 , this was the office of the famed east german biochemist karl mothes , the ipb 's first director publication restrictions for east german research the german democratic republic , or gdr as it was known in english , focused on other hard sciences , including chemistry , biotechnology and nuclear science .
the gdr received reactor technology from the soviet union .
while research studies from the hard sciences had the chance to be published in western journals , it was much tougher for the social sciences and humanities , according to dieter hoffman , a fellow at the max planck institute for the history of science in berlin .
before the wall came down , hoffmann worked at the east german academy of sciences in the institute for theory and the history of science . "
it was not possible for me for instance , to publish in western journals , " said hoffmann , " and also i could not go to west to visit colleagues or conferences and to present there my scientific research . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people who worked at the ipb during the east german period lost their jobs or were forced to retire scientists who did n't toe the party line , or who were suspected of criticizing the regime quickly found their work censored or not published at all .
still , there were some instances that proved to be beneficial for young scientists under the gdr .
hildegard maria nickel worked as a sociologist at the academy of educational sciences in east germany .
she says now that she would never have had the opportunity to become a professor if she had n't grown up in east germany because of her background .
born to working class parents , nickel 's father was a migrant and she was one of eight children .
in the gdr , women were given the same opportunities as men to work and study .
despite such advances , nickel found herself increasingly disillusioned with a system that censored findings it did n't want to hear .
" i think we did really good research on the youth in gdr and we could see how they feel in the end of the 70s , 80s , that they want to leave the gdr , " said nickel , " but nobody wanted to know it and we could n't publish it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before the wall came down , dieter hoffmann worked at the east german academy of sciences in the institute for theory and the history of science .
unification brought new opportunities when the wall came down , nickel and hoffmann were able to find jobs in a unified germany , easily travel and freely publish .
but many older faculty , found themselves demoted or pushed out . "
some people went to an early retirement .
some people could start a new scientific career or continue their career in a new location or institute and some people became unemployed , " said hoffman .
one of the prime examples of scientists finding a new career under a unified germany was , of course angela merkel , germany 's current chancellor .
before she entered politics , merkel studied , worked and eventually earned her doctorate in quantum chemistry in east berlin .
while integrating east and west german science research centres was a difficult process for many , hoffmann added that in a unified germany today there are plenty of exciting areas of research .

a public spat between the two men became the writing on the wall for luzhkov . the kremlin 's website said on tuesday that russian president dmitry medvedev had signed a decree firing moscow mayor yury luzkhov after 18 years on the job .
the sacking comes after months of minor scandals and open mudslinging from both men .
the kremlin said the 74-year-old luzkhov was " dismissed from the position of moscow mayor because he has lost the confidence of the russian president . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow boomed under luzhkov , but major problems remained luzkhov was first appointed in 1992 by boris yeltsin in the wake of the collapse of the soviet union .
he oversaw the transformation of the russian capital from a gray , sleepy city into a glitzy and gleaming economic powerhouse , funneling petrodollars into massive construction projects .
he had long faced allegations of corruption over the business activities of his wife , construction billionaire yelena baturina , and had been accused by preservationists of destroying important historic buildings in the city center .
but a summer of missteps finally cost him his job .
a tough summer the construction boom has left the city with some of the world 's worst traffic and an overextended power grid .
luzhkov was criticized this july when repairs on the main highway leading to the city 's international airport led to lengthy delays .
he struck back over medvedev 's decision to suspend the construction of a highway through a forest outside the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : residents suffered through the smoke without their mayor in august he lost more points with muscovites when he continued his vacation in austria as forest and peat-bog fires filled the city with acrid smoke for weeks .
the kremlin publicly criticized his decision to stay away .
after his initial appointment , luzhkov was reelected in 1996 , 1999 and 2003 .
he was appointed for another four-year term by then-president vladimir putin after elections for regional governors and mayors of the country 's biggest cities were scrapped .
now luzhkov has become a victim of the kremlin 's shakeup of regional leaders .
diminishing popularity luzhkov was known for his bellicose manner and his flat , working man 's caps .
his socially conservative rhetoric targeted gay pride parades , which his police regularly broke up .
he riled progressives further when he allowed billboards with stalin 's image to be used in anniversary celebrations of the world war ii victory this last may .
his popularity had dropped with just 36 percent of respondents to a september opinion poll by the independent levada center saying he was doing a good job .
that was down from 40 percent in july and 65 percent in 2001 .
luzhkov said on television on monday that we would not step down voluntarily .
that was not necessary in the end , and he has now been replaced by his deputy , vladimir resin .

luzhkov was criticized this july when repairs on the main highway leading to the city 's international airport led to lengthy delays .
he struck back over medvedev 's decision to suspend the construction of a highway through a forest outside the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : residents suffered through the smoke without their mayor in august he lost more points with muscovites when he continued his vacation in austria as forest and peat-bog fires filled the city with acrid smoke for weeks .
the kremlin publicly criticized his decision to stay away .
after his initial appointment , luzhkov was reelected in 1996 , 1999 and 2003 .
he was appointed for another four-year term by then-president vladimir putin after elections for regional governors and mayors of the country 's biggest cities were scrapped .
now luzhkov has become a victim of the kremlin 's shakeup of regional leaders .
diminishing popularity luzhkov was known for his bellicose manner and his flat , working man 's caps .
his socially conservative rhetoric targeted gay pride parades , which his police regularly broke up .
he riled progressives further when he allowed billboards with stalin 's image to be used in anniversary celebrations of the world war ii victory this last may .
his popularity had dropped with just 36 percent of respondents to a september opinion poll by the independent levada center saying he was doing a good job .
that was down from 40 percent in july and 65 percent in 2001 .
luzhkov said on television on monday that we would not step down voluntarily .
that was not necessary in the end , and he has now been replaced by his deputy , vladimir resin .

a blogging leader ten years ago , hossein derakhshan moved from iran to canada to study .
that 's where he met his wife , who is also from iran , and became a canadian citizen .
in 2001 , from his base in toronto , derakhshan penned an online guide teaching iranians how to blog in their own language and championed persian blogging from both inside and outside of his homeland .
dubbed by some as " the blogfather , " derakhshan was frequently interviewed by western media outlets about the nascent iranian blogging community and his blogs in both english and persian .
as he continued at the time , he also became an outspoken critic of iran 's religious leadership .
blogging from toronto , and later paris and london , under the pen name " hoder , " derakhshan criticized iran 's elite as being inflexible and unwilling to engage in reform , while attacking ayatollah khamenei directly in his writing .
in 2005 , he served as a jury member in deutsche welle 's best of the blogs awards .
the following year , he made a very public trip to israel , which is normally forbidden for iranian citizens .
" i 'm going to israel as a citizen journalist and a peace activist , ” he wrote on his english blog at the time .
" i 'm a citizen of canada and i have the right to visit any country i want . "

in 2006 , derakhshan wrote an opinion piece defending iran 's nuclear program in the washington post .
he also began to attack activists and former friends on his blogs and in other media .
later he told the guardian newspaper in vehement words that if the united states attacked iran , he would return and fight for his homeland .
after visiting israel , derakhshan moved to london to pursue graduate studies . that 's when he went from making oppositional statements to outright supporting the new president .
he went on rhetorical rampages against many who had previously been his friends and colleagues and later was even sued for libel in the united states in 2007 .
in the fall of 2008 , before derakhshan returned to iran , he asked his friends to not take a public stance if he was arrested .
derakhshan had returned to iran in late 2008 , apparently having secured a job offer at press tv , the country 's english-language news service , but was arrested two weeks after his arrival .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad himself asked for a swift resolution to the case .
arrested after two weeks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahmoud ahmadinejad called for a swift resolution to derakhshan 's case however , little is known about his current situation .
a brief statement made three months ago by tehran accuses him of insulting the prophet muhammad along with iran 's spiritual leader and president , as well as disseminating " anti-revolutionary propaganda " and spying for israel .
derakhshan 's mother told an expatriate iranian news website , kamtarin.com , that she has visited her son in prison .
his physical and mental conditions are worrisome .
canadian citizenship not accepted unlike other possible death penalty cases in iran , the customary wave of popular solidarity failed to materialize behind derakhshan , although there has been some attention online and in the canadian media .
even the mayor of paris , bertrand delanoe , rallied to his support in a statement on his website .
" in the name of paris , i solemnly call upon the judicial authorities of tehran to not condemn hossein derakhshan to death , " he wrote last week . " and i invite the mobilization of all of our energies to save this honorable , courageous and dignified life . "
but derakhshan 's political stance and relationship to ahmadinejad remains clouded .
iranian authorities have not accepted derakhshan efforts to invoke his rights as a canadian citizen .

can you put a figure to what a single bee yields in its lifetime ?
what ’ s the actual value of the role played by mangroves in protecting coastlines and marine life ?
questions like these have never really been asked until now , with nature ’ s services taken largely for granted and therefore never precisely quantified .
but it 's a way of thinking that 's been gathering pace ever since the group of eight industrialized nations commissioned a report in 2007 from the united nations environment program .
the aim was to draw attention to the global benefits of biodiversity , and to the social and economic costs of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation .
the precursor to the teeb study -lrb- the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity -rrb- was the stern review compiled by british economist nicholas stern , chair of the grantham research institute on climate change and the environment at the london school of economics .
this 2006 report was one of the first in-depth studies of the effects of global warming on the world economy .
" with teeb , we want to spell out how much natural capital is worth , " said christoph schroeter-schlaack from the helmholtz center for environmental research -lrb- ufz -rrb- in leipzig , who worked on the study .
" we also want to ensure that the financial value of the environment is taken into greater consideration during the process of political and economic decision-making . "
funds to save forests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harvesting rubber does n't have to damage the environment but still brings farmers a good yield the final teeb synthesis report will be released in october at the 10th conference of parties to the convention of biological diversity meeting in nagoya , japan .
then , in december , environmental economics will be topping the agenda at the un climate summit in cancún , when experts will be calling for sustainable management of forest resources to be integrated into international climate agreements .
environment ministers will also be discussing a forest protection fund which would award subsidies to developing nations that protect their forests instead of selling them off to clear land that can then be used for agriculture , for example .
a number of south american countries will be bringing their own ideas to the table , including brazil , ecuador , guyana and costa rica , which is currently playing a pioneering role in terms of forest protection .
enormous value bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mangroves serve as natural dykes clearly , it has grasped the significance of forest economics . forests have a huge financial value .
as the teeb study shows , deforestation costs the world between $ 2 and 5 trillion worth of natural capital a year – whereas it would cost a mere $ 60 billion to conserve threatened forests .
the smaller the eco-system , the more precise the studies .
according to the ufz , one hectare of wood in the middle of the southwestern city of freiburg is worth almost 13,000 euros across a period of 100 years .
it acts as an air and water filter , a carbon sink , a supplier of timber and an employer for lumberjacks and a service provider for locals who come here in their leisure time – and save money , since these services are free .
factors contributing to the studies include the role played by biodiversity in boosting the efficiency of an eco-system .
estuaries and mangroves are especially valuable types of landscape because flood protection and fishing opportunities are just some of the services they provide .
in vietnam , planting and protecting nearly 12,000 hectares of mangroves cost $ 1.1 million but saved annual expenditures on dyke maintenance of $ 7.3 million .
investment in dyke building is absorbed into vietnam ’ s gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , but the economic contribution of the mangroves is never quantified .
in fact , their very destruction is seen as boosting gdp – much to the dismay of environmental economists .
a new mindset bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say illegal fishing is destroying valuable coral reefs they are keen to promote the idea of environmental indicators of growth and a new mindset : us ecological economist robert costanza has proposed that businesses pay into a precautionary fund when embarking on high-risk ventures , and can claim their payment back only if the project proves to cause little or no environmental damage .
bp would have had to pay up over 25 percent of the entire value of the company before it began drilling for oil in the gulf of mexico , constanza said .
" what would have happened then ? " he asks .
" either it would ’ ve decided not to drill , or it would have looked into ways to reduce the risk and increased its investments in safe technology . "
the recent oil disaster in the us is a perfect illustration of how quickly precautionary environmental protection can pay off .
the global fishing industry would also stand to profit .
a detailed study has yet to be carried out , but the world bank estimates that the fishing industry loses an annual $ 50 billion because of smaller catches despite rising expenditure on ships and equipment .
stephan lutter is an expert on fishing with the world wildlife fund , and stressed that the costs incurred by the destruction of valuable coral reefs by trawl nets , by-catches and illegal fishing have yet to be calculated .
" the fishing frenzy means that right now , everyone is a loser , " he said .
a rethink is long overdue .
studies such as teeb can help bring it about – and unlike the value of nature ’ s services , their message can be quantified .
ultimately , the economics of nature are based on a 1:100 ratio : nature pays back an average 100 euros for every euro invested in environmental protection – with services whose value has been overlooked for too long .

can you put a figure to what a single bee yields in its lifetime ?
what ’ s the actual value of the role played by mangroves in protecting coastlines and marine life ?
questions like these have never really been asked until now , with nature ’ s services taken largely for granted and therefore never precisely quantified .
but it 's a way of thinking that 's been gathering pace ever since the group of eight industrialized nations commissioned a report in 2007 from the united nations environment program .
the aim was to draw attention to the global benefits of biodiversity , and to the social and economic costs of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation .
the precursor to the teeb study -lrb- the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity -rrb- was the stern review compiled by british economist nicholas stern , chair of the grantham research institute on climate change and the environment at the london school of economics .
this 2006 report was one of the first in-depth studies of the effects of global warming on the world economy .
" with teeb , we want to spell out how much natural capital is worth , " said christoph schroeter-schlaack from the helmholtz center for environmental research -lrb- ufz -rrb- in leipzig , who worked on the study .
" we also want to ensure that the financial value of the environment is taken into greater consideration during the process of political and economic decision-making . "
funds to save forests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harvesting rubber does n't have to damage the environment but still brings farmers a good yield the final teeb synthesis report will be released in october at the 10th conference of parties to the convention of biological diversity meeting in nagoya , japan .
then , in december , environmental economics will be topping the agenda at the un climate summit in cancún , when experts will be calling for sustainable management of forest resources to be integrated into international climate agreements .
environment ministers will also be discussing a forest protection fund which would award subsidies to developing nations that protect their forests instead of selling them off to clear land that can then be used for agriculture , for example .
a number of south american countries will be bringing their own ideas to the table , including brazil , ecuador , guyana and costa rica , which is currently playing a pioneering role in terms of forest protection .
enormous value bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mangroves serve as natural dykes clearly , it has grasped the significance of forest economics . forests have a huge financial value .
as the teeb study shows , deforestation costs the world between $ 2 and 5 trillion worth of natural capital a year – whereas it would cost a mere $ 60 billion to conserve threatened forests .
the smaller the eco-system , the more precise the studies .
according to the ufz , one hectare of wood in the middle of the southwestern city of freiburg is worth almost 13,000 euros across a period of 100 years .
it acts as an air and water filter , a carbon sink , a supplier of timber and an employer for lumberjacks and a service provider for locals who come here in their leisure time – and save money , since these services are free .
factors contributing to the studies include the role played by biodiversity in boosting the efficiency of an eco-system .
estuaries and mangroves are especially valuable types of landscape because flood protection and fishing opportunities are just some of the services they provide .
in vietnam , planting and protecting nearly 12,000 hectares of mangroves cost $ 1.1 million but saved annual expenditures on dyke maintenance of $ 7.3 million .
investment in dyke building is absorbed into vietnam ’ s gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , but the economic contribution of the mangroves is never quantified .
in fact , their very destruction is seen as boosting gdp – much to the dismay of environmental economists .
a new mindset bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say illegal fishing is destroying valuable coral reefs they are keen to promote the idea of environmental indicators of growth and a new mindset : us ecological economist robert costanza has proposed that businesses pay into a precautionary fund when embarking on high-risk ventures , and can claim their payment back only if the project proves to cause little or no environmental damage .
bp would have had to pay up over 25 percent of the entire value of the company before it began drilling for oil in the gulf of mexico , constanza said .
" what would have happened then ? " he asks .
" either it would ’ ve decided not to drill , or it would have looked into ways to reduce the risk and increased its investments in safe technology . "
the recent oil disaster in the us is a perfect illustration of how quickly precautionary environmental protection can pay off .
the global fishing industry would also stand to profit .
a detailed study has yet to be carried out , but the world bank estimates that the fishing industry loses an annual $ 50 billion because of smaller catches despite rising expenditure on ships and equipment .
stephan lutter is an expert on fishing with the world wildlife fund , and stressed that the costs incurred by the destruction of valuable coral reefs by trawl nets , by-catches and illegal fishing have yet to be calculated .
" the fishing frenzy means that right now , everyone is a loser , " he said .
a rethink is long overdue .
studies such as teeb can help bring it about – and unlike the value of nature ’ s services , their message can be quantified .
ultimately , the economics of nature are based on a 1:100 ratio : nature pays back an average 100 euros for every euro invested in environmental protection – with services whose value has been overlooked for too long .

environment ministers will also be discussing a forest protection fund which would award subsidies to developing nations that protect their forests instead of selling them off to clear land that can then be used for agriculture , for example .
a number of south american countries will be bringing their own ideas to the table , including brazil , ecuador , guyana and costa rica , which is currently playing a pioneering role in terms of forest protection .
enormous value bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mangroves serve as natural dykes clearly , it has grasped the significance of forest economics . forests have a huge financial value .
as the teeb study shows , deforestation costs the world between $ 2 and 5 trillion worth of natural capital a year – whereas it would cost a mere $ 60 billion to conserve threatened forests .
the smaller the eco-system , the more precise the studies .
according to the ufz , one hectare of wood in the middle of the southwestern city of freiburg is worth almost 13,000 euros across a period of 100 years .
it acts as an air and water filter , a carbon sink , a supplier of timber and an employer for lumberjacks and a service provider for locals who come here in their leisure time – and save money , since these services are free .
factors contributing to the studies include the role played by biodiversity in boosting the efficiency of an eco-system .
estuaries and mangroves are especially valuable types of landscape because flood protection and fishing opportunities are just some of the services they provide .
in vietnam , planting and protecting nearly 12,000 hectares of mangroves cost $ 1.1 million but saved annual expenditures on dyke maintenance of $ 7.3 million .
investment in dyke building is absorbed into vietnam ’ s gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , but the economic contribution of the mangroves is never quantified .
in fact , their very destruction is seen as boosting gdp – much to the dismay of environmental economists .
a new mindset bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say illegal fishing is destroying valuable coral reefs they are keen to promote the idea of environmental indicators of growth and a new mindset : us ecological economist robert costanza has proposed that businesses pay into a precautionary fund when embarking on high-risk ventures , and can claim their payment back only if the project proves to cause little or no environmental damage .
bp would have had to pay up over 25 percent of the entire value of the company before it began drilling for oil in the gulf of mexico , constanza said .
" what would have happened then ? " he asks .
" either it would ’ ve decided not to drill , or it would have looked into ways to reduce the risk and increased its investments in safe technology . "
the recent oil disaster in the us is a perfect illustration of how quickly precautionary environmental protection can pay off .
the global fishing industry would also stand to profit .
a detailed study has yet to be carried out , but the world bank estimates that the fishing industry loses an annual $ 50 billion because of smaller catches despite rising expenditure on ships and equipment .
stephan lutter is an expert on fishing with the world wildlife fund , and stressed that the costs incurred by the destruction of valuable coral reefs by trawl nets , by-catches and illegal fishing have yet to be calculated .
" the fishing frenzy means that right now , everyone is a loser , " he said .
a rethink is long overdue .
studies such as teeb can help bring it about – and unlike the value of nature ’ s services , their message can be quantified .
ultimately , the economics of nature are based on a 1:100 ratio : nature pays back an average 100 euros for every euro invested in environmental protection – with services whose value has been overlooked for too long .

opposition leaders say it ’ s a blow to the growing renewable energy sector . cabinet ministers in berlin on tuesday presented a new energy concept which they called exemplary and unmatched in the world , and which includes a controversial extension to germany 's nuclear power plants .
" the concept is not just a vision , " said environment minister norbert roettgen in berlin .
" by 2050 , about 80 percent of all energy consumed in this country will come from renewable sources , but on the way to this age we need nuclear power for an interim period to make this happen . "
under the new plan , the deadline to shut down germany 's nuclear power plants would be extended by an average of 12 years , with the last one running until 2036 .
merkel and her government say the extension is needed to keep germany running until renewable energy sources can supply the country with enough energy to replace what is produced by nuclear plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's cabinet insists the extension is necessary " a longer lifespan for nuclear power plants will help us keep energy prices affordable for both private consumers and industry , " said economics minister rainer bruederle .
" and it 'll be easier for us to reduce harmful gas emissions . "
effects on renewable energy that 's an argument that the opposition reject .
both sigmar gabriel , chairman of the spd , and juergen trittin , co-chairman of the greens , said the government 's plan would hurt the renewable energy industry with providers having to compete with nuclear energy to get a foothold in the market .
both trittin and gabriel are former environment ministers under previous coalition governments .
" with its energy plan , the government is about to block the creation of 300,000 new jobs in the renewables sector , " gabriel told german public broadcaster ard .
" many small and medium-sized firms involved in generating renewable energy are now being put under increasing pressure . "
the new plan also includes a tax on uranium fuel rods that bruederle said would generate 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- in government revenue annually .
a renewable energy fund would also be established that would collect 300 million euros from power companies each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without a majority in the bundesrat , merkel hopes to bypass the upper house constitutional court battle brewing the opposition is also displeased by suggestions from the government that the plan only needs the approval of the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , and not the bundesrat , the upper house , which represents the country 's 16 states .
merkel 's coalition of conservative christian democrats , their bavarian sister party , the christian social union and the liberal free democrats argues that the nuclear plant deadline is a federal issue , not a state matter .
the governing coalition lost its majority in the bundesrat in the state election in north rhine-westphalia in may .
it still has a majority in the bundestag .
the opposition has said if the government does bypass the bundesrat , it will go to the country 's constitutional court .

in november 2008 , he returned to iran and was subsequently arrested .
he was sentenced to 19.5 years in jail . an iranian court has sentenced iranian-canadian blogger hossein derakhshan to 19.5 years in prison , according to iranian media .
the conservative website , mashreghnews.ir , which is close to iran 's presidential office , said derakhshan was convicted on charges of cooperation with hostile countries , spreading propaganda against the ruling establishment , promotion of counterrevolutionary groups and insulting islamic thoughts and religious figures .
verdict can be appealed he was also given a five years ' ban from membership in political parties and activities in the media , and was sentenced to returning received funds in the amount of 30,750 euros , $ 2,900 , and 200 british pounds .
derakhshan can appeal , the report added .
before the verdict , immediate family members as well as reporters without borders had feared hossein derakhshan may be threatened with death penalty .
the iranian blogging pioneer has been held in a tehran prison for nearly two years and has been given little , if any , access to legal representation and no consular access to canadian authorities .
in recent days , family members had said that the prosecutor was seeking the death penalty for derakhshan .
a blogging leader ten years ago , hossein derakhshan moved from iran to canada to study .
that 's where he met his wife , who is also from iran , and became a canadian citizen .
in 2001 , from his base in toronto , derakhshan penned an online guide teaching iranians how to blog in their own language and championed persian blogging from both inside and outside of his homeland .
dubbed by some as " the blogfather , " derakhshan was frequently interviewed by western media outlets about the nascent iranian blogging community and his blogs in both english and persian .

"
the company claims that it can significantly reduce cost power consumption in desalination technology .
that , combined with existing research at local universities and britain 's first desalination plant , which came online in june , are turning london into one of europe 's hubs for desalination research and development .
southeast england drier than you think bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european environment agency says that southeast england is a region of " severe water stress " that may seem a bit strange , given britain 's reputation for wet summers and rainy days , people do n't generally think of britain as a country that is short on water . but southeast england is actually classified as an area of " severe water stress " by the european environment agency , with less rain than rome and a lower annual rainfall than most of germany .
although it is an unremarkable-looking set of grey warehouses and storage tanks , the thames water plant has revolutionized water provision in the capital .
in times of drought , the company says the plant can provide a new source of clean water to up to one million people .
" with climate change threatening hotter , drier summers and an additional 700,000 people forecast to move to london by 2021 , " the company wrote in an online statement in june , " the new water works will be available to help provide the capital 's supplies for the future - whatever the weather . "
as well as being britain 's first , the thames water plant is the only one in the world to use a four-stage version of a desalination process called reverse osmosis .
reverse osmosis – the standard in water desalination – involves pumping salt water at high pressure through very fine membranes .
the water molecules are forced through the membrane , but not the salt molecules , leaving clean water the other side .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the thames water plant is the first in the world to use a four-stage reverse osmosis system unlike similar plants around the world , in the thames water plant the salty water is sent through the membranes four times , meaning that an impressive 85 percent of the intake is converted into drinking water .
and by taking water from a tidal section of the river thames , the plant needs less energy than those which use more salty sea water .
secret agents meanwhile , on the other side of london from the thames plant , a company called modern water has developed a desalination process which it says could transform water provision around the globe .
the key innovations in modern water 's system - currently undergoing commercial trials in oman - are a process called forward osmosis , combined with the use of a secret " osmotic agent . "
" on one side of our membrane we have sea water which contains not only salt but other ions , " explained the executive chairman , neil macdougall in an interview with deutsche welle .
" on the other we have fresh water with a very concentrated solution using our osmotic agent .
using the natural process of osmosis , the fresh water is pulled across . "
in the next stage , the osmotic agent - whose exact composition is carefully guarded by the company - is removed from the water to produce clean drinking water .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london-based modern water says its test of a desalination facility in al khaluf , oman has been successful forward osmosis still requires a membrane to separate the salty from the clean water , but the water does n't have to be pumped at the high pressure necessary for reverse osmosis . that difference , according to modern water , accounts for a reduction in energy costs of around 30 percent .
and since energy costs constitute around half of the running costs of a typical desalination plant , this could dramatically change the business model for desalination plants .
according to the uk-based magazine global water intelligence – which tracks the desalination industry - the mystery surrounding modern water 's osmotic agent means that it is difficult to fully evaluate the process .
but modern water itself is confident enough to set the ambitious goal of bringing down the cost of desalinating water until it is on a par with the cost of treating fresh water .
growth industry the construction of new desalination plants , and recent advances by companies like modern water have brought desalination from the driest regions of the world – like the middle east – to more temperate regions like london , and that growth is set to continue .
" the current desalination capacity in the world is 68 million cubic meters a day , " said christopher gasson , the publisher of global water intelligence magazine , " and we think that will increase to around 130m cubic meters per day by 2016 , around doubling the whole industry . "
this does little to impress environmental groups , however , who share a fundamental objection to the desalination industry .
they argue that by making available a practically unlimited source of new water from the sea , desalination discourages us from using the water we already have more wisely .
where environmentalists do agree with industry figures , however , is that with over a billion people short of water around the globe , new desalination techniques have the potential to provide water to people who otherwise would n't have it .
still , the world wildlife fund -lrb- wwf -rrb- believes that , in most cases , the easiest way to increase our water supply is simply to waste less water . " in most cases our easiest source of new water for drinking water , or for industrial or cooling is to waste less water , " said phil dickie , the author of the wwf 's 2007 report on desalination , " and the cost of wasting less is much less than that of taking sea water and going through quite energy-intensive processes to turn it into fresh drinking water .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 28.09.2010 london becoming a hub for desalination technology großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the thames river in london is now a water source for the city britain opened its first desalination plant this summer , and more recently , another british firm meanwhile said this month that its new method of desalination could transform water on a global scale . earlier this month , a british firm called modern water announced that its six-month interim results for its " manipulated osmosis " system in oman is delivering " excellent initial results . "
the company claims that it can significantly reduce cost power consumption in desalination technology .
that , combined with existing research at local universities and britain 's first desalination plant , which came online in june , are turning london into one of europe 's hubs for desalination research and development .
southeast england drier than you think bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european environment agency says that southeast england is a region of " severe water stress " that may seem a bit strange , given britain 's reputation for wet summers and rainy days , people do n't generally think of britain as a country that is short on water . but southeast england is actually classified as an area of " severe water stress " by the european environment agency , with less rain than rome and a lower annual rainfall than most of germany .
although it is an unremarkable-looking set of grey warehouses and storage tanks , the thames water plant has revolutionized water provision in the capital .
in times of drought , the company says the plant can provide a new source of clean water to up to one million people .
" with climate change threatening hotter , drier summers and an additional 700,000 people forecast to move to london by 2021 , " the company wrote in an online statement in june , " the new water works will be available to help provide the capital 's supplies for the future - whatever the weather . "
as well as being britain 's first , the thames water plant is the only one in the world to use a four-stage version of a desalination process called reverse osmosis .
reverse osmosis – the standard in water desalination – involves pumping salt water at high pressure through very fine membranes .
the water molecules are forced through the membrane , but not the salt molecules , leaving clean water the other side .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the thames water plant is the first in the world to use a four-stage reverse osmosis system unlike similar plants around the world , in the thames water plant the salty water is sent through the membranes four times , meaning that an impressive 85 percent of the intake is converted into drinking water .
and by taking water from a tidal section of the river thames , the plant needs less energy than those which use more salty sea water .
secret agents meanwhile , on the other side of london from the thames plant , a company called modern water has developed a desalination process which it says could transform water provision around the globe .
the key innovations in modern water 's system - currently undergoing commercial trials in oman - are a process called forward osmosis , combined with the use of a secret " osmotic agent . "
" on one side of our membrane we have sea water which contains not only salt but other ions , " explained the executive chairman , neil macdougall in an interview with deutsche welle .
" on the other we have fresh water with a very concentrated solution using our osmotic agent .
using the natural process of osmosis , the fresh water is pulled across . "
in the next stage , the osmotic agent - whose exact composition is carefully guarded by the company - is removed from the water to produce clean drinking water .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london-based modern water says its test of a desalination facility in al khaluf , oman has been successful forward osmosis still requires a membrane to separate the salty from the clean water , but the water does n't have to be pumped at the high pressure necessary for reverse osmosis . that difference , according to modern water , accounts for a reduction in energy costs of around 30 percent .
and since energy costs constitute around half of the running costs of a typical desalination plant , this could dramatically change the business model for desalination plants .
according to the uk-based magazine global water intelligence – which tracks the desalination industry - the mystery surrounding modern water 's osmotic agent means that it is difficult to fully evaluate the process .
but modern water itself is confident enough to set the ambitious goal of bringing down the cost of desalinating water until it is on a par with the cost of treating fresh water .
growth industry the construction of new desalination plants , and recent advances by companies like modern water have brought desalination from the driest regions of the world – like the middle east – to more temperate regions like london , and that growth is set to continue .

a public spat between the two men became the writing on the wall for luzhkov . the kremlin 's website said on tuesday that russian president dmitry medvedev had signed a decree firing moscow mayor yury luzkhov after 18 years on the job .
the sacking comes after months of minor scandals and open mudslinging from both men .
the kremlin said the 74-year-old luzkhov was " dismissed from the position of moscow mayor because he has lost the confidence of the russian president . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow boomed under luzhkov , but major problems remained luzkhov was first appointed in 1992 by boris yeltsin in the wake of the collapse of the soviet union .
he oversaw the transformation of the russian capital from a gray , sleepy city into a glitzy and gleaming economic powerhouse , funneling petrodollars into massive construction projects .
he had long faced allegations of corruption over the business activities of his wife , construction billionaire yelena baturina , and had been accused by preservationists of destroying important historic buildings in the city center .
but a summer of missteps finally cost him his job .
a tough summer the construction boom has left the city with some of the world 's worst traffic and an overextended power grid .
luzhkov was criticized this july when repairs on the main highway leading to the city 's international airport led to lengthy delays .
he struck back over medvedev 's decision to suspend the construction of a highway through a forest outside the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : residents suffered through the smoke without their mayor in august he lost more points with muscovites when he continued his vacation in austria as forest and peat-bog fires filled the city with acrid smoke for weeks .
the kremlin publicly criticized his decision to stay away .
after his initial appointment , luzhkov was reelected in 1996 , 1999 and 2003 .
he was appointed for another four-year term by then-president vladimir putin after elections for regional governors and mayors of the country 's biggest cities were scrapped .
now luzhkov has become a victim of the kremlin 's shakeup of regional leaders .
diminishing popularity luzhkov was known for his bellicose manner and his flat , working man 's caps .
his socially conservative rhetoric targeted gay pride parades , which his police regularly broke up .
he riled progressives further when he allowed billboards with stalin 's image to be used in anniversary celebrations of the world war ii victory this last may .
his popularity had dropped with just 36 percent of respondents to a september opinion poll by the independent levada center saying he was doing a good job .
that was down from 40 percent in july and 65 percent in 2001 .
luzhkov said on television on monday that we would not step down voluntarily .
that was not necessary in the end , and he has now been replaced by his deputy , vladimir resin .

the organization called for a halt to the practice . the international human rights organization amnesty international has released a damning report which says european union -lrb- eu -rrb- countries have been quietly deporting roma gypsies back to kosovo for over a year .

amnesty says that many of the roma are made to sign statements attesting their deportation is voluntary .
the report calculates that almost 10,000 roma are legally obliged to leave the country and are therefore at risk of forcible return to kosovo from germany alone .
it says the roma deportations began during negotiations of a bilateral readmission agreement between germany and kosovo in 2009 , which was finally signed on april 14 , 2010 , and came into force on september 1 , 2010 .

one company says it is ready to deploy the technology , but locals are fighting plans to bury the carbon under their town . energy giant vattenfall is currently testing its procedure for carbon capture and storage -lrb- ccs -rrb- in a part of eastern germany known as lausitz .
" we 're working on a process to remove co2 from waste gas .
that way we 're hoping to make the process of generating electricity from brown coal climate-friendlier " , said vattenfall 's lutz picard who shows visitors around daily to explain how the company wants to make coal production green .
the company says some 55 million tons of lignite , also known as brown coal , are still produced here every year .
the pilot facility , at vattenfall 's schwarze pumpe brown-coal power plant , is trialing a technique which the company calls ' oxyfuel ' because it involves adding large amounts of oxygen to the coal-burning process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oxygen is added when burning coal to extract the co2 half the equation " we add oxygen when we burn the coal " , said vattenfall 's lutz picard .
" that 's how we 're able to remove co2 from the waste gas because the concentration of co2 at the cauldron 's mouthpiece is higher . "
after it has been cleaned in several steps , the company says it is able to extract almost pure co2 .
at the moment , however , the co2 that is being extracted is simply being released back into the atmosphere , because the company is still waiting for a new law which would allow it to pump the gas underground .
germany 's government is expected to give the green light to ccs technology , in line with its recently-announced energy concept for the next 40 years , which aims to promote a massive expansion of renewable energies while keeping energy prices stable through " bridge " technologies like nuclear power .
at vattenfall 's schwarze pumpe site , this would mean trucks and pipelines would be used to transport co2 to the small town of beeskow nearby , where it would be pressed 1,000 meters below the surface .
vattenfall is confident of securing the necessary legislation , but it has since hit another snag : local resistance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beeskow 's inhabitants are against the plans to store co2 below their town guinea pigs the inhabitants of beeskow are against the plans and have put up big yellow crosses all along the road .
the pictures are reminiscent of the protest carried out by the anti-nuclear movement in other parts of germany , where energy giants are planning to build repositories for nuclear waste .
beeskow 's inhabitants say there has n't been enough investigation of the potential impact of pumping the carbon below their town , and they do n't want to be used as " guinea pigs . " many are afraid that the carbon might not be as clean as promised by vattenfall , and that sulfur and heavy metals like arsenic could get into the drinking water via the ground water .
even if the gas were clean , underground storage could lead to another problem , said activist hardy feldmann , because the liquid co2 would be pressed into porous sand stone which contains very salty water , or brine .
" the brine would have to make space for the co2 " , feldmann said .
" that would mean it would end up in the ground water .
so we would have high levels of salt in the ground water . "
so far , the city of beeskow has vetoed vattenfall 's plans to conduct geological research on the brine layers , and has attacked federal authorities for allowing vattenfall to proceed with its plans despite the absence of a law on the technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the co2 extracted be pure enough to be stored underground ?
export opportunity but these concerns are not shared at vattenfall .
lutz picard stresses that his company will do everything it can to purify the greenhouse gas and make the underground storage facility as secure as possible .
for him the technology is inevitable .
" in germany you may argue about where coal ranks as a source of energy " , picard said .
" but in countries like china or india you ca n't .
there , coal is available and people will use it .
and then the only question is : how do you use coal in a climate-friendly way ? "
for vattenfall , capturing and storing carbon dioxide could mean a big export opportunity – and perhaps one of it 's last in the coal mining industry , considering that in 40 years ' time , germany is supposed to end to its own coal production .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the remodeled jawaharlal nehru stadium is where the opening and closing ceremonies are due to take place several athletes from australia and the uk have already withdrawn from the games due to health and safety concerns . difficult situation from the start the crisis for games organizers started long ago with several deadlines for completion of sporting venues and infrastructure being missed . " we inherited a very difficult situation , " said sheila dikshit , the chief minister of delhi , who has been monitoring the preparations .
" but it is improving almost by the hour .
of course there have been some seepages that the builders should have looked at earlier but we will finish whatever we can and do whatever is possible . " but recent events have cast doubt on whether it is really possible to improve matters considerably .
a snake was found in a south african athlete 's room at the games village and a cobra was recovered from the r k khanna tennis stadium . bildunterschrift : many migrant workers have been sleeping on the streets of delhi mark doyle , an australian athlete , tried to downplay the incident however .
" i think we are okay from the snake point of view .
we are australians and used to dealing with the most venomous , so a couple of snakes is not going to be an issue for us . " after initially staying in hotels , more than 1,000 athletes , including 36 from australia , have now moved to the athletes ' village . blame game in full swing however , the blame game is in full swing and the knives are clearly sharpening for some accountability .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commonwealth games village dining hall will welcome thousands one man seems willing to take responsibility - suresh kalmadi , the commonwealth games organizing committee chairman -lrb- oc -rrb- , who has come under fire from all sides for his shabby handling of the preparations . " i have just come back from the village and i had lunch with all the athletes .
all of them love the village and said they had never seen such a village anywhere .
it is true that the cleanliness part was not maintained but this is because we got the venue late .
there was a big fight between the builder of the place and the contractor .
for three months , there was no work going on there .
i am ready to take all the blame - i will accept all the blame , " he said .
already organizers have overshot their budget by nine , spending at least $ 4.6 billion upgrading stadiums , refurbishing roads and building power and water utilities .
the government itself has spent $ 2.7 billion more on a new airport terminal . author : murali krishnan editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for some it was easier than others , as older faculty were often forced out , and younger faculty found opportunities in the west . while the rest of the country was trying to figure how to integrate two governments , two currencies and two of nearly everything else , the sciences were no different .
after unification , the west german government advisory body , the council of science and humanities was tasked with evaluating east german research facilities , according to karl ulrich mayer , a west german sociologist at yale university in the united states .
" a whole number of institutes were closed down , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle , nearly two decades after the official reunification date of october 3 , 1990 .
" -lsb- mainly -rsb- because it was assumed that they were too much of the party line , " he added .
mayer is now also president of the leibniz association , which comprises of 86 research institutions across germany , including many in the former east germany , like the leibniz institute for plant biochemistry outside of leipzig . he added that the hard sciences too , were not immune to cuts and layoffs . "
in jena there was a big academy of science institutes in the area of penicillin research , that was reduced to about 550 people from 1,000 , " said mayer , " and these 550 people were then distributed among two leibniz institutes and a few university institutes . "
while some east german institutes were absorbed into existing west german facilities , the max planck society refused to do this , which gave them the opportunity to found new research institutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1964 , this was the office of the famed east german biochemist karl mothes , the ipb 's first director publication restrictions for east german research the german democratic republic , or gdr as it was known in english , focused on other hard sciences , including chemistry , biotechnology and nuclear science .
the gdr received reactor technology from the soviet union .
while research studies from the hard sciences had the chance to be published in western journals , it was much tougher for the social sciences and humanities , according to dieter hoffman , a fellow at the max planck institute for the history of science in berlin .
before the wall came down , hoffmann worked at the east german academy of sciences in the institute for theory and the history of science . "
it was not possible for me for instance , to publish in western journals , " said hoffmann , " and also i could not go to west to visit colleagues or conferences and to present there my scientific research . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people who worked at the ipb during the east german period lost their jobs or were forced to retire scientists who did n't toe the party line , or who were suspected of criticizing the regime quickly found their work censored or not published at all .
still , there were some instances that proved to be beneficial for young scientists under the gdr .
hildegard maria nickel worked as a sociologist at the academy of educational sciences in east germany .
she says now that she would never have had the opportunity to become a professor if she had n't grown up in east germany because of her background .
born to working class parents , nickel 's father was a migrant and she was one of eight children .
in the gdr , women were given the same opportunities as men to work and study .
despite such advances , nickel found herself increasingly disillusioned with a system that censored findings it did n't want to hear .
" i think we did really good research on the youth in gdr and we could see how they feel in the end of the 70s , 80s , that they want to leave the gdr , " said nickel , " but nobody wanted to know it and we could n't publish it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before the wall came down , dieter hoffmann worked at the east german academy of sciences in the institute for theory and the history of science .
unification brought new opportunities when the wall came down , nickel and hoffmann were able to find jobs in a unified germany , easily travel and freely publish .
but many older faculty , found themselves demoted or pushed out . "
some people went to an early retirement .
some people could start a new scientific career or continue their career in a new location or institute and some people became unemployed , " said hoffman .
one of the prime examples of scientists finding a new career under a unified germany was , of course angela merkel , germany 's current chancellor .
before she entered politics , merkel studied , worked and eventually earned her doctorate in quantum chemistry in east berlin .
while integrating east and west german science research centres was a difficult process for many , hoffmann added that in a unified germany today there are plenty of exciting areas of research .
after all , he observed , the city of jena is a world leader in optics and home to companies like carl zeiss , schott and jenoptik .
dresden specializes in material sciences , and freiberg in saxony is known for solar power manufacturing . "
i think what you find now on the landscape -lsb- is -rsb- very often amazing , " he said . " for instance here in berlin , this institute for laser physics - max-born institute - that 's one of the worldwide leading institutes in this field . "

opposition leaders say it ’ s a blow to the growing renewable energy sector . cabinet ministers in berlin on tuesday presented a new energy concept which they called exemplary and unmatched in the world , and which includes a controversial extension to germany 's nuclear power plants .
" the concept is not just a vision , " said environment minister norbert roettgen in berlin .
" by 2050 , about 80 percent of all energy consumed in this country will come from renewable sources , but on the way to this age we need nuclear power for an interim period to make this happen . "
under the new plan , the deadline to shut down germany 's nuclear power plants would be extended by an average of 12 years , with the last one running until 2036 .
merkel and her government say the extension is needed to keep germany running until renewable energy sources can supply the country with enough energy to replace what is produced by nuclear plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's cabinet insists the extension is necessary " a longer lifespan for nuclear power plants will help us keep energy prices affordable for both private consumers and industry , " said economics minister rainer bruederle .
" and it 'll be easier for us to reduce harmful gas emissions . "
effects on renewable energy that 's an argument that the opposition reject .
both sigmar gabriel , chairman of the spd , and juergen trittin , co-chairman of the greens , said the government 's plan would hurt the renewable energy industry with providers having to compete with nuclear energy to get a foothold in the market .
both trittin and gabriel are former environment ministers under previous coalition governments .
" with its energy plan , the government is about to block the creation of 300,000 new jobs in the renewables sector , " gabriel told german public broadcaster ard .
" many small and medium-sized firms involved in generating renewable energy are now being put under increasing pressure . "
the new plan also includes a tax on uranium fuel rods that bruederle said would generate 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- in government revenue annually .
a renewable energy fund would also be established that would collect 300 million euros from power companies each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without a majority in the bundesrat , merkel hopes to bypass the upper house constitutional court battle brewing the opposition is also displeased by suggestions from the government that the plan only needs the approval of the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , and not the bundesrat , the upper house , which represents the country 's 16 states .
merkel 's coalition of conservative christian democrats , their bavarian sister party , the christian social union and the liberal free democrats argues that the nuclear plant deadline is a federal issue , not a state matter .
the governing coalition lost its majority in the bundesrat in the state election in north rhine-westphalia in may .
it still has a majority in the bundestag .
the opposition has said if the government does bypass the bundesrat , it will go to the country 's constitutional court .

opposition leaders say it ’ s a blow to the growing renewable energy sector . cabinet ministers in berlin on tuesday presented a new energy concept which they called exemplary and unmatched in the world , and which includes a controversial extension to germany 's nuclear power plants .
" the concept is not just a vision , " said environment minister norbert roettgen in berlin .
" by 2050 , about 80 percent of all energy consumed in this country will come from renewable sources , but on the way to this age we need nuclear power for an interim period to make this happen . "
under the new plan , the deadline to shut down germany 's nuclear power plants would be extended by an average of 12 years , with the last one running until 2036 .
merkel and her government say the extension is needed to keep germany running until renewable energy sources can supply the country with enough energy to replace what is produced by nuclear plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's cabinet insists the extension is necessary " a longer lifespan for nuclear power plants will help us keep energy prices affordable for both private consumers and industry , " said economics minister rainer bruederle .
" and it 'll be easier for us to reduce harmful gas emissions . "
effects on renewable energy that 's an argument that the opposition reject .
both sigmar gabriel , chairman of the spd , and juergen trittin , co-chairman of the greens , said the government 's plan would hurt the renewable energy industry with providers having to compete with nuclear energy to get a foothold in the market .
both trittin and gabriel are former environment ministers under previous coalition governments .
" with its energy plan , the government is about to block the creation of 300,000 new jobs in the renewables sector , " gabriel told german public broadcaster ard .
" many small and medium-sized firms involved in generating renewable energy are now being put under increasing pressure . "
the new plan also includes a tax on uranium fuel rods that bruederle said would generate 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- in government revenue annually .
a renewable energy fund would also be established that would collect 300 million euros from power companies each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without a majority in the bundesrat , merkel hopes to bypass the upper house constitutional court battle brewing the opposition is also displeased by suggestions from the government that the plan only needs the approval of the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , and not the bundesrat , the upper house , which represents the country 's 16 states .
merkel 's coalition of conservative christian democrats , their bavarian sister party , the christian social union and the liberal free democrats argues that the nuclear plant deadline is a federal issue , not a state matter .
the governing coalition lost its majority in the bundesrat in the state election in north rhine-westphalia in may .
it still has a majority in the bundestag .
the opposition has said if the government does bypass the bundesrat , it will go to the country 's constitutional court .

even some members of the ruling party are calling for it to be toned down . debate over a controversial bill to reform immigration and citizenship regulations began in the french parliament on tuesday , with members of both the ruling and opposition parties offering criticism .
the bill is france 's fifth piece of immigration legislation in seven years , and would , among other things , make it easier for the government to revoke french nationality from citizens who have been naturalized for less than 10 years and who have been convicted of killing or attacking a policeman or any public official .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bill also simplifies entry for highly qualified immigrants immigration minister eric besson , who first proposed the legislation , said in an interview with le parisien newspaper that he wanted his ministry to be " a machine to produce good french citizens . "
" last year we gave french nationality to 108,000 foreigners , " the newspaper quoted him as saying .
" being a ' good french person ' does n't mean denying your history , your roots or your french culture . "
besson 's original bill took a more moderate approach before president nicolas sarkozy and interior minister brice hortefeux toughened it during cabinet debate .
opposition on both sides in addition to the citizenship regulations , the bill would allow france to deport foreigners , including eu citizens , for theft , aggressive begging or abusing the right to remain in france for 30 days without permission by leaving and re-entering the country to renew that right . at the same time if would speed up entry procedures for highly qualified immigrants .
sarkozy 's government argues that the legislation would bring france into line with european union immigration directives , but critics have accused him of twisting those directives to fit a populist , anti-immigrant agenda , possibly to attract far-right voters ahead of presidential elections in 2012 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics like the bill to france 's expulsions of roma opposition socialist spokesman bruno le roux said if passed into law , the bill would amount to " another step taken in the deterioration of republican principles . "
etienne pinte , a member of parliament from sarkozy 's own conservative ump party , said the bill was an attempt to bring in votes in the far-right national front party .
he said he would seek up to 40 amendments to " humanize " the bill , or vote against it .
new york-based human rights watch has urged parliament to reject the bill and tied it in with france 's mass roma expulsions , the legality of which is currently the subject of debate in the european commission .
" it is shocking that the french government is pushing for measures that clearly target roma , " said hrw 's judith sunderland . " it smacks of a populist move at the expense of the most discriminated against and vulnerable people in europe today . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 28.09.2010 french legislators debate bill on immigration and citizenship großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bill is highly controversial with human rights groups the french parliament has begun debating a bill that would strip naturalized citizens of their nationality for committing certain crimes .
even some members of the ruling party are calling for it to be toned down . debate over a controversial bill to reform immigration and citizenship regulations began in the french parliament on tuesday , with members of both the ruling and opposition parties offering criticism .
the bill is france 's fifth piece of immigration legislation in seven years , and would , among other things , make it easier for the government to revoke french nationality from citizens who have been naturalized for less than 10 years and who have been convicted of killing or attacking a policeman or any public official .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bill also simplifies entry for highly qualified immigrants immigration minister eric besson , who first proposed the legislation , said in an interview with le parisien newspaper that he wanted his ministry to be " a machine to produce good french citizens . "
" last year we gave french nationality to 108,000 foreigners , " the newspaper quoted him as saying .
" being a ' good french person ' does n't mean denying your history , your roots or your french culture . "
besson 's original bill took a more moderate approach before president nicolas sarkozy and interior minister brice hortefeux toughened it during cabinet debate .
opposition on both sides in addition to the citizenship regulations , the bill would allow france to deport foreigners , including eu citizens , for theft , aggressive begging or abusing the right to remain in france for 30 days without permission by leaving and re-entering the country to renew that right . at the same time if would speed up entry procedures for highly qualified immigrants .
sarkozy 's government argues that the legislation would bring france into line with european union immigration directives , but critics have accused him of twisting those directives to fit a populist , anti-immigrant agenda , possibly to attract far-right voters ahead of presidential elections in 2012 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics like the bill to france 's expulsions of roma opposition socialist spokesman bruno le roux said if passed into law , the bill would amount to " another step taken in the deterioration of republican principles . "
etienne pinte , a member of parliament from sarkozy 's own conservative ump party , said the bill was an attempt to bring in votes in the far-right national front party .
he said he would seek up to 40 amendments to " humanize " the bill , or vote against it .
new york-based human rights watch has urged parliament to reject the bill and tied it in with france 's mass roma expulsions , the legality of which is currently the subject of debate in the european commission .
" it is shocking that the french government is pushing for measures that clearly target roma , " said hrw 's judith sunderland . " it smacks of a populist move at the expense of the most discriminated against and vulnerable people in europe today . "

"
the company claims that it can significantly reduce cost power consumption in desalination technology .
that , combined with existing research at local universities and britain 's first desalination plant , which came online in june , are turning london into one of europe 's hubs for desalination research and development .
southeast england drier than you think bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european environment agency says that southeast england is a region of " severe water stress " that may seem a bit strange , given britain 's reputation for wet summers and rainy days , people do n't generally think of britain as a country that is short on water . but southeast england is actually classified as an area of " severe water stress " by the european environment agency , with less rain than rome and a lower annual rainfall than most of germany .
although it is an unremarkable-looking set of grey warehouses and storage tanks , the thames water plant has revolutionized water provision in the capital .
in times of drought , the company says the plant can provide a new source of clean water to up to one million people .
" with climate change threatening hotter , drier summers and an additional 700,000 people forecast to move to london by 2021 , " the company wrote in an online statement in june , " the new water works will be available to help provide the capital 's supplies for the future - whatever the weather . "
as well as being britain 's first , the thames water plant is the only one in the world to use a four-stage version of a desalination process called reverse osmosis .
reverse osmosis – the standard in water desalination – involves pumping salt water at high pressure through very fine membranes .
the water molecules are forced through the membrane , but not the salt molecules , leaving clean water the other side .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the thames water plant is the first in the world to use a four-stage reverse osmosis system unlike similar plants around the world , in the thames water plant the salty water is sent through the membranes four times , meaning that an impressive 85 percent of the intake is converted into drinking water .
and by taking water from a tidal section of the river thames , the plant needs less energy than those which use more salty sea water .
secret agents meanwhile , on the other side of london from the thames plant , a company called modern water has developed a desalination process which it says could transform water provision around the globe .
the key innovations in modern water 's system - currently undergoing commercial trials in oman - are a process called forward osmosis , combined with the use of a secret " osmotic agent . "
" on one side of our membrane we have sea water which contains not only salt but other ions , " explained the executive chairman , neil macdougall in an interview with deutsche welle .
" on the other we have fresh water with a very concentrated solution using our osmotic agent .
using the natural process of osmosis , the fresh water is pulled across . "
in the next stage , the osmotic agent - whose exact composition is carefully guarded by the company - is removed from the water to produce clean drinking water .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london-based modern water says its test of a desalination facility in al khaluf , oman has been successful forward osmosis still requires a membrane to separate the salty from the clean water , but the water does n't have to be pumped at the high pressure necessary for reverse osmosis . that difference , according to modern water , accounts for a reduction in energy costs of around 30 percent .
and since energy costs constitute around half of the running costs of a typical desalination plant , this could dramatically change the business model for desalination plants .
according to the uk-based magazine global water intelligence – which tracks the desalination industry - the mystery surrounding modern water 's osmotic agent means that it is difficult to fully evaluate the process .
but modern water itself is confident enough to set the ambitious goal of bringing down the cost of desalinating water until it is on a par with the cost of treating fresh water .
growth industry the construction of new desalination plants , and recent advances by companies like modern water have brought desalination from the driest regions of the world – like the middle east – to more temperate regions like london , and that growth is set to continue .
" the current desalination capacity in the world is 68 million cubic meters a day , " said christopher gasson , the publisher of global water intelligence magazine , " and we think that will increase to around 130m cubic meters per day by 2016 , around doubling the whole industry . "
this does little to impress environmental groups , however , who share a fundamental objection to the desalination industry .
they argue that by making available a practically unlimited source of new water from the sea , desalination discourages us from using the water we already have more wisely .
where environmentalists do agree with industry figures , however , is that with over a billion people short of water around the globe , new desalination techniques have the potential to provide water to people who otherwise would n't have it .
still , the world wildlife fund -lrb- wwf -rrb- believes that , in most cases , the easiest way to increase our water supply is simply to waste less water . " in most cases our easiest source of new water for drinking water , or for industrial or cooling is to waste less water , " said phil dickie , the author of the wwf 's 2007 report on desalination , " and the cost of wasting less is much less than that of taking sea water and going through quite energy-intensive processes to turn it into fresh drinking water .

and economists , among others , are happy : consumer spending has long been a weak point in the country 's economic performance . german consumer confidence continues to climb as the economy strengthens and unemployment falls , boosting income expectations , according to a survey .
the gfk market research institute said tuesday that its forward-looking consumer confidence index for october rose to 4.9 points , up from a revised 4.3 in september , representing a three-year high .
" the decisive factor in the strong sentiment among consumers is the extremely positive development of the employment market , " gfk said in a statement .
falling unemployment germany 's unemployment rate was 7.6 percent last month .
that was approximately the level at which it was when the us investment bank lehman brothers collapsed two years ago , fueling a global financial crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling unemployment is bolstering consumer confidence although the german economy is showing signs of slower growth in the second half of the year , the federal labor agency 's iab research institute expects unemployment to drop slightly below 3 million people in 2011 to a nine-year low .
low inflation gfk also pointed to the low level of inflation , currently at around 1 percent , as another factor increasing consumer purchasing power .
the market researcher added that consumers in germany are already experiencing an improved income situation ; according to new data from the federal statistical office , gross monthly income after living expenses increased by 2.3 percent in the second quarter . germany , europe 's biggest economy , has enjoyed strong export-led growth this year .
its massive 2.2 percent growth in the second quarter over the previous three-month period has helped the 16-nation eurozone outperform the us .

a public spat between the two men became the writing on the wall for luzhkov . the kremlin 's website said on tuesday that russian president dmitry medvedev had signed a decree firing moscow mayor yury luzkhov after 18 years on the job .
the sacking comes after months of minor scandals and open mudslinging from both men .
the kremlin said the 74-year-old luzkhov was " dismissed from the position of moscow mayor because he has lost the confidence of the russian president . "

even some members of the ruling party are calling for it to be toned down . debate over a controversial bill to reform immigration and citizenship regulations began in the french parliament on tuesday , with members of both the ruling and opposition parties offering criticism .
the bill is france 's fifth piece of immigration legislation in seven years , and would , among other things , make it easier for the government to revoke french nationality from citizens who have been naturalized for less than 10 years and who have been convicted of killing or attacking a policeman or any public official .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bill also simplifies entry for highly qualified immigrants immigration minister eric besson , who first proposed the legislation , said in an interview with le parisien newspaper that he wanted his ministry to be " a machine to produce good french citizens . "
" last year we gave french nationality to 108,000 foreigners , " the newspaper quoted him as saying .
" being a ' good french person ' does n't mean denying your history , your roots or your french culture . "
besson 's original bill took a more moderate approach before president nicolas sarkozy and interior minister brice hortefeux toughened it during cabinet debate .
opposition on both sides in addition to the citizenship regulations , the bill would allow france to deport foreigners , including eu citizens , for theft , aggressive begging or abusing the right to remain in france for 30 days without permission by leaving and re-entering the country to renew that right . at the same time if would speed up entry procedures for highly qualified immigrants .
sarkozy 's government argues that the legislation would bring france into line with european union immigration directives , but critics have accused him of twisting those directives to fit a populist , anti-immigrant agenda , possibly to attract far-right voters ahead of presidential elections in 2012 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics like the bill to france 's expulsions of roma opposition socialist spokesman bruno le roux said if passed into law , the bill would amount to " another step taken in the deterioration of republican principles . "
etienne pinte , a member of parliament from sarkozy 's own conservative ump party , said the bill was an attempt to bring in votes in the far-right national front party .
he said he would seek up to 40 amendments to " humanize " the bill , or vote against it .
new york-based human rights watch has urged parliament to reject the bill and tied it in with france 's mass roma expulsions , the legality of which is currently the subject of debate in the european commission .
" it is shocking that the french government is pushing for measures that clearly target roma , " said hrw 's judith sunderland . " it smacks of a populist move at the expense of the most discriminated against and vulnerable people in europe today . "

institute director ahman sarmast told dw about the school 's roots and goals . afghanistan 's ministry of education established its first music school in 1973 .
the kabul-based school has had a tumultuous history , paralleling that of its home country .
since 2008 , musicologist and afghan native dr. ahmad sarmast has headed a new project at the afghanistan national institute of music -lrb- anim -rrb- that aims to help rebuild musical life in the country .
the project is sponsored in part by the world bank , the german government , the goethe institute and the german society of music merchants . dr. sarmast talked with deutsche welle about the challenges and promise of the endeavor .
deutsche welle : what does anim stand for ?
ahmad sarmast : the afghanistan national institute of music is the only music school in afghanistan .
students enroll in the fourth grade and they receive both formal and musical education .
they graduate after 10 years of continuous music education with a diploma in music .
our music department is divided into two branches : afghan traditional music and western classical music .
at the moment , we have 154 students , but eventually we will be able to host 300 .
where did the idea come from ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration is a major hurdle - but also a central goal - at the school i left my country at an early age after completing my studies in moscow .
actually , i am the first afghan with a doctorate in music .
since the collapse of najibullah 's leftist regime -lsb- in 1992 -rsb- , i have kept an eye on the evolution of music in my country .
i spent most of my time in exile in australia , and it was there that i thought about establishing a music school in my country of origin .
negotiations with the local administration and potential fundraisers began in 2007 , but the final implementation of the project took place in 2008 .
you had a comfortable life in australia .
what brought you back to afghanistan ?
one of the reasons was my background and my social status here .
my father was a well known conductor , but i also had the secret dream that i could help to change the minds of thousands of young afghans towards music .
many of those who grew up under the taliban regime were completely brainwashed against music .
in fact , kabul used to be a more cultivated and sophisticated city but most of the intellectuals and educated people of afghanistan left during the rule by the communist government and after its collapse .
kabul today is nothing but a big village , which has lost its once sophisticated and open-minded society .
you mentioned before that you have 154 students .
are all of them " street kids " ?
when i came to afghanistan my goal was to establish a music school just for street kids and orphans .
but after discussions with the ministry of education we agreed that 50 percent of the seats would be reserved for the most advantaged families of the country .
we did n't want to deprive any talented potential student from getting musical education .
at the moment , street kids still do n't make up 50 percent of the total because we have " inherited " some others that already belonged to the former school of fine arts .
today , we have 24 street kids with us .
some were selling chewing gum , plastic bags or boiled eggs in the street .
now , we give their families 30 us dollars to stay in school as a kind of compensation for their loss of income .
we are also trying to provide them with buses so they do n't need to waste any money at all on transportation .
what kind of problems do you face with this group of children ?
recently , i lost a very talented girl .
she wasn ’ t attending her classes , and i could n't contact her family .
just a few days ago , we discovered that she had been engaged .
she is only 14 .
there are also the difficulties of integrating the street kids into a basic school discipline .
we have to re-educate them , in the full meaning of the verb .
it also helps them to recover after so many years of war and destruction .
that is all that they have seen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarmast came home to afghanistan to head the music project do you have any other plans for the near future ?
once we have fully implemented the kabul center , we have plans to spread the idea to mazar-e sharif and to establish a second school there .
we are also planning a third school in herat and a fourth in jalalabad .
i have already started to gather funds for mazar-e sharif 's school , and germany is very interested .
their troops are based in the same area , in the north of the country , and berlin is investing in several other cultural projects there .
given the current situation of unrest and the apparently ever-growing power of the taliban , are n't you afraid that music might well be silenced again in the short term ?
i am a very optimistic man - otherwise , i would not be here now .
but more important is the fact that music has always been present in afghanistan .
even during the taliban regime , people would smuggle records and cassettes at the risk of their lives .
drivers would always have two kinds of music : the kind they liked , but also the muslim chants in case they ran across taliban officials and had to swap the tapes .
afghans have always loved music .

even some members of the ruling party are calling for it to be toned down . debate over a controversial bill to reform immigration and citizenship regulations began in the french parliament on tuesday , with members of both the ruling and opposition parties offering criticism .
the bill is france 's fifth piece of immigration legislation in seven years , and would , among other things , make it easier for the government to revoke french nationality from citizens who have been naturalized for less than 10 years and who have been convicted of killing or attacking a policeman or any public official .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bill also simplifies entry for highly qualified immigrants immigration minister eric besson , who first proposed the legislation , said in an interview with le parisien newspaper that he wanted his ministry to be " a machine to produce good french citizens . "
" last year we gave french nationality to 108,000 foreigners , " the newspaper quoted him as saying .
" being a ' good french person ' does n't mean denying your history , your roots or your french culture . "
besson 's original bill took a more moderate approach before president nicolas sarkozy and interior minister brice hortefeux toughened it during cabinet debate .
opposition on both sides in addition to the citizenship regulations , the bill would allow france to deport foreigners , including eu citizens , for theft , aggressive begging or abusing the right to remain in france for 30 days without permission by leaving and re-entering the country to renew that right . at the same time if would speed up entry procedures for highly qualified immigrants .
sarkozy 's government argues that the legislation would bring france into line with european union immigration directives , but critics have accused him of twisting those directives to fit a populist , anti-immigrant agenda , possibly to attract far-right voters ahead of presidential elections in 2012 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics like the bill to france 's expulsions of roma opposition socialist spokesman bruno le roux said if passed into law , the bill would amount to " another step taken in the deterioration of republican principles . "
etienne pinte , a member of parliament from sarkozy 's own conservative ump party , said the bill was an attempt to bring in votes in the far-right national front party .
he said he would seek up to 40 amendments to " humanize " the bill , or vote against it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 28.09.2010 london becoming a hub for desalination technology großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the thames river in london is now a water source for the city britain opened its first desalination plant this summer , and more recently , another british firm meanwhile said this month that its new method of desalination could transform water on a global scale . earlier this month , a british firm called modern water announced that its six-month interim results for its " manipulated osmosis " system in oman is delivering " excellent initial results . "
the company claims that it can significantly reduce cost power consumption in desalination technology .
that , combined with existing research at local universities and britain 's first desalination plant , which came online in june , are turning london into one of europe 's hubs for desalination research and development .
southeast england drier than you think bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european environment agency says that southeast england is a region of " severe water stress " that may seem a bit strange , given britain 's reputation for wet summers and rainy days , people do n't generally think of britain as a country that is short on water . but southeast england is actually classified as an area of " severe water stress " by the european environment agency , with less rain than rome and a lower annual rainfall than most of germany .
although it is an unremarkable-looking set of grey warehouses and storage tanks , the thames water plant has revolutionized water provision in the capital .
in times of drought , the company says the plant can provide a new source of clean water to up to one million people .
" with climate change threatening hotter , drier summers and an additional 700,000 people forecast to move to london by 2021 , " the company wrote in an online statement in june , " the new water works will be available to help provide the capital 's supplies for the future - whatever the weather . "
as well as being britain 's first , the thames water plant is the only one in the world to use a four-stage version of a desalination process called reverse osmosis .
reverse osmosis – the standard in water desalination – involves pumping salt water at high pressure through very fine membranes .
the water molecules are forced through the membrane , but not the salt molecules , leaving clean water the other side .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the thames water plant is the first in the world to use a four-stage reverse osmosis system unlike similar plants around the world , in the thames water plant the salty water is sent through the membranes four times , meaning that an impressive 85 percent of the intake is converted into drinking water .
and by taking water from a tidal section of the river thames , the plant needs less energy than those which use more salty sea water .
secret agents meanwhile , on the other side of london from the thames plant , a company called modern water has developed a desalination process which it says could transform water provision around the globe .
the key innovations in modern water 's system - currently undergoing commercial trials in oman - are a process called forward osmosis , combined with the use of a secret " osmotic agent . "
" on one side of our membrane we have sea water which contains not only salt but other ions , " explained the executive chairman , neil macdougall in an interview with deutsche welle .
" on the other we have fresh water with a very concentrated solution using our osmotic agent .
using the natural process of osmosis , the fresh water is pulled across . "
in the next stage , the osmotic agent - whose exact composition is carefully guarded by the company - is removed from the water to produce clean drinking water .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london-based modern water says its test of a desalination facility in al khaluf , oman has been successful forward osmosis still requires a membrane to separate the salty from the clean water , but the water does n't have to be pumped at the high pressure necessary for reverse osmosis . that difference , according to modern water , accounts for a reduction in energy costs of around 30 percent .
and since energy costs constitute around half of the running costs of a typical desalination plant , this could dramatically change the business model for desalination plants .
according to the uk-based magazine global water intelligence – which tracks the desalination industry - the mystery surrounding modern water 's osmotic agent means that it is difficult to fully evaluate the process .
but modern water itself is confident enough to set the ambitious goal of bringing down the cost of desalinating water until it is on a par with the cost of treating fresh water .
growth industry the construction of new desalination plants , and recent advances by companies like modern water have brought desalination from the driest regions of the world – like the middle east – to more temperate regions like london , and that growth is set to continue .
" the current desalination capacity in the world is 68 million cubic meters a day , " said christopher gasson , the publisher of global water intelligence magazine , " and we think that will increase to around 130m cubic meters per day by 2016 , around doubling the whole industry . "
this does little to impress environmental groups , however , who share a fundamental objection to the desalination industry .
they argue that by making available a practically unlimited source of new water from the sea , desalination discourages us from using the water we already have more wisely .
where environmentalists do agree with industry figures , however , is that with over a billion people short of water around the globe , new desalination techniques have the potential to provide water to people who otherwise would n't have it .
still , the world wildlife fund -lrb- wwf -rrb- believes that , in most cases , the easiest way to increase our water supply is simply to waste less water . " in most cases our easiest source of new water for drinking water , or for industrial or cooling is to waste less water , " said phil dickie , the author of the wwf 's 2007 report on desalination , " and the cost of wasting less is much less than that of taking sea water and going through quite energy-intensive processes to turn it into fresh drinking water .

"
the company claims that it can significantly reduce cost power consumption in desalination technology .
that , combined with existing research at local universities and britain 's first desalination plant , which came online in june , are turning london into one of europe 's hubs for desalination research and development .
southeast england drier than you think bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european environment agency says that southeast england is a region of " severe water stress " that may seem a bit strange , given britain 's reputation for wet summers and rainy days , people do n't generally think of britain as a country that is short on water . but southeast england is actually classified as an area of " severe water stress " by the european environment agency , with less rain than rome and a lower annual rainfall than most of germany .
although it is an unremarkable-looking set of grey warehouses and storage tanks , the thames water plant has revolutionized water provision in the capital .
in times of drought , the company says the plant can provide a new source of clean water to up to one million people .
" with climate change threatening hotter , drier summers and an additional 700,000 people forecast to move to london by 2021 , " the company wrote in an online statement in june , " the new water works will be available to help provide the capital 's supplies for the future - whatever the weather . "
as well as being britain 's first , the thames water plant is the only one in the world to use a four-stage version of a desalination process called reverse osmosis .
reverse osmosis – the standard in water desalination – involves pumping salt water at high pressure through very fine membranes .
the water molecules are forced through the membrane , but not the salt molecules , leaving clean water the other side .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the thames water plant is the first in the world to use a four-stage reverse osmosis system unlike similar plants around the world , in the thames water plant the salty water is sent through the membranes four times , meaning that an impressive 85 percent of the intake is converted into drinking water .
and by taking water from a tidal section of the river thames , the plant needs less energy than those which use more salty sea water .
secret agents meanwhile , on the other side of london from the thames plant , a company called modern water has developed a desalination process which it says could transform water provision around the globe .
the key innovations in modern water 's system - currently undergoing commercial trials in oman - are a process called forward osmosis , combined with the use of a secret " osmotic agent . "
" on one side of our membrane we have sea water which contains not only salt but other ions , " explained the executive chairman , neil macdougall in an interview with deutsche welle .
" on the other we have fresh water with a very concentrated solution using our osmotic agent .
using the natural process of osmosis , the fresh water is pulled across . "
in the next stage , the osmotic agent - whose exact composition is carefully guarded by the company - is removed from the water to produce clean drinking water .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london-based modern water says its test of a desalination facility in al khaluf , oman has been successful forward osmosis still requires a membrane to separate the salty from the clean water , but the water does n't have to be pumped at the high pressure necessary for reverse osmosis . that difference , according to modern water , accounts for a reduction in energy costs of around 30 percent .
and since energy costs constitute around half of the running costs of a typical desalination plant , this could dramatically change the business model for desalination plants .
according to the uk-based magazine global water intelligence – which tracks the desalination industry - the mystery surrounding modern water 's osmotic agent means that it is difficult to fully evaluate the process .
but modern water itself is confident enough to set the ambitious goal of bringing down the cost of desalinating water until it is on a par with the cost of treating fresh water .
growth industry the construction of new desalination plants , and recent advances by companies like modern water have brought desalination from the driest regions of the world – like the middle east – to more temperate regions like london , and that growth is set to continue .
" the current desalination capacity in the world is 68 million cubic meters a day , " said christopher gasson , the publisher of global water intelligence magazine , " and we think that will increase to around 130m cubic meters per day by 2016 , around doubling the whole industry . "
this does little to impress environmental groups , however , who share a fundamental objection to the desalination industry .
they argue that by making available a practically unlimited source of new water from the sea , desalination discourages us from using the water we already have more wisely .
where environmentalists do agree with industry figures , however , is that with over a billion people short of water around the globe , new desalination techniques have the potential to provide water to people who otherwise would n't have it .
still , the world wildlife fund -lrb- wwf -rrb- believes that , in most cases , the easiest way to increase our water supply is simply to waste less water . " in most cases our easiest source of new water for drinking water , or for industrial or cooling is to waste less water , " said phil dickie , the author of the wwf 's 2007 report on desalination , " and the cost of wasting less is much less than that of taking sea water and going through quite energy-intensive processes to turn it into fresh drinking water .

for some it was easier than others , as older faculty were often forced out , and younger faculty found opportunities in the west . while the rest of the country was trying to figure how to integrate two governments , two currencies and two of nearly everything else , the sciences were no different .
after unification , the west german government advisory body , the council of science and humanities was tasked with evaluating east german research facilities , according to karl ulrich mayer , a west german sociologist at yale university in the united states .
" a whole number of institutes were closed down , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle , nearly two decades after the official reunification date of october 3 , 1990 .
" -lsb- mainly -rsb- because it was assumed that they were too much of the party line , " he added .
mayer is now also president of the leibniz association , which comprises of 86 research institutions across germany , including many in the former east germany , like the leibniz institute for plant biochemistry outside of leipzig . he added that the hard sciences too , were not immune to cuts and layoffs . "
in jena there was a big academy of science institutes in the area of penicillin research , that was reduced to about 550 people from 1,000 , " said mayer , " and these 550 people were then distributed among two leibniz institutes and a few university institutes . "
while some east german institutes were absorbed into existing west german facilities , the max planck society refused to do this , which gave them the opportunity to found new research institutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1964 , this was the office of the famed east german biochemist karl mothes , the ipb 's first director publication restrictions for east german research the german democratic republic , or gdr as it was known in english , focused on other hard sciences , including chemistry , biotechnology and nuclear science .
the gdr received reactor technology from the soviet union .
while research studies from the hard sciences had the chance to be published in western journals , it was much tougher for the social sciences and humanities , according to dieter hoffman , a fellow at the max planck institute for the history of science in berlin .
before the wall came down , hoffmann worked at the east german academy of sciences in the institute for theory and the history of science . "
it was not possible for me for instance , to publish in western journals , " said hoffmann , " and also i could not go to west to visit colleagues or conferences and to present there my scientific research . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people who worked at the ipb during the east german period lost their jobs or were forced to retire scientists who did n't toe the party line , or who were suspected of criticizing the regime quickly found their work censored or not published at all .
still , there were some instances that proved to be beneficial for young scientists under the gdr .
hildegard maria nickel worked as a sociologist at the academy of educational sciences in east germany .
she says now that she would never have had the opportunity to become a professor if she had n't grown up in east germany because of her background .
born to working class parents , nickel 's father was a migrant and she was one of eight children .
in the gdr , women were given the same opportunities as men to work and study .
despite such advances , nickel found herself increasingly disillusioned with a system that censored findings it did n't want to hear .
" i think we did really good research on the youth in gdr and we could see how they feel in the end of the 70s , 80s , that they want to leave the gdr , " said nickel , " but nobody wanted to know it and we could n't publish it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before the wall came down , dieter hoffmann worked at the east german academy of sciences in the institute for theory and the history of science .
unification brought new opportunities when the wall came down , nickel and hoffmann were able to find jobs in a unified germany , easily travel and freely publish .
but many older faculty , found themselves demoted or pushed out . "
some people went to an early retirement .
some people could start a new scientific career or continue their career in a new location or institute and some people became unemployed , " said hoffman .
one of the prime examples of scientists finding a new career under a unified germany was , of course angela merkel , germany 's current chancellor .
before she entered politics , merkel studied , worked and eventually earned her doctorate in quantum chemistry in east berlin .
while integrating east and west german science research centres was a difficult process for many , hoffmann added that in a unified germany today there are plenty of exciting areas of research .
after all , he observed , the city of jena is a world leader in optics and home to companies like carl zeiss , schott and jenoptik .
dresden specializes in material sciences , and freiberg in saxony is known for solar power manufacturing . "
i think what you find now on the landscape -lsb- is -rsb- very often amazing , " he said . " for instance here in berlin , this institute for laser physics - max-born institute - that 's one of the worldwide leading institutes in this field . "

for some it was easier than others , as older faculty were often forced out , and younger faculty found opportunities in the west . while the rest of the country was trying to figure how to integrate two governments , two currencies and two of nearly everything else , the sciences were no different .
after unification , the west german government advisory body , the council of science and humanities was tasked with evaluating east german research facilities , according to karl ulrich mayer , a west german sociologist at yale university in the united states .
" a whole number of institutes were closed down , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle , nearly two decades after the official reunification date of october 3 , 1990 .
" -lsb- mainly -rsb- because it was assumed that they were too much of the party line , " he added .
mayer is now also president of the leibniz association , which comprises of 86 research institutions across germany , including many in the former east germany , like the leibniz institute for plant biochemistry outside of leipzig . he added that the hard sciences too , were not immune to cuts and layoffs . "
in jena there was a big academy of science institutes in the area of penicillin research , that was reduced to about 550 people from 1,000 , " said mayer , " and these 550 people were then distributed among two leibniz institutes and a few university institutes . "
while some east german institutes were absorbed into existing west german facilities , the max planck society refused to do this , which gave them the opportunity to found new research institutes .

the gdr received reactor technology from the soviet union .
while research studies from the hard sciences had the chance to be published in western journals , it was much tougher for the social sciences and humanities , according to dieter hoffman , a fellow at the max planck institute for the history of science in berlin .
before the wall came down , hoffmann worked at the east german academy of sciences in the institute for theory and the history of science . "
it was not possible for me for instance , to publish in western journals , " said hoffmann , " and also i could not go to west to visit colleagues or conferences and to present there my scientific research . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people who worked at the ipb during the east german period lost their jobs or were forced to retire scientists who did n't toe the party line , or who were suspected of criticizing the regime quickly found their work censored or not published at all .
still , there were some instances that proved to be beneficial for young scientists under the gdr .
hildegard maria nickel worked as a sociologist at the academy of educational sciences in east germany .
she says now that she would never have had the opportunity to become a professor if she had n't grown up in east germany because of her background .
born to working class parents , nickel 's father was a migrant and she was one of eight children .
in the gdr , women were given the same opportunities as men to work and study .
despite such advances , nickel found herself increasingly disillusioned with a system that censored findings it did n't want to hear .
" i think we did really good research on the youth in gdr and we could see how they feel in the end of the 70s , 80s , that they want to leave the gdr , " said nickel , " but nobody wanted to know it and we could n't publish it . "

the move comes as no surprise for n koreans both above and below the 38th parallel . park gun ha knows a little something about the north korean worker ’ s party – he was once a member before defecting to south korea in 2005 and now belongs to an association of formerly high-ranking refugees . he told deutsche welle that even though most north koreans back home probably did not even kim jong-un ’ s name until tuesday , they will probably not be surprised that he is on his way to taking over from his father eventually . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : n korean leader kim jong-il reportedly has kidney problems however , park also pointed out that the question of who the next leader will be is not a top concern for most north koreans .
" north koreans lost hope when kim jong-il took over and the economy went bad , ” he explained .
" now they don ’ t really care about who the successor is .
they are much more concerned with how they will survive . " he said that the pyongyang regime would justify the eventual succession of kim jong-un by stressing his plans to reform the economy .
" that ’ s the only way the north korean people will support him . " government has created a flawless cv for kim jong-un park doubted that either kim jong-un or his aunt kim kyoung hee , who was also appointed as a general on tuesday , had any real experience in the north korean military . lee sae yul , the secretary general of the north korea liberation front , an organization in seoul made up of former north korean soldiers agreed .
" current soldiers in the north korean army would be shocked if they found out about this inexperience but that ’ s unlikely to happen . " " the government there has flawlessly created kim jong-un ’ s education and military experience .
it would be impossible for any one to find out the truth . "
bildunterschrift : members of the ruling worker 's party gather at pyongyang station on their way to the party conference disseminating the truth across the border lee 's organization is trying to change the fact that north koreans do not know the truth by sending dvds and other media across the border with information about kim jong-il ’ s regime and about life outside of north korea .
lee hopes that this will help more and more north koreans to question their government and defect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kim jong-il was confirmed as eventual successor to his father at the last major party meeting in 1980 however , north korea liberation front ’ s director kim myoung ha said that for now , there was not much ordinary north koreans could do to express the dissatisfaction with the leadership . " things will be the same when kim jong-un becomes leader , " he said .
" people will grow to hate the government .
there ’ s not much they can do about it , but they will expect life there to get worse and worse . " he predicted that there would be few public displays of anger but hostility toward the new leader would boil under the surface . author : jason strother -lrb- seoul -rrb- editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move comes as no surprise for n koreans both above and below the 38th parallel . park gun ha knows a little something about the north korean worker ’ s party – he was once a member before defecting to south korea in 2005 and now belongs to an association of formerly high-ranking refugees . he told deutsche welle that even though most north koreans back home probably did not even kim jong-un ’ s name until tuesday , they will probably not be surprised that he is on his way to taking over from his father eventually . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : n korean leader kim jong-il reportedly has kidney problems however , park also pointed out that the question of who the next leader will be is not a top concern for most north koreans .
" north koreans lost hope when kim jong-il took over and the economy went bad , ” he explained .
" now they don ’ t really care about who the successor is .
they are much more concerned with how they will survive . " he said that the pyongyang regime would justify the eventual succession of kim jong-un by stressing his plans to reform the economy .
" that ’ s the only way the north korean people will support him . " government has created a flawless cv for kim jong-un park doubted that either kim jong-un or his aunt kim kyoung hee , who was also appointed as a general on tuesday , had any real experience in the north korean military . lee sae yul , the secretary general of the north korea liberation front , an organization in seoul made up of former north korean soldiers agreed .
" current soldiers in the north korean army would be shocked if they found out about this inexperience but that ’ s unlikely to happen . " " the government there has flawlessly created kim jong-un ’ s education and military experience .
it would be impossible for any one to find out the truth . "
bildunterschrift : members of the ruling worker 's party gather at pyongyang station on their way to the party conference disseminating the truth across the border lee 's organization is trying to change the fact that north koreans do not know the truth by sending dvds and other media across the border with information about kim jong-il ’ s regime and about life outside of north korea .
lee hopes that this will help more and more north koreans to question their government and defect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kim jong-il was confirmed as eventual successor to his father at the last major party meeting in 1980 however , north korea liberation front ’ s director kim myoung ha said that for now , there was not much ordinary north koreans could do to express the dissatisfaction with the leadership . " things will be the same when kim jong-un becomes leader , " he said .
" people will grow to hate the government .
there ’ s not much they can do about it , but they will expect life there to get worse and worse .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear -pipe- 28.09.2010 merkel 's cabinet gives thumbs up to extension for nuclear reactors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear energy is a contentious issue with environmentalists chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet has approved a new energy strategy that extends a deadline to shut down nuclear reactors .
opposition leaders say it ’ s a blow to the growing renewable energy sector . cabinet ministers in berlin on tuesday presented a new energy concept which they called exemplary and unmatched in the world , and which includes a controversial extension to germany 's nuclear power plants .
" the concept is not just a vision , " said environment minister norbert roettgen in berlin .
" by 2050 , about 80 percent of all energy consumed in this country will come from renewable sources , but on the way to this age we need nuclear power for an interim period to make this happen . "
under the new plan , the deadline to shut down germany 's nuclear power plants would be extended by an average of 12 years , with the last one running until 2036 .
merkel and her government say the extension is needed to keep germany running until renewable energy sources can supply the country with enough energy to replace what is produced by nuclear plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's cabinet insists the extension is necessary " a longer lifespan for nuclear power plants will help us keep energy prices affordable for both private consumers and industry , " said economics minister rainer bruederle .
" and it 'll be easier for us to reduce harmful gas emissions . "
effects on renewable energy that 's an argument that the opposition reject .
both sigmar gabriel , chairman of the spd , and juergen trittin , co-chairman of the greens , said the government 's plan would hurt the renewable energy industry with providers having to compete with nuclear energy to get a foothold in the market .
both trittin and gabriel are former environment ministers under previous coalition governments .
" with its energy plan , the government is about to block the creation of 300,000 new jobs in the renewables sector , " gabriel told german public broadcaster ard .
" many small and medium-sized firms involved in generating renewable energy are now being put under increasing pressure . "
the new plan also includes a tax on uranium fuel rods that bruederle said would generate 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- in government revenue annually .
a renewable energy fund would also be established that would collect 300 million euros from power companies each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without a majority in the bundesrat , merkel hopes to bypass the upper house constitutional court battle brewing the opposition is also displeased by suggestions from the government that the plan only needs the approval of the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , and not the bundesrat , the upper house , which represents the country 's 16 states .
merkel 's coalition of conservative christian democrats , their bavarian sister party , the christian social union and the liberal free democrats argues that the nuclear plant deadline is a federal issue , not a state matter .
the governing coalition lost its majority in the bundesrat in the state election in north rhine-westphalia in may .
it still has a majority in the bundestag .
the opposition has said if the government does bypass the bundesrat , it will go to the country 's constitutional court .

marco streller , a former stuttgart and cologne player , picked up from a mistake by bayern defender daniel van buyten and passed to frei who slotted the ball in the right-hand corner .

and economists , among others , are happy : consumer spending has long been a weak point in the country 's economic performance . german consumer confidence continues to climb as the economy strengthens and unemployment falls , boosting income expectations , according to a survey .
the gfk market research institute said tuesday that its forward-looking consumer confidence index for october rose to 4.9 points , up from a revised 4.3 in september , representing a three-year high .
" the decisive factor in the strong sentiment among consumers is the extremely positive development of the employment market , " gfk said in a statement .
falling unemployment germany 's unemployment rate was 7.6 percent last month .
that was approximately the level at which it was when the us investment bank lehman brothers collapsed two years ago , fueling a global financial crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling unemployment is bolstering consumer confidence although the german economy is showing signs of slower growth in the second half of the year , the federal labor agency 's iab research institute expects unemployment to drop slightly below 3 million people in 2011 to a nine-year low .
low inflation gfk also pointed to the low level of inflation , currently at around 1 percent , as another factor increasing consumer purchasing power .
the market researcher added that consumers in germany are already experiencing an improved income situation ; according to new data from the federal statistical office , gross monthly income after living expenses increased by 2.3 percent in the second quarter . germany , europe 's biggest economy , has enjoyed strong export-led growth this year .
its massive 2.2 percent growth in the second quarter over the previous three-month period has helped the 16-nation eurozone outperform the us .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern germany -pipe- 28.09.2010 east german scientists faced opportunities and disappointment during reunification großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leibniz institute for plant biochemistry was one of east germany 's premiere scientific laboratories as in other fields , east german science struggled to find its place in a unified germany .
for some it was easier than others , as older faculty were often forced out , and younger faculty found opportunities in the west . while the rest of the country was trying to figure how to integrate two governments , two currencies and two of nearly everything else , the sciences were no different .
after unification , the west german government advisory body , the council of science and humanities was tasked with evaluating east german research facilities , according to karl ulrich mayer , a west german sociologist at yale university in the united states .
" a whole number of institutes were closed down , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle , nearly two decades after the official reunification date of october 3 , 1990 .
" -lsb- mainly -rsb- because it was assumed that they were too much of the party line , " he added .
mayer is now also president of the leibniz association , which comprises of 86 research institutions across germany , including many in the former east germany , like the leibniz institute for plant biochemistry outside of leipzig . he added that the hard sciences too , were not immune to cuts and layoffs . "
in jena there was a big academy of science institutes in the area of penicillin research , that was reduced to about 550 people from 1,000 , " said mayer , " and these 550 people were then distributed among two leibniz institutes and a few university institutes . "
while some east german institutes were absorbed into existing west german facilities , the max planck society refused to do this , which gave them the opportunity to found new research institutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1964 , this was the office of the famed east german biochemist karl mothes , the ipb 's first director publication restrictions for east german research the german democratic republic , or gdr as it was known in english , focused on other hard sciences , including chemistry , biotechnology and nuclear science .
the gdr received reactor technology from the soviet union .
while research studies from the hard sciences had the chance to be published in western journals , it was much tougher for the social sciences and humanities , according to dieter hoffman , a fellow at the max planck institute for the history of science in berlin .
before the wall came down , hoffmann worked at the east german academy of sciences in the institute for theory and the history of science . "
it was not possible for me for instance , to publish in western journals , " said hoffmann , " and also i could not go to west to visit colleagues or conferences and to present there my scientific research . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people who worked at the ipb during the east german period lost their jobs or were forced to retire scientists who did n't toe the party line , or who were suspected of criticizing the regime quickly found their work censored or not published at all .
still , there were some instances that proved to be beneficial for young scientists under the gdr .
hildegard maria nickel worked as a sociologist at the academy of educational sciences in east germany .
she says now that she would never have had the opportunity to become a professor if she had n't grown up in east germany because of her background .
born to working class parents , nickel 's father was a migrant and she was one of eight children .
in the gdr , women were given the same opportunities as men to work and study .
despite such advances , nickel found herself increasingly disillusioned with a system that censored findings it did n't want to hear .
" i think we did really good research on the youth in gdr and we could see how they feel in the end of the 70s , 80s , that they want to leave the gdr , " said nickel , " but nobody wanted to know it and we could n't publish it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before the wall came down , dieter hoffmann worked at the east german academy of sciences in the institute for theory and the history of science .
unification brought new opportunities when the wall came down , nickel and hoffmann were able to find jobs in a unified germany , easily travel and freely publish .
but many older faculty , found themselves demoted or pushed out . "
some people went to an early retirement .
some people could start a new scientific career or continue their career in a new location or institute and some people became unemployed , " said hoffman .
one of the prime examples of scientists finding a new career under a unified germany was , of course angela merkel , germany 's current chancellor .
before she entered politics , merkel studied , worked and eventually earned her doctorate in quantum chemistry in east berlin .
while integrating east and west german science research centres was a difficult process for many , hoffmann added that in a unified germany today there are plenty of exciting areas of research .
after all , he observed , the city of jena is a world leader in optics and home to companies like carl zeiss , schott and jenoptik .
dresden specializes in material sciences , and freiberg in saxony is known for solar power manufacturing . "
i think what you find now on the landscape -lsb- is -rsb- very often amazing , " he said . " for instance here in berlin , this institute for laser physics - max-born institute - that 's one of the worldwide leading institutes in this field . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 28.09.2010 london becoming a hub for desalination technology großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the thames river in london is now a water source for the city britain opened its first desalination plant this summer , and more recently , another british firm meanwhile said this month that its new method of desalination could transform water on a global scale . earlier this month , a british firm called modern water announced that its six-month interim results for its " manipulated osmosis " system in oman is delivering " excellent initial results . "
the company claims that it can significantly reduce cost power consumption in desalination technology .
that , combined with existing research at local universities and britain 's first desalination plant , which came online in june , are turning london into one of europe 's hubs for desalination research and development .
southeast england drier than you think bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european environment agency says that southeast england is a region of " severe water stress " that may seem a bit strange , given britain 's reputation for wet summers and rainy days , people do n't generally think of britain as a country that is short on water . but southeast england is actually classified as an area of " severe water stress " by the european environment agency , with less rain than rome and a lower annual rainfall than most of germany .
although it is an unremarkable-looking set of grey warehouses and storage tanks , the thames water plant has revolutionized water provision in the capital .
in times of drought , the company says the plant can provide a new source of clean water to up to one million people .
" with climate change threatening hotter , drier summers and an additional 700,000 people forecast to move to london by 2021 , " the company wrote in an online statement in june , " the new water works will be available to help provide the capital 's supplies for the future - whatever the weather . "
as well as being britain 's first , the thames water plant is the only one in the world to use a four-stage version of a desalination process called reverse osmosis .
reverse osmosis – the standard in water desalination – involves pumping salt water at high pressure through very fine membranes .
the water molecules are forced through the membrane , but not the salt molecules , leaving clean water the other side .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the thames water plant is the first in the world to use a four-stage reverse osmosis system unlike similar plants around the world , in the thames water plant the salty water is sent through the membranes four times , meaning that an impressive 85 percent of the intake is converted into drinking water .
and by taking water from a tidal section of the river thames , the plant needs less energy than those which use more salty sea water .
secret agents meanwhile , on the other side of london from the thames plant , a company called modern water has developed a desalination process which it says could transform water provision around the globe .
the key innovations in modern water 's system - currently undergoing commercial trials in oman - are a process called forward osmosis , combined with the use of a secret " osmotic agent . "
" on one side of our membrane we have sea water which contains not only salt but other ions , " explained the executive chairman , neil macdougall in an interview with deutsche welle .
" on the other we have fresh water with a very concentrated solution using our osmotic agent .
using the natural process of osmosis , the fresh water is pulled across . "
in the next stage , the osmotic agent - whose exact composition is carefully guarded by the company - is removed from the water to produce clean drinking water .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london-based modern water says its test of a desalination facility in al khaluf , oman has been successful forward osmosis still requires a membrane to separate the salty from the clean water , but the water does n't have to be pumped at the high pressure necessary for reverse osmosis . that difference , according to modern water , accounts for a reduction in energy costs of around 30 percent .
and since energy costs constitute around half of the running costs of a typical desalination plant , this could dramatically change the business model for desalination plants .
according to the uk-based magazine global water intelligence – which tracks the desalination industry - the mystery surrounding modern water 's osmotic agent means that it is difficult to fully evaluate the process .
but modern water itself is confident enough to set the ambitious goal of bringing down the cost of desalinating water until it is on a par with the cost of treating fresh water .
growth industry the construction of new desalination plants , and recent advances by companies like modern water have brought desalination from the driest regions of the world – like the middle east – to more temperate regions like london , and that growth is set to continue .
" the current desalination capacity in the world is 68 million cubic meters a day , " said christopher gasson , the publisher of global water intelligence magazine , " and we think that will increase to around 130m cubic meters per day by 2016 , around doubling the whole industry . "
this does little to impress environmental groups , however , who share a fundamental objection to the desalination industry .
they argue that by making available a practically unlimited source of new water from the sea , desalination discourages us from using the water we already have more wisely .
where environmentalists do agree with industry figures , however , is that with over a billion people short of water around the globe , new desalination techniques have the potential to provide water to people who otherwise would n't have it .
still , the world wildlife fund -lrb- wwf -rrb- believes that , in most cases , the easiest way to increase our water supply is simply to waste less water . " in most cases our easiest source of new water for drinking water , or for industrial or cooling is to waste less water , " said phil dickie , the author of the wwf 's 2007 report on desalination , " and the cost of wasting less is much less than that of taking sea water and going through quite energy-intensive processes to turn it into fresh drinking water . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern germany -pipe- 28.09.2010 east german scientists faced opportunities and disappointment during reunification großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leibniz institute for plant biochemistry was one of east germany 's premiere scientific laboratories as in other fields , east german science struggled to find its place in a unified germany .
for some it was easier than others , as older faculty were often forced out , and younger faculty found opportunities in the west . while the rest of the country was trying to figure how to integrate two governments , two currencies and two of nearly everything else , the sciences were no different .
after unification , the west german government advisory body , the council of science and humanities was tasked with evaluating east german research facilities , according to karl ulrich mayer , a west german sociologist at yale university in the united states .
" a whole number of institutes were closed down , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle , nearly two decades after the official reunification date of october 3 , 1990 .
" -lsb- mainly -rsb- because it was assumed that they were too much of the party line , " he added .
mayer is now also president of the leibniz association , which comprises of 86 research institutions across germany , including many in the former east germany , like the leibniz institute for plant biochemistry outside of leipzig . he added that the hard sciences too , were not immune to cuts and layoffs . "
in jena there was a big academy of science institutes in the area of penicillin research , that was reduced to about 550 people from 1,000 , " said mayer , " and these 550 people were then distributed among two leibniz institutes and a few university institutes . "
while some east german institutes were absorbed into existing west german facilities , the max planck society refused to do this , which gave them the opportunity to found new research institutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1964 , this was the office of the famed east german biochemist karl mothes , the ipb 's first director publication restrictions for east german research the german democratic republic , or gdr as it was known in english , focused on other hard sciences , including chemistry , biotechnology and nuclear science .
the gdr received reactor technology from the soviet union .
while research studies from the hard sciences had the chance to be published in western journals , it was much tougher for the social sciences and humanities , according to dieter hoffman , a fellow at the max planck institute for the history of science in berlin .
before the wall came down , hoffmann worked at the east german academy of sciences in the institute for theory and the history of science . "
it was not possible for me for instance , to publish in western journals , " said hoffmann , " and also i could not go to west to visit colleagues or conferences and to present there my scientific research . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people who worked at the ipb during the east german period lost their jobs or were forced to retire scientists who did n't toe the party line , or who were suspected of criticizing the regime quickly found their work censored or not published at all .
still , there were some instances that proved to be beneficial for young scientists under the gdr .
hildegard maria nickel worked as a sociologist at the academy of educational sciences in east germany .
she says now that she would never have had the opportunity to become a professor if she had n't grown up in east germany because of her background .
born to working class parents , nickel 's father was a migrant and she was one of eight children .
in the gdr , women were given the same opportunities as men to work and study .
despite such advances , nickel found herself increasingly disillusioned with a system that censored findings it did n't want to hear .
" i think we did really good research on the youth in gdr and we could see how they feel in the end of the 70s , 80s , that they want to leave the gdr , " said nickel , " but nobody wanted to know it and we could n't publish it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before the wall came down , dieter hoffmann worked at the east german academy of sciences in the institute for theory and the history of science .
unification brought new opportunities when the wall came down , nickel and hoffmann were able to find jobs in a unified germany , easily travel and freely publish .
but many older faculty , found themselves demoted or pushed out . "
some people went to an early retirement .
some people could start a new scientific career or continue their career in a new location or institute and some people became unemployed , " said hoffman .
one of the prime examples of scientists finding a new career under a unified germany was , of course angela merkel , germany 's current chancellor .
before she entered politics , merkel studied , worked and eventually earned her doctorate in quantum chemistry in east berlin .
while integrating east and west german science research centres was a difficult process for many , hoffmann added that in a unified germany today there are plenty of exciting areas of research .
after all , he observed , the city of jena is a world leader in optics and home to companies like carl zeiss , schott and jenoptik .
dresden specializes in material sciences , and freiberg in saxony is known for solar power manufacturing . "
i think what you find now on the landscape -lsb- is -rsb- very often amazing , " he said . " for instance here in berlin , this institute for laser physics - max-born institute - that 's one of the worldwide leading institutes in this field . "

in november 2008 , he returned to iran and was subsequently arrested .
he was sentenced to 19.5 years in jail . an iranian court has sentenced iranian-canadian blogger hossein derakhshan to 19.5 years in prison , according to iranian media .
the conservative website , mashreghnews.ir , which is close to iran 's presidential office , said derakhshan was convicted on charges of cooperation with hostile countries , spreading propaganda against the ruling establishment , promotion of counterrevolutionary groups and insulting islamic thoughts and religious figures .
verdict can be appealed he was also given a five years ' ban from membership in political parties and activities in the media , and was sentenced to returning received funds in the amount of 30,750 euros , $ 2,900 , and 200 british pounds .
derakhshan can appeal , the report added .
before the verdict , immediate family members as well as reporters without borders had feared hossein derakhshan may be threatened with death penalty .
the iranian blogging pioneer has been held in a tehran prison for nearly two years and has been given little , if any , access to legal representation and no consular access to canadian authorities .
in recent days , family members had said that the prosecutor was seeking the death penalty for derakhshan .
a blogging leader ten years ago , hossein derakhshan moved from iran to canada to study .
that 's where he met his wife , who is also from iran , and became a canadian citizen .
in 2001 , from his base in toronto , derakhshan penned an online guide teaching iranians how to blog in their own language and championed persian blogging from both inside and outside of his homeland .
dubbed by some as " the blogfather , " derakhshan was frequently interviewed by western media outlets about the nascent iranian blogging community and his blogs in both english and persian .
as he continued at the time , he also became an outspoken critic of iran 's religious leadership .
blogging from toronto , and later paris and london , under the pen name " hoder , " derakhshan criticized iran 's elite as being inflexible and unwilling to engage in reform , while attacking ayatollah khamenei directly in his writing .
in 2005 , he served as a jury member in deutsche welle 's best of the blogs awards .
the following year , he made a very public trip to israel , which is normally forbidden for iranian citizens .
" i 'm going to israel as a citizen journalist and a peace activist , ” he wrote on his english blog at the time .
" i 'm a citizen of canada and i have the right to visit any country i want . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : derakhshan defended iran 's nuclear program in the face of protests a change of views later that year , derakhshan suddenly switched his political perspective and became a staunch nationalist and defender of the islamic republic .
in 2006 , derakhshan wrote an opinion piece defending iran 's nuclear program in the washington post .
he also began to attack activists and former friends on his blogs and in other media .
later he told the guardian newspaper in vehement words that if the united states attacked iran , he would return and fight for his homeland .
after visiting israel , derakhshan moved to london to pursue graduate studies . that 's when he went from making oppositional statements to outright supporting the new president .
he went on rhetorical rampages against many who had previously been his friends and colleagues and later was even sued for libel in the united states in 2007 .
in the fall of 2008 , before derakhshan returned to iran , he asked his friends to not take a public stance if he was arrested .
derakhshan had returned to iran in late 2008 , apparently having secured a job offer at press tv , the country 's english-language news service , but was arrested two weeks after his arrival .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad himself asked for a swift resolution to the case .
arrested after two weeks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahmoud ahmadinejad called for a swift resolution to derakhshan 's case however , little is known about his current situation .
a brief statement made three months ago by tehran accuses him of insulting the prophet muhammad along with iran 's spiritual leader and president , as well as disseminating " anti-revolutionary propaganda " and spying for israel .
derakhshan 's mother told an expatriate iranian news website , kamtarin.com , that she has visited her son in prison .
his physical and mental conditions are worrisome .
canadian citizenship not accepted unlike other possible death penalty cases in iran , the customary wave of popular solidarity failed to materialize behind derakhshan , although there has been some attention online and in the canadian media .
even the mayor of paris , bertrand delanoe , rallied to his support in a statement on his website .
" in the name of paris , i solemnly call upon the judicial authorities of tehran to not condemn hossein derakhshan to death , " he wrote last week . " and i invite the mobilization of all of our energies to save this honorable , courageous and dignified life . "
but derakhshan 's political stance and relationship to ahmadinejad remains clouded .
iranian authorities have not accepted derakhshan efforts to invoke his rights as a canadian citizen .
" despite the iranian government ’ s position , we consider mr. derakhshan to be a canadian citizen , " wrote lisa monette , a spokesperson from the canadian department of foreign affairs and international trade , in a statement sent to deutsche welle .
" we will continue to press the iranian authorities for access , as we have in similar cases involving dual nationals in other jurisdictions .
canada continues to urge iran to fully respect all of its human rights obligations , both in law and in practice . "
iranian authorities have arrested numerous bloggers in recent years in a bid to clamp down on internet dissent .

in november 2008 , he returned to iran and was subsequently arrested .
he was sentenced to 19.5 years in jail . an iranian court has sentenced iranian-canadian blogger hossein derakhshan to 19.5 years in prison , according to iranian media .
the conservative website , mashreghnews.ir , which is close to iran 's presidential office , said derakhshan was convicted on charges of cooperation with hostile countries , spreading propaganda against the ruling establishment , promotion of counterrevolutionary groups and insulting islamic thoughts and religious figures .
verdict can be appealed he was also given a five years ' ban from membership in political parties and activities in the media , and was sentenced to returning received funds in the amount of 30,750 euros , $ 2,900 , and 200 british pounds .
derakhshan can appeal , the report added .
before the verdict , immediate family members as well as reporters without borders had feared hossein derakhshan may be threatened with death penalty .
the iranian blogging pioneer has been held in a tehran prison for nearly two years and has been given little , if any , access to legal representation and no consular access to canadian authorities .
in recent days , family members had said that the prosecutor was seeking the death penalty for derakhshan .
a blogging leader ten years ago , hossein derakhshan moved from iran to canada to study .
that 's where he met his wife , who is also from iran , and became a canadian citizen .
in 2001 , from his base in toronto , derakhshan penned an online guide teaching iranians how to blog in their own language and championed persian blogging from both inside and outside of his homeland .
dubbed by some as " the blogfather , " derakhshan was frequently interviewed by western media outlets about the nascent iranian blogging community and his blogs in both english and persian .
as he continued at the time , he also became an outspoken critic of iran 's religious leadership .
blogging from toronto , and later paris and london , under the pen name " hoder , " derakhshan criticized iran 's elite as being inflexible and unwilling to engage in reform , while attacking ayatollah khamenei directly in his writing .
in 2005 , he served as a jury member in deutsche welle 's best of the blogs awards .
the following year , he made a very public trip to israel , which is normally forbidden for iranian citizens .
" i 'm going to israel as a citizen journalist and a peace activist , ” he wrote on his english blog at the time .
" i 'm a citizen of canada and i have the right to visit any country i want . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : derakhshan defended iran 's nuclear program in the face of protests a change of views later that year , derakhshan suddenly switched his political perspective and became a staunch nationalist and defender of the islamic republic .
in 2006 , derakhshan wrote an opinion piece defending iran 's nuclear program in the washington post .
he also began to attack activists and former friends on his blogs and in other media .
later he told the guardian newspaper in vehement words that if the united states attacked iran , he would return and fight for his homeland .
after visiting israel , derakhshan moved to london to pursue graduate studies . that 's when he went from making oppositional statements to outright supporting the new president .
he went on rhetorical rampages against many who had previously been his friends and colleagues and later was even sued for libel in the united states in 2007 .
in the fall of 2008 , before derakhshan returned to iran , he asked his friends to not take a public stance if he was arrested .
derakhshan had returned to iran in late 2008 , apparently having secured a job offer at press tv , the country 's english-language news service , but was arrested two weeks after his arrival .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad himself asked for a swift resolution to the case .
arrested after two weeks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahmoud ahmadinejad called for a swift resolution to derakhshan 's case however , little is known about his current situation .
a brief statement made three months ago by tehran accuses him of insulting the prophet muhammad along with iran 's spiritual leader and president , as well as disseminating " anti-revolutionary propaganda " and spying for israel .
derakhshan 's mother told an expatriate iranian news website , kamtarin.com , that she has visited her son in prison .
his physical and mental conditions are worrisome .
canadian citizenship not accepted unlike other possible death penalty cases in iran , the customary wave of popular solidarity failed to materialize behind derakhshan , although there has been some attention online and in the canadian media .
even the mayor of paris , bertrand delanoe , rallied to his support in a statement on his website .
" in the name of paris , i solemnly call upon the judicial authorities of tehran to not condemn hossein derakhshan to death , " he wrote last week . " and i invite the mobilization of all of our energies to save this honorable , courageous and dignified life . "
but derakhshan 's political stance and relationship to ahmadinejad remains clouded .
iranian authorities have not accepted derakhshan efforts to invoke his rights as a canadian citizen .
" despite the iranian government ’ s position , we consider mr. derakhshan to be a canadian citizen , " wrote lisa monette , a spokesperson from the canadian department of foreign affairs and international trade , in a statement sent to deutsche welle .
" we will continue to press the iranian authorities for access , as we have in similar cases involving dual nationals in other jurisdictions .
canada continues to urge iran to fully respect all of its human rights obligations , both in law and in practice . "
iranian authorities have arrested numerous bloggers in recent years in a bid to clamp down on internet dissent .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : derakhshan defended iran 's nuclear program in the face of protests a change of views later that year , derakhshan suddenly switched his political perspective and became a staunch nationalist and defender of the islamic republic .
in 2006 , derakhshan wrote an opinion piece defending iran 's nuclear program in the washington post .
he also began to attack activists and former friends on his blogs and in other media .
later he told the guardian newspaper in vehement words that if the united states attacked iran , he would return and fight for his homeland .
after visiting israel , derakhshan moved to london to pursue graduate studies . that 's when he went from making oppositional statements to outright supporting the new president .
he went on rhetorical rampages against many who had previously been his friends and colleagues and later was even sued for libel in the united states in 2007 .
in the fall of 2008 , before derakhshan returned to iran , he asked his friends to not take a public stance if he was arrested .
derakhshan had returned to iran in late 2008 , apparently having secured a job offer at press tv , the country 's english-language news service , but was arrested two weeks after his arrival .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad himself asked for a swift resolution to the case .
arrested after two weeks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahmoud ahmadinejad called for a swift resolution to derakhshan 's case however , little is known about his current situation .
a brief statement made three months ago by tehran accuses him of insulting the prophet muhammad along with iran 's spiritual leader and president , as well as disseminating " anti-revolutionary propaganda " and spying for israel .
derakhshan 's mother told an expatriate iranian news website , kamtarin.com , that she has visited her son in prison .
his physical and mental conditions are worrisome .
canadian citizenship not accepted unlike other possible death penalty cases in iran , the customary wave of popular solidarity failed to materialize behind derakhshan , although there has been some attention online and in the canadian media .
even the mayor of paris , bertrand delanoe , rallied to his support in a statement on his website .
" in the name of paris , i solemnly call upon the judicial authorities of tehran to not condemn hossein derakhshan to death , " he wrote last week . " and i invite the mobilization of all of our energies to save this honorable , courageous and dignified life . "
but derakhshan 's political stance and relationship to ahmadinejad remains clouded .
iranian authorities have not accepted derakhshan efforts to invoke his rights as a canadian citizen .
" despite the iranian government ’ s position , we consider mr. derakhshan to be a canadian citizen , " wrote lisa monette , a spokesperson from the canadian department of foreign affairs and international trade , in a statement sent to deutsche welle .
" we will continue to press the iranian authorities for access , as we have in similar cases involving dual nationals in other jurisdictions .
canada continues to urge iran to fully respect all of its human rights obligations , both in law and in practice . "
iranian authorities have arrested numerous bloggers in recent years in a bid to clamp down on internet dissent .

with just two wins this season bayern are ten points adrift of league newcomers mainz 05 , who beat louis van gaal 's side 2-1 last saturday .
schweinsteiger helped bayern keep their champions league 100 percent record with a goal in the 56th minute from the penalty spot and then tapped in the winner in the last minute of regular play to secure all three points for the visitors .
the bavarians now head group e. in their opening match two weeks ago bayern munich beat as roma in their opening group match .
bildunterschrift : basel 's swiss international alexander frei scores the opening goal early lead for basel swiss international alex frei put basel ahead in the 18th minute with their first real goal opportunity .
marco streller , a former stuttgart and cologne player , picked up from a mistake by bayern defender daniel van buyten and passed to frei who slotted the ball in the right-hand corner .
bayern had 65 percent of the ball possession in the first half but failed to use their goal chances .
in the 40th minute basel , who are trained by ex-bayern munich star thorsten fink , nearly made it 2-0 , but goalie joerg butt denied xherdan shaqiri the goal .
coach van gaal reacted by bringing on mario gomez to replace hamid altintop for the start of the second half .
world cup joint top scorer thomas mueller was then brought down in the penalty area by ex-frankfurt player benjamin huggel early in the second half .

despite the announcement , schaeuble participated in a cabinet meeting and a press conference on the government 's new energy plan on tuesday .
" the inflammation requires treatment , " spokesman michael offer told reporters in berlin on tuesday .
" the incidents earlier this year have shown that he is also able to complete his duties from the hospital . "
in a routine procedure in mid-february , doctors replaced an implant that helped regulate schaeuble 's digestive system .
he left the hospital on his own accord , but was later readmitted because the wound healed poorly .
past resignation speculation health problems have previously interfered with schaeuble 's duties in the german government .
he was hospitalized in may during a summit of european union finance ministers in brussels because of a reaction to medication .
interior minister thomas de maiziere was quickly flown in to replace him .
such incidents led to speculation that schaeuble would resign his position .
but chancellor angela merkel publicly supported schaeuble 's decision to continue in office and asked him to prioritize his health and allow himself to heal completely .
an assassination attempt by a deranged man in october 1990 left schaeuble a paraplegic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 28.09.2010 london becoming a hub for desalination technology großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the thames river in london is now a water source for the city britain opened its first desalination plant this summer , and more recently , another british firm meanwhile said this month that its new method of desalination could transform water on a global scale . earlier this month , a british firm called modern water announced that its six-month interim results for its " manipulated osmosis " system in oman is delivering " excellent initial results . "
the company claims that it can significantly reduce cost power consumption in desalination technology .
that , combined with existing research at local universities and britain 's first desalination plant , which came online in june , are turning london into one of europe 's hubs for desalination research and development .
southeast england drier than you think bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european environment agency says that southeast england is a region of " severe water stress " that may seem a bit strange , given britain 's reputation for wet summers and rainy days , people do n't generally think of britain as a country that is short on water . but southeast england is actually classified as an area of " severe water stress " by the european environment agency , with less rain than rome and a lower annual rainfall than most of germany .
although it is an unremarkable-looking set of grey warehouses and storage tanks , the thames water plant has revolutionized water provision in the capital .
in times of drought , the company says the plant can provide a new source of clean water to up to one million people .
" with climate change threatening hotter , drier summers and an additional 700,000 people forecast to move to london by 2021 , " the company wrote in an online statement in june , " the new water works will be available to help provide the capital 's supplies for the future - whatever the weather . "
as well as being britain 's first , the thames water plant is the only one in the world to use a four-stage version of a desalination process called reverse osmosis .
reverse osmosis – the standard in water desalination – involves pumping salt water at high pressure through very fine membranes .
the water molecules are forced through the membrane , but not the salt molecules , leaving clean water the other side .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the thames water plant is the first in the world to use a four-stage reverse osmosis system unlike similar plants around the world , in the thames water plant the salty water is sent through the membranes four times , meaning that an impressive 85 percent of the intake is converted into drinking water .
and by taking water from a tidal section of the river thames , the plant needs less energy than those which use more salty sea water .
secret agents meanwhile , on the other side of london from the thames plant , a company called modern water has developed a desalination process which it says could transform water provision around the globe .
the key innovations in modern water 's system - currently undergoing commercial trials in oman - are a process called forward osmosis , combined with the use of a secret " osmotic agent . "
" on one side of our membrane we have sea water which contains not only salt but other ions , " explained the executive chairman , neil macdougall in an interview with deutsche welle .
" on the other we have fresh water with a very concentrated solution using our osmotic agent .
using the natural process of osmosis , the fresh water is pulled across . "
in the next stage , the osmotic agent - whose exact composition is carefully guarded by the company - is removed from the water to produce clean drinking water .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london-based modern water says its test of a desalination facility in al khaluf , oman has been successful forward osmosis still requires a membrane to separate the salty from the clean water , but the water does n't have to be pumped at the high pressure necessary for reverse osmosis . that difference , according to modern water , accounts for a reduction in energy costs of around 30 percent .
and since energy costs constitute around half of the running costs of a typical desalination plant , this could dramatically change the business model for desalination plants .
according to the uk-based magazine global water intelligence – which tracks the desalination industry - the mystery surrounding modern water 's osmotic agent means that it is difficult to fully evaluate the process .
but modern water itself is confident enough to set the ambitious goal of bringing down the cost of desalinating water until it is on a par with the cost of treating fresh water .
growth industry the construction of new desalination plants , and recent advances by companies like modern water have brought desalination from the driest regions of the world – like the middle east – to more temperate regions like london , and that growth is set to continue .
" the current desalination capacity in the world is 68 million cubic meters a day , " said christopher gasson , the publisher of global water intelligence magazine , " and we think that will increase to around 130m cubic meters per day by 2016 , around doubling the whole industry . "
this does little to impress environmental groups , however , who share a fundamental objection to the desalination industry .
they argue that by making available a practically unlimited source of new water from the sea , desalination discourages us from using the water we already have more wisely .
where environmentalists do agree with industry figures , however , is that with over a billion people short of water around the globe , new desalination techniques have the potential to provide water to people who otherwise would n't have it .
still , the world wildlife fund -lrb- wwf -rrb- believes that , in most cases , the easiest way to increase our water supply is simply to waste less water . " in most cases our easiest source of new water for drinking water , or for industrial or cooling is to waste less water , " said phil dickie , the author of the wwf 's 2007 report on desalination , " and the cost of wasting less is much less than that of taking sea water and going through quite energy-intensive processes to turn it into fresh drinking water .

" the inflammation requires treatment , " spokesman michael offer told reporters in berlin on tuesday .
" the incidents earlier this year have shown that he is also able to complete his duties from the hospital . "
in a routine procedure in mid-february , doctors replaced an implant that helped regulate schaeuble 's digestive system .
he left the hospital on his own accord , but was later readmitted because the wound healed poorly .
past resignation speculation health problems have previously interfered with schaeuble 's duties in the german government .
he was hospitalized in may during a summit of european union finance ministers in brussels because of a reaction to medication .
interior minister thomas de maiziere was quickly flown in to replace him .
such incidents led to speculation that schaeuble would resign his position .
but chancellor angela merkel publicly supported schaeuble 's decision to continue in office and asked him to prioritize his health and allow himself to heal completely .
an assassination attempt by a deranged man in october 1990 left schaeuble a paraplegic .

one company says it is ready to deploy the technology , but locals are fighting plans to bury the carbon under their town . energy giant vattenfall is currently testing its procedure for carbon capture and storage -lrb- ccs -rrb- in a part of eastern germany known as lausitz .
" we 're working on a process to remove co2 from waste gas .
that way we 're hoping to make the process of generating electricity from brown coal climate-friendlier " , said vattenfall 's lutz picard who shows visitors around daily to explain how the company wants to make coal production green .
the company says some 55 million tons of lignite , also known as brown coal , are still produced here every year .
the pilot facility , at vattenfall 's schwarze pumpe brown-coal power plant , is trialing a technique which the company calls ' oxyfuel ' because it involves adding large amounts of oxygen to the coal-burning process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oxygen is added when burning coal to extract the co2 half the equation " we add oxygen when we burn the coal " , said vattenfall 's lutz picard .
" that 's how we 're able to remove co2 from the waste gas because the concentration of co2 at the cauldron 's mouthpiece is higher . "
after it has been cleaned in several steps , the company says it is able to extract almost pure co2 .
at the moment , however , the co2 that is being extracted is simply being released back into the atmosphere , because the company is still waiting for a new law which would allow it to pump the gas underground .
germany 's government is expected to give the green light to ccs technology , in line with its recently-announced energy concept for the next 40 years , which aims to promote a massive expansion of renewable energies while keeping energy prices stable through " bridge " technologies like nuclear power .
at vattenfall 's schwarze pumpe site , this would mean trucks and pipelines would be used to transport co2 to the small town of beeskow nearby , where it would be pressed 1,000 meters below the surface .
vattenfall is confident of securing the necessary legislation , but it has since hit another snag : local resistance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beeskow 's inhabitants are against the plans to store co2 below their town guinea pigs the inhabitants of beeskow are against the plans and have put up big yellow crosses all along the road .
the pictures are reminiscent of the protest carried out by the anti-nuclear movement in other parts of germany , where energy giants are planning to build repositories for nuclear waste .
beeskow 's inhabitants say there has n't been enough investigation of the potential impact of pumping the carbon below their town , and they do n't want to be used as " guinea pigs . " many are afraid that the carbon might not be as clean as promised by vattenfall , and that sulfur and heavy metals like arsenic could get into the drinking water via the ground water .
even if the gas were clean , underground storage could lead to another problem , said activist hardy feldmann , because the liquid co2 would be pressed into porous sand stone which contains very salty water , or brine .
" the brine would have to make space for the co2 " , feldmann said .
" that would mean it would end up in the ground water .
so we would have high levels of salt in the ground water . "
so far , the city of beeskow has vetoed vattenfall 's plans to conduct geological research on the brine layers , and has attacked federal authorities for allowing vattenfall to proceed with its plans despite the absence of a law on the technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the co2 extracted be pure enough to be stored underground ?
export opportunity but these concerns are not shared at vattenfall .
lutz picard stresses that his company will do everything it can to purify the greenhouse gas and make the underground storage facility as secure as possible .
for him the technology is inevitable .
" in germany you may argue about where coal ranks as a source of energy " , picard said .
" but in countries like china or india you ca n't .
there , coal is available and people will use it .
and then the only question is : how do you use coal in a climate-friendly way ? "
for vattenfall , capturing and storing carbon dioxide could mean a big export opportunity – and perhaps one of it 's last in the coal mining industry , considering that in 40 years ' time , germany is supposed to end to its own coal production .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 28.09.2010 amnesty report condemns eu roma deportations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the deported roma were reportedly children european countries , including germany , have been forcibly returning roma gypsies to kosovo , amnesty international said in a report published on tuesday .
the organization called for a halt to the practice . the international human rights organization amnesty international has released a damning report which says european union -lrb- eu -rrb- countries have been quietly deporting roma gypsies back to kosovo for over a year .
the report , titled " not welcome anywhere : stop the forced return of roma to kosovo " , singles out germany as a chief perpetrator , alleging many of the gypsies are being forcibly removed from their homes at early hours in the morning with nothing more than the clothes on their back .
amnesty says that many of the roma are made to sign statements attesting their deportation is voluntary .
the report calculates that almost 10,000 roma are legally obliged to leave the country and are therefore at risk of forcible return to kosovo from germany alone .
it says the roma deportations began during negotiations of a bilateral readmission agreement between germany and kosovo in 2009 , which was finally signed on april 14 , 2010 , and came into force on september 1 , 2010 .
roma discrimination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic albanians were the driving force behind kosovo 's independence sian jones , amnesty 's kosovo expert , said eu countries risked breaking international law by sending roma back " to places where they are at risk of persecution , or other serious harm . "
discrimination against roma in kosovo is " widespread and systematic compounded by their perceived association with kosovo serbs , " said amnesty .
" the eu should instead continue to provide international protection for roma and other minorities in kosovo until they can return there safely , " added sian jones .
" the kosovo authorities must also ensure that roma and other minorities can return voluntarily and reintegrate fully in society . "
the london-based rights group said few roma receive help on their return to kosovo , meaning many face problems in obtaining access to education , healthcare , housing and social benefits .
deportations from germany are organized by the individual states , and there are wide differences between the strictness with which they are carried out , with some states having imposed a virtual moratorium .
roma clampdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding issued a sharp rebuke of french policy on roma a recent report by the united nations children 's organization , unicef , indicates that nearly 40 percent of the roma returned from germany are stateless , and that as many as 50 percent who are legally obliged to leave are children .
it also states that almost two-thirds of them are born and educated in germany .
the partially-recognized republic of kosovo declared itself independent from serbia in 2008 .
so far , the independence of the albanian-majority state has been recognized by 70 countries .
the amnesty report comes amid international outrage at a clampdown on roma in france , which has seen hundreds of them sent back to romania and bulgaria since the beginning of august despite eu legislation on the free movement of people .
eu justice commissioner viviane reding threatened to take legal action against france over the deportations .

the organization called for a halt to the practice . the international human rights organization amnesty international has released a damning report which says european union -lrb- eu -rrb- countries have been quietly deporting roma gypsies back to kosovo for over a year .
the report , titled " not welcome anywhere : stop the forced return of roma to kosovo " , singles out germany as a chief perpetrator , alleging many of the gypsies are being forcibly removed from their homes at early hours in the morning with nothing more than the clothes on their back .
amnesty says that many of the roma are made to sign statements attesting their deportation is voluntary .
the report calculates that almost 10,000 roma are legally obliged to leave the country and are therefore at risk of forcible return to kosovo from germany alone .
it says the roma deportations began during negotiations of a bilateral readmission agreement between germany and kosovo in 2009 , which was finally signed on april 14 , 2010 , and came into force on september 1 , 2010 .
roma discrimination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic albanians were the driving force behind kosovo 's independence sian jones , amnesty 's kosovo expert , said eu countries risked breaking international law by sending roma back " to places where they are at risk of persecution , or other serious harm . "
discrimination against roma in kosovo is " widespread and systematic compounded by their perceived association with kosovo serbs , " said amnesty .
" the eu should instead continue to provide international protection for roma and other minorities in kosovo until they can return there safely , " added sian jones .
" the kosovo authorities must also ensure that roma and other minorities can return voluntarily and reintegrate fully in society . "
the london-based rights group said few roma receive help on their return to kosovo , meaning many face problems in obtaining access to education , healthcare , housing and social benefits .
deportations from germany are organized by the individual states , and there are wide differences between the strictness with which they are carried out , with some states having imposed a virtual moratorium .
roma clampdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding issued a sharp rebuke of french policy on roma a recent report by the united nations children 's organization , unicef , indicates that nearly 40 percent of the roma returned from germany are stateless , and that as many as 50 percent who are legally obliged to leave are children .
it also states that almost two-thirds of them are born and educated in germany .
the partially-recognized republic of kosovo declared itself independent from serbia in 2008 .
so far , the independence of the albanian-majority state has been recognized by 70 countries .
the amnesty report comes amid international outrage at a clampdown on roma in france , which has seen hundreds of them sent back to romania and bulgaria since the beginning of august despite eu legislation on the free movement of people .
eu justice commissioner viviane reding threatened to take legal action against france over the deportations .

marco streller , a former stuttgart and cologne player , picked up from a mistake by bayern defender daniel van buyten and passed to frei who slotted the ball in the right-hand corner .
bayern had 65 percent of the ball possession in the first half but failed to use their goal chances .
in the 40th minute basel , who are trained by ex-bayern munich star thorsten fink , nearly made it 2-0 , but goalie joerg butt denied xherdan shaqiri the goal .
coach van gaal reacted by bringing on mario gomez to replace hamid altintop for the start of the second half .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 28.09.2010 amnesty report condemns eu roma deportations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the deported roma were reportedly children european countries , including germany , have been forcibly returning roma gypsies to kosovo , amnesty international said in a report published on tuesday .
the organization called for a halt to the practice . the international human rights organization amnesty international has released a damning report which says european union -lrb- eu -rrb- countries have been quietly deporting roma gypsies back to kosovo for over a year .
the report , titled " not welcome anywhere : stop the forced return of roma to kosovo " , singles out germany as a chief perpetrator , alleging many of the gypsies are being forcibly removed from their homes at early hours in the morning with nothing more than the clothes on their back .
amnesty says that many of the roma are made to sign statements attesting their deportation is voluntary .
the report calculates that almost 10,000 roma are legally obliged to leave the country and are therefore at risk of forcible return to kosovo from germany alone .
it says the roma deportations began during negotiations of a bilateral readmission agreement between germany and kosovo in 2009 , which was finally signed on april 14 , 2010 , and came into force on september 1 , 2010 .
roma discrimination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic albanians were the driving force behind kosovo 's independence sian jones , amnesty 's kosovo expert , said eu countries risked breaking international law by sending roma back " to places where they are at risk of persecution , or other serious harm . "
discrimination against roma in kosovo is " widespread and systematic compounded by their perceived association with kosovo serbs , " said amnesty .
" the eu should instead continue to provide international protection for roma and other minorities in kosovo until they can return there safely , " added sian jones .
" the kosovo authorities must also ensure that roma and other minorities can return voluntarily and reintegrate fully in society . "
the london-based rights group said few roma receive help on their return to kosovo , meaning many face problems in obtaining access to education , healthcare , housing and social benefits .
deportations from germany are organized by the individual states , and there are wide differences between the strictness with which they are carried out , with some states having imposed a virtual moratorium .
roma clampdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding issued a sharp rebuke of french policy on roma a recent report by the united nations children 's organization , unicef , indicates that nearly 40 percent of the roma returned from germany are stateless , and that as many as 50 percent who are legally obliged to leave are children .
it also states that almost two-thirds of them are born and educated in germany .
the partially-recognized republic of kosovo declared itself independent from serbia in 2008 .
so far , the independence of the albanian-majority state has been recognized by 70 countries .
the amnesty report comes amid international outrage at a clampdown on roma in france , which has seen hundreds of them sent back to romania and bulgaria since the beginning of august despite eu legislation on the free movement of people .
eu justice commissioner viviane reding threatened to take legal action against france over the deportations .

opposition leaders say it ’ s a blow to the growing renewable energy sector . cabinet ministers in berlin on tuesday presented a new energy concept which they called exemplary and unmatched in the world , and which includes a controversial extension to germany 's nuclear power plants .
" the concept is not just a vision , " said environment minister norbert roettgen in berlin .
" by 2050 , about 80 percent of all energy consumed in this country will come from renewable sources , but on the way to this age we need nuclear power for an interim period to make this happen . "
under the new plan , the deadline to shut down germany 's nuclear power plants would be extended by an average of 12 years , with the last one running until 2036 .
merkel and her government say the extension is needed to keep germany running until renewable energy sources can supply the country with enough energy to replace what is produced by nuclear plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's cabinet insists the extension is necessary " a longer lifespan for nuclear power plants will help us keep energy prices affordable for both private consumers and industry , " said economics minister rainer bruederle .
" and it 'll be easier for us to reduce harmful gas emissions . "
effects on renewable energy that 's an argument that the opposition reject .
both sigmar gabriel , chairman of the spd , and juergen trittin , co-chairman of the greens , said the government 's plan would hurt the renewable energy industry with providers having to compete with nuclear energy to get a foothold in the market .
both trittin and gabriel are former environment ministers under previous coalition governments .
" with its energy plan , the government is about to block the creation of 300,000 new jobs in the renewables sector , " gabriel told german public broadcaster ard .
" many small and medium-sized firms involved in generating renewable energy are now being put under increasing pressure . "
the new plan also includes a tax on uranium fuel rods that bruederle said would generate 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- in government revenue annually .
a renewable energy fund would also be established that would collect 300 million euros from power companies each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without a majority in the bundesrat , merkel hopes to bypass the upper house constitutional court battle brewing the opposition is also displeased by suggestions from the government that the plan only needs the approval of the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , and not the bundesrat , the upper house , which represents the country 's 16 states .
merkel 's coalition of conservative christian democrats , their bavarian sister party , the christian social union and the liberal free democrats argues that the nuclear plant deadline is a federal issue , not a state matter .
the governing coalition lost its majority in the bundesrat in the state election in north rhine-westphalia in may .
it still has a majority in the bundestag .
the opposition has said if the government does bypass the bundesrat , it will go to the country 's constitutional court .

the organization called for a halt to the practice . the international human rights organization amnesty international has released a damning report which says european union -lrb- eu -rrb- countries have been quietly deporting roma gypsies back to kosovo for over a year .
the report , titled " not welcome anywhere : stop the forced return of roma to kosovo " , singles out germany as a chief perpetrator , alleging many of the gypsies are being forcibly removed from their homes at early hours in the morning with nothing more than the clothes on their back .
amnesty says that many of the roma are made to sign statements attesting their deportation is voluntary .
the report calculates that almost 10,000 roma are legally obliged to leave the country and are therefore at risk of forcible return to kosovo from germany alone .
it says the roma deportations began during negotiations of a bilateral readmission agreement between germany and kosovo in 2009 , which was finally signed on april 14 , 2010 , and came into force on september 1 , 2010 .
roma discrimination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic albanians were the driving force behind kosovo 's independence sian jones , amnesty 's kosovo expert , said eu countries risked breaking international law by sending roma back " to places where they are at risk of persecution , or other serious harm . "
discrimination against roma in kosovo is " widespread and systematic compounded by their perceived association with kosovo serbs , " said amnesty .
" the eu should instead continue to provide international protection for roma and other minorities in kosovo until they can return there safely , " added sian jones .
" the kosovo authorities must also ensure that roma and other minorities can return voluntarily and reintegrate fully in society . "
the london-based rights group said few roma receive help on their return to kosovo , meaning many face problems in obtaining access to education , healthcare , housing and social benefits .
deportations from germany are organized by the individual states , and there are wide differences between the strictness with which they are carried out , with some states having imposed a virtual moratorium .
roma clampdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding issued a sharp rebuke of french policy on roma a recent report by the united nations children 's organization , unicef , indicates that nearly 40 percent of the roma returned from germany are stateless , and that as many as 50 percent who are legally obliged to leave are children .
it also states that almost two-thirds of them are born and educated in germany .
the partially-recognized republic of kosovo declared itself independent from serbia in 2008 .
so far , the independence of the albanian-majority state has been recognized by 70 countries .
the amnesty report comes amid international outrage at a clampdown on roma in france , which has seen hundreds of them sent back to romania and bulgaria since the beginning of august despite eu legislation on the free movement of people .
eu justice commissioner viviane reding threatened to take legal action against france over the deportations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 28.09.2010 iran sentences blogging pioneer to more than 19 years in prison großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court called hossein derakhshan an " anti-revolutionary blogger " iranian-canadian hossein derakhshan was a dissident blogger , but he became outspokenly pro-ahmadinejad .
in november 2008 , he returned to iran and was subsequently arrested .
he was sentenced to 19.5 years in jail . an iranian court has sentenced iranian-canadian blogger hossein derakhshan to 19.5 years in prison , according to iranian media .
the conservative website , mashreghnews.ir , which is close to iran 's presidential office , said derakhshan was convicted on charges of cooperation with hostile countries , spreading propaganda against the ruling establishment , promotion of counterrevolutionary groups and insulting islamic thoughts and religious figures .
verdict can be appealed he was also given a five years ' ban from membership in political parties and activities in the media , and was sentenced to returning received funds in the amount of 30,750 euros , $ 2,900 , and 200 british pounds .
derakhshan can appeal , the report added .
before the verdict , immediate family members as well as reporters without borders had feared hossein derakhshan may be threatened with death penalty .
the iranian blogging pioneer has been held in a tehran prison for nearly two years and has been given little , if any , access to legal representation and no consular access to canadian authorities .
in recent days , family members had said that the prosecutor was seeking the death penalty for derakhshan .
a blogging leader ten years ago , hossein derakhshan moved from iran to canada to study .
that 's where he met his wife , who is also from iran , and became a canadian citizen .
in 2001 , from his base in toronto , derakhshan penned an online guide teaching iranians how to blog in their own language and championed persian blogging from both inside and outside of his homeland .
dubbed by some as " the blogfather , " derakhshan was frequently interviewed by western media outlets about the nascent iranian blogging community and his blogs in both english and persian .
as he continued at the time , he also became an outspoken critic of iran 's religious leadership .
blogging from toronto , and later paris and london , under the pen name " hoder , " derakhshan criticized iran 's elite as being inflexible and unwilling to engage in reform , while attacking ayatollah khamenei directly in his writing .
in 2005 , he served as a jury member in deutsche welle 's best of the blogs awards .
the following year , he made a very public trip to israel , which is normally forbidden for iranian citizens .
" i 'm going to israel as a citizen journalist and a peace activist , ” he wrote on his english blog at the time .
" i 'm a citizen of canada and i have the right to visit any country i want . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : derakhshan defended iran 's nuclear program in the face of protests a change of views later that year , derakhshan suddenly switched his political perspective and became a staunch nationalist and defender of the islamic republic .
in 2006 , derakhshan wrote an opinion piece defending iran 's nuclear program in the washington post .
he also began to attack activists and former friends on his blogs and in other media .
later he told the guardian newspaper in vehement words that if the united states attacked iran , he would return and fight for his homeland .
after visiting israel , derakhshan moved to london to pursue graduate studies . that 's when he went from making oppositional statements to outright supporting the new president .
he went on rhetorical rampages against many who had previously been his friends and colleagues and later was even sued for libel in the united states in 2007 .
in the fall of 2008 , before derakhshan returned to iran , he asked his friends to not take a public stance if he was arrested .
derakhshan had returned to iran in late 2008 , apparently having secured a job offer at press tv , the country 's english-language news service , but was arrested two weeks after his arrival .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad himself asked for a swift resolution to the case .
arrested after two weeks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahmoud ahmadinejad called for a swift resolution to derakhshan 's case however , little is known about his current situation .
a brief statement made three months ago by tehran accuses him of insulting the prophet muhammad along with iran 's spiritual leader and president , as well as disseminating " anti-revolutionary propaganda " and spying for israel .
derakhshan 's mother told an expatriate iranian news website , kamtarin.com , that she has visited her son in prison .
his physical and mental conditions are worrisome .
canadian citizenship not accepted unlike other possible death penalty cases in iran , the customary wave of popular solidarity failed to materialize behind derakhshan , although there has been some attention online and in the canadian media .
even the mayor of paris , bertrand delanoe , rallied to his support in a statement on his website .
" in the name of paris , i solemnly call upon the judicial authorities of tehran to not condemn hossein derakhshan to death , " he wrote last week . " and i invite the mobilization of all of our energies to save this honorable , courageous and dignified life . "
but derakhshan 's political stance and relationship to ahmadinejad remains clouded .
iranian authorities have not accepted derakhshan efforts to invoke his rights as a canadian citizen .
" despite the iranian government ’ s position , we consider mr. derakhshan to be a canadian citizen , " wrote lisa monette , a spokesperson from the canadian department of foreign affairs and international trade , in a statement sent to deutsche welle .
" we will continue to press the iranian authorities for access , as we have in similar cases involving dual nationals in other jurisdictions .
canada continues to urge iran to fully respect all of its human rights obligations , both in law and in practice . "
iranian authorities have arrested numerous bloggers in recent years in a bid to clamp down on internet dissent .

opposition leaders say it ’ s a blow to the growing renewable energy sector . cabinet ministers in berlin on tuesday presented a new energy concept which they called exemplary and unmatched in the world , and which includes a controversial extension to germany 's nuclear power plants .
" the concept is not just a vision , " said environment minister norbert roettgen in berlin .
" by 2050 , about 80 percent of all energy consumed in this country will come from renewable sources , but on the way to this age we need nuclear power for an interim period to make this happen . "
under the new plan , the deadline to shut down germany 's nuclear power plants would be extended by an average of 12 years , with the last one running until 2036 .
merkel and her government say the extension is needed to keep germany running until renewable energy sources can supply the country with enough energy to replace what is produced by nuclear plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's cabinet insists the extension is necessary " a longer lifespan for nuclear power plants will help us keep energy prices affordable for both private consumers and industry , " said economics minister rainer bruederle .
" and it 'll be easier for us to reduce harmful gas emissions . "
effects on renewable energy that 's an argument that the opposition reject .
both sigmar gabriel , chairman of the spd , and juergen trittin , co-chairman of the greens , said the government 's plan would hurt the renewable energy industry with providers having to compete with nuclear energy to get a foothold in the market .
both trittin and gabriel are former environment ministers under previous coalition governments .
" with its energy plan , the government is about to block the creation of 300,000 new jobs in the renewables sector , " gabriel told german public broadcaster ard .
" many small and medium-sized firms involved in generating renewable energy are now being put under increasing pressure . "
the new plan also includes a tax on uranium fuel rods that bruederle said would generate 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- in government revenue annually .
a renewable energy fund would also be established that would collect 300 million euros from power companies each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without a majority in the bundesrat , merkel hopes to bypass the upper house constitutional court battle brewing the opposition is also displeased by suggestions from the government that the plan only needs the approval of the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , and not the bundesrat , the upper house , which represents the country 's 16 states .
merkel 's coalition of conservative christian democrats , their bavarian sister party , the christian social union and the liberal free democrats argues that the nuclear plant deadline is a federal issue , not a state matter .
the governing coalition lost its majority in the bundesrat in the state election in north rhine-westphalia in may .
it still has a majority in the bundestag .
the opposition has said if the government does bypass the bundesrat , it will go to the country 's constitutional court .

opposition leaders say it ’ s a blow to the growing renewable energy sector . cabinet ministers in berlin on tuesday presented a new energy concept which they called exemplary and unmatched in the world , and which includes a controversial extension to germany 's nuclear power plants .
" the concept is not just a vision , " said environment minister norbert roettgen in berlin .
" by 2050 , about 80 percent of all energy consumed in this country will come from renewable sources , but on the way to this age we need nuclear power for an interim period to make this happen . "
under the new plan , the deadline to shut down germany 's nuclear power plants would be extended by an average of 12 years , with the last one running until 2036 .
merkel and her government say the extension is needed to keep germany running until renewable energy sources can supply the country with enough energy to replace what is produced by nuclear plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's cabinet insists the extension is necessary " a longer lifespan for nuclear power plants will help us keep energy prices affordable for both private consumers and industry , " said economics minister rainer bruederle .
" and it 'll be easier for us to reduce harmful gas emissions . "

both sigmar gabriel , chairman of the spd , and juergen trittin , co-chairman of the greens , said the government 's plan would hurt the renewable energy industry with providers having to compete with nuclear energy to get a foothold in the market .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern germany -pipe- 28.09.2010 east german scientists faced opportunities and disappointment during reunification großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leibniz institute for plant biochemistry was one of east germany 's premiere scientific laboratories as in other fields , east german science struggled to find its place in a unified germany .
for some it was easier than others , as older faculty were often forced out , and younger faculty found opportunities in the west . while the rest of the country was trying to figure how to integrate two governments , two currencies and two of nearly everything else , the sciences were no different .
after unification , the west german government advisory body , the council of science and humanities was tasked with evaluating east german research facilities , according to karl ulrich mayer , a west german sociologist at yale university in the united states .
" a whole number of institutes were closed down , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle , nearly two decades after the official reunification date of october 3 , 1990 .
" -lsb- mainly -rsb- because it was assumed that they were too much of the party line , " he added .
mayer is now also president of the leibniz association , which comprises of 86 research institutions across germany , including many in the former east germany , like the leibniz institute for plant biochemistry outside of leipzig . he added that the hard sciences too , were not immune to cuts and layoffs . "
in jena there was a big academy of science institutes in the area of penicillin research , that was reduced to about 550 people from 1,000 , " said mayer , " and these 550 people were then distributed among two leibniz institutes and a few university institutes . "
while some east german institutes were absorbed into existing west german facilities , the max planck society refused to do this , which gave them the opportunity to found new research institutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1964 , this was the office of the famed east german biochemist karl mothes , the ipb 's first director publication restrictions for east german research the german democratic republic , or gdr as it was known in english , focused on other hard sciences , including chemistry , biotechnology and nuclear science .
the gdr received reactor technology from the soviet union .
while research studies from the hard sciences had the chance to be published in western journals , it was much tougher for the social sciences and humanities , according to dieter hoffman , a fellow at the max planck institute for the history of science in berlin .
before the wall came down , hoffmann worked at the east german academy of sciences in the institute for theory and the history of science . "
it was not possible for me for instance , to publish in western journals , " said hoffmann , " and also i could not go to west to visit colleagues or conferences and to present there my scientific research . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people who worked at the ipb during the east german period lost their jobs or were forced to retire scientists who did n't toe the party line , or who were suspected of criticizing the regime quickly found their work censored or not published at all .
still , there were some instances that proved to be beneficial for young scientists under the gdr .
hildegard maria nickel worked as a sociologist at the academy of educational sciences in east germany .
she says now that she would never have had the opportunity to become a professor if she had n't grown up in east germany because of her background .
born to working class parents , nickel 's father was a migrant and she was one of eight children .
in the gdr , women were given the same opportunities as men to work and study .
despite such advances , nickel found herself increasingly disillusioned with a system that censored findings it did n't want to hear .
" i think we did really good research on the youth in gdr and we could see how they feel in the end of the 70s , 80s , that they want to leave the gdr , " said nickel , " but nobody wanted to know it and we could n't publish it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before the wall came down , dieter hoffmann worked at the east german academy of sciences in the institute for theory and the history of science .
unification brought new opportunities when the wall came down , nickel and hoffmann were able to find jobs in a unified germany , easily travel and freely publish .
but many older faculty , found themselves demoted or pushed out . "
some people went to an early retirement .
some people could start a new scientific career or continue their career in a new location or institute and some people became unemployed , " said hoffman .
one of the prime examples of scientists finding a new career under a unified germany was , of course angela merkel , germany 's current chancellor .
before she entered politics , merkel studied , worked and eventually earned her doctorate in quantum chemistry in east berlin .
while integrating east and west german science research centres was a difficult process for many , hoffmann added that in a unified germany today there are plenty of exciting areas of research .
after all , he observed , the city of jena is a world leader in optics and home to companies like carl zeiss , schott and jenoptik .
dresden specializes in material sciences , and freiberg in saxony is known for solar power manufacturing . "
i think what you find now on the landscape -lsb- is -rsb- very often amazing , " he said . " for instance here in berlin , this institute for laser physics - max-born institute - that 's one of the worldwide leading institutes in this field . "

"
the company claims that it can significantly reduce cost power consumption in desalination technology .
that , combined with existing research at local universities and britain 's first desalination plant , which came online in june , are turning london into one of europe 's hubs for desalination research and development .
southeast england drier than you think bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european environment agency says that southeast england is a region of " severe water stress " that may seem a bit strange , given britain 's reputation for wet summers and rainy days , people do n't generally think of britain as a country that is short on water . but southeast england is actually classified as an area of " severe water stress " by the european environment agency , with less rain than rome and a lower annual rainfall than most of germany .
although it is an unremarkable-looking set of grey warehouses and storage tanks , the thames water plant has revolutionized water provision in the capital .
in times of drought , the company says the plant can provide a new source of clean water to up to one million people .
" with climate change threatening hotter , drier summers and an additional 700,000 people forecast to move to london by 2021 , " the company wrote in an online statement in june , " the new water works will be available to help provide the capital 's supplies for the future - whatever the weather . "
as well as being britain 's first , the thames water plant is the only one in the world to use a four-stage version of a desalination process called reverse osmosis .
reverse osmosis – the standard in water desalination – involves pumping salt water at high pressure through very fine membranes .
the water molecules are forced through the membrane , but not the salt molecules , leaving clean water the other side .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the thames water plant is the first in the world to use a four-stage reverse osmosis system unlike similar plants around the world , in the thames water plant the salty water is sent through the membranes four times , meaning that an impressive 85 percent of the intake is converted into drinking water .
and by taking water from a tidal section of the river thames , the plant needs less energy than those which use more salty sea water .
secret agents meanwhile , on the other side of london from the thames plant , a company called modern water has developed a desalination process which it says could transform water provision around the globe .
the key innovations in modern water 's system - currently undergoing commercial trials in oman - are a process called forward osmosis , combined with the use of a secret " osmotic agent . "
" on one side of our membrane we have sea water which contains not only salt but other ions , " explained the executive chairman , neil macdougall in an interview with deutsche welle .
" on the other we have fresh water with a very concentrated solution using our osmotic agent .
using the natural process of osmosis , the fresh water is pulled across . "
in the next stage , the osmotic agent - whose exact composition is carefully guarded by the company - is removed from the water to produce clean drinking water .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london-based modern water says its test of a desalination facility in al khaluf , oman has been successful forward osmosis still requires a membrane to separate the salty from the clean water , but the water does n't have to be pumped at the high pressure necessary for reverse osmosis . that difference , according to modern water , accounts for a reduction in energy costs of around 30 percent .
and since energy costs constitute around half of the running costs of a typical desalination plant , this could dramatically change the business model for desalination plants .
according to the uk-based magazine global water intelligence – which tracks the desalination industry - the mystery surrounding modern water 's osmotic agent means that it is difficult to fully evaluate the process .
but modern water itself is confident enough to set the ambitious goal of bringing down the cost of desalinating water until it is on a par with the cost of treating fresh water .
growth industry the construction of new desalination plants , and recent advances by companies like modern water have brought desalination from the driest regions of the world – like the middle east – to more temperate regions like london , and that growth is set to continue .
" the current desalination capacity in the world is 68 million cubic meters a day , " said christopher gasson , the publisher of global water intelligence magazine , " and we think that will increase to around 130m cubic meters per day by 2016 , around doubling the whole industry . "
this does little to impress environmental groups , however , who share a fundamental objection to the desalination industry .
they argue that by making available a practically unlimited source of new water from the sea , desalination discourages us from using the water we already have more wisely .
where environmentalists do agree with industry figures , however , is that with over a billion people short of water around the globe , new desalination techniques have the potential to provide water to people who otherwise would n't have it .
still , the world wildlife fund -lrb- wwf -rrb- believes that , in most cases , the easiest way to increase our water supply is simply to waste less water . " in most cases our easiest source of new water for drinking water , or for industrial or cooling is to waste less water , " said phil dickie , the author of the wwf 's 2007 report on desalination , " and the cost of wasting less is much less than that of taking sea water and going through quite energy-intensive processes to turn it into fresh drinking water .

even some members of the ruling party are calling for it to be toned down . debate over a controversial bill to reform immigration and citizenship regulations began in the french parliament on tuesday , with members of both the ruling and opposition parties offering criticism .
the bill is france 's fifth piece of immigration legislation in seven years , and would , among other things , make it easier for the government to revoke french nationality from citizens who have been naturalized for less than 10 years and who have been convicted of killing or attacking a policeman or any public official .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bill also simplifies entry for highly qualified immigrants immigration minister eric besson , who first proposed the legislation , said in an interview with le parisien newspaper that he wanted his ministry to be " a machine to produce good french citizens . "

besson 's original bill took a more moderate approach before president nicolas sarkozy and interior minister brice hortefeux toughened it during cabinet debate .
opposition on both sides in addition to the citizenship regulations , the bill would allow france to deport foreigners , including eu citizens , for theft , aggressive begging or abusing the right to remain in france for 30 days without permission by leaving and re-entering the country to renew that right . at the same time if would speed up entry procedures for highly qualified immigrants .
sarkozy 's government argues that the legislation would bring france into line with european union immigration directives , but critics have accused him of twisting those directives to fit a populist , anti-immigrant agenda , possibly to attract far-right voters ahead of presidential elections in 2012 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics like the bill to france 's expulsions of roma opposition socialist spokesman bruno le roux said if passed into law , the bill would amount to " another step taken in the deterioration of republican principles . "
etienne pinte , a member of parliament from sarkozy 's own conservative ump party , said the bill was an attempt to bring in votes in the far-right national front party .
he said he would seek up to 40 amendments to " humanize " the bill , or vote against it .
new york-based human rights watch has urged parliament to reject the bill and tied it in with france 's mass roma expulsions , the legality of which is currently the subject of debate in the european commission .
" it is shocking that the french government is pushing for measures that clearly target roma , " said hrw 's judith sunderland . " it smacks of a populist move at the expense of the most discriminated against and vulnerable people in europe today . "

"
the company claims that it can significantly reduce cost power consumption in desalination technology .
that , combined with existing research at local universities and britain 's first desalination plant , which came online in june , are turning london into one of europe 's hubs for desalination research and development .
southeast england drier than you think bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european environment agency says that southeast england is a region of " severe water stress " that may seem a bit strange , given britain 's reputation for wet summers and rainy days , people do n't generally think of britain as a country that is short on water . but southeast england is actually classified as an area of " severe water stress " by the european environment agency , with less rain than rome and a lower annual rainfall than most of germany .
although it is an unremarkable-looking set of grey warehouses and storage tanks , the thames water plant has revolutionized water provision in the capital .
in times of drought , the company says the plant can provide a new source of clean water to up to one million people .
" with climate change threatening hotter , drier summers and an additional 700,000 people forecast to move to london by 2021 , " the company wrote in an online statement in june , " the new water works will be available to help provide the capital 's supplies for the future - whatever the weather . "
as well as being britain 's first , the thames water plant is the only one in the world to use a four-stage version of a desalination process called reverse osmosis .
reverse osmosis – the standard in water desalination – involves pumping salt water at high pressure through very fine membranes .
the water molecules are forced through the membrane , but not the salt molecules , leaving clean water the other side .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the thames water plant is the first in the world to use a four-stage reverse osmosis system unlike similar plants around the world , in the thames water plant the salty water is sent through the membranes four times , meaning that an impressive 85 percent of the intake is converted into drinking water .
and by taking water from a tidal section of the river thames , the plant needs less energy than those which use more salty sea water .
secret agents meanwhile , on the other side of london from the thames plant , a company called modern water has developed a desalination process which it says could transform water provision around the globe .
the key innovations in modern water 's system - currently undergoing commercial trials in oman - are a process called forward osmosis , combined with the use of a secret " osmotic agent . "
" on one side of our membrane we have sea water which contains not only salt but other ions , " explained the executive chairman , neil macdougall in an interview with deutsche welle .
" on the other we have fresh water with a very concentrated solution using our osmotic agent .
using the natural process of osmosis , the fresh water is pulled across . "
in the next stage , the osmotic agent - whose exact composition is carefully guarded by the company - is removed from the water to produce clean drinking water .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london-based modern water says its test of a desalination facility in al khaluf , oman has been successful forward osmosis still requires a membrane to separate the salty from the clean water , but the water does n't have to be pumped at the high pressure necessary for reverse osmosis . that difference , according to modern water , accounts for a reduction in energy costs of around 30 percent .
and since energy costs constitute around half of the running costs of a typical desalination plant , this could dramatically change the business model for desalination plants .
according to the uk-based magazine global water intelligence – which tracks the desalination industry - the mystery surrounding modern water 's osmotic agent means that it is difficult to fully evaluate the process .
but modern water itself is confident enough to set the ambitious goal of bringing down the cost of desalinating water until it is on a par with the cost of treating fresh water .
growth industry the construction of new desalination plants , and recent advances by companies like modern water have brought desalination from the driest regions of the world – like the middle east – to more temperate regions like london , and that growth is set to continue .
" the current desalination capacity in the world is 68 million cubic meters a day , " said christopher gasson , the publisher of global water intelligence magazine , " and we think that will increase to around 130m cubic meters per day by 2016 , around doubling the whole industry . "
this does little to impress environmental groups , however , who share a fundamental objection to the desalination industry .
they argue that by making available a practically unlimited source of new water from the sea , desalination discourages us from using the water we already have more wisely .
where environmentalists do agree with industry figures , however , is that with over a billion people short of water around the globe , new desalination techniques have the potential to provide water to people who otherwise would n't have it .
still , the world wildlife fund -lrb- wwf -rrb- believes that , in most cases , the easiest way to increase our water supply is simply to waste less water . " in most cases our easiest source of new water for drinking water , or for industrial or cooling is to waste less water , " said phil dickie , the author of the wwf 's 2007 report on desalination , " and the cost of wasting less is much less than that of taking sea water and going through quite energy-intensive processes to turn it into fresh drinking water .

southeast england drier than you think bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european environment agency says that southeast england is a region of " severe water stress " that may seem a bit strange , given britain 's reputation for wet summers and rainy days , people do n't generally think of britain as a country that is short on water . but southeast england is actually classified as an area of " severe water stress " by the european environment agency , with less rain than rome and a lower annual rainfall than most of germany .
although it is an unremarkable-looking set of grey warehouses and storage tanks , the thames water plant has revolutionized water provision in the capital .
in times of drought , the company says the plant can provide a new source of clean water to up to one million people .
" with climate change threatening hotter , drier summers and an additional 700,000 people forecast to move to london by 2021 , " the company wrote in an online statement in june , " the new water works will be available to help provide the capital 's supplies for the future - whatever the weather . "
as well as being britain 's first , the thames water plant is the only one in the world to use a four-stage version of a desalination process called reverse osmosis .
reverse osmosis – the standard in water desalination – involves pumping salt water at high pressure through very fine membranes .
the water molecules are forced through the membrane , but not the salt molecules , leaving clean water the other side .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the thames water plant is the first in the world to use a four-stage reverse osmosis system unlike similar plants around the world , in the thames water plant the salty water is sent through the membranes four times , meaning that an impressive 85 percent of the intake is converted into drinking water .
and by taking water from a tidal section of the river thames , the plant needs less energy than those which use more salty sea water .
secret agents meanwhile , on the other side of london from the thames plant , a company called modern water has developed a desalination process which it says could transform water provision around the globe .
the key innovations in modern water 's system - currently undergoing commercial trials in oman - are a process called forward osmosis , combined with the use of a secret " osmotic agent . "
" on one side of our membrane we have sea water which contains not only salt but other ions , " explained the executive chairman , neil macdougall in an interview with deutsche welle .
" on the other we have fresh water with a very concentrated solution using our osmotic agent .
using the natural process of osmosis , the fresh water is pulled across . "
in the next stage , the osmotic agent - whose exact composition is carefully guarded by the company - is removed from the water to produce clean drinking water .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london-based modern water says its test of a desalination facility in al khaluf , oman has been successful forward osmosis still requires a membrane to separate the salty from the clean water , but the water does n't have to be pumped at the high pressure necessary for reverse osmosis . that difference , according to modern water , accounts for a reduction in energy costs of around 30 percent .
and since energy costs constitute around half of the running costs of a typical desalination plant , this could dramatically change the business model for desalination plants .
according to the uk-based magazine global water intelligence – which tracks the desalination industry - the mystery surrounding modern water 's osmotic agent means that it is difficult to fully evaluate the process .
but modern water itself is confident enough to set the ambitious goal of bringing down the cost of desalinating water until it is on a par with the cost of treating fresh water .
growth industry the construction of new desalination plants , and recent advances by companies like modern water have brought desalination from the driest regions of the world – like the middle east – to more temperate regions like london , and that growth is set to continue .
" the current desalination capacity in the world is 68 million cubic meters a day , " said christopher gasson , the publisher of global water intelligence magazine , " and we think that will increase to around 130m cubic meters per day by 2016 , around doubling the whole industry . "
this does little to impress environmental groups , however , who share a fundamental objection to the desalination industry .
they argue that by making available a practically unlimited source of new water from the sea , desalination discourages us from using the water we already have more wisely .
where environmentalists do agree with industry figures , however , is that with over a billion people short of water around the globe , new desalination techniques have the potential to provide water to people who otherwise would n't have it .
still , the world wildlife fund -lrb- wwf -rrb- believes that , in most cases , the easiest way to increase our water supply is simply to waste less water . " in most cases our easiest source of new water for drinking water , or for industrial or cooling is to waste less water , " said phil dickie , the author of the wwf 's 2007 report on desalination , " and the cost of wasting less is much less than that of taking sea water and going through quite energy-intensive processes to turn it into fresh drinking water .

in november 2008 , he returned to iran and was subsequently arrested .
he was sentenced to 19.5 years in jail . an iranian court has sentenced iranian-canadian blogger hossein derakhshan to 19.5 years in prison , according to iranian media .
the conservative website , mashreghnews.ir , which is close to iran 's presidential office , said derakhshan was convicted on charges of cooperation with hostile countries , spreading propaganda against the ruling establishment , promotion of counterrevolutionary groups and insulting islamic thoughts and religious figures .
verdict can be appealed he was also given a five years ' ban from membership in political parties and activities in the media , and was sentenced to returning received funds in the amount of 30,750 euros , $ 2,900 , and 200 british pounds .
derakhshan can appeal , the report added .
before the verdict , immediate family members as well as reporters without borders had feared hossein derakhshan may be threatened with death penalty .
the iranian blogging pioneer has been held in a tehran prison for nearly two years and has been given little , if any , access to legal representation and no consular access to canadian authorities .
in recent days , family members had said that the prosecutor was seeking the death penalty for derakhshan .
a blogging leader ten years ago , hossein derakhshan moved from iran to canada to study .
that 's where he met his wife , who is also from iran , and became a canadian citizen .
in 2001 , from his base in toronto , derakhshan penned an online guide teaching iranians how to blog in their own language and championed persian blogging from both inside and outside of his homeland .
dubbed by some as " the blogfather , " derakhshan was frequently interviewed by western media outlets about the nascent iranian blogging community and his blogs in both english and persian .
as he continued at the time , he also became an outspoken critic of iran 's religious leadership .
blogging from toronto , and later paris and london , under the pen name " hoder , " derakhshan criticized iran 's elite as being inflexible and unwilling to engage in reform , while attacking ayatollah khamenei directly in his writing .
in 2005 , he served as a jury member in deutsche welle 's best of the blogs awards .
the following year , he made a very public trip to israel , which is normally forbidden for iranian citizens .
" i 'm going to israel as a citizen journalist and a peace activist , ” he wrote on his english blog at the time .
" i 'm a citizen of canada and i have the right to visit any country i want . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : derakhshan defended iran 's nuclear program in the face of protests a change of views later that year , derakhshan suddenly switched his political perspective and became a staunch nationalist and defender of the islamic republic .
in 2006 , derakhshan wrote an opinion piece defending iran 's nuclear program in the washington post .
he also began to attack activists and former friends on his blogs and in other media .
later he told the guardian newspaper in vehement words that if the united states attacked iran , he would return and fight for his homeland .
after visiting israel , derakhshan moved to london to pursue graduate studies . that 's when he went from making oppositional statements to outright supporting the new president .
he went on rhetorical rampages against many who had previously been his friends and colleagues and later was even sued for libel in the united states in 2007 .
in the fall of 2008 , before derakhshan returned to iran , he asked his friends to not take a public stance if he was arrested .
derakhshan had returned to iran in late 2008 , apparently having secured a job offer at press tv , the country 's english-language news service , but was arrested two weeks after his arrival .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad himself asked for a swift resolution to the case .
arrested after two weeks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahmoud ahmadinejad called for a swift resolution to derakhshan 's case however , little is known about his current situation .
a brief statement made three months ago by tehran accuses him of insulting the prophet muhammad along with iran 's spiritual leader and president , as well as disseminating " anti-revolutionary propaganda " and spying for israel .
derakhshan 's mother told an expatriate iranian news website , kamtarin.com , that she has visited her son in prison .
his physical and mental conditions are worrisome .
canadian citizenship not accepted unlike other possible death penalty cases in iran , the customary wave of popular solidarity failed to materialize behind derakhshan , although there has been some attention online and in the canadian media .
even the mayor of paris , bertrand delanoe , rallied to his support in a statement on his website .
" in the name of paris , i solemnly call upon the judicial authorities of tehran to not condemn hossein derakhshan to death , " he wrote last week . " and i invite the mobilization of all of our energies to save this honorable , courageous and dignified life . "
but derakhshan 's political stance and relationship to ahmadinejad remains clouded .
iranian authorities have not accepted derakhshan efforts to invoke his rights as a canadian citizen .
" despite the iranian government ’ s position , we consider mr. derakhshan to be a canadian citizen , " wrote lisa monette , a spokesperson from the canadian department of foreign affairs and international trade , in a statement sent to deutsche welle .
" we will continue to press the iranian authorities for access , as we have in similar cases involving dual nationals in other jurisdictions .
canada continues to urge iran to fully respect all of its human rights obligations , both in law and in practice . "
iranian authorities have arrested numerous bloggers in recent years in a bid to clamp down on internet dissent .

a public spat between the two men became the writing on the wall for luzhkov . the kremlin 's website said on tuesday that russian president dmitry medvedev had signed a decree firing moscow mayor yury luzkhov after 18 years on the job .
the sacking comes after months of minor scandals and open mudslinging from both men .
the kremlin said the 74-year-old luzkhov was " dismissed from the position of moscow mayor because he has lost the confidence of the russian president . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow boomed under luzhkov , but major problems remained luzkhov was first appointed in 1992 by boris yeltsin in the wake of the collapse of the soviet union .
he oversaw the transformation of the russian capital from a gray , sleepy city into a glitzy and gleaming economic powerhouse , funneling petrodollars into massive construction projects .
he had long faced allegations of corruption over the business activities of his wife , construction billionaire yelena baturina , and had been accused by preservationists of destroying important historic buildings in the city center .
but a summer of missteps finally cost him his job .
a tough summer the construction boom has left the city with some of the world 's worst traffic and an overextended power grid .
luzhkov was criticized this july when repairs on the main highway leading to the city 's international airport led to lengthy delays .
he struck back over medvedev 's decision to suspend the construction of a highway through a forest outside the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : residents suffered through the smoke without their mayor in august he lost more points with muscovites when he continued his vacation in austria as forest and peat-bog fires filled the city with acrid smoke for weeks .
the kremlin publicly criticized his decision to stay away .
after his initial appointment , luzhkov was reelected in 1996 , 1999 and 2003 .
he was appointed for another four-year term by then-president vladimir putin after elections for regional governors and mayors of the country 's biggest cities were scrapped .
now luzhkov has become a victim of the kremlin 's shakeup of regional leaders .
diminishing popularity luzhkov was known for his bellicose manner and his flat , working man 's caps .
his socially conservative rhetoric targeted gay pride parades , which his police regularly broke up .
he riled progressives further when he allowed billboards with stalin 's image to be used in anniversary celebrations of the world war ii victory this last may .
his popularity had dropped with just 36 percent of respondents to a september opinion poll by the independent levada center saying he was doing a good job .
that was down from 40 percent in july and 65 percent in 2001 .
luzhkov said on television on monday that we would not step down voluntarily .
that was not necessary in the end , and he has now been replaced by his deputy , vladimir resin .

a public spat between the two men became the writing on the wall for luzhkov . the kremlin 's website said on tuesday that russian president dmitry medvedev had signed a decree firing moscow mayor yury luzkhov after 18 years on the job .
the sacking comes after months of minor scandals and open mudslinging from both men .
the kremlin said the 74-year-old luzkhov was " dismissed from the position of moscow mayor because he has lost the confidence of the russian president . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow boomed under luzhkov , but major problems remained luzkhov was first appointed in 1992 by boris yeltsin in the wake of the collapse of the soviet union .
he oversaw the transformation of the russian capital from a gray , sleepy city into a glitzy and gleaming economic powerhouse , funneling petrodollars into massive construction projects .
he had long faced allegations of corruption over the business activities of his wife , construction billionaire yelena baturina , and had been accused by preservationists of destroying important historic buildings in the city center .
but a summer of missteps finally cost him his job .
a tough summer the construction boom has left the city with some of the world 's worst traffic and an overextended power grid .
luzhkov was criticized this july when repairs on the main highway leading to the city 's international airport led to lengthy delays .
he struck back over medvedev 's decision to suspend the construction of a highway through a forest outside the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : residents suffered through the smoke without their mayor in august he lost more points with muscovites when he continued his vacation in austria as forest and peat-bog fires filled the city with acrid smoke for weeks .
the kremlin publicly criticized his decision to stay away .
after his initial appointment , luzhkov was reelected in 1996 , 1999 and 2003 .
he was appointed for another four-year term by then-president vladimir putin after elections for regional governors and mayors of the country 's biggest cities were scrapped .
now luzhkov has become a victim of the kremlin 's shakeup of regional leaders .
diminishing popularity luzhkov was known for his bellicose manner and his flat , working man 's caps .
his socially conservative rhetoric targeted gay pride parades , which his police regularly broke up .
he riled progressives further when he allowed billboards with stalin 's image to be used in anniversary celebrations of the world war ii victory this last may .
his popularity had dropped with just 36 percent of respondents to a september opinion poll by the independent levada center saying he was doing a good job .
that was down from 40 percent in july and 65 percent in 2001 .
luzhkov said on television on monday that we would not step down voluntarily .
that was not necessary in the end , and he has now been replaced by his deputy , vladimir resin .

these are the second such arrests since eta announced a ceasefire that the government says does n't go far enough . early on tuesday , spanish police detained seven suspected members of askapena , considered the international propaganda branch of the armed separatist group eta .
the arrests took place in the basque and navarre regions of northern spain and follow similar police actions earlier in september against ekin , another eta-related group .
all of those being held were charged with belonging to an armed group .
the spanish government has continued its crackdown against the web of basque separatists despite the organization 's declaration of a ceasefire on september 5 .
as a condition of that ceasefire , eta is demanding talks with spain on a possible sovereign basque state made up of part of northern spain and part of southern france .
that possibility has been rejected by prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero , whose government wants an unconditional surrender .
the spanish government is cautious about eta 's promises after the group broke a " permanent ceasefire " in 2006 .
shortly after the government agreed to peace talks , eta set off a bomb in a parking lot at madrid 's airport , killing two men .
eta has killed some 850 people in its 42-year fight for independence and is considered a terrorist organization by the european union and the united states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 28.09.2010 amnesty report condemns eu roma deportations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the deported roma were reportedly children european countries , including germany , have been forcibly returning roma gypsies to kosovo , amnesty international said in a report published on tuesday .
the organization called for a halt to the practice . the international human rights organization amnesty international has released a damning report which says european union -lrb- eu -rrb- countries have been quietly deporting roma gypsies back to kosovo for over a year .
the report , titled " not welcome anywhere : stop the forced return of roma to kosovo " , singles out germany as a chief perpetrator , alleging many of the gypsies are being forcibly removed from their homes at early hours in the morning with nothing more than the clothes on their back .
amnesty says that many of the roma are made to sign statements attesting their deportation is voluntary .
the report calculates that almost 10,000 roma are legally obliged to leave the country and are therefore at risk of forcible return to kosovo from germany alone .
it says the roma deportations began during negotiations of a bilateral readmission agreement between germany and kosovo in 2009 , which was finally signed on april 14 , 2010 , and came into force on september 1 , 2010 .
roma discrimination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic albanians were the driving force behind kosovo 's independence sian jones , amnesty 's kosovo expert , said eu countries risked breaking international law by sending roma back " to places where they are at risk of persecution , or other serious harm . "
discrimination against roma in kosovo is " widespread and systematic compounded by their perceived association with kosovo serbs , " said amnesty .
" the eu should instead continue to provide international protection for roma and other minorities in kosovo until they can return there safely , " added sian jones .
" the kosovo authorities must also ensure that roma and other minorities can return voluntarily and reintegrate fully in society . "
the london-based rights group said few roma receive help on their return to kosovo , meaning many face problems in obtaining access to education , healthcare , housing and social benefits .
deportations from germany are organized by the individual states , and there are wide differences between the strictness with which they are carried out , with some states having imposed a virtual moratorium .
roma clampdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding issued a sharp rebuke of french policy on roma a recent report by the united nations children 's organization , unicef , indicates that nearly 40 percent of the roma returned from germany are stateless , and that as many as 50 percent who are legally obliged to leave are children .
it also states that almost two-thirds of them are born and educated in germany .
the partially-recognized republic of kosovo declared itself independent from serbia in 2008 .
so far , the independence of the albanian-majority state has been recognized by 70 countries .
the amnesty report comes amid international outrage at a clampdown on roma in france , which has seen hundreds of them sent back to romania and bulgaria since the beginning of august despite eu legislation on the free movement of people .
eu justice commissioner viviane reding threatened to take legal action against france over the deportations .

the organization called for a halt to the practice . the international human rights organization amnesty international has released a damning report which says european union -lrb- eu -rrb- countries have been quietly deporting roma gypsies back to kosovo for over a year .
the report , titled " not welcome anywhere : stop the forced return of roma to kosovo " , singles out germany as a chief perpetrator , alleging many of the gypsies are being forcibly removed from their homes at early hours in the morning with nothing more than the clothes on their back .
amnesty says that many of the roma are made to sign statements attesting their deportation is voluntary .
the report calculates that almost 10,000 roma are legally obliged to leave the country and are therefore at risk of forcible return to kosovo from germany alone .
it says the roma deportations began during negotiations of a bilateral readmission agreement between germany and kosovo in 2009 , which was finally signed on april 14 , 2010 , and came into force on september 1 , 2010 .
roma discrimination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic albanians were the driving force behind kosovo 's independence sian jones , amnesty 's kosovo expert , said eu countries risked breaking international law by sending roma back " to places where they are at risk of persecution , or other serious harm . "
discrimination against roma in kosovo is " widespread and systematic compounded by their perceived association with kosovo serbs , " said amnesty .
" the eu should instead continue to provide international protection for roma and other minorities in kosovo until they can return there safely , " added sian jones .
" the kosovo authorities must also ensure that roma and other minorities can return voluntarily and reintegrate fully in society . "
the london-based rights group said few roma receive help on their return to kosovo , meaning many face problems in obtaining access to education , healthcare , housing and social benefits .
deportations from germany are organized by the individual states , and there are wide differences between the strictness with which they are carried out , with some states having imposed a virtual moratorium .
roma clampdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding issued a sharp rebuke of french policy on roma a recent report by the united nations children 's organization , unicef , indicates that nearly 40 percent of the roma returned from germany are stateless , and that as many as 50 percent who are legally obliged to leave are children .
it also states that almost two-thirds of them are born and educated in germany .
the partially-recognized republic of kosovo declared itself independent from serbia in 2008 .
so far , the independence of the albanian-majority state has been recognized by 70 countries .
the amnesty report comes amid international outrage at a clampdown on roma in france , which has seen hundreds of them sent back to romania and bulgaria since the beginning of august despite eu legislation on the free movement of people .
eu justice commissioner viviane reding threatened to take legal action against france over the deportations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 28.09.2010 german town resists carbon capture and storage scheme großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vattenfall says its coal plant is ready to capture and store its co2 emissions carbon capture and storage -lrb- ccs -rrb- promises to make coal power green .
one company says it is ready to deploy the technology , but locals are fighting plans to bury the carbon under their town . energy giant vattenfall is currently testing its procedure for carbon capture and storage -lrb- ccs -rrb- in a part of eastern germany known as lausitz .
" we 're working on a process to remove co2 from waste gas .
that way we 're hoping to make the process of generating electricity from brown coal climate-friendlier " , said vattenfall 's lutz picard who shows visitors around daily to explain how the company wants to make coal production green .
the company says some 55 million tons of lignite , also known as brown coal , are still produced here every year .
the pilot facility , at vattenfall 's schwarze pumpe brown-coal power plant , is trialing a technique which the company calls ' oxyfuel ' because it involves adding large amounts of oxygen to the coal-burning process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oxygen is added when burning coal to extract the co2 half the equation " we add oxygen when we burn the coal " , said vattenfall 's lutz picard .
" that 's how we 're able to remove co2 from the waste gas because the concentration of co2 at the cauldron 's mouthpiece is higher . "
after it has been cleaned in several steps , the company says it is able to extract almost pure co2 .
at the moment , however , the co2 that is being extracted is simply being released back into the atmosphere , because the company is still waiting for a new law which would allow it to pump the gas underground .
germany 's government is expected to give the green light to ccs technology , in line with its recently-announced energy concept for the next 40 years , which aims to promote a massive expansion of renewable energies while keeping energy prices stable through " bridge " technologies like nuclear power .
at vattenfall 's schwarze pumpe site , this would mean trucks and pipelines would be used to transport co2 to the small town of beeskow nearby , where it would be pressed 1,000 meters below the surface .
vattenfall is confident of securing the necessary legislation , but it has since hit another snag : local resistance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beeskow 's inhabitants are against the plans to store co2 below their town guinea pigs the inhabitants of beeskow are against the plans and have put up big yellow crosses all along the road .
the pictures are reminiscent of the protest carried out by the anti-nuclear movement in other parts of germany , where energy giants are planning to build repositories for nuclear waste .
beeskow 's inhabitants say there has n't been enough investigation of the potential impact of pumping the carbon below their town , and they do n't want to be used as " guinea pigs . " many are afraid that the carbon might not be as clean as promised by vattenfall , and that sulfur and heavy metals like arsenic could get into the drinking water via the ground water .
even if the gas were clean , underground storage could lead to another problem , said activist hardy feldmann , because the liquid co2 would be pressed into porous sand stone which contains very salty water , or brine .
" the brine would have to make space for the co2 " , feldmann said .
" that would mean it would end up in the ground water .
so we would have high levels of salt in the ground water . "
so far , the city of beeskow has vetoed vattenfall 's plans to conduct geological research on the brine layers , and has attacked federal authorities for allowing vattenfall to proceed with its plans despite the absence of a law on the technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the co2 extracted be pure enough to be stored underground ?
export opportunity but these concerns are not shared at vattenfall .
lutz picard stresses that his company will do everything it can to purify the greenhouse gas and make the underground storage facility as secure as possible .
for him the technology is inevitable .
" in germany you may argue about where coal ranks as a source of energy " , picard said .
" but in countries like china or india you ca n't .
there , coal is available and people will use it .
and then the only question is : how do you use coal in a climate-friendly way ? "
for vattenfall , capturing and storing carbon dioxide could mean a big export opportunity – and perhaps one of it 's last in the coal mining industry , considering that in 40 years ' time , germany is supposed to end to its own coal production .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the remodeled jawaharlal nehru stadium is where the opening and closing ceremonies are due to take place several athletes from australia and the uk have already withdrawn from the games due to health and safety concerns . difficult situation from the start the crisis for games organizers started long ago with several deadlines for completion of sporting venues and infrastructure being missed . " we inherited a very difficult situation , " said sheila dikshit , the chief minister of delhi , who has been monitoring the preparations .
" but it is improving almost by the hour .
of course there have been some seepages that the builders should have looked at earlier but we will finish whatever we can and do whatever is possible . " but recent events have cast doubt on whether it is really possible to improve matters considerably .
a snake was found in a south african athlete 's room at the games village and a cobra was recovered from the r k khanna tennis stadium . bildunterschrift : many migrant workers have been sleeping on the streets of delhi mark doyle , an australian athlete , tried to downplay the incident however .
" i think we are okay from the snake point of view .
we are australians and used to dealing with the most venomous , so a couple of snakes is not going to be an issue for us . " after initially staying in hotels , more than 1,000 athletes , including 36 from australia , have now moved to the athletes ' village . blame game in full swing however , the blame game is in full swing and the knives are clearly sharpening for some accountability .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commonwealth games village dining hall will welcome thousands one man seems willing to take responsibility - suresh kalmadi , the commonwealth games organizing committee chairman -lrb- oc -rrb- , who has come under fire from all sides for his shabby handling of the preparations . " i have just come back from the village and i had lunch with all the athletes .
all of them love the village and said they had never seen such a village anywhere .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern germany -pipe- 28.09.2010 east german scientists faced opportunities and disappointment during reunification großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leibniz institute for plant biochemistry was one of east germany 's premiere scientific laboratories as in other fields , east german science struggled to find its place in a unified germany .
for some it was easier than others , as older faculty were often forced out , and younger faculty found opportunities in the west . while the rest of the country was trying to figure how to integrate two governments , two currencies and two of nearly everything else , the sciences were no different .
after unification , the west german government advisory body , the council of science and humanities was tasked with evaluating east german research facilities , according to karl ulrich mayer , a west german sociologist at yale university in the united states .
" a whole number of institutes were closed down , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle , nearly two decades after the official reunification date of october 3 , 1990 .
" -lsb- mainly -rsb- because it was assumed that they were too much of the party line , " he added .
mayer is now also president of the leibniz association , which comprises of 86 research institutions across germany , including many in the former east germany , like the leibniz institute for plant biochemistry outside of leipzig . he added that the hard sciences too , were not immune to cuts and layoffs . "
in jena there was a big academy of science institutes in the area of penicillin research , that was reduced to about 550 people from 1,000 , " said mayer , " and these 550 people were then distributed among two leibniz institutes and a few university institutes . "
while some east german institutes were absorbed into existing west german facilities , the max planck society refused to do this , which gave them the opportunity to found new research institutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1964 , this was the office of the famed east german biochemist karl mothes , the ipb 's first director publication restrictions for east german research the german democratic republic , or gdr as it was known in english , focused on other hard sciences , including chemistry , biotechnology and nuclear science .
the gdr received reactor technology from the soviet union .
while research studies from the hard sciences had the chance to be published in western journals , it was much tougher for the social sciences and humanities , according to dieter hoffman , a fellow at the max planck institute for the history of science in berlin .
before the wall came down , hoffmann worked at the east german academy of sciences in the institute for theory and the history of science . "
it was not possible for me for instance , to publish in western journals , " said hoffmann , " and also i could not go to west to visit colleagues or conferences and to present there my scientific research . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people who worked at the ipb during the east german period lost their jobs or were forced to retire scientists who did n't toe the party line , or who were suspected of criticizing the regime quickly found their work censored or not published at all .
still , there were some instances that proved to be beneficial for young scientists under the gdr .
hildegard maria nickel worked as a sociologist at the academy of educational sciences in east germany .
she says now that she would never have had the opportunity to become a professor if she had n't grown up in east germany because of her background .
born to working class parents , nickel 's father was a migrant and she was one of eight children .
in the gdr , women were given the same opportunities as men to work and study .
despite such advances , nickel found herself increasingly disillusioned with a system that censored findings it did n't want to hear .
" i think we did really good research on the youth in gdr and we could see how they feel in the end of the 70s , 80s , that they want to leave the gdr , " said nickel , " but nobody wanted to know it and we could n't publish it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before the wall came down , dieter hoffmann worked at the east german academy of sciences in the institute for theory and the history of science .
unification brought new opportunities when the wall came down , nickel and hoffmann were able to find jobs in a unified germany , easily travel and freely publish .
but many older faculty , found themselves demoted or pushed out . "
some people went to an early retirement .
some people could start a new scientific career or continue their career in a new location or institute and some people became unemployed , " said hoffman .
one of the prime examples of scientists finding a new career under a unified germany was , of course angela merkel , germany 's current chancellor .
before she entered politics , merkel studied , worked and eventually earned her doctorate in quantum chemistry in east berlin .
while integrating east and west german science research centres was a difficult process for many , hoffmann added that in a unified germany today there are plenty of exciting areas of research .
after all , he observed , the city of jena is a world leader in optics and home to companies like carl zeiss , schott and jenoptik .
dresden specializes in material sciences , and freiberg in saxony is known for solar power manufacturing . "
i think what you find now on the landscape -lsb- is -rsb- very often amazing , " he said . " for instance here in berlin , this institute for laser physics - max-born institute - that 's one of the worldwide leading institutes in this field . "

for some it was easier than others , as older faculty were often forced out , and younger faculty found opportunities in the west . while the rest of the country was trying to figure how to integrate two governments , two currencies and two of nearly everything else , the sciences were no different .
after unification , the west german government advisory body , the council of science and humanities was tasked with evaluating east german research facilities , according to karl ulrich mayer , a west german sociologist at yale university in the united states .
" a whole number of institutes were closed down , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle , nearly two decades after the official reunification date of october 3 , 1990 .
" -lsb- mainly -rsb- because it was assumed that they were too much of the party line , " he added .
mayer is now also president of the leibniz association , which comprises of 86 research institutions across germany , including many in the former east germany , like the leibniz institute for plant biochemistry outside of leipzig . he added that the hard sciences too , were not immune to cuts and layoffs .

hildegard maria nickel worked as a sociologist at the academy of educational sciences in east germany .
she says now that she would never have had the opportunity to become a professor if she had n't grown up in east germany because of her background .
born to working class parents , nickel 's father was a migrant and she was one of eight children .
in the gdr , women were given the same opportunities as men to work and study .
despite such advances , nickel found herself increasingly disillusioned with a system that censored findings it did n't want to hear .
" i think we did really good research on the youth in gdr and we could see how they feel in the end of the 70s , 80s , that they want to leave the gdr , " said nickel , " but nobody wanted to know it and we could n't publish it . "

one of the prime examples of scientists finding a new career under a unified germany was , of course angela merkel , germany 's current chancellor .
before she entered politics , merkel studied , worked and eventually earned her doctorate in quantum chemistry in east berlin .
while integrating east and west german science research centres was a difficult process for many , hoffmann added that in a unified germany today there are plenty of exciting areas of research .

opposition leaders say it ’ s a blow to the growing renewable energy sector . cabinet ministers in berlin on tuesday presented a new energy concept which they called exemplary and unmatched in the world , and which includes a controversial extension to germany 's nuclear power plants .
" the concept is not just a vision , " said environment minister norbert roettgen in berlin .
" by 2050 , about 80 percent of all energy consumed in this country will come from renewable sources , but on the way to this age we need nuclear power for an interim period to make this happen . "
under the new plan , the deadline to shut down germany 's nuclear power plants would be extended by an average of 12 years , with the last one running until 2036 .
merkel and her government say the extension is needed to keep germany running until renewable energy sources can supply the country with enough energy to replace what is produced by nuclear plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's cabinet insists the extension is necessary " a longer lifespan for nuclear power plants will help us keep energy prices affordable for both private consumers and industry , " said economics minister rainer bruederle .
" and it 'll be easier for us to reduce harmful gas emissions . "
effects on renewable energy that 's an argument that the opposition reject .
both sigmar gabriel , chairman of the spd , and juergen trittin , co-chairman of the greens , said the government 's plan would hurt the renewable energy industry with providers having to compete with nuclear energy to get a foothold in the market .
both trittin and gabriel are former environment ministers under previous coalition governments .
" with its energy plan , the government is about to block the creation of 300,000 new jobs in the renewables sector , " gabriel told german public broadcaster ard .
" many small and medium-sized firms involved in generating renewable energy are now being put under increasing pressure . "
the new plan also includes a tax on uranium fuel rods that bruederle said would generate 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- in government revenue annually .
a renewable energy fund would also be established that would collect 300 million euros from power companies each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without a majority in the bundesrat , merkel hopes to bypass the upper house constitutional court battle brewing the opposition is also displeased by suggestions from the government that the plan only needs the approval of the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , and not the bundesrat , the upper house , which represents the country 's 16 states .
merkel 's coalition of conservative christian democrats , their bavarian sister party , the christian social union and the liberal free democrats argues that the nuclear plant deadline is a federal issue , not a state matter .
the governing coalition lost its majority in the bundesrat in the state election in north rhine-westphalia in may .
it still has a majority in the bundestag .
the opposition has said if the government does bypass the bundesrat , it will go to the country 's constitutional court .

opposition leaders say it ’ s a blow to the growing renewable energy sector . cabinet ministers in berlin on tuesday presented a new energy concept which they called exemplary and unmatched in the world , and which includes a controversial extension to germany 's nuclear power plants .
" the concept is not just a vision , " said environment minister norbert roettgen in berlin .
" by 2050 , about 80 percent of all energy consumed in this country will come from renewable sources , but on the way to this age we need nuclear power for an interim period to make this happen . "
under the new plan , the deadline to shut down germany 's nuclear power plants would be extended by an average of 12 years , with the last one running until 2036 .
merkel and her government say the extension is needed to keep germany running until renewable energy sources can supply the country with enough energy to replace what is produced by nuclear plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's cabinet insists the extension is necessary " a longer lifespan for nuclear power plants will help us keep energy prices affordable for both private consumers and industry , " said economics minister rainer bruederle .
" and it 'll be easier for us to reduce harmful gas emissions . "
effects on renewable energy that 's an argument that the opposition reject .
both sigmar gabriel , chairman of the spd , and juergen trittin , co-chairman of the greens , said the government 's plan would hurt the renewable energy industry with providers having to compete with nuclear energy to get a foothold in the market .
both trittin and gabriel are former environment ministers under previous coalition governments .
" with its energy plan , the government is about to block the creation of 300,000 new jobs in the renewables sector , " gabriel told german public broadcaster ard .
" many small and medium-sized firms involved in generating renewable energy are now being put under increasing pressure . "
the new plan also includes a tax on uranium fuel rods that bruederle said would generate 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- in government revenue annually .
a renewable energy fund would also be established that would collect 300 million euros from power companies each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without a majority in the bundesrat , merkel hopes to bypass the upper house constitutional court battle brewing the opposition is also displeased by suggestions from the government that the plan only needs the approval of the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , and not the bundesrat , the upper house , which represents the country 's 16 states .
merkel 's coalition of conservative christian democrats , their bavarian sister party , the christian social union and the liberal free democrats argues that the nuclear plant deadline is a federal issue , not a state matter .
the governing coalition lost its majority in the bundesrat in the state election in north rhine-westphalia in may .
it still has a majority in the bundestag .
the opposition has said if the government does bypass the bundesrat , it will go to the country 's constitutional court .

institute director ahman sarmast told dw about the school 's roots and goals . afghanistan 's ministry of education established its first music school in 1973 .
the kabul-based school has had a tumultuous history , paralleling that of its home country .
since 2008 , musicologist and afghan native dr. ahmad sarmast has headed a new project at the afghanistan national institute of music -lrb- anim -rrb- that aims to help rebuild musical life in the country .
the project is sponsored in part by the world bank , the german government , the goethe institute and the german society of music merchants . dr. sarmast talked with deutsche welle about the challenges and promise of the endeavor .
deutsche welle : what does anim stand for ?
ahmad sarmast : the afghanistan national institute of music is the only music school in afghanistan .
students enroll in the fourth grade and they receive both formal and musical education .
they graduate after 10 years of continuous music education with a diploma in music .
our music department is divided into two branches : afghan traditional music and western classical music .
at the moment , we have 154 students , but eventually we will be able to host 300 .
where did the idea come from ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration is a major hurdle - but also a central goal - at the school i left my country at an early age after completing my studies in moscow .
actually , i am the first afghan with a doctorate in music .
since the collapse of najibullah 's leftist regime -lsb- in 1992 -rsb- , i have kept an eye on the evolution of music in my country .
i spent most of my time in exile in australia , and it was there that i thought about establishing a music school in my country of origin .
negotiations with the local administration and potential fundraisers began in 2007 , but the final implementation of the project took place in 2008 .
you had a comfortable life in australia .
what brought you back to afghanistan ?
one of the reasons was my background and my social status here .
my father was a well known conductor , but i also had the secret dream that i could help to change the minds of thousands of young afghans towards music .
many of those who grew up under the taliban regime were completely brainwashed against music .
in fact , kabul used to be a more cultivated and sophisticated city but most of the intellectuals and educated people of afghanistan left during the rule by the communist government and after its collapse .
kabul today is nothing but a big village , which has lost its once sophisticated and open-minded society .
you mentioned before that you have 154 students .
are all of them " street kids " ?
when i came to afghanistan my goal was to establish a music school just for street kids and orphans .
but after discussions with the ministry of education we agreed that 50 percent of the seats would be reserved for the most advantaged families of the country .
we did n't want to deprive any talented potential student from getting musical education .
at the moment , street kids still do n't make up 50 percent of the total because we have " inherited " some others that already belonged to the former school of fine arts .
today , we have 24 street kids with us .
some were selling chewing gum , plastic bags or boiled eggs in the street .
now , we give their families 30 us dollars to stay in school as a kind of compensation for their loss of income .
we are also trying to provide them with buses so they do n't need to waste any money at all on transportation .
what kind of problems do you face with this group of children ?
recently , i lost a very talented girl .
she wasn ’ t attending her classes , and i could n't contact her family .
just a few days ago , we discovered that she had been engaged .
she is only 14 .
there are also the difficulties of integrating the street kids into a basic school discipline .
we have to re-educate them , in the full meaning of the verb .
it also helps them to recover after so many years of war and destruction .
that is all that they have seen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarmast came home to afghanistan to head the music project do you have any other plans for the near future ?
once we have fully implemented the kabul center , we have plans to spread the idea to mazar-e sharif and to establish a second school there .
we are also planning a third school in herat and a fourth in jalalabad .
i have already started to gather funds for mazar-e sharif 's school , and germany is very interested .
their troops are based in the same area , in the north of the country , and berlin is investing in several other cultural projects there .
given the current situation of unrest and the apparently ever-growing power of the taliban , are n't you afraid that music might well be silenced again in the short term ?
i am a very optimistic man - otherwise , i would not be here now .
but more important is the fact that music has always been present in afghanistan .
even during the taliban regime , people would smuggle records and cassettes at the risk of their lives .
drivers would always have two kinds of music : the kind they liked , but also the muslim chants in case they ran across taliban officials and had to swap the tapes .
afghans have always loved music .

in fact , kabul used to be a more cultivated and sophisticated city but most of the intellectuals and educated people of afghanistan left during the rule by the communist government and after its collapse .
kabul today is nothing but a big village , which has lost its once sophisticated and open-minded society .
you mentioned before that you have 154 students .
are all of them " street kids " ?
when i came to afghanistan my goal was to establish a music school just for street kids and orphans .
but after discussions with the ministry of education we agreed that 50 percent of the seats would be reserved for the most advantaged families of the country .
we did n't want to deprive any talented potential student from getting musical education .
at the moment , street kids still do n't make up 50 percent of the total because we have " inherited " some others that already belonged to the former school of fine arts .
today , we have 24 street kids with us .
some were selling chewing gum , plastic bags or boiled eggs in the street .
now , we give their families 30 us dollars to stay in school as a kind of compensation for their loss of income .
we are also trying to provide them with buses so they do n't need to waste any money at all on transportation .
what kind of problems do you face with this group of children ?
recently , i lost a very talented girl .
she wasn ’ t attending her classes , and i could n't contact her family .
just a few days ago , we discovered that she had been engaged .
she is only 14 .
there are also the difficulties of integrating the street kids into a basic school discipline .
we have to re-educate them , in the full meaning of the verb .
it also helps them to recover after so many years of war and destruction .
that is all that they have seen .

once we have fully implemented the kabul center , we have plans to spread the idea to mazar-e sharif and to establish a second school there .
we are also planning a third school in herat and a fourth in jalalabad .
i have already started to gather funds for mazar-e sharif 's school , and germany is very interested .

institute director ahman sarmast told dw about the school 's roots and goals . afghanistan 's ministry of education established its first music school in 1973 .
the kabul-based school has had a tumultuous history , paralleling that of its home country .
since 2008 , musicologist and afghan native dr. ahmad sarmast has headed a new project at the afghanistan national institute of music -lrb- anim -rrb- that aims to help rebuild musical life in the country .
the project is sponsored in part by the world bank , the german government , the goethe institute and the german society of music merchants . dr. sarmast talked with deutsche welle about the challenges and promise of the endeavor .
deutsche welle : what does anim stand for ?
ahmad sarmast : the afghanistan national institute of music is the only music school in afghanistan .
students enroll in the fourth grade and they receive both formal and musical education .
they graduate after 10 years of continuous music education with a diploma in music .
our music department is divided into two branches : afghan traditional music and western classical music .
at the moment , we have 154 students , but eventually we will be able to host 300 .
where did the idea come from ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration is a major hurdle - but also a central goal - at the school i left my country at an early age after completing my studies in moscow .
actually , i am the first afghan with a doctorate in music .
since the collapse of najibullah 's leftist regime -lsb- in 1992 -rsb- , i have kept an eye on the evolution of music in my country .
i spent most of my time in exile in australia , and it was there that i thought about establishing a music school in my country of origin .
negotiations with the local administration and potential fundraisers began in 2007 , but the final implementation of the project took place in 2008 .
you had a comfortable life in australia .
what brought you back to afghanistan ?
one of the reasons was my background and my social status here .
my father was a well known conductor , but i also had the secret dream that i could help to change the minds of thousands of young afghans towards music .
many of those who grew up under the taliban regime were completely brainwashed against music .
in fact , kabul used to be a more cultivated and sophisticated city but most of the intellectuals and educated people of afghanistan left during the rule by the communist government and after its collapse .
kabul today is nothing but a big village , which has lost its once sophisticated and open-minded society .

are all of them " street kids " ?
when i came to afghanistan my goal was to establish a music school just for street kids and orphans .
but after discussions with the ministry of education we agreed that 50 percent of the seats would be reserved for the most advantaged families of the country .
we did n't want to deprive any talented potential student from getting musical education .
at the moment , street kids still do n't make up 50 percent of the total because we have " inherited " some others that already belonged to the former school of fine arts .
today , we have 24 street kids with us .
some were selling chewing gum , plastic bags or boiled eggs in the street .
now , we give their families 30 us dollars to stay in school as a kind of compensation for their loss of income .
we are also trying to provide them with buses so they do n't need to waste any money at all on transportation .

even some members of the ruling party are calling for it to be toned down . debate over a controversial bill to reform immigration and citizenship regulations began in the french parliament on tuesday , with members of both the ruling and opposition parties offering criticism .
the bill is france 's fifth piece of immigration legislation in seven years , and would , among other things , make it easier for the government to revoke french nationality from citizens who have been naturalized for less than 10 years and who have been convicted of killing or attacking a policeman or any public official .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bill also simplifies entry for highly qualified immigrants immigration minister eric besson , who first proposed the legislation , said in an interview with le parisien newspaper that he wanted his ministry to be " a machine to produce good french citizens . "
" last year we gave french nationality to 108,000 foreigners , " the newspaper quoted him as saying .
" being a ' good french person ' does n't mean denying your history , your roots or your french culture . "
besson 's original bill took a more moderate approach before president nicolas sarkozy and interior minister brice hortefeux toughened it during cabinet debate .
opposition on both sides in addition to the citizenship regulations , the bill would allow france to deport foreigners , including eu citizens , for theft , aggressive begging or abusing the right to remain in france for 30 days without permission by leaving and re-entering the country to renew that right . at the same time if would speed up entry procedures for highly qualified immigrants .
sarkozy 's government argues that the legislation would bring france into line with european union immigration directives , but critics have accused him of twisting those directives to fit a populist , anti-immigrant agenda , possibly to attract far-right voters ahead of presidential elections in 2012 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics like the bill to france 's expulsions of roma opposition socialist spokesman bruno le roux said if passed into law , the bill would amount to " another step taken in the deterioration of republican principles . "
etienne pinte , a member of parliament from sarkozy 's own conservative ump party , said the bill was an attempt to bring in votes in the far-right national front party .
he said he would seek up to 40 amendments to " humanize " the bill , or vote against it .
new york-based human rights watch has urged parliament to reject the bill and tied it in with france 's mass roma expulsions , the legality of which is currently the subject of debate in the european commission .
" it is shocking that the french government is pushing for measures that clearly target roma , " said hrw 's judith sunderland . " it smacks of a populist move at the expense of the most discriminated against and vulnerable people in europe today . "

a public spat between the two men became the writing on the wall for luzhkov . the kremlin 's website said on tuesday that russian president dmitry medvedev had signed a decree firing moscow mayor yury luzkhov after 18 years on the job .
the sacking comes after months of minor scandals and open mudslinging from both men .
the kremlin said the 74-year-old luzkhov was " dismissed from the position of moscow mayor because he has lost the confidence of the russian president . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow boomed under luzhkov , but major problems remained luzkhov was first appointed in 1992 by boris yeltsin in the wake of the collapse of the soviet union .
he oversaw the transformation of the russian capital from a gray , sleepy city into a glitzy and gleaming economic powerhouse , funneling petrodollars into massive construction projects .
he had long faced allegations of corruption over the business activities of his wife , construction billionaire yelena baturina , and had been accused by preservationists of destroying important historic buildings in the city center .
but a summer of missteps finally cost him his job .
a tough summer the construction boom has left the city with some of the world 's worst traffic and an overextended power grid .
luzhkov was criticized this july when repairs on the main highway leading to the city 's international airport led to lengthy delays .
he struck back over medvedev 's decision to suspend the construction of a highway through a forest outside the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : residents suffered through the smoke without their mayor in august he lost more points with muscovites when he continued his vacation in austria as forest and peat-bog fires filled the city with acrid smoke for weeks .
the kremlin publicly criticized his decision to stay away .
after his initial appointment , luzhkov was reelected in 1996 , 1999 and 2003 .
he was appointed for another four-year term by then-president vladimir putin after elections for regional governors and mayors of the country 's biggest cities were scrapped .
now luzhkov has become a victim of the kremlin 's shakeup of regional leaders .
diminishing popularity luzhkov was known for his bellicose manner and his flat , working man 's caps .
his socially conservative rhetoric targeted gay pride parades , which his police regularly broke up .
he riled progressives further when he allowed billboards with stalin 's image to be used in anniversary celebrations of the world war ii victory this last may .
his popularity had dropped with just 36 percent of respondents to a september opinion poll by the independent levada center saying he was doing a good job .
that was down from 40 percent in july and 65 percent in 2001 .
luzhkov said on television on monday that we would not step down voluntarily .
that was not necessary in the end , and he has now been replaced by his deputy , vladimir resin .

in november 2008 , he returned to iran and was subsequently arrested .
he was sentenced to 19.5 years in jail . an iranian court has sentenced iranian-canadian blogger hossein derakhshan to 19.5 years in prison , according to iranian media .
the conservative website , mashreghnews.ir , which is close to iran 's presidential office , said derakhshan was convicted on charges of cooperation with hostile countries , spreading propaganda against the ruling establishment , promotion of counterrevolutionary groups and insulting islamic thoughts and religious figures .
verdict can be appealed he was also given a five years ' ban from membership in political parties and activities in the media , and was sentenced to returning received funds in the amount of 30,750 euros , $ 2,900 , and 200 british pounds .
derakhshan can appeal , the report added .
before the verdict , immediate family members as well as reporters without borders had feared hossein derakhshan may be threatened with death penalty .
the iranian blogging pioneer has been held in a tehran prison for nearly two years and has been given little , if any , access to legal representation and no consular access to canadian authorities .
in recent days , family members had said that the prosecutor was seeking the death penalty for derakhshan .
a blogging leader ten years ago , hossein derakhshan moved from iran to canada to study .
that 's where he met his wife , who is also from iran , and became a canadian citizen .
in 2001 , from his base in toronto , derakhshan penned an online guide teaching iranians how to blog in their own language and championed persian blogging from both inside and outside of his homeland .
dubbed by some as " the blogfather , " derakhshan was frequently interviewed by western media outlets about the nascent iranian blogging community and his blogs in both english and persian .
as he continued at the time , he also became an outspoken critic of iran 's religious leadership .
blogging from toronto , and later paris and london , under the pen name " hoder , " derakhshan criticized iran 's elite as being inflexible and unwilling to engage in reform , while attacking ayatollah khamenei directly in his writing .
in 2005 , he served as a jury member in deutsche welle 's best of the blogs awards .
the following year , he made a very public trip to israel , which is normally forbidden for iranian citizens .
" i 'm going to israel as a citizen journalist and a peace activist , ” he wrote on his english blog at the time .
" i 'm a citizen of canada and i have the right to visit any country i want . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : derakhshan defended iran 's nuclear program in the face of protests a change of views later that year , derakhshan suddenly switched his political perspective and became a staunch nationalist and defender of the islamic republic .
in 2006 , derakhshan wrote an opinion piece defending iran 's nuclear program in the washington post .
he also began to attack activists and former friends on his blogs and in other media .
later he told the guardian newspaper in vehement words that if the united states attacked iran , he would return and fight for his homeland .
after visiting israel , derakhshan moved to london to pursue graduate studies . that 's when he went from making oppositional statements to outright supporting the new president .
he went on rhetorical rampages against many who had previously been his friends and colleagues and later was even sued for libel in the united states in 2007 .
in the fall of 2008 , before derakhshan returned to iran , he asked his friends to not take a public stance if he was arrested .
derakhshan had returned to iran in late 2008 , apparently having secured a job offer at press tv , the country 's english-language news service , but was arrested two weeks after his arrival .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad himself asked for a swift resolution to the case .
arrested after two weeks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahmoud ahmadinejad called for a swift resolution to derakhshan 's case however , little is known about his current situation .
a brief statement made three months ago by tehran accuses him of insulting the prophet muhammad along with iran 's spiritual leader and president , as well as disseminating " anti-revolutionary propaganda " and spying for israel .
derakhshan 's mother told an expatriate iranian news website , kamtarin.com , that she has visited her son in prison .
his physical and mental conditions are worrisome .
canadian citizenship not accepted unlike other possible death penalty cases in iran , the customary wave of popular solidarity failed to materialize behind derakhshan , although there has been some attention online and in the canadian media .
even the mayor of paris , bertrand delanoe , rallied to his support in a statement on his website .
" in the name of paris , i solemnly call upon the judicial authorities of tehran to not condemn hossein derakhshan to death , " he wrote last week . " and i invite the mobilization of all of our energies to save this honorable , courageous and dignified life . "
but derakhshan 's political stance and relationship to ahmadinejad remains clouded .
iranian authorities have not accepted derakhshan efforts to invoke his rights as a canadian citizen .
" despite the iranian government ’ s position , we consider mr. derakhshan to be a canadian citizen , " wrote lisa monette , a spokesperson from the canadian department of foreign affairs and international trade , in a statement sent to deutsche welle .
" we will continue to press the iranian authorities for access , as we have in similar cases involving dual nationals in other jurisdictions .
canada continues to urge iran to fully respect all of its human rights obligations , both in law and in practice . "
iranian authorities have arrested numerous bloggers in recent years in a bid to clamp down on internet dissent .

" despite the iranian government ’ s position , we consider mr. derakhshan to be a canadian citizen , " wrote lisa monette , a spokesperson from the canadian department of foreign affairs and international trade , in a statement sent to deutsche welle .
" we will continue to press the iranian authorities for access , as we have in similar cases involving dual nationals in other jurisdictions .
canada continues to urge iran to fully respect all of its human rights obligations , both in law and in practice . "
iranian authorities have arrested numerous bloggers in recent years in a bid to clamp down on internet dissent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 28.09.2010 amnesty report condemns eu roma deportations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the deported roma were reportedly children european countries , including germany , have been forcibly returning roma gypsies to kosovo , amnesty international said in a report published on tuesday .
the organization called for a halt to the practice . the international human rights organization amnesty international has released a damning report which says european union -lrb- eu -rrb- countries have been quietly deporting roma gypsies back to kosovo for over a year .
the report , titled " not welcome anywhere : stop the forced return of roma to kosovo " , singles out germany as a chief perpetrator , alleging many of the gypsies are being forcibly removed from their homes at early hours in the morning with nothing more than the clothes on their back .
amnesty says that many of the roma are made to sign statements attesting their deportation is voluntary .
the report calculates that almost 10,000 roma are legally obliged to leave the country and are therefore at risk of forcible return to kosovo from germany alone .
it says the roma deportations began during negotiations of a bilateral readmission agreement between germany and kosovo in 2009 , which was finally signed on april 14 , 2010 , and came into force on september 1 , 2010 .
roma discrimination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic albanians were the driving force behind kosovo 's independence sian jones , amnesty 's kosovo expert , said eu countries risked breaking international law by sending roma back " to places where they are at risk of persecution , or other serious harm . "
discrimination against roma in kosovo is " widespread and systematic compounded by their perceived association with kosovo serbs , " said amnesty .
" the eu should instead continue to provide international protection for roma and other minorities in kosovo until they can return there safely , " added sian jones .
" the kosovo authorities must also ensure that roma and other minorities can return voluntarily and reintegrate fully in society . "
the london-based rights group said few roma receive help on their return to kosovo , meaning many face problems in obtaining access to education , healthcare , housing and social benefits .
deportations from germany are organized by the individual states , and there are wide differences between the strictness with which they are carried out , with some states having imposed a virtual moratorium .
roma clampdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding issued a sharp rebuke of french policy on roma a recent report by the united nations children 's organization , unicef , indicates that nearly 40 percent of the roma returned from germany are stateless , and that as many as 50 percent who are legally obliged to leave are children .
it also states that almost two-thirds of them are born and educated in germany .
the partially-recognized republic of kosovo declared itself independent from serbia in 2008 .
so far , the independence of the albanian-majority state has been recognized by 70 countries .
the amnesty report comes amid international outrage at a clampdown on roma in france , which has seen hundreds of them sent back to romania and bulgaria since the beginning of august despite eu legislation on the free movement of people .
eu justice commissioner viviane reding threatened to take legal action against france over the deportations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern germany -pipe- 28.09.2010 east german scientists faced opportunities and disappointment during reunification großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leibniz institute for plant biochemistry was one of east germany 's premiere scientific laboratories as in other fields , east german science struggled to find its place in a unified germany .
for some it was easier than others , as older faculty were often forced out , and younger faculty found opportunities in the west . while the rest of the country was trying to figure how to integrate two governments , two currencies and two of nearly everything else , the sciences were no different .
after unification , the west german government advisory body , the council of science and humanities was tasked with evaluating east german research facilities , according to karl ulrich mayer , a west german sociologist at yale university in the united states .
" a whole number of institutes were closed down , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle , nearly two decades after the official reunification date of october 3 , 1990 .
" -lsb- mainly -rsb- because it was assumed that they were too much of the party line , " he added .
mayer is now also president of the leibniz association , which comprises of 86 research institutions across germany , including many in the former east germany , like the leibniz institute for plant biochemistry outside of leipzig . he added that the hard sciences too , were not immune to cuts and layoffs . "
in jena there was a big academy of science institutes in the area of penicillin research , that was reduced to about 550 people from 1,000 , " said mayer , " and these 550 people were then distributed among two leibniz institutes and a few university institutes . "
while some east german institutes were absorbed into existing west german facilities , the max planck society refused to do this , which gave them the opportunity to found new research institutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1964 , this was the office of the famed east german biochemist karl mothes , the ipb 's first director publication restrictions for east german research the german democratic republic , or gdr as it was known in english , focused on other hard sciences , including chemistry , biotechnology and nuclear science .
the gdr received reactor technology from the soviet union .
while research studies from the hard sciences had the chance to be published in western journals , it was much tougher for the social sciences and humanities , according to dieter hoffman , a fellow at the max planck institute for the history of science in berlin .
before the wall came down , hoffmann worked at the east german academy of sciences in the institute for theory and the history of science . "
it was not possible for me for instance , to publish in western journals , " said hoffmann , " and also i could not go to west to visit colleagues or conferences and to present there my scientific research . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people who worked at the ipb during the east german period lost their jobs or were forced to retire scientists who did n't toe the party line , or who were suspected of criticizing the regime quickly found their work censored or not published at all .
still , there were some instances that proved to be beneficial for young scientists under the gdr .
hildegard maria nickel worked as a sociologist at the academy of educational sciences in east germany .
she says now that she would never have had the opportunity to become a professor if she had n't grown up in east germany because of her background .
born to working class parents , nickel 's father was a migrant and she was one of eight children .
in the gdr , women were given the same opportunities as men to work and study .
despite such advances , nickel found herself increasingly disillusioned with a system that censored findings it did n't want to hear .
" i think we did really good research on the youth in gdr and we could see how they feel in the end of the 70s , 80s , that they want to leave the gdr , " said nickel , " but nobody wanted to know it and we could n't publish it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before the wall came down , dieter hoffmann worked at the east german academy of sciences in the institute for theory and the history of science .
unification brought new opportunities when the wall came down , nickel and hoffmann were able to find jobs in a unified germany , easily travel and freely publish .
but many older faculty , found themselves demoted or pushed out . "
some people went to an early retirement .
some people could start a new scientific career or continue their career in a new location or institute and some people became unemployed , " said hoffman .
one of the prime examples of scientists finding a new career under a unified germany was , of course angela merkel , germany 's current chancellor .
before she entered politics , merkel studied , worked and eventually earned her doctorate in quantum chemistry in east berlin .
while integrating east and west german science research centres was a difficult process for many , hoffmann added that in a unified germany today there are plenty of exciting areas of research .
after all , he observed , the city of jena is a world leader in optics and home to companies like carl zeiss , schott and jenoptik .
dresden specializes in material sciences , and freiberg in saxony is known for solar power manufacturing . "
i think what you find now on the landscape -lsb- is -rsb- very often amazing , " he said . " for instance here in berlin , this institute for laser physics - max-born institute - that 's one of the worldwide leading institutes in this field . "

and economists , among others , are happy : consumer spending has long been a weak point in the country 's economic performance . german consumer confidence continues to climb as the economy strengthens and unemployment falls , boosting income expectations , according to a survey .
the gfk market research institute said tuesday that its forward-looking consumer confidence index for october rose to 4.9 points , up from a revised 4.3 in september , representing a three-year high .
" the decisive factor in the strong sentiment among consumers is the extremely positive development of the employment market , " gfk said in a statement .
falling unemployment germany 's unemployment rate was 7.6 percent last month .
that was approximately the level at which it was when the us investment bank lehman brothers collapsed two years ago , fueling a global financial crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling unemployment is bolstering consumer confidence although the german economy is showing signs of slower growth in the second half of the year , the federal labor agency 's iab research institute expects unemployment to drop slightly below 3 million people in 2011 to a nine-year low .
low inflation gfk also pointed to the low level of inflation , currently at around 1 percent , as another factor increasing consumer purchasing power .
the market researcher added that consumers in germany are already experiencing an improved income situation ; according to new data from the federal statistical office , gross monthly income after living expenses increased by 2.3 percent in the second quarter . germany , europe 's biggest economy , has enjoyed strong export-led growth this year .
its massive 2.2 percent growth in the second quarter over the previous three-month period has helped the 16-nation eurozone outperform the us .

after unification , the west german government advisory body , the council of science and humanities was tasked with evaluating east german research facilities , according to karl ulrich mayer , a west german sociologist at yale university in the united states .
" a whole number of institutes were closed down , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle , nearly two decades after the official reunification date of october 3 , 1990 .
" -lsb- mainly -rsb- because it was assumed that they were too much of the party line , " he added .
mayer is now also president of the leibniz association , which comprises of 86 research institutions across germany , including many in the former east germany , like the leibniz institute for plant biochemistry outside of leipzig . he added that the hard sciences too , were not immune to cuts and layoffs .

in jena there was a big academy of science institutes in the area of penicillin research , that was reduced to about 550 people from 1,000 , " said mayer , " and these 550 people were then distributed among two leibniz institutes and a few university institutes . "

in the gdr , women were given the same opportunities as men to work and study .
despite such advances , nickel found herself increasingly disillusioned with a system that censored findings it did n't want to hear .
" i think we did really good research on the youth in gdr and we could see how they feel in the end of the 70s , 80s , that they want to leave the gdr , " said nickel , " but nobody wanted to know it and we could n't publish it . "

for some it was easier than others , as older faculty were often forced out , and younger faculty found opportunities in the west . while the rest of the country was trying to figure how to integrate two governments , two currencies and two of nearly everything else , the sciences were no different .
after unification , the west german government advisory body , the council of science and humanities was tasked with evaluating east german research facilities , according to karl ulrich mayer , a west german sociologist at yale university in the united states .
" a whole number of institutes were closed down , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle , nearly two decades after the official reunification date of october 3 , 1990 .
" -lsb- mainly -rsb- because it was assumed that they were too much of the party line , " he added .
mayer is now also president of the leibniz association , which comprises of 86 research institutions across germany , including many in the former east germany , like the leibniz institute for plant biochemistry outside of leipzig . he added that the hard sciences too , were not immune to cuts and layoffs . "
in jena there was a big academy of science institutes in the area of penicillin research , that was reduced to about 550 people from 1,000 , " said mayer , " and these 550 people were then distributed among two leibniz institutes and a few university institutes . "
while some east german institutes were absorbed into existing west german facilities , the max planck society refused to do this , which gave them the opportunity to found new research institutes .

the gdr received reactor technology from the soviet union .
while research studies from the hard sciences had the chance to be published in western journals , it was much tougher for the social sciences and humanities , according to dieter hoffman , a fellow at the max planck institute for the history of science in berlin .
before the wall came down , hoffmann worked at the east german academy of sciences in the institute for theory and the history of science . "
it was not possible for me for instance , to publish in western journals , " said hoffmann , " and also i could not go to west to visit colleagues or conferences and to present there my scientific research . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people who worked at the ipb during the east german period lost their jobs or were forced to retire scientists who did n't toe the party line , or who were suspected of criticizing the regime quickly found their work censored or not published at all .
still , there were some instances that proved to be beneficial for young scientists under the gdr .
hildegard maria nickel worked as a sociologist at the academy of educational sciences in east germany .
she says now that she would never have had the opportunity to become a professor if she had n't grown up in east germany because of her background .
born to working class parents , nickel 's father was a migrant and she was one of eight children .
in the gdr , women were given the same opportunities as men to work and study .
despite such advances , nickel found herself increasingly disillusioned with a system that censored findings it did n't want to hear .
" i think we did really good research on the youth in gdr and we could see how they feel in the end of the 70s , 80s , that they want to leave the gdr , " said nickel , " but nobody wanted to know it and we could n't publish it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before the wall came down , dieter hoffmann worked at the east german academy of sciences in the institute for theory and the history of science .
unification brought new opportunities when the wall came down , nickel and hoffmann were able to find jobs in a unified germany , easily travel and freely publish .
but many older faculty , found themselves demoted or pushed out . "
some people went to an early retirement .
some people could start a new scientific career or continue their career in a new location or institute and some people became unemployed , " said hoffman .
one of the prime examples of scientists finding a new career under a unified germany was , of course angela merkel , germany 's current chancellor .
before she entered politics , merkel studied , worked and eventually earned her doctorate in quantum chemistry in east berlin .
while integrating east and west german science research centres was a difficult process for many , hoffmann added that in a unified germany today there are plenty of exciting areas of research .
after all , he observed , the city of jena is a world leader in optics and home to companies like carl zeiss , schott and jenoptik .
dresden specializes in material sciences , and freiberg in saxony is known for solar power manufacturing . "
i think what you find now on the landscape -lsb- is -rsb- very often amazing , " he said . " for instance here in berlin , this institute for laser physics - max-born institute - that 's one of the worldwide leading institutes in this field . "

and economists , among others , are happy : consumer spending has long been a weak point in the country 's economic performance . german consumer confidence continues to climb as the economy strengthens and unemployment falls , boosting income expectations , according to a survey .
the gfk market research institute said tuesday that its forward-looking consumer confidence index for october rose to 4.9 points , up from a revised 4.3 in september , representing a three-year high .
" the decisive factor in the strong sentiment among consumers is the extremely positive development of the employment market , " gfk said in a statement .
falling unemployment germany 's unemployment rate was 7.6 percent last month .
that was approximately the level at which it was when the us investment bank lehman brothers collapsed two years ago , fueling a global financial crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling unemployment is bolstering consumer confidence although the german economy is showing signs of slower growth in the second half of the year , the federal labor agency 's iab research institute expects unemployment to drop slightly below 3 million people in 2011 to a nine-year low .
low inflation gfk also pointed to the low level of inflation , currently at around 1 percent , as another factor increasing consumer purchasing power .
the market researcher added that consumers in germany are already experiencing an improved income situation ; according to new data from the federal statistical office , gross monthly income after living expenses increased by 2.3 percent in the second quarter . germany , europe 's biggest economy , has enjoyed strong export-led growth this year .
its massive 2.2 percent growth in the second quarter over the previous three-month period has helped the 16-nation eurozone outperform the us .

the move comes as no surprise for n koreans both above and below the 38th parallel . park gun ha knows a little something about the north korean worker ’ s party – he was once a member before defecting to south korea in 2005 and now belongs to an association of formerly high-ranking refugees . he told deutsche welle that even though most north koreans back home probably did not even kim jong-un ’ s name until tuesday , they will probably not be surprised that he is on his way to taking over from his father eventually . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : n korean leader kim jong-il reportedly has kidney problems however , park also pointed out that the question of who the next leader will be is not a top concern for most north koreans .
" north koreans lost hope when kim jong-il took over and the economy went bad , ” he explained .
" now they don ’ t really care about who the successor is .
they are much more concerned with how they will survive . " he said that the pyongyang regime would justify the eventual succession of kim jong-un by stressing his plans to reform the economy .
" that ’ s the only way the north korean people will support him . " government has created a flawless cv for kim jong-un park doubted that either kim jong-un or his aunt kim kyoung hee , who was also appointed as a general on tuesday , had any real experience in the north korean military . lee sae yul , the secretary general of the north korea liberation front , an organization in seoul made up of former north korean soldiers agreed .
" current soldiers in the north korean army would be shocked if they found out about this inexperience but that ’ s unlikely to happen . " " the government there has flawlessly created kim jong-un ’ s education and military experience .
it would be impossible for any one to find out the truth . "
bildunterschrift : members of the ruling worker 's party gather at pyongyang station on their way to the party conference disseminating the truth across the border lee 's organization is trying to change the fact that north koreans do not know the truth by sending dvds and other media across the border with information about kim jong-il ’ s regime and about life outside of north korea .
lee hopes that this will help more and more north koreans to question their government and defect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kim jong-il was confirmed as eventual successor to his father at the last major party meeting in 1980 however , north korea liberation front ’ s director kim myoung ha said that for now , there was not much ordinary north koreans could do to express the dissatisfaction with the leadership . " things will be the same when kim jong-un becomes leader , " he said .
" people will grow to hate the government .
there ’ s not much they can do about it , but they will expect life there to get worse and worse . " he predicted that there would be few public displays of anger but hostility toward the new leader would boil under the surface . author : jason strother -lrb- seoul -rrb- editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite the announcement , schaeuble participated in a cabinet meeting and a press conference on the government 's new energy plan on tuesday .
" the inflammation requires treatment , " spokesman michael offer told reporters in berlin on tuesday .
" the incidents earlier this year have shown that he is also able to complete his duties from the hospital . "
in a routine procedure in mid-february , doctors replaced an implant that helped regulate schaeuble 's digestive system .
he left the hospital on his own accord , but was later readmitted because the wound healed poorly .
past resignation speculation health problems have previously interfered with schaeuble 's duties in the german government .
he was hospitalized in may during a summit of european union finance ministers in brussels because of a reaction to medication .
interior minister thomas de maiziere was quickly flown in to replace him .
such incidents led to speculation that schaeuble would resign his position .
but chancellor angela merkel publicly supported schaeuble 's decision to continue in office and asked him to prioritize his health and allow himself to heal completely .
an assassination attempt by a deranged man in october 1990 left schaeuble a paraplegic .

despite the announcement , schaeuble participated in a cabinet meeting and a press conference on the government 's new energy plan on tuesday .
" the inflammation requires treatment , " spokesman michael offer told reporters in berlin on tuesday .
" the incidents earlier this year have shown that he is also able to complete his duties from the hospital . "
in a routine procedure in mid-february , doctors replaced an implant that helped regulate schaeuble 's digestive system .
he left the hospital on his own accord , but was later readmitted because the wound healed poorly .
past resignation speculation health problems have previously interfered with schaeuble 's duties in the german government .
he was hospitalized in may during a summit of european union finance ministers in brussels because of a reaction to medication .
interior minister thomas de maiziere was quickly flown in to replace him .
such incidents led to speculation that schaeuble would resign his position .
but chancellor angela merkel publicly supported schaeuble 's decision to continue in office and asked him to prioritize his health and allow himself to heal completely .
an assassination attempt by a deranged man in october 1990 left schaeuble a paraplegic .

opposition leaders say it ’ s a blow to the growing renewable energy sector . cabinet ministers in berlin on tuesday presented a new energy concept which they called exemplary and unmatched in the world , and which includes a controversial extension to germany 's nuclear power plants .
" the concept is not just a vision , " said environment minister norbert roettgen in berlin .
" by 2050 , about 80 percent of all energy consumed in this country will come from renewable sources , but on the way to this age we need nuclear power for an interim period to make this happen . "
under the new plan , the deadline to shut down germany 's nuclear power plants would be extended by an average of 12 years , with the last one running until 2036 .
merkel and her government say the extension is needed to keep germany running until renewable energy sources can supply the country with enough energy to replace what is produced by nuclear plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's cabinet insists the extension is necessary " a longer lifespan for nuclear power plants will help us keep energy prices affordable for both private consumers and industry , " said economics minister rainer bruederle .
" and it 'll be easier for us to reduce harmful gas emissions . "
effects on renewable energy that 's an argument that the opposition reject .
both sigmar gabriel , chairman of the spd , and juergen trittin , co-chairman of the greens , said the government 's plan would hurt the renewable energy industry with providers having to compete with nuclear energy to get a foothold in the market .
both trittin and gabriel are former environment ministers under previous coalition governments .
" with its energy plan , the government is about to block the creation of 300,000 new jobs in the renewables sector , " gabriel told german public broadcaster ard .
" many small and medium-sized firms involved in generating renewable energy are now being put under increasing pressure . "
the new plan also includes a tax on uranium fuel rods that bruederle said would generate 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- in government revenue annually .
a renewable energy fund would also be established that would collect 300 million euros from power companies each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without a majority in the bundesrat , merkel hopes to bypass the upper house constitutional court battle brewing the opposition is also displeased by suggestions from the government that the plan only needs the approval of the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , and not the bundesrat , the upper house , which represents the country 's 16 states .
merkel 's coalition of conservative christian democrats , their bavarian sister party , the christian social union and the liberal free democrats argues that the nuclear plant deadline is a federal issue , not a state matter .
the governing coalition lost its majority in the bundesrat in the state election in north rhine-westphalia in may .
it still has a majority in the bundestag .
the opposition has said if the government does bypass the bundesrat , it will go to the country 's constitutional court .

opposition leaders say it ’ s a blow to the growing renewable energy sector . cabinet ministers in berlin on tuesday presented a new energy concept which they called exemplary and unmatched in the world , and which includes a controversial extension to germany 's nuclear power plants .
" the concept is not just a vision , " said environment minister norbert roettgen in berlin .
" by 2050 , about 80 percent of all energy consumed in this country will come from renewable sources , but on the way to this age we need nuclear power for an interim period to make this happen . "
under the new plan , the deadline to shut down germany 's nuclear power plants would be extended by an average of 12 years , with the last one running until 2036 .
merkel and her government say the extension is needed to keep germany running until renewable energy sources can supply the country with enough energy to replace what is produced by nuclear plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's cabinet insists the extension is necessary " a longer lifespan for nuclear power plants will help us keep energy prices affordable for both private consumers and industry , " said economics minister rainer bruederle .
" and it 'll be easier for us to reduce harmful gas emissions . "
effects on renewable energy that 's an argument that the opposition reject .
both sigmar gabriel , chairman of the spd , and juergen trittin , co-chairman of the greens , said the government 's plan would hurt the renewable energy industry with providers having to compete with nuclear energy to get a foothold in the market .
both trittin and gabriel are former environment ministers under previous coalition governments .
" with its energy plan , the government is about to block the creation of 300,000 new jobs in the renewables sector , " gabriel told german public broadcaster ard .
" many small and medium-sized firms involved in generating renewable energy are now being put under increasing pressure . "
the new plan also includes a tax on uranium fuel rods that bruederle said would generate 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- in government revenue annually .
a renewable energy fund would also be established that would collect 300 million euros from power companies each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without a majority in the bundesrat , merkel hopes to bypass the upper house constitutional court battle brewing the opposition is also displeased by suggestions from the government that the plan only needs the approval of the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , and not the bundesrat , the upper house , which represents the country 's 16 states .
merkel 's coalition of conservative christian democrats , their bavarian sister party , the christian social union and the liberal free democrats argues that the nuclear plant deadline is a federal issue , not a state matter .
the governing coalition lost its majority in the bundesrat in the state election in north rhine-westphalia in may .
it still has a majority in the bundestag .
the opposition has said if the government does bypass the bundesrat , it will go to the country 's constitutional court .

the move comes as no surprise for n koreans both above and below the 38th parallel . park gun ha knows a little something about the north korean worker ’ s party – he was once a member before defecting to south korea in 2005 and now belongs to an association of formerly high-ranking refugees . he told deutsche welle that even though most north koreans back home probably did not even kim jong-un ’ s name until tuesday , they will probably not be surprised that he is on his way to taking over from his father eventually . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : n korean leader kim jong-il reportedly has kidney problems however , park also pointed out that the question of who the next leader will be is not a top concern for most north koreans .
" north koreans lost hope when kim jong-il took over and the economy went bad , ” he explained .
" now they don ’ t really care about who the successor is .
they are much more concerned with how they will survive . " he said that the pyongyang regime would justify the eventual succession of kim jong-un by stressing his plans to reform the economy .
" that ’ s the only way the north korean people will support him . " government has created a flawless cv for kim jong-un park doubted that either kim jong-un or his aunt kim kyoung hee , who was also appointed as a general on tuesday , had any real experience in the north korean military . lee sae yul , the secretary general of the north korea liberation front , an organization in seoul made up of former north korean soldiers agreed .
" current soldiers in the north korean army would be shocked if they found out about this inexperience but that ’ s unlikely to happen . " " the government there has flawlessly created kim jong-un ’ s education and military experience .
it would be impossible for any one to find out the truth . "
bildunterschrift : members of the ruling worker 's party gather at pyongyang station on their way to the party conference disseminating the truth across the border lee 's organization is trying to change the fact that north koreans do not know the truth by sending dvds and other media across the border with information about kim jong-il ’ s regime and about life outside of north korea .
lee hopes that this will help more and more north koreans to question their government and defect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kim jong-il was confirmed as eventual successor to his father at the last major party meeting in 1980 however , north korea liberation front ’ s director kim myoung ha said that for now , there was not much ordinary north koreans could do to express the dissatisfaction with the leadership . " things will be the same when kim jong-un becomes leader , " he said .
" people will grow to hate the government .
there ’ s not much they can do about it , but they will expect life there to get worse and worse . " he predicted that there would be few public displays of anger but hostility toward the new leader would boil under the surface . author : jason strother -lrb- seoul -rrb- editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in november 2008 , he returned to iran and was subsequently arrested .
he was sentenced to 19.5 years in jail . an iranian court has sentenced iranian-canadian blogger hossein derakhshan to 19.5 years in prison , according to iranian media .
the conservative website , mashreghnews.ir , which is close to iran 's presidential office , said derakhshan was convicted on charges of cooperation with hostile countries , spreading propaganda against the ruling establishment , promotion of counterrevolutionary groups and insulting islamic thoughts and religious figures .
verdict can be appealed he was also given a five years ' ban from membership in political parties and activities in the media , and was sentenced to returning received funds in the amount of 30,750 euros , $ 2,900 , and 200 british pounds .
derakhshan can appeal , the report added .
before the verdict , immediate family members as well as reporters without borders had feared hossein derakhshan may be threatened with death penalty .
the iranian blogging pioneer has been held in a tehran prison for nearly two years and has been given little , if any , access to legal representation and no consular access to canadian authorities .
in recent days , family members had said that the prosecutor was seeking the death penalty for derakhshan .
a blogging leader ten years ago , hossein derakhshan moved from iran to canada to study .
that 's where he met his wife , who is also from iran , and became a canadian citizen .
in 2001 , from his base in toronto , derakhshan penned an online guide teaching iranians how to blog in their own language and championed persian blogging from both inside and outside of his homeland .
dubbed by some as " the blogfather , " derakhshan was frequently interviewed by western media outlets about the nascent iranian blogging community and his blogs in both english and persian .
as he continued at the time , he also became an outspoken critic of iran 's religious leadership .
blogging from toronto , and later paris and london , under the pen name " hoder , " derakhshan criticized iran 's elite as being inflexible and unwilling to engage in reform , while attacking ayatollah khamenei directly in his writing .
in 2005 , he served as a jury member in deutsche welle 's best of the blogs awards .
the following year , he made a very public trip to israel , which is normally forbidden for iranian citizens .
" i 'm going to israel as a citizen journalist and a peace activist , ” he wrote on his english blog at the time .
" i 'm a citizen of canada and i have the right to visit any country i want . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : derakhshan defended iran 's nuclear program in the face of protests a change of views later that year , derakhshan suddenly switched his political perspective and became a staunch nationalist and defender of the islamic republic .
in 2006 , derakhshan wrote an opinion piece defending iran 's nuclear program in the washington post .
he also began to attack activists and former friends on his blogs and in other media .
later he told the guardian newspaper in vehement words that if the united states attacked iran , he would return and fight for his homeland .
after visiting israel , derakhshan moved to london to pursue graduate studies . that 's when he went from making oppositional statements to outright supporting the new president .
he went on rhetorical rampages against many who had previously been his friends and colleagues and later was even sued for libel in the united states in 2007 .
in the fall of 2008 , before derakhshan returned to iran , he asked his friends to not take a public stance if he was arrested .
derakhshan had returned to iran in late 2008 , apparently having secured a job offer at press tv , the country 's english-language news service , but was arrested two weeks after his arrival .

a brief statement made three months ago by tehran accuses him of insulting the prophet muhammad along with iran 's spiritual leader and president , as well as disseminating " anti-revolutionary propaganda " and spying for israel .
derakhshan 's mother told an expatriate iranian news website , kamtarin.com , that she has visited her son in prison .
his physical and mental conditions are worrisome .
canadian citizenship not accepted unlike other possible death penalty cases in iran , the customary wave of popular solidarity failed to materialize behind derakhshan , although there has been some attention online and in the canadian media .
even the mayor of paris , bertrand delanoe , rallied to his support in a statement on his website .
" in the name of paris , i solemnly call upon the judicial authorities of tehran to not condemn hossein derakhshan to death , " he wrote last week . " and i invite the mobilization of all of our energies to save this honorable , courageous and dignified life . "
but derakhshan 's political stance and relationship to ahmadinejad remains clouded .
iranian authorities have not accepted derakhshan efforts to invoke his rights as a canadian citizen .
" despite the iranian government ’ s position , we consider mr. derakhshan to be a canadian citizen , " wrote lisa monette , a spokesperson from the canadian department of foreign affairs and international trade , in a statement sent to deutsche welle .
" we will continue to press the iranian authorities for access , as we have in similar cases involving dual nationals in other jurisdictions .
canada continues to urge iran to fully respect all of its human rights obligations , both in law and in practice . "
iranian authorities have arrested numerous bloggers in recent years in a bid to clamp down on internet dissent .

iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad himself asked for a swift resolution to the case .
arrested after two weeks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahmoud ahmadinejad called for a swift resolution to derakhshan 's case however , little is known about his current situation .
a brief statement made three months ago by tehran accuses him of insulting the prophet muhammad along with iran 's spiritual leader and president , as well as disseminating " anti-revolutionary propaganda " and spying for israel .
derakhshan 's mother told an expatriate iranian news website , kamtarin.com , that she has visited her son in prison .
his physical and mental conditions are worrisome .
canadian citizenship not accepted unlike other possible death penalty cases in iran , the customary wave of popular solidarity failed to materialize behind derakhshan , although there has been some attention online and in the canadian media .
even the mayor of paris , bertrand delanoe , rallied to his support in a statement on his website .
" in the name of paris , i solemnly call upon the judicial authorities of tehran to not condemn hossein derakhshan to death , " he wrote last week . " and i invite the mobilization of all of our energies to save this honorable , courageous and dignified life . "
but derakhshan 's political stance and relationship to ahmadinejad remains clouded .
iranian authorities have not accepted derakhshan efforts to invoke his rights as a canadian citizen .
" despite the iranian government ’ s position , we consider mr. derakhshan to be a canadian citizen , " wrote lisa monette , a spokesperson from the canadian department of foreign affairs and international trade , in a statement sent to deutsche welle .
" we will continue to press the iranian authorities for access , as we have in similar cases involving dual nationals in other jurisdictions .
canada continues to urge iran to fully respect all of its human rights obligations , both in law and in practice . "
iranian authorities have arrested numerous bloggers in recent years in a bid to clamp down on internet dissent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 28.09.2010 french legislators debate bill on immigration and citizenship großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bill is highly controversial with human rights groups the french parliament has begun debating a bill that would strip naturalized citizens of their nationality for committing certain crimes .
even some members of the ruling party are calling for it to be toned down . debate over a controversial bill to reform immigration and citizenship regulations began in the french parliament on tuesday , with members of both the ruling and opposition parties offering criticism .
the bill is france 's fifth piece of immigration legislation in seven years , and would , among other things , make it easier for the government to revoke french nationality from citizens who have been naturalized for less than 10 years and who have been convicted of killing or attacking a policeman or any public official .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bill also simplifies entry for highly qualified immigrants immigration minister eric besson , who first proposed the legislation , said in an interview with le parisien newspaper that he wanted his ministry to be " a machine to produce good french citizens . "
" last year we gave french nationality to 108,000 foreigners , " the newspaper quoted him as saying .
" being a ' good french person ' does n't mean denying your history , your roots or your french culture . "
besson 's original bill took a more moderate approach before president nicolas sarkozy and interior minister brice hortefeux toughened it during cabinet debate .
opposition on both sides in addition to the citizenship regulations , the bill would allow france to deport foreigners , including eu citizens , for theft , aggressive begging or abusing the right to remain in france for 30 days without permission by leaving and re-entering the country to renew that right . at the same time if would speed up entry procedures for highly qualified immigrants .
sarkozy 's government argues that the legislation would bring france into line with european union immigration directives , but critics have accused him of twisting those directives to fit a populist , anti-immigrant agenda , possibly to attract far-right voters ahead of presidential elections in 2012 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics like the bill to france 's expulsions of roma opposition socialist spokesman bruno le roux said if passed into law , the bill would amount to " another step taken in the deterioration of republican principles . "
etienne pinte , a member of parliament from sarkozy 's own conservative ump party , said the bill was an attempt to bring in votes in the far-right national front party .
he said he would seek up to 40 amendments to " humanize " the bill , or vote against it .
new york-based human rights watch has urged parliament to reject the bill and tied it in with france 's mass roma expulsions , the legality of which is currently the subject of debate in the european commission .
" it is shocking that the french government is pushing for measures that clearly target roma , " said hrw 's judith sunderland . " it smacks of a populist move at the expense of the most discriminated against and vulnerable people in europe today . "

with just two wins this season bayern are ten points adrift of league newcomers mainz 05 , who beat louis van gaal 's side 2-1 last saturday .
schweinsteiger helped bayern keep their champions league 100 percent record with a goal in the 56th minute from the penalty spot and then tapped in the winner in the last minute of regular play to secure all three points for the visitors .
the bavarians now head group e. in their opening match two weeks ago bayern munich beat as roma in their opening group match .
bildunterschrift : basel 's swiss international alexander frei scores the opening goal early lead for basel swiss international alex frei put basel ahead in the 18th minute with their first real goal opportunity .
marco streller , a former stuttgart and cologne player , picked up from a mistake by bayern defender daniel van buyten and passed to frei who slotted the ball in the right-hand corner .
bayern had 65 percent of the ball possession in the first half but failed to use their goal chances .
in the 40th minute basel , who are trained by ex-bayern munich star thorsten fink , nearly made it 2-0 , but goalie joerg butt denied xherdan shaqiri the goal .
coach van gaal reacted by bringing on mario gomez to replace hamid altintop for the start of the second half .
world cup joint top scorer thomas mueller was then brought down in the penalty area by ex-frankfurt player benjamin huggel early in the second half .
bastian schweinsteiger made no mistake taking the penalty to level the score .

when basel took the lead , it was hard , " schweinsteiger said .
" it really hurts because we had a great chance .

yet most venezuelans live in poverty , many of them in shanty towns , some of which sprawl over the hillsides around the capital , caracas .
venezuela 's president , hugo chavez , says he is leading the country - which is enjoying a windfall from high oil prices - through a socialist revolution .

its economic fortunes are tied to world oil prices .
a 1970s boom largely benefited the middle classes , but a subsequent price collapse condemned many of this class to poverty while eroding the living standards of the already impoverished .
unemployment is high and , according to official figures , around 60 % of households are poor .
in 1998 venezuelans broke the stranglehold of the discredited party system to elect the populist left-winger hugo chavez , a former army officer who has proclaimed a " bolivarian revolution " , named after south america 's independence hero .
at a glance politics : president hugo chavez leads a self-styled socialist revolution but polarises domestic opinion economy : venezuela is a major oil producer ; export revenues fund huge social programmes international : mr chavez is a strident critic of washington ; the us portrays him as a security threat .
critics say he is using fuel sales under preferential terms to extend political influence in the region timeline radical reform , political unrest and deep divisions have characterised the president 's term in office .
his supporters - known as " chavistas " - and his detractors have both staged street protests .
supporters say his economic reforms - including the nationalisation of much of the economy , especially the oil sector - and his expansion of social programmes has helped the poor benefit from the country 's oil export revenues .
critics say his actions have damaged economic performance and encouraged inflation , running at 25 % by the end of 2009 .
in january 2010 , the government devalued the bolivar in an attempt to boost oil revenues and simulate domestic production .
venezuela under mr chavez has sought to strengthen its regional influence through diplomatic and economic overtures towards other south american and caribbean nations .
this has been seen , in part , as an effort to counter washington 's influence in the region , and has been a contributory factor in strained relations with us allies such as colombia .
relations with bogota hit a new low in 2009 after the colombian government agreed to closer military ties with the us .

hugo chavez has polarised political opinion the president , who says he wants to create a new form of socialism , has pursued populist policies aimed at helping the poor .
the programmes include free health care , subsidised food and land reform .
critics have accused mr chavez of trying to emulate cuba 's communist system and of increasing state intervention in business .
mr chavez came to prominence when he led a failed coup in 1992 .
after a spell in prison he embarked on a political career that swept him to power in a landslide election victory in 1998 .
the charismatic president often continued to wear his paratrooper 's red beret .
he delighted the poor but infuriated the rich and the powerful news media with his rambling speeches that denounced the wealthy elite .
as mr chavez grew more powerful , his critics said he was leading venezuela towards a cuban-style authoritarian government .
he was criticised for courting countries which attracted us or international disapproval , namely cuba , saddam hussein 's iraq , libya , and more recently , iran .
he was forced out of office by the military in april 2002 , only to be reinstated within 48 hours after a post-coup government collapsed in the face of a rebellion by loyalist troops and massive protests .
following an opposition petition , mr chavez faced a referendum on his rule on 15 august 2004 , from which he emerged victorious .
he won a third term in elections in december 2006 , and in early 2007 , the national assembly - boycotted by the opposition - unanimously voted to grant him sweeping powers to rule by decree for the next 18 months , with the aim of pushing through sweeping economic reforms .
after 2006 , chavez 's government forged ahead with plans to nationalise much of the economy , especially in the energy sector , traditionally dominated by us-owned firms .
mr chavez suffered his first electoral defeat in december 2007 , when voters in a referendum narrowly rejected proposals to extend his powers and accelerate his socialist revolution .
however , venezuelans backed the president by voting to abolish term limits in a february 2009 referendum , clearing the way for mr chavez to run for re-election in 2012 .
the opposition made significant gains in the september 2010 parliamentary elections .
while the socialist party of mr chavez still controls the assembly it missed out on the two-thirds majority which would have given him the freedom to pass his legislative agenda without the support of his opponents .
media overview facts leaders media media watchdogs have been highly critical of the behaviour of the venezuelan media , and of president chavez 's attitudes towards broadcasters and the press .
the president has been accused of creating a hostile , intimidatory climate for journalists , while some private media outlets have been criticised for being involved in the opposition movement against him .
in 2007 he came under fire from media rights groups over the decision not to renew the terrestrial broadcasting licence of rctv , venezuela 's oldest private tv station .
mr chavez accused the network of backing the 2002 coup .
a controversial media law came into effect in 2005 .
officials said it would improve standards by banning the inappropriate airing of scenes of sex and violence .
but critics of the bill , which also prohibits material deemed to harm national security , said it was an attempt to silence media criticism .
venezuela 's many private broadcasters operate alongside state-run radio and tv channels .
president chavez has his own weekly tv and radio programme on the government-run networks .
the country is the main shareholder in telesur , a caracas-based pan-american tv channel which , according to its chairman , aims to present latin america 's vision of itself to the world .
the governments with a stake in the venture are all left wing or left of centre .
