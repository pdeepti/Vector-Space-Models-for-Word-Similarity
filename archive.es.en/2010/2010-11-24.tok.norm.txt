"
liana ganea of the romanian media watchdog active watch said that the media in southeastern europe was not only lacking in quality production but also in freedom of speech .
ganea cited the example of romanian tycoon sorin ovidiu vantu , who in 2009 ordered a journalist working for his media group , realitatea-catavencu , to " attack " certain political figures in romania .
" when i tell you to attack somebody , then you have to just attack him , " the multimillionaire commanded his reporter , who was recording the conversation and afterwards made it public .
romania joined the european union in 2007 ; however , ganea said that the situation had gotten worse ever since , mainly due to a " war " and an " earthquake . "
" the ' war ' was the political battle before the presidential election in 2009 , which unfortunately had a very negative impact on the media .

in albania , lani added , corruption is an " inescapable nemesis " to the freedom of reporting .
apart from politics and business , there is a third influence that infringes on independent journalism , according to ljiliana zurovac , head of the press counsel in bosnia .
zurovac told deutsche welle that media coverage in her country was all too often swayed by religious conviction .
" unfortunately -lsb- religion -rsb- is very strong , but not because the religious centers in bosnia are too pushy .
many media organizations are very willing to cooperate ; and this is regardless of the faith , whether islamic , orthodox , or catholic .

the online news offerings in bulgaria , as for the other countries in southeast europe , are too expansive for any single person to follow .
however , only very few media outlets are able to survive on their own .
without financial assistance , most private broadcasters and television stations would have already gone bankrupt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ganea said the choice was between independence and survival liana ganea , of active watch in romania , says many media organizations there are forced to choose between journalistic independence and bare survival .

we have to talk about the problems of the press openly .
to give our journalists confidence , we have to face the public and discuss our weaknesses .

a central part of the bonn conference was the debate on how journalism in southeast europe can be financed in the future while still allowing for independence from business and political interests .
the director the international federation of journalists , renate schroeder , said at the close of the two-day conference that " we all view journalism as a service for the common good , " referring to the federation 's plans to focus more on southeast europe in the future .

the plans have raised the ire of workers , who went on general strike in protest . public sector workers across portugal went on strike on wednesday , disrupting transport and other services including healthcare .
the day-long strike was called by the country 's two biggest unions in protest at the government 's planned austerity measures .
three-quarters of train services and 60 percent of bus services were cancelled , while no flights took off or landed at any airport .
it was the first joint general strike held by the unions since 1988 .
together , they represent around 1.5 million workers .
the head of the main ugt union , joao proenca said , " it is the biggest strike ever staged . "
making the cuts the socialist government wants to implement the austerity program in a bid to cut a high national level of debt .
prime minister jose socrates has vowed to stick by his course of wage cuts and tax hikes , hoping to quash speculation that portugal will be the next european country to need a bailout after ireland and greece .
commenting during the strike , labor minister helena andre said without the austerity measures , " the consequences for the portuguese and the economy will be a great deal worse . "
the government 's austerity budget is due to be finally approved by parliament this week .
the measures include cutting public sector wages by five percent , freezing pensions and raising value added tax from 21 to 23 percent .
portugal has gone through many years of continuous low growth .
its unemployment rate stands at 10.9 percent - the highest since the 1980s - and it could rise further .
even though the economy has shown some growth this year , economists fear that higher taxes and wage cuts could cause a relapse into recession in 2011 as consumer spending falls .

he has pledged to take measures to improve competition . in his harshest criticism yet of former presidentvladimir putin 's ruling party united russia , president dmitry medvedev warned on wednesday that russian politics faced stagnation because of a lack of competition .
for a full 11 minutes , russian president dmitry medvedev reviewed the state of russian democracy in his video blog , and the general impression was that he was happy with what he saw .
still , he said , the lack of political competition could lead to stagnation , a term usually used to describe the rule of former soviet leader leonid brezhnev , who ruled from 1964 to 1982 .
" it is no secret that at a certain point in our political life symptoms of stagnation began to emerge , " medvedev said in the blog .
" and the danger arose that stability would turn into stagnation .
and such a stagnation is equally damaging for both the ruling party and for opposition forces . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev warned of political stagnation in russia more competition needed medvedev suggested that the current state of events , with the ruling party winning most elections with a landslide , was ultimately harmful to the country and that more competition was sorely needed .
" if the opposition does not stand the slightest chance of winning in an honest battle , it is degraded and becomes marginalized .
but if the ruling party has no chance whatsoever to lose , it simply turns into bronze and ultimately also degrades , like any living organism which does not move , " he said .
united russia , whose leader is prime minister putin , dominates the duma , russia 's lower house of parliament .
it has won virtually every election over the past 10 years , receiving close to 100 percent of the vote in some regions .
in many ways , the party looks like a modern day copy of the communist party of the soviet era .
though support has been dwindling for some time , according to opinion polls , united russia once again emerged as the clear winner in the latest regional elections in october .
but independent observers said the outcome was marred by large-scale fraud .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regional elections were not above board , say observers lip service united russia also dominates television news broadcasts , where opposition parties not represented in parliament have no access whatsoever .
medvedev hardly addressed these concerns , instead devoting most of his time to what he said the government had done to improve the level of democracy in russia , and he clearly did not question whether or not elections held in russia can be called free and fair .
the ruling party , meanwhile , was quick to embrace medvedev 's criticism .
according to one of its leaders , andrei vorobyov , united russia supports the president 's initiatives , even though , he said , it means conditions will be tougher for his party . , " but politics is a struggle , " he said , " and we , as before , are ready to fight for each vote . "
observers in moscow said medvedev 's remarks may be aimed at creating a more liberal image , ahead of presidential and parliamentary elections next year . but neither medvedev nor putin have tipped their hands about which , if any , office they intend to stand for in the 2011 polls .

but in the eyup district , a holy site for muslims , life is veiled in centuries of tradition . it is afternoon in eyup .
the call of the muezzin rings out over the square in front of the mosque .

his mother says softly , " god willing , they will always be a happy couple . " a few meters away , a couple proudly presents their five-year-old son .
the boy looks like a little sultan .
he is wearing a shiny white suit with gold edging and a turban-like headpiece .
in a few days he will participate in the " sunnet " - the turkish circumcision ceremony . before this important event , the boy 's parents take him to the eyup sultan mosque .
" you pray before circumcision - that 's the practice laid down by our prophet , " explains the boy 's father . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eyup is a popular place for wedding ceremonies pilgrims and tourists according to theologian and eyup 's cultural affairs coordinator irfan calisan , the district gets many regular visitors .

" on days of particular religious significance , like the festival of sacrifice , we sometimes have 100,000 visitors per day , " said calisan . muslims flock to eyup not only for special occasions or religious events .
there is also an old tradition , dating back over 500 years , of visiting the gravesite of abu ayyub al-ansari - the companion and standard-bearer of the prophet mohammed , believed to have died there in the seventh century .
the gravesite , located in the mosque 's inner courtyard , dates back to the 15th century .
the eyup district owes its name to this famous religious figure . " many mecca pilgrims make a stopover here , " said calisan .
" we call this tradition from the ottoman times ' little hajj .

they can stand in front of it and pray in the hope of having their wish granted . the graveside is decorated with precious carpets and tiles .
the sarcophagus of abu ayyub al-ansari is in a separate room , behind a silver lattice door .
only the hafiz , the koran reciter , is allowed to enter it .
the mufti of eyup , isa gurler , gave deutsche welle the chance to look inside . " as the prophet left mecca and went to medina , he spent seven months in abu ayyub al-ansari 's house , " explained gurler .
" after the prophet 's death , ansari became a leading islamic scholar .
he told the muslims about the deeds and statements of the prophet . " eternal peace after visiting the gravesite , many pilgrims head to the old cemetery behind the mosque to honor the dead .
only very few can be buried there - it is reserved for special dignitaries .
but the spiritual atmosphere of the place puts a spell on everyone present , regardless of why they are there . irfan calisan smiles wisely .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press freedom -pipe- 24.11.2010 independent journalism in southeast europe seeks future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw and the southeast europe association hosted the two-day conference the media market in southeastern europe is one of the most dynamic in the world .
however , the independence of balkan journalism is less impressive , as a conference co-hosted by dw has shown . at the close of the " media in southeast europe " conference in bonn , one of the presenters summoned the words of bruce springsteen to characterize the media market in southeast-european countries : " 57 channels and nothing on . "
liana ganea of the romanian media watchdog active watch said that the media in southeastern europe was not only lacking in quality production but also in freedom of speech .
ganea cited the example of romanian tycoon sorin ovidiu vantu , who in 2009 ordered a journalist working for his media group , realitatea-catavencu , to " attack " certain political figures in romania .
" when i tell you to attack somebody , then you have to just attack him , " the multimillionaire commanded his reporter , who was recording the conversation and afterwards made it public .
romania joined the european union in 2007 ; however , ganea said that the situation had gotten worse ever since , mainly due to a " war " and an " earthquake . "
" the ' war ' was the political battle before the presidential election in 2009 , which unfortunately had a very negative impact on the media .
romanian news outlets were completely manipulated and polarized ; journalists were on one side or the other , and they acted like vicious fighters .
and then came the ' earthquake ' : the global economic crisis . "
' sandwiched ' journalism as a result of the desolate financial situation , several media institutions around southeast europe were forced to close departments , with even experienced journalists being laid off .
remzi lani , head of the tirana media organization in albania , told deutsche welle that journalists in his country often pandered to politicians and businessmen - and not the general public " the main problem is media ' clientelism ' - the media is sandwiched between politics and the economy .
it does n't serve the public interest , but rather that of big business and influential politicians .
and who pays the price ?
it 's the public , which is not represented and whose interests are forgotten , " lani said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zurovac is concerned about the influence of religion on reporting in bosnia in every balkan state , the media is officially free but not always independent .
in albania , lani added , corruption is an " inescapable nemesis " to the freedom of reporting .
apart from politics and business , there is a third influence that infringes on independent journalism , according to ljiliana zurovac , head of the press counsel in bosnia .
zurovac told deutsche welle that media coverage in her country was all too often swayed by religious conviction .
" unfortunately -lsb- religion -rsb- is very strong , but not because the religious centers in bosnia are too pushy .
many media organizations are very willing to cooperate ; and this is regardless of the faith , whether islamic , orthodox , or catholic .
independence or survival the diversity of the media market in southeast europe is indeed impressive ; in the capital of bulgaria , for instance , there are over 30 different radio broadcasters for fewer than 1.5 million people .
the online news offerings in bulgaria , as for the other countries in southeast europe , are too expansive for any single person to follow .
however , only very few media outlets are able to survive on their own .
without financial assistance , most private broadcasters and television stations would have already gone bankrupt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ganea said the choice was between independence and survival liana ganea , of active watch in romania , says many media organizations there are forced to choose between journalistic independence and bare survival .
" we have to scrutinize the desolate state of journalism in our country , for this may be the only way to start making changes to it .
we have to talk about the problems of the press openly .
to give our journalists confidence , we have to face the public and discuss our weaknesses .
to find solutions , we have to face the political and economic pressure , " ganea said .
a central part of the bonn conference was the debate on how journalism in southeast europe can be financed in the future while still allowing for independence from business and political interests .
the director the international federation of journalists , renate schroeder , said at the close of the two-day conference that " we all view journalism as a service for the common good , " referring to the federation 's plans to focus more on southeast europe in the future .

critics say the changes are targeted against smaller firms and could lead to mass unemployment . demonstrations by thousands on behalf of small and medium-sized businesses in ukraine brought traffic to a halt on monday , with demands for a presidential veto of a controversial tax reform bill .
traffic was blocked in the main street of the capital , kyiv , as more than 6,000 demonstrators assembled at the city 's independence square .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko vowed to push for new elections if the laws were not vetoed although a court had declared the demonstration illegal last week , protesters defied the ban with chants of " we wo n't leave , we wo n't leave . "
protests also took place in the cities of lviv and poltava , which , like the kyiv demonstration , were intended to pressure president viktor yanukovych to reject tax reform legislation .
the demonstrations began last week after parliament passed legislation for a hike in company operating fees and tough new tax accounting rules .
at the same time , some standards for larger businesses were relaxed .
the protests took place exactly six years after the orange revolution , which had brought yanukovych 's rivals to power .
the main difference was that now people from all over ukraine and belonging to various political groups gathered to voice their anger .
organizers kept the protest largely free from party politics .
former prime minister speaks out however , one of yanukovych 's political arch-rivals yulia tymoshenko , did join the protests .
tymoshenko , the country 's former prime minister , threatened to press for a referendum on early presidential and parliamentary elections if the president were to sign the new tax bill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics of the changes say they will strip firms of much-needed revenue " for a national referendum we need to collect three million signatures , " tymoshenko told the crowd .
" do you think we can do that ? "
critics say the new bill only favors big business , and that it could lead to mass unemployment , with many firms depending on tax breaks to survive .
one demonstrator told the ukrainian television station 5 kanal that he would keep demonstrating until the demands were met .
" i will stay here till the end , " he said .
" today the future of ukraine is at stake , the future of my children , my grandchildren and great-grandchildren .
it is us or them .
either we are citizens of our country , or just people that can be experimented with . "

the plans have raised the ire of workers , who went on general strike in protest . public sector workers across portugal went on strike on wednesday , disrupting transport and other services including healthcare .
the day-long strike was called by the country 's two biggest unions in protest at the government 's planned austerity measures .
three-quarters of train services and 60 percent of bus services were cancelled , while no flights took off or landed at any airport .
it was the first joint general strike held by the unions since 1988 .
together , they represent around 1.5 million workers .
the head of the main ugt union , joao proenca said , " it is the biggest strike ever staged . "
making the cuts the socialist government wants to implement the austerity program in a bid to cut a high national level of debt .
prime minister jose socrates has vowed to stick by his course of wage cuts and tax hikes , hoping to quash speculation that portugal will be the next european country to need a bailout after ireland and greece .
commenting during the strike , labor minister helena andre said without the austerity measures , " the consequences for the portuguese and the economy will be a great deal worse . "
the government 's austerity budget is due to be finally approved by parliament this week .
the measures include cutting public sector wages by five percent , freezing pensions and raising value added tax from 21 to 23 percent .
portugal has gone through many years of continuous low growth .
its unemployment rate stands at 10.9 percent - the highest since the 1980s - and it could rise further .
even though the economy has shown some growth this year , economists fear that higher taxes and wage cuts could cause a relapse into recession in 2011 as consumer spending falls .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 24.11.2010 medvedev warns of stagnation in russian politics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruling party united russia dominates the duma russian president dmitry medvedev is concerned about a lack of political competition , which he said on wednesday , could lead to stagnation .
he has pledged to take measures to improve competition . in his harshest criticism yet of former presidentvladimir putin 's ruling party united russia , president dmitry medvedev warned on wednesday that russian politics faced stagnation because of a lack of competition .
for a full 11 minutes , russian president dmitry medvedev reviewed the state of russian democracy in his video blog , and the general impression was that he was happy with what he saw .
still , he said , the lack of political competition could lead to stagnation , a term usually used to describe the rule of former soviet leader leonid brezhnev , who ruled from 1964 to 1982 .
" it is no secret that at a certain point in our political life symptoms of stagnation began to emerge , " medvedev said in the blog .
" and the danger arose that stability would turn into stagnation .
and such a stagnation is equally damaging for both the ruling party and for opposition forces . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev warned of political stagnation in russia more competition needed medvedev suggested that the current state of events , with the ruling party winning most elections with a landslide , was ultimately harmful to the country and that more competition was sorely needed .
" if the opposition does not stand the slightest chance of winning in an honest battle , it is degraded and becomes marginalized .
but if the ruling party has no chance whatsoever to lose , it simply turns into bronze and ultimately also degrades , like any living organism which does not move , " he said .
united russia , whose leader is prime minister putin , dominates the duma , russia 's lower house of parliament .
it has won virtually every election over the past 10 years , receiving close to 100 percent of the vote in some regions .
in many ways , the party looks like a modern day copy of the communist party of the soviet era .
though support has been dwindling for some time , according to opinion polls , united russia once again emerged as the clear winner in the latest regional elections in october .
but independent observers said the outcome was marred by large-scale fraud .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regional elections were not above board , say observers lip service united russia also dominates television news broadcasts , where opposition parties not represented in parliament have no access whatsoever .
medvedev hardly addressed these concerns , instead devoting most of his time to what he said the government had done to improve the level of democracy in russia , and he clearly did not question whether or not elections held in russia can be called free and fair .
the ruling party , meanwhile , was quick to embrace medvedev 's criticism .
according to one of its leaders , andrei vorobyov , united russia supports the president 's initiatives , even though , he said , it means conditions will be tougher for his party . , " but politics is a struggle , " he said , " and we , as before , are ready to fight for each vote . "
observers in moscow said medvedev 's remarks may be aimed at creating a more liberal image , ahead of presidential and parliamentary elections next year . but neither medvedev nor putin have tipped their hands about which , if any , office they intend to stand for in the 2011 polls .

the cuts are necessary to secure a multi-billion-euro international bailout . ireland has set out a four-year plan to save 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- in order to secure an international bailout expected to be in the region of 85 billion euros .
under the national recovery plan , the irish republic aims to bring its budget deficit down from a projected 32 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- to three percent of gdp by 2014 by imposing tax increases , wage cuts and by curbing public spending .
" we can and we will pull through this as we have in the past , " prime minister brian cowen told a news conference in dublin .
" we are a smart , resilient , proud people and we are going to come through this challenge because we love our country . "
finance minister brian lenihan , meanwhile , stressed the urgency of the situation .
" if we do not make these savings , we have no credible way of borrowing money to pay for our social welfare and health and education sectors from the middle of next year , " he said .
optimistic on growth the program is based on an average growth projection of 2.75 percent for the next four years , which some experts say is optimistic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen could have a tough time selling his budget to the opposition " it 's certainly challenging , given the extent of fiscal tightening , which is around 10 percent of gdp , " grant lewis , head of economic research at daiwa capital markets europe told deutsche welle .
" but i think , the eu and the imf will sign up for that , as in the last 15 years , ireland has had a good track record in terms of growth , it 's a flexible economy with a well-educated workforce and good demographics . "
measures include reducing the minimum wage by one euro , slashing public sector jobs and pay and raising the sales tax from 21 percent to 23 percent in 2014 .
under the current tax regime , 45 percent of irish workers do not pay income tax , a situation the government calls " unsustainable " .
the eu 's commissioner for economic and financial affairs , olli rehn , welcomed the program , calling it " a sound basis for the negotiations " on the international bailout .

it was a magnet for foreign investment during ireland 's boom years , but has been heavily criticized by its european neighbors .
countries like germany say it creates an unfair advantage , especially while ireland is drip-fed by eu bailout funds .
" it 's the heart of ireland 's business model and it 's attracted loads of multinationals .
germany and france as europe 's biggest economies have massive advantages compared to ireland , so its low corporation tax should n't matter so much , " lewis said .

ireland is set to take a majority stake of up to 80 percent in top lender bank of ireland that could leave the state with effective control of the country 's top three banks .
allied irish banks could join the anglo-irish bank in being fully nationalized .
lewis believes the irish government may have to do more further down the line .
" the banking sector is the great unknown , it has broken ireland 's back , we 'll have to see how the measures for the banking sector pan out , " lewis told deutsche welle .

the plans have raised the ire of workers , who went on general strike in protest . public sector workers across portugal went on strike on wednesday , disrupting transport and other services including healthcare .
the day-long strike was called by the country 's two biggest unions in protest at the government 's planned austerity measures .
three-quarters of train services and 60 percent of bus services were cancelled , while no flights took off or landed at any airport .
it was the first joint general strike held by the unions since 1988 .
together , they represent around 1.5 million workers .
the head of the main ugt union , joao proenca said , " it is the biggest strike ever staged . "
making the cuts the socialist government wants to implement the austerity program in a bid to cut a high national level of debt .
prime minister jose socrates has vowed to stick by his course of wage cuts and tax hikes , hoping to quash speculation that portugal will be the next european country to need a bailout after ireland and greece .
commenting during the strike , labor minister helena andre said without the austerity measures , " the consequences for the portuguese and the economy will be a great deal worse . "
the government 's austerity budget is due to be finally approved by parliament this week .
the measures include cutting public sector wages by five percent , freezing pensions and raising value added tax from 21 to 23 percent .
portugal has gone through many years of continuous low growth .
its unemployment rate stands at 10.9 percent - the highest since the 1980s - and it could rise further .
even though the economy has shown some growth this year , economists fear that higher taxes and wage cuts could cause a relapse into recession in 2011 as consumer spending falls .

he has pledged to take measures to improve competition . in his harshest criticism yet of former presidentvladimir putin 's ruling party united russia , president dmitry medvedev warned on wednesday that russian politics faced stagnation because of a lack of competition .
for a full 11 minutes , russian president dmitry medvedev reviewed the state of russian democracy in his video blog , and the general impression was that he was happy with what he saw .
still , he said , the lack of political competition could lead to stagnation , a term usually used to describe the rule of former soviet leader leonid brezhnev , who ruled from 1964 to 1982 .
" it is no secret that at a certain point in our political life symptoms of stagnation began to emerge , " medvedev said in the blog .
" and the danger arose that stability would turn into stagnation .
and such a stagnation is equally damaging for both the ruling party and for opposition forces . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev warned of political stagnation in russia more competition needed medvedev suggested that the current state of events , with the ruling party winning most elections with a landslide , was ultimately harmful to the country and that more competition was sorely needed .
" if the opposition does not stand the slightest chance of winning in an honest battle , it is degraded and becomes marginalized .
but if the ruling party has no chance whatsoever to lose , it simply turns into bronze and ultimately also degrades , like any living organism which does not move , " he said .
united russia , whose leader is prime minister putin , dominates the duma , russia 's lower house of parliament .
it has won virtually every election over the past 10 years , receiving close to 100 percent of the vote in some regions .
in many ways , the party looks like a modern day copy of the communist party of the soviet era .
though support has been dwindling for some time , according to opinion polls , united russia once again emerged as the clear winner in the latest regional elections in october .
but independent observers said the outcome was marred by large-scale fraud .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regional elections were not above board , say observers lip service united russia also dominates television news broadcasts , where opposition parties not represented in parliament have no access whatsoever .
medvedev hardly addressed these concerns , instead devoting most of his time to what he said the government had done to improve the level of democracy in russia , and he clearly did not question whether or not elections held in russia can be called free and fair .
the ruling party , meanwhile , was quick to embrace medvedev 's criticism .
according to one of its leaders , andrei vorobyov , united russia supports the president 's initiatives , even though , he said , it means conditions will be tougher for his party . , " but politics is a struggle , " he said , " and we , as before , are ready to fight for each vote . "
observers in moscow said medvedev 's remarks may be aimed at creating a more liberal image , ahead of presidential and parliamentary elections next year . but neither medvedev nor putin have tipped their hands about which , if any , office they intend to stand for in the 2011 polls .

the plans have raised the ire of workers , who went on general strike in protest . public sector workers across portugal went on strike on wednesday , disrupting transport and other services including healthcare .
the day-long strike was called by the country 's two biggest unions in protest at the government 's planned austerity measures .
three-quarters of train services and 60 percent of bus services were cancelled , while no flights took off or landed at any airport .
it was the first joint general strike held by the unions since 1988 .
together , they represent around 1.5 million workers .
the head of the main ugt union , joao proenca said , " it is the biggest strike ever staged . "
making the cuts the socialist government wants to implement the austerity program in a bid to cut a high national level of debt .
prime minister jose socrates has vowed to stick by his course of wage cuts and tax hikes , hoping to quash speculation that portugal will be the next european country to need a bailout after ireland and greece .
commenting during the strike , labor minister helena andre said without the austerity measures , " the consequences for the portuguese and the economy will be a great deal worse . "
the government 's austerity budget is due to be finally approved by parliament this week .
the measures include cutting public sector wages by five percent , freezing pensions and raising value added tax from 21 to 23 percent .
portugal has gone through many years of continuous low growth .
its unemployment rate stands at 10.9 percent - the highest since the 1980s - and it could rise further .
even though the economy has shown some growth this year , economists fear that higher taxes and wage cuts could cause a relapse into recession in 2011 as consumer spending falls .

now some analysts are grumbling that the euro may be on its way out too . this irish rescue package agreed this week – along with the greek bailout earlier in the year - has found the eurozone countries hopelessly divided over the question of how to save the common currency in the long term .
they have good reason to be concerned : the bond markets are n't showing a healthy interest in portugal , another likely bailout candidate .
nor are they particularly impressed with spain , an even bigger economy with a similarly troubling debt load , a high unemployment rate and a stagnating economy .
should these countries also seek relief , the future of the euro could be on the line .
worried in berlin the alarm bells are ringing in berlin .
the german government could end up paying 17 billion euros or more of the expected 90-billion-euro irish rescue package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble is worried about the euro on tuesday , german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble warned lawmakers that the irish debt crisis posed a huge risk .
he said the race to shore up ireland 's banking sector and public finances " puts our common currency at stake . "
the excessive debt levels in greece and now ireland , the minister added , only reinforce germany 's strategy of trimming its budget during a nascent recovery .
but berlin 's austerity strategy has drawn criticism from major partners , including the united states .
so has chancellor angela merkel 's suggestion that , in future euro crises , private bondholders should bear more of the losses .
merkel 's proposal is motivated , in part , by pressure from germany 's constitutional court , which could still declare the government 's participation in european bailouts illegal .
in addition to being promised that the euro would be as stable as the deutschmark , germans were told prior to the deutschmark-euro conversion that there would be a " no bailout clause " that would prevent europe 's richer countries from having to rescue the indigent .
irreconcilable camps with every new day of uncertainty , fears are mounting that the ongoing crisis in europe could lead to the default of individual countries and ultimately the collapse of the eurozone .
a deep divide now runs through the two almost irreconcilable camps : the one led by germany and supported by mainly northern european countries defending a culture of economic and monetary stability ; and the other consisting mostly of southern european countries referred to as piigs – portugal , italy , ireland , greece and spain .
european policymakers are now trying to achieve a consensus between the two camps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the euro still be around in a decade ?
" the europeans have a difficult task , " said friedrich heinemann , a director at the centre for european economic research in mannheim , germany .
" on the one side , they must avoid panics and irrational attacks on solvent governments .
on the other side , they must refrain from establishing a guarantee mechanism , which would smash consolidation incentives . " germany is " aware of both dangers , " heinemann told deutsche welle , and has taken what he calls " a highly responsible position . "
the government , he said , consented to the 750-billion-euro european financial stability facility but insisted on a crisis resolution mechanism that would include creditors in a solution for insolvent countries .
" the latter position may not be popular among highly indebted countries but it is important for the fiscal and political future of europe , " heinemann said .
" euro member countries must remain responsible for their own public finances . "
other analysts agree .
" i think germany is right in wanting to avoid a transfer union , " said marco annunziata , chief economist at unicredit group . there are two possible ways of avoiding this , according to annunziata .
the first , he said , would be to have a true centralization of european fiscal policy – something that would require a greater degree of political union than seems feasible at this stage . the second is to have a framework for sovereign debt restructuring - a credible signal to investors that the next time a eurozone country has difficulties servicing its debt , it will be helped only if at the same time private investors suffer haircuts .
this would make private investors more careful when assessing sovereign risk , and would therefore impose stricter discipline on countries by driving debt spreads wider at the first signs of fiscal indiscipline . " these issues need to be resolved soon , however , " annunziata told deutsche welle .
" otherwise , the risk is that popular support for the eurozone might disintegrate very quickly . " " a more german eurozone " some experts question , though , how big a role germany , europe 's largest economy , should play in stabilizing the eurozone .
turning the eurozone into a larger germany , says philip whyte with the centre for european reform in london , could have adverse consequences - not only for the country itself but also for europe and even the rest of the world .
he maintains that " a more german eurozone " would be afflicted by chronically weak demand , debilitating cycles of competitive wage cuts and prolonged economic slumps in the deficit countries .
like many others , whyte agrees the time has come to make some tough decisions .
" the genius of the european union has been to muddle its way through , " he said .
" i do n't think that muddling is an option this time . "
so should investors unload their euros while they are still worth something ?
expert heinemann is confident the common currency will survive .
" i do n't see the euro breaking apart , " he said .
" or does anybody see the us currency union breaking apart because of the imminent californian bankruptcy ?

but in the eyup district , a holy site for muslims , life is veiled in centuries of tradition . it is afternoon in eyup .
the call of the muezzin rings out over the square in front of the mosque .
women in colorful headscarves lead their children by the hand as men with prayer beads amble towards the entrance to the mosque . pairs of newlyweds pose for photos in front of the fountain ; the brides ' wedding dresses shimmering in the sunlight .
a young groom exclaims , " we are here to pray to allah for a good marriage ! "
his mother says softly , " god willing , they will always be a happy couple . " a few meters away , a couple proudly presents their five-year-old son .
the boy looks like a little sultan .
he is wearing a shiny white suit with gold edging and a turban-like headpiece .
in a few days he will participate in the " sunnet " - the turkish circumcision ceremony . before this important event , the boy 's parents take him to the eyup sultan mosque .
" you pray before circumcision - that 's the practice laid down by our prophet , " explains the boy 's father . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eyup is a popular place for wedding ceremonies pilgrims and tourists according to theologian and eyup 's cultural affairs coordinator irfan calisan , the district gets many regular visitors .
each year , eyup is visited by up to four million people - one and a half million in the fasting month of ramadan alone .
" on days of particular religious significance , like the festival of sacrifice , we sometimes have 100,000 visitors per day , " said calisan . muslims flock to eyup not only for special occasions or religious events .
there is also an old tradition , dating back over 500 years , of visiting the gravesite of abu ayyub al-ansari - the companion and standard-bearer of the prophet mohammed , believed to have died there in the seventh century .
the gravesite , located in the mosque 's inner courtyard , dates back to the 15th century .
the eyup district owes its name to this famous religious figure . " many mecca pilgrims make a stopover here , " said calisan .
" we call this tradition from the ottoman times ' little hajj . " ' hopes and prayers traditionally , the abu ayyub al-ansari gravesite is also visited by unmarried and childless women , who come to pray for a husband and offspring , as well as by students and the sick , who pray for good exam results and health . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sarcophagus of abu ayyub al-ansari is an important holy site those who come here have the chance to take advantage of the so-called " wishing window " at the entrance to the abu ayyub al-ansari mausoleum .
they can stand in front of it and pray in the hope of having their wish granted . the graveside is decorated with precious carpets and tiles .
the sarcophagus of abu ayyub al-ansari is in a separate room , behind a silver lattice door .
only the hafiz , the koran reciter , is allowed to enter it .
the mufti of eyup , isa gurler , gave deutsche welle the chance to look inside . " as the prophet left mecca and went to medina , he spent seven months in abu ayyub al-ansari 's house , " explained gurler .
" after the prophet 's death , ansari became a leading islamic scholar .
he told the muslims about the deeds and statements of the prophet . " eternal peace after visiting the gravesite , many pilgrims head to the old cemetery behind the mosque to honor the dead .
only very few can be buried there - it is reserved for special dignitaries .
but the spiritual atmosphere of the place puts a spell on everyone present , regardless of why they are there . irfan calisan smiles wisely .

existing projects studying solar activity and cosmic radiation will still provide data . in a statement posted to its website on monday , the european space agency has decided to extend 11 space-based scientific missions for four more years .
in 2008 , the esa decided that as a cost-cutting measure , scientific missions would be re-evaluated every two years .
the missions will subject to confirmation in late 2012 as part of the regular two-year cycle .
some of the esa 's current missions include the solar and heliospheric observatory -lrb- soho -rrb- , which is a collaborative effort between the european agency and its american counterpart , nasa , to study the sun in detail .
the soho spacecraft is now ensured to be operational so that it can observe the sun during its next solar maximum in 2013 , when it reaches the highest point in its cyclical magnetic activity .
' a good day for space science ' another is the planck satellite , which in 2009 began studying cosmic microwave background radiation left over from the big bang approximately 14 billion years ago .
" it is not an easy time to make such commitments but we should not doubt the wisdom of the -lsb- science programme committee -rsb- in squeezing even more return from the big investments of the past , " said david southwood , esa 's director of science and robotic exploration , in the statement .
" the highest quality science will continue to flow from this armada of spacecraft .
it is a good day for european space science .
europe will continue to play an important part in unlocking the mysteries of our universe . "

existing projects studying solar activity and cosmic radiation will still provide data . in a statement posted to its website on monday , the european space agency has decided to extend 11 space-based scientific missions for four more years .
in 2008 , the esa decided that as a cost-cutting measure , scientific missions would be re-evaluated every two years .
the missions will subject to confirmation in late 2012 as part of the regular two-year cycle .
some of the esa 's current missions include the solar and heliospheric observatory -lrb- soho -rrb- , which is a collaborative effort between the european agency and its american counterpart , nasa , to study the sun in detail .
the soho spacecraft is now ensured to be operational so that it can observe the sun during its next solar maximum in 2013 , when it reaches the highest point in its cyclical magnetic activity .
' a good day for space science ' another is the planck satellite , which in 2009 began studying cosmic microwave background radiation left over from the big bang approximately 14 billion years ago .
" it is not an easy time to make such commitments but we should not doubt the wisdom of the -lsb- science programme committee -rsb- in squeezing even more return from the big investments of the past , " said david southwood , esa 's director of science and robotic exploration , in the statement .
" the highest quality science will continue to flow from this armada of spacecraft .
it is a good day for european space science .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de investment -pipe- 24.11.2010 niche company aims to become natural resource heavyweight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche rohstoff reactivates abandoned projects the natural resources sector is dominated by global corporations such as bhp billiton , rio tinto and exxon mobil .
now a young german firm aims to join the major league of mining by reactivating abandoned deposits . situated in an office above a music school in heidelberg 's historic city center , the 15 employees of deutsche rohstoff are trying to profit from the rising prices of natural resources .
the company specializes in reactivating defunct sources of oil , gas , gold , silver , high-tech metals like indium or gallium , and rare earth elements .
an exception in a market dominated by large multinational players , deutsche rohstoff has been spending money with essentially no earnings since it was founded in 2006 .
but it has investors ' attention .
a recent sale of 320,000 new shares netted four million euros , with industry giants like the basf chemicals company buying stakes in the business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : titus gebel says there will always be projects larger companies miss " in the long term we want to fill the gap left behind by -lrb- former german mining companies -rrb- preussag and metallgesellschaft , " deutsche rohstoff executive titus gebel told deutsche welle .
" they were globally situated natural resource companies which could hold their own in the first division – or at least in the second division – during the 1980s . "
opportunity from rising prices there was a time when industrialized western countries had significantly more capacity to process their natural resources .
in the 1960s , for instance , germany was europe 's largest producer of oil .
as procurement from africa and asia became cheaper , oil prices dropped and domestic facilities were closed .
gebel , however , believes the rising cost of natural resources will make europe 's own deposits profitable again .
his company is betting on increased demand , which he 's sure is more than a temporary trend .
" because of the economic developments in china and india , the natural resources sector is experiencing what 's called a super-cycle – there will be a boom in the next 20 years . "
europe 's political stability is another factor to be taken into account .
many of the countries which have supplied the global economy with relatively inexpensive natural resources over recent years are politically volatile .
and those that are stable will increasingly choose to keep their resources for domestic production .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as resource prices rise , europe 's political stability will be a valuable asset china , for example , used 8 percent of the world 's demand for metal 16 years ago .
today it uses up to 25 percent .
" representatives from our industry are unified in their opinion , " gebel said .
" if growth in china and also india and brazil continues the way it has been so far , then in the next 25 years we will need to mine as much metal as we have in the combined history of mankind . "
spending without profits investors seem convinced by deutsche rohstoff 's logic .
the company went public in 2010 , and its stock price has risen by 35 percent .
but where are the profits ?
thus far deutsche rohstoff has primarily been investing in identifying investment opportunities and securing the rights to natural resource deposits .
in october it started production at the georgetown gold mine in australia , which is owned by a subsidiary company .
the first batch of gold bars are due to be processed by december and should see the project turn a profit by the end of this year or the next .
rhein petroleum – another affiliated company with oil and gas projects throughout germany – is also expected to generate its first revenues in 2011 , or 2012 at the latest .
when deutsche rohstoff picks a project , it is careful to make sure that production can be started as quickly as possible , according to gebel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche rohstoff picks projects which can be reactivated quickly " we look at deposits which were prospected in the past and calculate out whether modern technology and higher prices make it worthwhile , " he said .
" that way we can drastically shorten the time which customarily exists in mining between prospecting a deposit and beginning production . "
not afraid of big competition the basic idea behind deutsche rohstoff is n't just convincing to individual investors , it seems .
exxon mobile is on board along with glencore , the world 's largest supplier of raw materials , and wintershall , germany 's largest oil and gas trader .
gebel insists he is n't concerned about being squeezed out by from industry giants .
even with their combined forces , there will always be locations licensed for prospecting that major corporations wo n't get around to , he says .
so now small companies are cropping up around the world with plans to mull through archives in search of viable projects which are too small for their enormous counterparts .
one advantage deutsche rohstoff has is good industry contacts and the historic division of germany into a capitalist and communist states .
" it 's very interesting to note that in the area which used to be the former gdr -lrb- german democratic republic -rrb- , the countryside is perforated from where the gdr was searching for uranium and other natural resources , " he said .
" and we can draw on that information today . "
" we 've had access to gdr data .
we knew it existed – but that was n't common knowledge internationally . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de ukraine -pipe- 24.11.2010 ukraine demonstrators push for presidential veto on tax rules großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests against the stricter tax rules began last week ukraine 's capital kiev has been the scene of mass demonstrations calling for the president not to sanction a new tax code .
critics say the changes are targeted against smaller firms and could lead to mass unemployment . demonstrations by thousands on behalf of small and medium-sized businesses in ukraine brought traffic to a halt on monday , with demands for a presidential veto of a controversial tax reform bill .
traffic was blocked in the main street of the capital , kyiv , as more than 6,000 demonstrators assembled at the city 's independence square .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko vowed to push for new elections if the laws were not vetoed although a court had declared the demonstration illegal last week , protesters defied the ban with chants of " we wo n't leave , we wo n't leave . "
protests also took place in the cities of lviv and poltava , which , like the kyiv demonstration , were intended to pressure president viktor yanukovych to reject tax reform legislation .
the demonstrations began last week after parliament passed legislation for a hike in company operating fees and tough new tax accounting rules .
at the same time , some standards for larger businesses were relaxed .
the protests took place exactly six years after the orange revolution , which had brought yanukovych 's rivals to power .
the main difference was that now people from all over ukraine and belonging to various political groups gathered to voice their anger .
organizers kept the protest largely free from party politics .
former prime minister speaks out however , one of yanukovych 's political arch-rivals yulia tymoshenko , did join the protests .
tymoshenko , the country 's former prime minister , threatened to press for a referendum on early presidential and parliamentary elections if the president were to sign the new tax bill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics of the changes say they will strip firms of much-needed revenue " for a national referendum we need to collect three million signatures , " tymoshenko told the crowd .
" do you think we can do that ? "
critics say the new bill only favors big business , and that it could lead to mass unemployment , with many firms depending on tax breaks to survive .
one demonstrator told the ukrainian television station 5 kanal that he would keep demonstrating until the demands were met .
" i will stay here till the end , " he said .
" today the future of ukraine is at stake , the future of my children , my grandchildren and great-grandchildren .
it is us or them .
either we are citizens of our country , or just people that can be experimented with . "
softly , softly approach the authorities have reacted cautiously to the protests and an attempt on tuesday to dismantle the tent camp in the center of kyiv failed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovych has said he is willing to make compromises president yanukovich said he was prepared to listen to the demands , but added that the need to remove tax evasion loopholes in the law meant they could not be met fully .
" i understand their demands very well , " yanukovich was reported to have said on monday .
" they will not be satisfied 100 percent . "
ukrainian prime minister mykola azarov has defended the tax code , claiming that it is the most liberal in europe .

critics say the changes are targeted against smaller firms and could lead to mass unemployment . demonstrations by thousands on behalf of small and medium-sized businesses in ukraine brought traffic to a halt on monday , with demands for a presidential veto of a controversial tax reform bill .
traffic was blocked in the main street of the capital , kyiv , as more than 6,000 demonstrators assembled at the city 's independence square .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko vowed to push for new elections if the laws were not vetoed although a court had declared the demonstration illegal last week , protesters defied the ban with chants of " we wo n't leave , we wo n't leave . "
protests also took place in the cities of lviv and poltava , which , like the kyiv demonstration , were intended to pressure president viktor yanukovych to reject tax reform legislation .
the demonstrations began last week after parliament passed legislation for a hike in company operating fees and tough new tax accounting rules .
at the same time , some standards for larger businesses were relaxed .
the protests took place exactly six years after the orange revolution , which had brought yanukovych 's rivals to power .
the main difference was that now people from all over ukraine and belonging to various political groups gathered to voice their anger .
organizers kept the protest largely free from party politics .
former prime minister speaks out however , one of yanukovych 's political arch-rivals yulia tymoshenko , did join the protests .
tymoshenko , the country 's former prime minister , threatened to press for a referendum on early presidential and parliamentary elections if the president were to sign the new tax bill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics of the changes say they will strip firms of much-needed revenue " for a national referendum we need to collect three million signatures , " tymoshenko told the crowd .
" do you think we can do that ? "
critics say the new bill only favors big business , and that it could lead to mass unemployment , with many firms depending on tax breaks to survive .
one demonstrator told the ukrainian television station 5 kanal that he would keep demonstrating until the demands were met .
" i will stay here till the end , " he said .
" today the future of ukraine is at stake , the future of my children , my grandchildren and great-grandchildren .
it is us or them .
either we are citizens of our country , or just people that can be experimented with . "
softly , softly approach the authorities have reacted cautiously to the protests and an attempt on tuesday to dismantle the tent camp in the center of kyiv failed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovych has said he is willing to make compromises president yanukovich said he was prepared to listen to the demands , but added that the need to remove tax evasion loopholes in the law meant they could not be met fully .
" i understand their demands very well , " yanukovich was reported to have said on monday .
" they will not be satisfied 100 percent . "
ukrainian prime minister mykola azarov has defended the tax code , claiming that it is the most liberal in europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press freedom -pipe- 24.11.2010 independent journalism in southeast europe seeks future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw and the southeast europe association hosted the two-day conference the media market in southeastern europe is one of the most dynamic in the world .
however , the independence of balkan journalism is less impressive , as a conference co-hosted by dw has shown . at the close of the " media in southeast europe " conference in bonn , one of the presenters summoned the words of bruce springsteen to characterize the media market in southeast-european countries : " 57 channels and nothing on . "
liana ganea of the romanian media watchdog active watch said that the media in southeastern europe was not only lacking in quality production but also in freedom of speech .
ganea cited the example of romanian tycoon sorin ovidiu vantu , who in 2009 ordered a journalist working for his media group , realitatea-catavencu , to " attack " certain political figures in romania .
" when i tell you to attack somebody , then you have to just attack him , " the multimillionaire commanded his reporter , who was recording the conversation and afterwards made it public .
romania joined the european union in 2007 ; however , ganea said that the situation had gotten worse ever since , mainly due to a " war " and an " earthquake . "
" the ' war ' was the political battle before the presidential election in 2009 , which unfortunately had a very negative impact on the media .
romanian news outlets were completely manipulated and polarized ; journalists were on one side or the other , and they acted like vicious fighters .
and then came the ' earthquake ' : the global economic crisis . "
' sandwiched ' journalism as a result of the desolate financial situation , several media institutions around southeast europe were forced to close departments , with even experienced journalists being laid off .
remzi lani , head of the tirana media organization in albania , told deutsche welle that journalists in his country often pandered to politicians and businessmen - and not the general public " the main problem is media ' clientelism ' - the media is sandwiched between politics and the economy .
it does n't serve the public interest , but rather that of big business and influential politicians .
and who pays the price ?
it 's the public , which is not represented and whose interests are forgotten , " lani said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zurovac is concerned about the influence of religion on reporting in bosnia in every balkan state , the media is officially free but not always independent .
in albania , lani added , corruption is an " inescapable nemesis " to the freedom of reporting .
apart from politics and business , there is a third influence that infringes on independent journalism , according to ljiliana zurovac , head of the press counsel in bosnia .
zurovac told deutsche welle that media coverage in her country was all too often swayed by religious conviction .
" unfortunately -lsb- religion -rsb- is very strong , but not because the religious centers in bosnia are too pushy .
many media organizations are very willing to cooperate ; and this is regardless of the faith , whether islamic , orthodox , or catholic .
independence or survival the diversity of the media market in southeast europe is indeed impressive ; in the capital of bulgaria , for instance , there are over 30 different radio broadcasters for fewer than 1.5 million people .
the online news offerings in bulgaria , as for the other countries in southeast europe , are too expansive for any single person to follow .
however , only very few media outlets are able to survive on their own .
without financial assistance , most private broadcasters and television stations would have already gone bankrupt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ganea said the choice was between independence and survival liana ganea , of active watch in romania , says many media organizations there are forced to choose between journalistic independence and bare survival .
" we have to scrutinize the desolate state of journalism in our country , for this may be the only way to start making changes to it .
we have to talk about the problems of the press openly .
to give our journalists confidence , we have to face the public and discuss our weaknesses .
to find solutions , we have to face the political and economic pressure , " ganea said .
a central part of the bonn conference was the debate on how journalism in southeast europe can be financed in the future while still allowing for independence from business and political interests .
the director the international federation of journalists , renate schroeder , said at the close of the two-day conference that " we all view journalism as a service for the common good , " referring to the federation 's plans to focus more on southeast europe in the future .

now some analysts are grumbling that the euro may be on its way out too . this irish rescue package agreed this week – along with the greek bailout earlier in the year - has found the eurozone countries hopelessly divided over the question of how to save the common currency in the long term .
they have good reason to be concerned : the bond markets are n't showing a healthy interest in portugal , another likely bailout candidate .
nor are they particularly impressed with spain , an even bigger economy with a similarly troubling debt load , a high unemployment rate and a stagnating economy .
should these countries also seek relief , the future of the euro could be on the line .
worried in berlin the alarm bells are ringing in berlin .
the german government could end up paying 17 billion euros or more of the expected 90-billion-euro irish rescue package .

he said the race to shore up ireland 's banking sector and public finances " puts our common currency at stake . "
the excessive debt levels in greece and now ireland , the minister added , only reinforce germany 's strategy of trimming its budget during a nascent recovery .
but berlin 's austerity strategy has drawn criticism from major partners , including the united states .
so has chancellor angela merkel 's suggestion that , in future euro crises , private bondholders should bear more of the losses .
merkel 's proposal is motivated , in part , by pressure from germany 's constitutional court , which could still declare the government 's participation in european bailouts illegal .
in addition to being promised that the euro would be as stable as the deutschmark , germans were told prior to the deutschmark-euro conversion that there would be a " no bailout clause " that would prevent europe 's richer countries from having to rescue the indigent .
irreconcilable camps with every new day of uncertainty , fears are mounting that the ongoing crisis in europe could lead to the default of individual countries and ultimately the collapse of the eurozone .
a deep divide now runs through the two almost irreconcilable camps : the one led by germany and supported by mainly northern european countries defending a culture of economic and monetary stability ; and the other consisting mostly of southern european countries referred to as piigs – portugal , italy , ireland , greece and spain .
european policymakers are now trying to achieve a consensus between the two camps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the euro still be around in a decade ?
" the europeans have a difficult task , " said friedrich heinemann , a director at the centre for european economic research in mannheim , germany .
" on the one side , they must avoid panics and irrational attacks on solvent governments .
on the other side , they must refrain from establishing a guarantee mechanism , which would smash consolidation incentives . " germany is " aware of both dangers , " heinemann told deutsche welle , and has taken what he calls " a highly responsible position . "
the government , he said , consented to the 750-billion-euro european financial stability facility but insisted on a crisis resolution mechanism that would include creditors in a solution for insolvent countries .
" the latter position may not be popular among highly indebted countries but it is important for the fiscal and political future of europe , " heinemann said .
" euro member countries must remain responsible for their own public finances . "
other analysts agree .
" i think germany is right in wanting to avoid a transfer union , " said marco annunziata , chief economist at unicredit group . there are two possible ways of avoiding this , according to annunziata .
the first , he said , would be to have a true centralization of european fiscal policy – something that would require a greater degree of political union than seems feasible at this stage . the second is to have a framework for sovereign debt restructuring - a credible signal to investors that the next time a eurozone country has difficulties servicing its debt , it will be helped only if at the same time private investors suffer haircuts .
this would make private investors more careful when assessing sovereign risk , and would therefore impose stricter discipline on countries by driving debt spreads wider at the first signs of fiscal indiscipline . " these issues need to be resolved soon , however , " annunziata told deutsche welle .
" otherwise , the risk is that popular support for the eurozone might disintegrate very quickly . " " a more german eurozone " some experts question , though , how big a role germany , europe 's largest economy , should play in stabilizing the eurozone .
turning the eurozone into a larger germany , says philip whyte with the centre for european reform in london , could have adverse consequences - not only for the country itself but also for europe and even the rest of the world .
he maintains that " a more german eurozone " would be afflicted by chronically weak demand , debilitating cycles of competitive wage cuts and prolonged economic slumps in the deficit countries .
like many others , whyte agrees the time has come to make some tough decisions .
" the genius of the european union has been to muddle its way through , " he said .
" i do n't think that muddling is an option this time . "
so should investors unload their euros while they are still worth something ?
expert heinemann is confident the common currency will survive .
" i do n't see the euro breaking apart , " he said .
" or does anybody see the us currency union breaking apart because of the imminent californian bankruptcy ?

existing projects studying solar activity and cosmic radiation will still provide data . in a statement posted to its website on monday , the european space agency has decided to extend 11 space-based scientific missions for four more years .
in 2008 , the esa decided that as a cost-cutting measure , scientific missions would be re-evaluated every two years .
the missions will subject to confirmation in late 2012 as part of the regular two-year cycle .
some of the esa 's current missions include the solar and heliospheric observatory -lrb- soho -rrb- , which is a collaborative effort between the european agency and its american counterpart , nasa , to study the sun in detail .
the soho spacecraft is now ensured to be operational so that it can observe the sun during its next solar maximum in 2013 , when it reaches the highest point in its cyclical magnetic activity .
' a good day for space science ' another is the planck satellite , which in 2009 began studying cosmic microwave background radiation left over from the big bang approximately 14 billion years ago .
" it is not an easy time to make such commitments but we should not doubt the wisdom of the -lsb- science programme committee -rsb- in squeezing even more return from the big investments of the past , " said david southwood , esa 's director of science and robotic exploration , in the statement .
" the highest quality science will continue to flow from this armada of spacecraft .
it is a good day for european space science .
europe will continue to play an important part in unlocking the mysteries of our universe . "

a spokesman for the eu 's economic and monetary affairs commissioner , olli rehn , insisted that the euro was a " stable " currency and that its continued existence was not threatened by eurozone debt or banking crises .
he was reacting to a statement by angela merkel , in which the german chancellor said europe was in an " extraordinarily serious situation . "
merkel said germany 's support for ireland was conditional on ireland " making clear what steps -lrb- it -rrb- must take to get back on a path of stabilization . "
merkel added that europe should have the " courage " to set limits on markets by ensuring that private investors bear some of the risk of future eurozone bailouts .

with its banking system in crisis and its budget deficit forecast to be 10 times the eu limit of three percent of gdp this year , ireland on sunday became the second eurozone member in six months to apply for a bailout after greece .
during wednesday 's parliamentary debate merkel argued in favor of involving private investors to bear some of the risk on government bonds .

the cuts are necessary to secure a multi-billion-euro international bailout . ireland has set out a four-year plan to save 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- in order to secure an international bailout expected to be in the region of 85 billion euros .
under the national recovery plan , the irish republic aims to bring its budget deficit down from a projected 32 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- to three percent of gdp by 2014 by imposing tax increases , wage cuts and by curbing public spending .
" we can and we will pull through this as we have in the past , " prime minister brian cowen told a news conference in dublin .
" we are a smart , resilient , proud people and we are going to come through this challenge because we love our country . "
finance minister brian lenihan , meanwhile , stressed the urgency of the situation .
" if we do not make these savings , we have no credible way of borrowing money to pay for our social welfare and health and education sectors from the middle of next year , " he said .
optimistic on growth the program is based on an average growth projection of 2.75 percent for the next four years , which some experts say is optimistic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen could have a tough time selling his budget to the opposition " it 's certainly challenging , given the extent of fiscal tightening , which is around 10 percent of gdp , " grant lewis , head of economic research at daiwa capital markets europe told deutsche welle .
" but i think , the eu and the imf will sign up for that , as in the last 15 years , ireland has had a good track record in terms of growth , it 's a flexible economy with a well-educated workforce and good demographics . "
measures include reducing the minimum wage by one euro , slashing public sector jobs and pay and raising the sales tax from 21 percent to 23 percent in 2014 .
under the current tax regime , 45 percent of irish workers do not pay income tax , a situation the government calls " unsustainable " .
the eu 's commissioner for economic and financial affairs , olli rehn , welcomed the program , calling it " a sound basis for the negotiations " on the international bailout .
corporation tax non-negotiable one tax that will not be raised is ireland 's corporation tax - at 12.5 percent the lowest in the european union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banking sector is at the heart of the debt crisis .
" the government remains committed to the 12.5 percent corporation tax rate : it will not be increased under any circumstances , " was the clear message in wednesday 's statement .
it was a magnet for foreign investment during ireland 's boom years , but has been heavily criticized by its european neighbors .
countries like germany say it creates an unfair advantage , especially while ireland is drip-fed by eu bailout funds .
" it 's the heart of ireland 's business model and it 's attracted loads of multinationals .
germany and france as europe 's biggest economies have massive advantages compared to ireland , so its low corporation tax should n't matter so much , " lewis said .
banking sector recovery crucial years of economic growth in ireland , fueled by a property boom and reckless lending practices , turned to bust when the housing market collapsed , exacerbated by the global financial crisis .
ireland is set to take a majority stake of up to 80 percent in top lender bank of ireland that could leave the state with effective control of the country 's top three banks .
allied irish banks could join the anglo-irish bank in being fully nationalized .
lewis believes the irish government may have to do more further down the line .
" the banking sector is the great unknown , it has broken ireland 's back , we 'll have to see how the measures for the banking sector pan out , " lewis told deutsche welle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 24.11.2010 ireland announces sweeping austerity measures to secure bailout großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are fears that the irish crisis could endanger the euro the irish government has given details of its most stringent austerity plan ever , aimed at saving 15 billion euros over the next four years .
the cuts are necessary to secure a multi-billion-euro international bailout . ireland has set out a four-year plan to save 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- in order to secure an international bailout expected to be in the region of 85 billion euros .
under the national recovery plan , the irish republic aims to bring its budget deficit down from a projected 32 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- to three percent of gdp by 2014 by imposing tax increases , wage cuts and by curbing public spending .
" we can and we will pull through this as we have in the past , " prime minister brian cowen told a news conference in dublin .
" we are a smart , resilient , proud people and we are going to come through this challenge because we love our country . "
finance minister brian lenihan , meanwhile , stressed the urgency of the situation .
" if we do not make these savings , we have no credible way of borrowing money to pay for our social welfare and health and education sectors from the middle of next year , " he said .
optimistic on growth the program is based on an average growth projection of 2.75 percent for the next four years , which some experts say is optimistic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen could have a tough time selling his budget to the opposition " it 's certainly challenging , given the extent of fiscal tightening , which is around 10 percent of gdp , " grant lewis , head of economic research at daiwa capital markets europe told deutsche welle .
" but i think , the eu and the imf will sign up for that , as in the last 15 years , ireland has had a good track record in terms of growth , it 's a flexible economy with a well-educated workforce and good demographics . "
measures include reducing the minimum wage by one euro , slashing public sector jobs and pay and raising the sales tax from 21 percent to 23 percent in 2014 .
under the current tax regime , 45 percent of irish workers do not pay income tax , a situation the government calls " unsustainable " .
the eu 's commissioner for economic and financial affairs , olli rehn , welcomed the program , calling it " a sound basis for the negotiations " on the international bailout .
corporation tax non-negotiable one tax that will not be raised is ireland 's corporation tax - at 12.5 percent the lowest in the european union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banking sector is at the heart of the debt crisis .
" the government remains committed to the 12.5 percent corporation tax rate : it will not be increased under any circumstances , " was the clear message in wednesday 's statement .
it was a magnet for foreign investment during ireland 's boom years , but has been heavily criticized by its european neighbors .
countries like germany say it creates an unfair advantage , especially while ireland is drip-fed by eu bailout funds .
" it 's the heart of ireland 's business model and it 's attracted loads of multinationals .
germany and france as europe 's biggest economies have massive advantages compared to ireland , so its low corporation tax should n't matter so much , " lewis said .
banking sector recovery crucial years of economic growth in ireland , fueled by a property boom and reckless lending practices , turned to bust when the housing market collapsed , exacerbated by the global financial crisis .
ireland is set to take a majority stake of up to 80 percent in top lender bank of ireland that could leave the state with effective control of the country 's top three banks .
allied irish banks could join the anglo-irish bank in being fully nationalized .
lewis believes the irish government may have to do more further down the line .
" the banking sector is the great unknown , it has broken ireland 's back , we 'll have to see how the measures for the banking sector pan out , " lewis told deutsche welle .

chancellor merkel was the target of pointed criticism during the annual budget debate in parliament .
but the conservative poltician rebuked the opposition , insisting her government was on the right political course . speaking during the annual debate on the budget , german chancellor angela merkel defended her center-right coalition 's handling of the economy , saying that after 13 months in power the government was on the right course .
" the economy is growing again and the number of unemployed has dropped to below three million , " said merkel .
merkel also reiterated that budget consolidation was her government 's primary task .
she argued that spending cuts came first but government plans for tax cuts had not been forgotten either .
however she declined to provide a specific timeline for lowering taxes .
the draft for the 2011 budget includes new borrowing of 48.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 64.6 billion -rrb- .
in the current 2010 budget year new borrowing of 50 billion euro is expected .
saving for the future countering opposition criticism that she was " skimping on the future " , merkel said that , on the contrary , she was " saving money to invest in the future . "
in an attack on the opposition green party , which is currently riding high in the opinion polls ahead of a number of state elections in 2011 , merkel sharply criticized what she called its " permanent blockade " politics .
the green 's parliamentary leader , renate kuenast , responded by calling the coalition 's social and ecological policies a " declaration of bankruptcy . "
social democrat parliamentary leader , frank-walter steinmeier said the coalition ruled far beyond its capabilities and that it had " squandered " the electorate 's trust .

as raw materials become scarcer , the economic importance of metal recycling is set to increase . the tangled mass of thin metal strips in a waist-high cardboard box has value , allegedly , even though they look like film that has been unspooled and tossed carelessly in a pile .
but bernhard markowis sees money here .
you just have to look closely , he says , reaching into the pile and pulling out a handful .
" there 's a lot of copper in here , " he says , showing it to a visitor .
" but you can see these small silver-colored bits . "
with his index finger he points to small silver splotches , no bigger than the head of a pin .
for 30 years , markowis has recycled precious metals for ami doduco , and for those three decades , he has watched how the manufacturing industry continually puts him and his company to the test .
while silver is found in a variety of industrial and consumer products - refrigerators , ointments and computer keyboards - the concentrations are often so low that it is n't worth the time and effort required to recover the metal .
silver recovery is an expensive process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : material is melted to determine its metal composition in doduco 's recycling area , large furnaces give the place the look of a steel mill .
up to 700 kilos of metal strips can be fed into the furnaces , which are heated to temperatures reaching 1,000 degrees celsius .
the resulting molten metal is then taken to the laboratory , where it is analyzed for precious elements and copper , and their weights are determined .
it is on this basis that doduco charges its clients , who can also choose to take their metal to an independent lab for analysis , if they want .
dirty laundry after the analysis is complete the real recovery work begins .
robert sorber , the product manger for silver powder at doduco , uses a burn-off method or chemical and electrolytic processes to recover the precious metal .
the more the workers processes the worker have to employ to separate the elements , the more expensive it becomes for clients .
sorber compares it to a laundry , where people pay money to get their clothes back clean .
" with us , they get their precious metals back , after they 've paid for the cleaning , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : copper is filtered out of metal plates through an electrolytic process doduco has electrical component production sites in spain , mexico and china , but all precious-metal recovery work is done in germany .
its foreign plants send all of their scrap to the headquarters in pforzheim in southwestern germany , with one important exception : china .
china has long recognized the potential of scrap as an important source of raw materials and does not allow its export .
it stores its scrap for later recycling .
in the past , doduco would only accept scrap that had a silver content of at least five percent , although today , one percent is enough for markowis to fire up his furnaces and start the recovery process .
a global leader in one rectangular basin filled with a bluish liquid , metal plates have been positioned at regular distances from each other and an electric current passes through them .
at their edges , silver crystals are growing .
" when women see this , they usually get pretty excited , " said markowis , looking at his visitor 's face for a second to confirm his observation before continuing .
the plates are lifted out of the liquid once every 20 minutes so the crystals fall off and can be taken out .
if the plates are left alone too long , the crystals would grow until they reached the neighboring plate , which would result in a short circuit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert sorber inspects a container with recovered silver worth about 550,000 euros doduco recycles about 400 tons of silver per year .
its biggest competitor , the allgemeine gold- und silberscheideanstalt , also based in pforzheim , processes about the same amount .
if doduco were a country , it would be the world 's 13th largest silver producer , according to armin nittel , head of the company 's precious-metals recovery unit .
if all german recovery companies were put together , they would jump to fifth place .
nittel thinks there is still room to grow .
he says 60 percent of used silver ends up in garbage dumps .
he wants to lower that number .
a kilo for a ton the high price of silver right now is helping nittel do that .
over the past five years , silver has risen from just over $ 8.00 per ounce to over $ 25.00 .
at the same time , the price increase makes his job harder as well .
manufacturers are continually looking for new ways to use less silver in their products than they do now .
despite that , the silver content of scrap is still higher than in ore , nittel says .
to recover two to three grams of gold or silver , it is necessary to mine about one ton of rock , while one kilo of scrap will yield the same result .
about one-fifth of silver comes from some kind of recovery process ; with gold , the percentage is even higher .
" recycling is an important factor in ensuring that industry has the amount of precious metals it needs , " nittel said .

the plates are lifted out of the liquid once every 20 minutes so the crystals fall off and can be taken out .
if the plates are left alone too long , the crystals would grow until they reached the neighboring plate , which would result in a short circuit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert sorber inspects a container with recovered silver worth about 550,000 euros doduco recycles about 400 tons of silver per year .
its biggest competitor , the allgemeine gold- und silberscheideanstalt , also based in pforzheim , processes about the same amount .
if doduco were a country , it would be the world 's 13th largest silver producer , according to armin nittel , head of the company 's precious-metals recovery unit .
if all german recovery companies were put together , they would jump to fifth place .
nittel thinks there is still room to grow .
he says 60 percent of used silver ends up in garbage dumps .
he wants to lower that number .
a kilo for a ton the high price of silver right now is helping nittel do that .
over the past five years , silver has risen from just over $ 8.00 per ounce to over $ 25.00 .
at the same time , the price increase makes his job harder as well .
manufacturers are continually looking for new ways to use less silver in their products than they do now .
despite that , the silver content of scrap is still higher than in ore , nittel says .
to recover two to three grams of gold or silver , it is necessary to mine about one ton of rock , while one kilo of scrap will yield the same result .
about one-fifth of silver comes from some kind of recovery process ; with gold , the percentage is even higher .
" recycling is an important factor in ensuring that industry has the amount of precious metals it needs , " nittel said .

the cuts are necessary to secure a multi-billion-euro international bailout . ireland has set out a four-year plan to save 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- in order to secure an international bailout expected to be in the region of 85 billion euros .
under the national recovery plan , the irish republic aims to bring its budget deficit down from a projected 32 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- to three percent of gdp by 2014 by imposing tax increases , wage cuts and by curbing public spending .
" we can and we will pull through this as we have in the past , " prime minister brian cowen told a news conference in dublin .
" we are a smart , resilient , proud people and we are going to come through this challenge because we love our country . "
finance minister brian lenihan , meanwhile , stressed the urgency of the situation .
" if we do not make these savings , we have no credible way of borrowing money to pay for our social welfare and health and education sectors from the middle of next year , " he said .
optimistic on growth the program is based on an average growth projection of 2.75 percent for the next four years , which some experts say is optimistic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen could have a tough time selling his budget to the opposition " it 's certainly challenging , given the extent of fiscal tightening , which is around 10 percent of gdp , " grant lewis , head of economic research at daiwa capital markets europe told deutsche welle .
" but i think , the eu and the imf will sign up for that , as in the last 15 years , ireland has had a good track record in terms of growth , it 's a flexible economy with a well-educated workforce and good demographics . "
measures include reducing the minimum wage by one euro , slashing public sector jobs and pay and raising the sales tax from 21 percent to 23 percent in 2014 .
under the current tax regime , 45 percent of irish workers do not pay income tax , a situation the government calls " unsustainable " .
the eu 's commissioner for economic and financial affairs , olli rehn , welcomed the program , calling it " a sound basis for the negotiations " on the international bailout .
corporation tax non-negotiable one tax that will not be raised is ireland 's corporation tax - at 12.5 percent the lowest in the european union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banking sector is at the heart of the debt crisis .
" the government remains committed to the 12.5 percent corporation tax rate : it will not be increased under any circumstances , " was the clear message in wednesday 's statement .
it was a magnet for foreign investment during ireland 's boom years , but has been heavily criticized by its european neighbors .
countries like germany say it creates an unfair advantage , especially while ireland is drip-fed by eu bailout funds .
" it 's the heart of ireland 's business model and it 's attracted loads of multinationals .

now some analysts are grumbling that the euro may be on its way out too . this irish rescue package agreed this week – along with the greek bailout earlier in the year - has found the eurozone countries hopelessly divided over the question of how to save the common currency in the long term .
they have good reason to be concerned : the bond markets are n't showing a healthy interest in portugal , another likely bailout candidate .
nor are they particularly impressed with spain , an even bigger economy with a similarly troubling debt load , a high unemployment rate and a stagnating economy .
should these countries also seek relief , the future of the euro could be on the line .
worried in berlin the alarm bells are ringing in berlin .
the german government could end up paying 17 billion euros or more of the expected 90-billion-euro irish rescue package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble is worried about the euro on tuesday , german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble warned lawmakers that the irish debt crisis posed a huge risk .
he said the race to shore up ireland 's banking sector and public finances " puts our common currency at stake . "
the excessive debt levels in greece and now ireland , the minister added , only reinforce germany 's strategy of trimming its budget during a nascent recovery .
but berlin 's austerity strategy has drawn criticism from major partners , including the united states .
so has chancellor angela merkel 's suggestion that , in future euro crises , private bondholders should bear more of the losses .
merkel 's proposal is motivated , in part , by pressure from germany 's constitutional court , which could still declare the government 's participation in european bailouts illegal .
in addition to being promised that the euro would be as stable as the deutschmark , germans were told prior to the deutschmark-euro conversion that there would be a " no bailout clause " that would prevent europe 's richer countries from having to rescue the indigent .
irreconcilable camps with every new day of uncertainty , fears are mounting that the ongoing crisis in europe could lead to the default of individual countries and ultimately the collapse of the eurozone .
a deep divide now runs through the two almost irreconcilable camps : the one led by germany and supported by mainly northern european countries defending a culture of economic and monetary stability ; and the other consisting mostly of southern european countries referred to as piigs – portugal , italy , ireland , greece and spain .
european policymakers are now trying to achieve a consensus between the two camps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the euro still be around in a decade ?
" the europeans have a difficult task , " said friedrich heinemann , a director at the centre for european economic research in mannheim , germany .
" on the one side , they must avoid panics and irrational attacks on solvent governments .
on the other side , they must refrain from establishing a guarantee mechanism , which would smash consolidation incentives . " germany is " aware of both dangers , " heinemann told deutsche welle , and has taken what he calls " a highly responsible position . "
the government , he said , consented to the 750-billion-euro european financial stability facility but insisted on a crisis resolution mechanism that would include creditors in a solution for insolvent countries .
" the latter position may not be popular among highly indebted countries but it is important for the fiscal and political future of europe , " heinemann said .
" euro member countries must remain responsible for their own public finances . "
other analysts agree .
" i think germany is right in wanting to avoid a transfer union , " said marco annunziata , chief economist at unicredit group . there are two possible ways of avoiding this , according to annunziata .
the first , he said , would be to have a true centralization of european fiscal policy – something that would require a greater degree of political union than seems feasible at this stage . the second is to have a framework for sovereign debt restructuring - a credible signal to investors that the next time a eurozone country has difficulties servicing its debt , it will be helped only if at the same time private investors suffer haircuts .
this would make private investors more careful when assessing sovereign risk , and would therefore impose stricter discipline on countries by driving debt spreads wider at the first signs of fiscal indiscipline . " these issues need to be resolved soon , however , " annunziata told deutsche welle .
" otherwise , the risk is that popular support for the eurozone might disintegrate very quickly . " " a more german eurozone " some experts question , though , how big a role germany , europe 's largest economy , should play in stabilizing the eurozone .
turning the eurozone into a larger germany , says philip whyte with the centre for european reform in london , could have adverse consequences - not only for the country itself but also for europe and even the rest of the world .
he maintains that " a more german eurozone " would be afflicted by chronically weak demand , debilitating cycles of competitive wage cuts and prolonged economic slumps in the deficit countries .
like many others , whyte agrees the time has come to make some tough decisions .
" the genius of the european union has been to muddle its way through , " he said .
" i do n't think that muddling is an option this time . "
so should investors unload their euros while they are still worth something ?
expert heinemann is confident the common currency will survive .
" i do n't see the euro breaking apart , " he said .
" or does anybody see the us currency union breaking apart because of the imminent californian bankruptcy ?

now a young german firm aims to join the major league of mining by reactivating abandoned deposits . situated in an office above a music school in heidelberg 's historic city center , the 15 employees of deutsche rohstoff are trying to profit from the rising prices of natural resources .
the company specializes in reactivating defunct sources of oil , gas , gold , silver , high-tech metals like indium or gallium , and rare earth elements .
an exception in a market dominated by large multinational players , deutsche rohstoff has been spending money with essentially no earnings since it was founded in 2006 .
but it has investors ' attention .
a recent sale of 320,000 new shares netted four million euros , with industry giants like the basf chemicals company buying stakes in the business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : titus gebel says there will always be projects larger companies miss " in the long term we want to fill the gap left behind by -lrb- former german mining companies -rrb- preussag and metallgesellschaft , " deutsche rohstoff executive titus gebel told deutsche welle .
" they were globally situated natural resource companies which could hold their own in the first division – or at least in the second division – during the 1980s . "
opportunity from rising prices there was a time when industrialized western countries had significantly more capacity to process their natural resources .
in the 1960s , for instance , germany was europe 's largest producer of oil .
as procurement from africa and asia became cheaper , oil prices dropped and domestic facilities were closed .
gebel , however , believes the rising cost of natural resources will make europe 's own deposits profitable again .
his company is betting on increased demand , which he 's sure is more than a temporary trend .
" because of the economic developments in china and india , the natural resources sector is experiencing what 's called a super-cycle – there will be a boom in the next 20 years . "
europe 's political stability is another factor to be taken into account .
many of the countries which have supplied the global economy with relatively inexpensive natural resources over recent years are politically volatile .
and those that are stable will increasingly choose to keep their resources for domestic production .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as resource prices rise , europe 's political stability will be a valuable asset china , for example , used 8 percent of the world 's demand for metal 16 years ago .
today it uses up to 25 percent .
" representatives from our industry are unified in their opinion , " gebel said .
" if growth in china and also india and brazil continues the way it has been so far , then in the next 25 years we will need to mine as much metal as we have in the combined history of mankind . "
spending without profits investors seem convinced by deutsche rohstoff 's logic .
the company went public in 2010 , and its stock price has risen by 35 percent .
but where are the profits ?
thus far deutsche rohstoff has primarily been investing in identifying investment opportunities and securing the rights to natural resource deposits .
in october it started production at the georgetown gold mine in australia , which is owned by a subsidiary company .
the first batch of gold bars are due to be processed by december and should see the project turn a profit by the end of this year or the next .
rhein petroleum – another affiliated company with oil and gas projects throughout germany – is also expected to generate its first revenues in 2011 , or 2012 at the latest .
when deutsche rohstoff picks a project , it is careful to make sure that production can be started as quickly as possible , according to gebel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche rohstoff picks projects which can be reactivated quickly " we look at deposits which were prospected in the past and calculate out whether modern technology and higher prices make it worthwhile , " he said .

analysts say beijing 's influence is not absolute . china is separated from north korea by the yalu river near the northern chinese city of dandong .
however , this river has proven to be less a barrier than a link between the two countries . the bridge over the river has seen goods worth more than one billion us dollars pass over it since the last six months .
north korea has been dependent on china for basic supplies and oil for decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yalu river at dandong separates china from north korea the two countries signed a friendship treaty in 1961 and pyongyang has had beijing 's tacit support ever since .
north korean leader kim jong-il has already visited china twice this year . earlier this year , china used its veto in the united nations security council against an international bid to enforce stronger sanctions against north korea . china 's influence should not be overestimated however , niu jun from the school of international studies at peking university says that although " china has more influence on north korea than any other country , this influence is not absolute . " british north korea expert jasper becker agrees : " kim jong-il does n't trust the chinese .
they are not involved in his inner circle or his decision-making process .
they are excluded from it and he ’ s definitely opposed to the chinese way . " bildunterschrift : china is worried that there will be a deluge of refugees if north korea collapses however , china is worried that a war or the collapse of the north korean regime will lead to a deluge of refugees from across the border .
" we will do our utmost to prevent that , " says shi yinhong from peking university . korean unification is also not an option for china .
if the border between the two divided countries were to fall , us troops would practically be on the chinese border .
this is why beijing is intent on maintaining the status quo , even if beijing has little sympathy for kim jong-il and his family . beijing has refused to condemn north korea for tuesday ’ s artillery attacks but it did urge both sides to show " calm and restraint " and to sit down for talks as soon as possible . japan calls on beijing to restrain pyongyang north korea 's neighbor japan also tried to ease the tension , with prime minister naoto kan calling on china to work with other partners and restrain pyongyang . in a telephone conversation with south korean president lee myung bak , kan underlined his country 's strong ties with washington and seoul . meanwhile , president lee myung bak was criticized at home for his " slow " response to the crisis with south korean defense minister kim tae yung being grilled by parliamentarians over intelligence glitches regarding information about the attack and his inadequate response to north korea ’ s artillery firing . kim said that north korea ’ s attempts to demonstrate its might were just a means for the upcoming leader kim jong-un to show off his status as a strong leader . author : manasi gopalakrishnan editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a spokesman for the eu 's economic and monetary affairs commissioner , olli rehn , insisted that the euro was a " stable " currency and that its continued existence was not threatened by eurozone debt or banking crises .
he was reacting to a statement by angela merkel , in which the german chancellor said europe was in an " extraordinarily serious situation . "
merkel said germany 's support for ireland was conditional on ireland " making clear what steps -lrb- it -rrb- must take to get back on a path of stabilization . "
merkel added that europe should have the " courage " to set limits on markets by ensuring that private investors bear some of the risk of future eurozone bailouts .
the chancellor said germany would look " positively " on ireland 's request , reportedly worth some 85 billion euros -lrb- 114 billion dollars -rrb- .
future of euro at stake : minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says support for an irish bailout is conditional german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble told the bundestag on tuesday that the future of the euro was " at stake " in the irish crisis .
with its banking system in crisis and its budget deficit forecast to be 10 times the eu limit of three percent of gdp this year , ireland on sunday became the second eurozone member in six months to apply for a bailout after greece .
during wednesday 's parliamentary debate merkel argued in favor of involving private investors to bear some of the risk on government bonds .
merkel reiterated that the european union should set limits on the markets .
the opposition social democrats instead called for more equality on european tax rates .
some eu members states believe that ireland 's low corporate tax rate percent is unfair competition .
with the jury still out on whether germany 's contribution to the greek bailout is compatible with german law , the german constitutional court will be watching how the irish rescue package closely .
in reaction to the irish debt crisis and the portuguese general strike the euro on wednesday sank below 1.33 dollars for the first time in two months .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de investment -pipe- 24.11.2010 niche company aims to become natural resource heavyweight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche rohstoff reactivates abandoned projects the natural resources sector is dominated by global corporations such as bhp billiton , rio tinto and exxon mobil .
now a young german firm aims to join the major league of mining by reactivating abandoned deposits . situated in an office above a music school in heidelberg 's historic city center , the 15 employees of deutsche rohstoff are trying to profit from the rising prices of natural resources .
the company specializes in reactivating defunct sources of oil , gas , gold , silver , high-tech metals like indium or gallium , and rare earth elements .
an exception in a market dominated by large multinational players , deutsche rohstoff has been spending money with essentially no earnings since it was founded in 2006 .
but it has investors ' attention .
a recent sale of 320,000 new shares netted four million euros , with industry giants like the basf chemicals company buying stakes in the business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : titus gebel says there will always be projects larger companies miss " in the long term we want to fill the gap left behind by -lrb- former german mining companies -rrb- preussag and metallgesellschaft , " deutsche rohstoff executive titus gebel told deutsche welle .
" they were globally situated natural resource companies which could hold their own in the first division – or at least in the second division – during the 1980s . "
opportunity from rising prices there was a time when industrialized western countries had significantly more capacity to process their natural resources .
in the 1960s , for instance , germany was europe 's largest producer of oil .
as procurement from africa and asia became cheaper , oil prices dropped and domestic facilities were closed .
gebel , however , believes the rising cost of natural resources will make europe 's own deposits profitable again .
his company is betting on increased demand , which he 's sure is more than a temporary trend .
" because of the economic developments in china and india , the natural resources sector is experiencing what 's called a super-cycle – there will be a boom in the next 20 years . "
europe 's political stability is another factor to be taken into account .
many of the countries which have supplied the global economy with relatively inexpensive natural resources over recent years are politically volatile .
and those that are stable will increasingly choose to keep their resources for domestic production .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as resource prices rise , europe 's political stability will be a valuable asset china , for example , used 8 percent of the world 's demand for metal 16 years ago .
today it uses up to 25 percent .
" representatives from our industry are unified in their opinion , " gebel said .
" if growth in china and also india and brazil continues the way it has been so far , then in the next 25 years we will need to mine as much metal as we have in the combined history of mankind . "
spending without profits investors seem convinced by deutsche rohstoff 's logic .
the company went public in 2010 , and its stock price has risen by 35 percent .
but where are the profits ?
thus far deutsche rohstoff has primarily been investing in identifying investment opportunities and securing the rights to natural resource deposits .
in october it started production at the georgetown gold mine in australia , which is owned by a subsidiary company .
the first batch of gold bars are due to be processed by december and should see the project turn a profit by the end of this year or the next .
rhein petroleum – another affiliated company with oil and gas projects throughout germany – is also expected to generate its first revenues in 2011 , or 2012 at the latest .
when deutsche rohstoff picks a project , it is careful to make sure that production can be started as quickly as possible , according to gebel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche rohstoff picks projects which can be reactivated quickly " we look at deposits which were prospected in the past and calculate out whether modern technology and higher prices make it worthwhile , " he said .
" that way we can drastically shorten the time which customarily exists in mining between prospecting a deposit and beginning production . "
not afraid of big competition the basic idea behind deutsche rohstoff is n't just convincing to individual investors , it seems .
exxon mobile is on board along with glencore , the world 's largest supplier of raw materials , and wintershall , germany 's largest oil and gas trader .
gebel insists he is n't concerned about being squeezed out by from industry giants .
even with their combined forces , there will always be locations licensed for prospecting that major corporations wo n't get around to , he says .
so now small companies are cropping up around the world with plans to mull through archives in search of viable projects which are too small for their enormous counterparts .
one advantage deutsche rohstoff has is good industry contacts and the historic division of germany into a capitalist and communist states .
" it 's very interesting to note that in the area which used to be the former gdr -lrb- german democratic republic -rrb- , the countryside is perforated from where the gdr was searching for uranium and other natural resources , " he said .
" and we can draw on that information today . "
" we 've had access to gdr data .
we knew it existed – but that was n't common knowledge internationally . "

a spokesman for the eu 's economic and monetary affairs commissioner , olli rehn , insisted that the euro was a " stable " currency and that its continued existence was not threatened by eurozone debt or banking crises .
he was reacting to a statement by angela merkel , in which the german chancellor said europe was in an " extraordinarily serious situation . "
merkel said germany 's support for ireland was conditional on ireland " making clear what steps -lrb- it -rrb- must take to get back on a path of stabilization . "
merkel added that europe should have the " courage " to set limits on markets by ensuring that private investors bear some of the risk of future eurozone bailouts .
the chancellor said germany would look " positively " on ireland 's request , reportedly worth some 85 billion euros -lrb- 114 billion dollars -rrb- .
future of euro at stake : minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says support for an irish bailout is conditional german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble told the bundestag on tuesday that the future of the euro was " at stake " in the irish crisis .
with its banking system in crisis and its budget deficit forecast to be 10 times the eu limit of three percent of gdp this year , ireland on sunday became the second eurozone member in six months to apply for a bailout after greece .
during wednesday 's parliamentary debate merkel argued in favor of involving private investors to bear some of the risk on government bonds .
merkel reiterated that the european union should set limits on the markets .
the opposition social democrats instead called for more equality on european tax rates .
some eu members states believe that ireland 's low corporate tax rate percent is unfair competition .
with the jury still out on whether germany 's contribution to the greek bailout is compatible with german law , the german constitutional court will be watching how the irish rescue package closely .
in reaction to the irish debt crisis and the portuguese general strike the euro on wednesday sank below 1.33 dollars for the first time in two months .

now some analysts are grumbling that the euro may be on its way out too . this irish rescue package agreed this week – along with the greek bailout earlier in the year - has found the eurozone countries hopelessly divided over the question of how to save the common currency in the long term .
they have good reason to be concerned : the bond markets are n't showing a healthy interest in portugal , another likely bailout candidate .
nor are they particularly impressed with spain , an even bigger economy with a similarly troubling debt load , a high unemployment rate and a stagnating economy .
should these countries also seek relief , the future of the euro could be on the line .
worried in berlin the alarm bells are ringing in berlin .
the german government could end up paying 17 billion euros or more of the expected 90-billion-euro irish rescue package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble is worried about the euro on tuesday , german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble warned lawmakers that the irish debt crisis posed a huge risk .
he said the race to shore up ireland 's banking sector and public finances " puts our common currency at stake . "
the excessive debt levels in greece and now ireland , the minister added , only reinforce germany 's strategy of trimming its budget during a nascent recovery .
but berlin 's austerity strategy has drawn criticism from major partners , including the united states .
so has chancellor angela merkel 's suggestion that , in future euro crises , private bondholders should bear more of the losses .
merkel 's proposal is motivated , in part , by pressure from germany 's constitutional court , which could still declare the government 's participation in european bailouts illegal .
in addition to being promised that the euro would be as stable as the deutschmark , germans were told prior to the deutschmark-euro conversion that there would be a " no bailout clause " that would prevent europe 's richer countries from having to rescue the indigent .
irreconcilable camps with every new day of uncertainty , fears are mounting that the ongoing crisis in europe could lead to the default of individual countries and ultimately the collapse of the eurozone .
a deep divide now runs through the two almost irreconcilable camps : the one led by germany and supported by mainly northern european countries defending a culture of economic and monetary stability ; and the other consisting mostly of southern european countries referred to as piigs – portugal , italy , ireland , greece and spain .
european policymakers are now trying to achieve a consensus between the two camps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the euro still be around in a decade ?
" the europeans have a difficult task , " said friedrich heinemann , a director at the centre for european economic research in mannheim , germany .
" on the one side , they must avoid panics and irrational attacks on solvent governments .
on the other side , they must refrain from establishing a guarantee mechanism , which would smash consolidation incentives . " germany is " aware of both dangers , " heinemann told deutsche welle , and has taken what he calls " a highly responsible position . "
the government , he said , consented to the 750-billion-euro european financial stability facility but insisted on a crisis resolution mechanism that would include creditors in a solution for insolvent countries .
" the latter position may not be popular among highly indebted countries but it is important for the fiscal and political future of europe , " heinemann said .
" euro member countries must remain responsible for their own public finances . "
other analysts agree .
" i think germany is right in wanting to avoid a transfer union , " said marco annunziata , chief economist at unicredit group . there are two possible ways of avoiding this , according to annunziata .
the first , he said , would be to have a true centralization of european fiscal policy – something that would require a greater degree of political union than seems feasible at this stage . the second is to have a framework for sovereign debt restructuring - a credible signal to investors that the next time a eurozone country has difficulties servicing its debt , it will be helped only if at the same time private investors suffer haircuts .
this would make private investors more careful when assessing sovereign risk , and would therefore impose stricter discipline on countries by driving debt spreads wider at the first signs of fiscal indiscipline . " these issues need to be resolved soon , however , " annunziata told deutsche welle .
" otherwise , the risk is that popular support for the eurozone might disintegrate very quickly . " " a more german eurozone " some experts question , though , how big a role germany , europe 's largest economy , should play in stabilizing the eurozone .
turning the eurozone into a larger germany , says philip whyte with the centre for european reform in london , could have adverse consequences - not only for the country itself but also for europe and even the rest of the world .
he maintains that " a more german eurozone " would be afflicted by chronically weak demand , debilitating cycles of competitive wage cuts and prolonged economic slumps in the deficit countries .
like many others , whyte agrees the time has come to make some tough decisions .
" the genius of the european union has been to muddle its way through , " he said .
" i do n't think that muddling is an option this time . "
so should investors unload their euros while they are still worth something ?
expert heinemann is confident the common currency will survive .
" i do n't see the euro breaking apart , " he said .
" or does anybody see the us currency union breaking apart because of the imminent californian bankruptcy ?

chancellor merkel was the target of pointed criticism during the annual budget debate in parliament .
but the conservative poltician rebuked the opposition , insisting her government was on the right political course . speaking during the annual debate on the budget , german chancellor angela merkel defended her center-right coalition 's handling of the economy , saying that after 13 months in power the government was on the right course .
" the economy is growing again and the number of unemployed has dropped to below three million , " said merkel .
merkel also reiterated that budget consolidation was her government 's primary task .
she argued that spending cuts came first but government plans for tax cuts had not been forgotten either .
however she declined to provide a specific timeline for lowering taxes .
the draft for the 2011 budget includes new borrowing of 48.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 64.6 billion -rrb- .
in the current 2010 budget year new borrowing of 50 billion euro is expected .
saving for the future countering opposition criticism that she was " skimping on the future " , merkel said that , on the contrary , she was " saving money to invest in the future . "
in an attack on the opposition green party , which is currently riding high in the opinion polls ahead of a number of state elections in 2011 , merkel sharply criticized what she called its " permanent blockade " politics .
the green 's parliamentary leader , renate kuenast , responded by calling the coalition 's social and ecological policies a " declaration of bankruptcy . "
social democrat parliamentary leader , frank-walter steinmeier said the coalition ruled far beyond its capabilities and that it had " squandered " the electorate 's trust .

now a young german firm aims to join the major league of mining by reactivating abandoned deposits . situated in an office above a music school in heidelberg 's historic city center , the 15 employees of deutsche rohstoff are trying to profit from the rising prices of natural resources .
the company specializes in reactivating defunct sources of oil , gas , gold , silver , high-tech metals like indium or gallium , and rare earth elements .
an exception in a market dominated by large multinational players , deutsche rohstoff has been spending money with essentially no earnings since it was founded in 2006 .
but it has investors ' attention .
a recent sale of 320,000 new shares netted four million euros , with industry giants like the basf chemicals company buying stakes in the business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : titus gebel says there will always be projects larger companies miss " in the long term we want to fill the gap left behind by -lrb- former german mining companies -rrb- preussag and metallgesellschaft , " deutsche rohstoff executive titus gebel told deutsche welle .
" they were globally situated natural resource companies which could hold their own in the first division – or at least in the second division – during the 1980s . "
opportunity from rising prices there was a time when industrialized western countries had significantly more capacity to process their natural resources .
in the 1960s , for instance , germany was europe 's largest producer of oil .
as procurement from africa and asia became cheaper , oil prices dropped and domestic facilities were closed .
gebel , however , believes the rising cost of natural resources will make europe 's own deposits profitable again .
his company is betting on increased demand , which he 's sure is more than a temporary trend .
" because of the economic developments in china and india , the natural resources sector is experiencing what 's called a super-cycle – there will be a boom in the next 20 years . "
europe 's political stability is another factor to be taken into account .
many of the countries which have supplied the global economy with relatively inexpensive natural resources over recent years are politically volatile .
and those that are stable will increasingly choose to keep their resources for domestic production .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as resource prices rise , europe 's political stability will be a valuable asset china , for example , used 8 percent of the world 's demand for metal 16 years ago .
today it uses up to 25 percent .
" representatives from our industry are unified in their opinion , " gebel said .
" if growth in china and also india and brazil continues the way it has been so far , then in the next 25 years we will need to mine as much metal as we have in the combined history of mankind . "
spending without profits investors seem convinced by deutsche rohstoff 's logic .
the company went public in 2010 , and its stock price has risen by 35 percent .
but where are the profits ?
thus far deutsche rohstoff has primarily been investing in identifying investment opportunities and securing the rights to natural resource deposits .
in october it started production at the georgetown gold mine in australia , which is owned by a subsidiary company .
the first batch of gold bars are due to be processed by december and should see the project turn a profit by the end of this year or the next .
rhein petroleum – another affiliated company with oil and gas projects throughout germany – is also expected to generate its first revenues in 2011 , or 2012 at the latest .
when deutsche rohstoff picks a project , it is careful to make sure that production can be started as quickly as possible , according to gebel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche rohstoff picks projects which can be reactivated quickly " we look at deposits which were prospected in the past and calculate out whether modern technology and higher prices make it worthwhile , " he said .
" that way we can drastically shorten the time which customarily exists in mining between prospecting a deposit and beginning production . "
not afraid of big competition the basic idea behind deutsche rohstoff is n't just convincing to individual investors , it seems .
exxon mobile is on board along with glencore , the world 's largest supplier of raw materials , and wintershall , germany 's largest oil and gas trader .
gebel insists he is n't concerned about being squeezed out by from industry giants .
even with their combined forces , there will always be locations licensed for prospecting that major corporations wo n't get around to , he says .
so now small companies are cropping up around the world with plans to mull through archives in search of viable projects which are too small for their enormous counterparts .
one advantage deutsche rohstoff has is good industry contacts and the historic division of germany into a capitalist and communist states .
" it 's very interesting to note that in the area which used to be the former gdr -lrb- german democratic republic -rrb- , the countryside is perforated from where the gdr was searching for uranium and other natural resources , " he said .
" and we can draw on that information today . "
" we 've had access to gdr data .
we knew it existed – but that was n't common knowledge internationally . "

however , the independence of balkan journalism is less impressive , as a conference co-hosted by dw has shown . at the close of the " media in southeast europe " conference in bonn , one of the presenters summoned the words of bruce springsteen to characterize the media market in southeast-european countries : " 57 channels and nothing on . "
liana ganea of the romanian media watchdog active watch said that the media in southeastern europe was not only lacking in quality production but also in freedom of speech .
ganea cited the example of romanian tycoon sorin ovidiu vantu , who in 2009 ordered a journalist working for his media group , realitatea-catavencu , to " attack " certain political figures in romania .

analysts say beijing 's influence is not absolute . china is separated from north korea by the yalu river near the northern chinese city of dandong .
however , this river has proven to be less a barrier than a link between the two countries . the bridge over the river has seen goods worth more than one billion us dollars pass over it since the last six months .
north korea has been dependent on china for basic supplies and oil for decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yalu river at dandong separates china from north korea the two countries signed a friendship treaty in 1961 and pyongyang has had beijing 's tacit support ever since .
north korean leader kim jong-il has already visited china twice this year . earlier this year , china used its veto in the united nations security council against an international bid to enforce stronger sanctions against north korea . china 's influence should not be overestimated however , niu jun from the school of international studies at peking university says that although " china has more influence on north korea than any other country , this influence is not absolute . " british north korea expert jasper becker agrees : " kim jong-il does n't trust the chinese .
they are not involved in his inner circle or his decision-making process .
they are excluded from it and he ’ s definitely opposed to the chinese way . " bildunterschrift : china is worried that there will be a deluge of refugees if north korea collapses however , china is worried that a war or the collapse of the north korean regime will lead to a deluge of refugees from across the border .
" we will do our utmost to prevent that , " says shi yinhong from peking university . korean unification is also not an option for china .
if the border between the two divided countries were to fall , us troops would practically be on the chinese border .
this is why beijing is intent on maintaining the status quo , even if beijing has little sympathy for kim jong-il and his family . beijing has refused to condemn north korea for tuesday ’ s artillery attacks but it did urge both sides to show " calm and restraint " and to sit down for talks as soon as possible . japan calls on beijing to restrain pyongyang north korea 's neighbor japan also tried to ease the tension , with prime minister naoto kan calling on china to work with other partners and restrain pyongyang . in a telephone conversation with south korean president lee myung bak , kan underlined his country 's strong ties with washington and seoul . meanwhile , president lee myung bak was criticized at home for his " slow " response to the crisis with south korean defense minister kim tae yung being grilled by parliamentarians over intelligence glitches regarding information about the attack and his inadequate response to north korea ’ s artillery firing . kim said that north korea ’ s attempts to demonstrate its might were just a means for the upcoming leader kim jong-un to show off his status as a strong leader . author : manasi gopalakrishnan editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many south koreans have mixed feelings over how their government should respond to the incident . in a phone call with south korean president lee myung bak , us president barack obama pledged his nation 's support in preventing more provocations from pyongyang on wednesday . the shelling of yeongpyeong island on tuesday , which killed two south korean marines and two civilians , is one of the most serious firefights to take place between the two koreas in decades . some south koreans , such as 64-year-old lee cheon-gu , are very angry about the bloodshed .
" the reason north korea keeps making these provocations is that the south korean government is too lenient , " he says . " seoul has not been strong enough to prevent more attacks from the north after the sinking of the cheonan , " he says .
this attack , which international investigators blame on a north korean torpedo , resulted in the death of 46 sailors in march .
pyongyang has denied any involvement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president barack obama has assured seoul of support part of succession game some analysts say that tuesday 's attack might have something to do with the power transition that is currently underway in the north . however , brian myers , the author of the " the cleanest race , how north koreans see themselves and why it matters , " thinks this is probably a secondary reason . but he concedes that all is not well : " we have heard reports from north korea that many citizens there are not comfortable with the succession ; they are not happy with the way the so-called young general is being presented .

many incidents like this have happened before .
i am just worried it will hurt the economy here and the stock market . " some do not even believe seoul 's account of what happened on yeonpyeong .
one young woman , who did not want to give her name , said she did not trust her government . " i am not so sure that north korea is really responsible for starting the fires on the island , " she said , adding that she was " sympathetic to the north and would wait for more information before deciding on the truth . " koreans have a sense of allegiance to the nation brian myers thought this general apathy among south koreans or outright denial of north korea 's involvement in attacks could undermine seoul ’ s attempts to unify the people against the kim jong-il regime . " the people here feel much more of a sense of allegiance to the nation , in other words , the korean race , than they do to south korea as a separate republicm , " he explained . " so when north korea attacks south korean territory , they do not feel like they ’ ve been violated by a foreign power .
instead they feel that the governments of pyongyang and seoul have had a disagreement or perhaps a misunderstanding of some kind . " however , for seoul and washington , there is no misunderstanding about what took place .

they have good reason to be concerned : the bond markets are n't showing a healthy interest in portugal , another likely bailout candidate .

should these countries also seek relief , the future of the euro could be on the line .
worried in berlin the alarm bells are ringing in berlin .
the german government could end up paying 17 billion euros or more of the expected 90-billion-euro irish rescue package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble is worried about the euro on tuesday , german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble warned lawmakers that the irish debt crisis posed a huge risk .
he said the race to shore up ireland 's banking sector and public finances " puts our common currency at stake . "
the excessive debt levels in greece and now ireland , the minister added , only reinforce germany 's strategy of trimming its budget during a nascent recovery .

merkel 's proposal is motivated , in part , by pressure from germany 's constitutional court , which could still declare the government 's participation in european bailouts illegal .
in addition to being promised that the euro would be as stable as the deutschmark , germans were told prior to the deutschmark-euro conversion that there would be a " no bailout clause " that would prevent europe 's richer countries from having to rescue the indigent .
irreconcilable camps with every new day of uncertainty , fears are mounting that the ongoing crisis in europe could lead to the default of individual countries and ultimately the collapse of the eurozone .
a deep divide now runs through the two almost irreconcilable camps : the one led by germany and supported by mainly northern european countries defending a culture of economic and monetary stability ; and the other consisting mostly of southern european countries referred to as piigs – portugal , italy , ireland , greece and spain .
european policymakers are now trying to achieve a consensus between the two camps .

" the europeans have a difficult task , " said friedrich heinemann , a director at the centre for european economic research in mannheim , germany .
" on the one side , they must avoid panics and irrational attacks on solvent governments .
on the other side , they must refrain from establishing a guarantee mechanism , which would smash consolidation incentives . " germany is " aware of both dangers , " heinemann told deutsche welle , and has taken what he calls " a highly responsible position . "
the government , he said , consented to the 750-billion-euro european financial stability facility but insisted on a crisis resolution mechanism that would include creditors in a solution for insolvent countries .
" the latter position may not be popular among highly indebted countries but it is important for the fiscal and political future of europe , " heinemann said .
" euro member countries must remain responsible for their own public finances . "
other analysts agree .
" i think germany is right in wanting to avoid a transfer union , " said marco annunziata , chief economist at unicredit group . there are two possible ways of avoiding this , according to annunziata .
the first , he said , would be to have a true centralization of european fiscal policy – something that would require a greater degree of political union than seems feasible at this stage . the second is to have a framework for sovereign debt restructuring - a credible signal to investors that the next time a eurozone country has difficulties servicing its debt , it will be helped only if at the same time private investors suffer haircuts .
this would make private investors more careful when assessing sovereign risk , and would therefore impose stricter discipline on countries by driving debt spreads wider at the first signs of fiscal indiscipline . " these issues need to be resolved soon , however , " annunziata told deutsche welle .
" otherwise , the risk is that popular support for the eurozone might disintegrate very quickly . " " a more german eurozone " some experts question , though , how big a role germany , europe 's largest economy , should play in stabilizing the eurozone .
turning the eurozone into a larger germany , says philip whyte with the centre for european reform in london , could have adverse consequences - not only for the country itself but also for europe and even the rest of the world .
he maintains that " a more german eurozone " would be afflicted by chronically weak demand , debilitating cycles of competitive wage cuts and prolonged economic slumps in the deficit countries .
like many others , whyte agrees the time has come to make some tough decisions .
" the genius of the european union has been to muddle its way through , " he said .
" i do n't think that muddling is an option this time . "
so should investors unload their euros while they are still worth something ?

in addition to being promised that the euro would be as stable as the deutschmark , germans were told prior to the deutschmark-euro conversion that there would be a " no bailout clause " that would prevent europe 's richer countries from having to rescue the indigent .
irreconcilable camps with every new day of uncertainty , fears are mounting that the ongoing crisis in europe could lead to the default of individual countries and ultimately the collapse of the eurozone .
a deep divide now runs through the two almost irreconcilable camps : the one led by germany and supported by mainly northern european countries defending a culture of economic and monetary stability ; and the other consisting mostly of southern european countries referred to as piigs – portugal , italy , ireland , greece and spain .
european policymakers are now trying to achieve a consensus between the two camps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the euro still be around in a decade ?
" the europeans have a difficult task , " said friedrich heinemann , a director at the centre for european economic research in mannheim , germany .
" on the one side , they must avoid panics and irrational attacks on solvent governments .
on the other side , they must refrain from establishing a guarantee mechanism , which would smash consolidation incentives . " germany is " aware of both dangers , " heinemann told deutsche welle , and has taken what he calls " a highly responsible position . "
the government , he said , consented to the 750-billion-euro european financial stability facility but insisted on a crisis resolution mechanism that would include creditors in a solution for insolvent countries .
" the latter position may not be popular among highly indebted countries but it is important for the fiscal and political future of europe , " heinemann said .
" euro member countries must remain responsible for their own public finances . "
other analysts agree .
" i think germany is right in wanting to avoid a transfer union , " said marco annunziata , chief economist at unicredit group . there are two possible ways of avoiding this , according to annunziata .
the first , he said , would be to have a true centralization of european fiscal policy – something that would require a greater degree of political union than seems feasible at this stage . the second is to have a framework for sovereign debt restructuring - a credible signal to investors that the next time a eurozone country has difficulties servicing its debt , it will be helped only if at the same time private investors suffer haircuts .
this would make private investors more careful when assessing sovereign risk , and would therefore impose stricter discipline on countries by driving debt spreads wider at the first signs of fiscal indiscipline . " these issues need to be resolved soon , however , " annunziata told deutsche welle .
" otherwise , the risk is that popular support for the eurozone might disintegrate very quickly . " " a more german eurozone " some experts question , though , how big a role germany , europe 's largest economy , should play in stabilizing the eurozone .
turning the eurozone into a larger germany , says philip whyte with the centre for european reform in london , could have adverse consequences - not only for the country itself but also for europe and even the rest of the world .
he maintains that " a more german eurozone " would be afflicted by chronically weak demand , debilitating cycles of competitive wage cuts and prolonged economic slumps in the deficit countries .
like many others , whyte agrees the time has come to make some tough decisions .
" the genius of the european union has been to muddle its way through , " he said .
" i do n't think that muddling is an option this time . "
so should investors unload their euros while they are still worth something ?
expert heinemann is confident the common currency will survive .
" i do n't see the euro breaking apart , " he said .
" or does anybody see the us currency union breaking apart because of the imminent californian bankruptcy ?

now some analysts are grumbling that the euro may be on its way out too . this irish rescue package agreed this week – along with the greek bailout earlier in the year - has found the eurozone countries hopelessly divided over the question of how to save the common currency in the long term .
they have good reason to be concerned : the bond markets are n't showing a healthy interest in portugal , another likely bailout candidate .
nor are they particularly impressed with spain , an even bigger economy with a similarly troubling debt load , a high unemployment rate and a stagnating economy .
should these countries also seek relief , the future of the euro could be on the line .
worried in berlin the alarm bells are ringing in berlin .
the german government could end up paying 17 billion euros or more of the expected 90-billion-euro irish rescue package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble is worried about the euro on tuesday , german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble warned lawmakers that the irish debt crisis posed a huge risk .
he said the race to shore up ireland 's banking sector and public finances " puts our common currency at stake . "
the excessive debt levels in greece and now ireland , the minister added , only reinforce germany 's strategy of trimming its budget during a nascent recovery .
but berlin 's austerity strategy has drawn criticism from major partners , including the united states .
so has chancellor angela merkel 's suggestion that , in future euro crises , private bondholders should bear more of the losses .
merkel 's proposal is motivated , in part , by pressure from germany 's constitutional court , which could still declare the government 's participation in european bailouts illegal .

werder bremen were convincingly defeated 3-0 by tottenham hotspur , eliminating them from the competition . schalke booked their place in the final 16 of the champions league with an impressive 3-0 win over french side , olympique lyon .
despite their poor bundesliga form , schalke reversed their fortunes to top their group and progress to the knock-out round with a game in hand .
lyon will also go through to the next round , just one point behind schalke .
schalke took control of the game from kick-off , racing to a 2-0 lead after just 20 minutes .
early pressure from raul and jefferson farfan exposed the french defense , and schalke threatened goal three times in the first five minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer was under a little more pressure in the second half the pressure paid off as farfan scored 14 minutes in , converting a pass from raul and firing home from 11 meters .
six minutes later , klaas-jan huntelaar picked up the ball on the edge of the area and netted schalke 's second goal .
huntelaar added his second goal of the game in an impressive solo effort in the last minutes .
the dutchman was fed a long ball and then held off two lyon defenders before looping the ball over goalkeeper hugo lloris .
the performance was a far cry from their bundesliga season , which sees them at 15th in the league , only having won three of their 13 games .
speaking after the game , schalke coach felix magath said it was " a nice feeling " to be through .
" for weeks we have been written off , but now we will play in the knockout stage , " magath said .

luka modric took the londoners into half time 2-0 up , with a neat dodge around bremen defender sebastian prodl before finding the back of the net .
despite spurs ' gareth bale missing a second-half penalty , peter crouch added a third after 79 minutes .
play-maker lennon set up the goal , getting past his marker to lay the ball back for crouch to finish .
the result sees tottenham through to the final 16 , while bremen were eliminated .

but in the eyup district , a holy site for muslims , life is veiled in centuries of tradition . it is afternoon in eyup .
the call of the muezzin rings out over the square in front of the mosque .
women in colorful headscarves lead their children by the hand as men with prayer beads amble towards the entrance to the mosque . pairs of newlyweds pose for photos in front of the fountain ; the brides ' wedding dresses shimmering in the sunlight .
a young groom exclaims , " we are here to pray to allah for a good marriage ! "
his mother says softly , " god willing , they will always be a happy couple . " a few meters away , a couple proudly presents their five-year-old son .
the boy looks like a little sultan .
he is wearing a shiny white suit with gold edging and a turban-like headpiece .
in a few days he will participate in the " sunnet " - the turkish circumcision ceremony . before this important event , the boy 's parents take him to the eyup sultan mosque .
" you pray before circumcision - that 's the practice laid down by our prophet , " explains the boy 's father . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eyup is a popular place for wedding ceremonies pilgrims and tourists according to theologian and eyup 's cultural affairs coordinator irfan calisan , the district gets many regular visitors .
each year , eyup is visited by up to four million people - one and a half million in the fasting month of ramadan alone .
" on days of particular religious significance , like the festival of sacrifice , we sometimes have 100,000 visitors per day , " said calisan . muslims flock to eyup not only for special occasions or religious events .
there is also an old tradition , dating back over 500 years , of visiting the gravesite of abu ayyub al-ansari - the companion and standard-bearer of the prophet mohammed , believed to have died there in the seventh century .
the gravesite , located in the mosque 's inner courtyard , dates back to the 15th century .
the eyup district owes its name to this famous religious figure . " many mecca pilgrims make a stopover here , " said calisan .
" we call this tradition from the ottoman times ' little hajj . " ' hopes and prayers traditionally , the abu ayyub al-ansari gravesite is also visited by unmarried and childless women , who come to pray for a husband and offspring , as well as by students and the sick , who pray for good exam results and health . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sarcophagus of abu ayyub al-ansari is an important holy site those who come here have the chance to take advantage of the so-called " wishing window " at the entrance to the abu ayyub al-ansari mausoleum .
they can stand in front of it and pray in the hope of having their wish granted . the graveside is decorated with precious carpets and tiles .
the sarcophagus of abu ayyub al-ansari is in a separate room , behind a silver lattice door .
only the hafiz , the koran reciter , is allowed to enter it .

werder bremen were convincingly defeated 3-0 by tottenham hotspur , eliminating them from the competition . schalke booked their place in the final 16 of the champions league with an impressive 3-0 win over french side , olympique lyon .
despite their poor bundesliga form , schalke reversed their fortunes to top their group and progress to the knock-out round with a game in hand .
lyon will also go through to the next round , just one point behind schalke .
schalke took control of the game from kick-off , racing to a 2-0 lead after just 20 minutes .
early pressure from raul and jefferson farfan exposed the french defense , and schalke threatened goal three times in the first five minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer was under a little more pressure in the second half the pressure paid off as farfan scored 14 minutes in , converting a pass from raul and firing home from 11 meters .
six minutes later , klaas-jan huntelaar picked up the ball on the edge of the area and netted schalke 's second goal .
huntelaar added his second goal of the game in an impressive solo effort in the last minutes .
the dutchman was fed a long ball and then held off two lyon defenders before looping the ball over goalkeeper hugo lloris .
the performance was a far cry from their bundesliga season , which sees them at 15th in the league , only having won three of their 13 games .
speaking after the game , schalke coach felix magath said it was " a nice feeling " to be through .
" for weeks we have been written off , but now we will play in the knockout stage , " magath said .
bremen crushed by spurs meanwhile the other german team in action on wednesday night saw themselves on the receiving end of a 3-0 defeat .

plagued by injury , bremen were on the back foot after just six minutes as younes kaboul gave spurs their first goal , volleying in a cross from aaron lennon at close range .
luka modric took the londoners into half time 2-0 up , with a neat dodge around bremen defender sebastian prodl before finding the back of the net .
despite spurs ' gareth bale missing a second-half penalty , peter crouch added a third after 79 minutes .
play-maker lennon set up the goal , getting past his marker to lay the ball back for crouch to finish .
the result sees tottenham through to the final 16 , while bremen were eliminated .
with one match in the group stage to go , 12 clubs are already through to the knock-out round .
spanish clubs valencia , barcelona and real madrid will join premier league clubs manchester united , chelsea and tottenham hotspurs , italian teams inter milan and ac milan , bundesliga sides schalke and bayern munich and french clubs marseille and olympique lyon .

schalke took control of the game from kick-off , racing to a 2-0 lead after just 20 minutes .
early pressure from raul and jefferson farfan exposed the french defense , and schalke threatened goal three times in the first five minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer was under a little more pressure in the second half the pressure paid off as farfan scored 14 minutes in , converting a pass from raul and firing home from 11 meters .
six minutes later , klaas-jan huntelaar picked up the ball on the edge of the area and netted schalke 's second goal .
huntelaar added his second goal of the game in an impressive solo effort in the last minutes .
the dutchman was fed a long ball and then held off two lyon defenders before looping the ball over goalkeeper hugo lloris .
the performance was a far cry from their bundesliga season , which sees them at 15th in the league , only having won three of their 13 games .
speaking after the game , schalke coach felix magath said it was " a nice feeling " to be through .
" for weeks we have been written off , but now we will play in the knockout stage , " magath said .
bremen crushed by spurs meanwhile the other german team in action on wednesday night saw themselves on the receiving end of a 3-0 defeat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tottenham 's younes kaboul -lrb- r . -rrb- opened scoring for spurs werder bremen were already at the bottom of their group table as they travelled away to white hart lane .
plagued by injury , bremen were on the back foot after just six minutes as younes kaboul gave spurs their first goal , volleying in a cross from aaron lennon at close range .
luka modric took the londoners into half time 2-0 up , with a neat dodge around bremen defender sebastian prodl before finding the back of the net .
despite spurs ' gareth bale missing a second-half penalty , peter crouch added a third after 79 minutes .
play-maker lennon set up the goal , getting past his marker to lay the ball back for crouch to finish .
the result sees tottenham through to the final 16 , while bremen were eliminated .
with one match in the group stage to go , 12 clubs are already through to the knock-out round .
spanish clubs valencia , barcelona and real madrid will join premier league clubs manchester united , chelsea and tottenham hotspurs , italian teams inter milan and ac milan , bundesliga sides schalke and bayern munich and french clubs marseille and olympique lyon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 24.11.2010 medvedev warns of stagnation in russian politics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruling party united russia dominates the duma russian president dmitry medvedev is concerned about a lack of political competition , which he said on wednesday , could lead to stagnation .
he has pledged to take measures to improve competition . in his harshest criticism yet of former presidentvladimir putin 's ruling party united russia , president dmitry medvedev warned on wednesday that russian politics faced stagnation because of a lack of competition .
for a full 11 minutes , russian president dmitry medvedev reviewed the state of russian democracy in his video blog , and the general impression was that he was happy with what he saw .
still , he said , the lack of political competition could lead to stagnation , a term usually used to describe the rule of former soviet leader leonid brezhnev , who ruled from 1964 to 1982 .
" it is no secret that at a certain point in our political life symptoms of stagnation began to emerge , " medvedev said in the blog .
" and the danger arose that stability would turn into stagnation .
and such a stagnation is equally damaging for both the ruling party and for opposition forces . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev warned of political stagnation in russia more competition needed medvedev suggested that the current state of events , with the ruling party winning most elections with a landslide , was ultimately harmful to the country and that more competition was sorely needed .
" if the opposition does not stand the slightest chance of winning in an honest battle , it is degraded and becomes marginalized .
but if the ruling party has no chance whatsoever to lose , it simply turns into bronze and ultimately also degrades , like any living organism which does not move , " he said .
united russia , whose leader is prime minister putin , dominates the duma , russia 's lower house of parliament .
it has won virtually every election over the past 10 years , receiving close to 100 percent of the vote in some regions .
in many ways , the party looks like a modern day copy of the communist party of the soviet era .
though support has been dwindling for some time , according to opinion polls , united russia once again emerged as the clear winner in the latest regional elections in october .
but independent observers said the outcome was marred by large-scale fraud .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regional elections were not above board , say observers lip service united russia also dominates television news broadcasts , where opposition parties not represented in parliament have no access whatsoever .
medvedev hardly addressed these concerns , instead devoting most of his time to what he said the government had done to improve the level of democracy in russia , and he clearly did not question whether or not elections held in russia can be called free and fair .
the ruling party , meanwhile , was quick to embrace medvedev 's criticism .
according to one of its leaders , andrei vorobyov , united russia supports the president 's initiatives , even though , he said , it means conditions will be tougher for his party . , " but politics is a struggle , " he said , " and we , as before , are ready to fight for each vote . "
observers in moscow said medvedev 's remarks may be aimed at creating a more liberal image , ahead of presidential and parliamentary elections next year . but neither medvedev nor putin have tipped their hands about which , if any , office they intend to stand for in the 2011 polls .

he has pledged to take measures to improve competition . in his harshest criticism yet of former presidentvladimir putin 's ruling party united russia , president dmitry medvedev warned on wednesday that russian politics faced stagnation because of a lack of competition .
for a full 11 minutes , russian president dmitry medvedev reviewed the state of russian democracy in his video blog , and the general impression was that he was happy with what he saw .
still , he said , the lack of political competition could lead to stagnation , a term usually used to describe the rule of former soviet leader leonid brezhnev , who ruled from 1964 to 1982 .
" it is no secret that at a certain point in our political life symptoms of stagnation began to emerge , " medvedev said in the blog .
" and the danger arose that stability would turn into stagnation .
and such a stagnation is equally damaging for both the ruling party and for opposition forces . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev warned of political stagnation in russia more competition needed medvedev suggested that the current state of events , with the ruling party winning most elections with a landslide , was ultimately harmful to the country and that more competition was sorely needed .
" if the opposition does not stand the slightest chance of winning in an honest battle , it is degraded and becomes marginalized .
but if the ruling party has no chance whatsoever to lose , it simply turns into bronze and ultimately also degrades , like any living organism which does not move , " he said .
united russia , whose leader is prime minister putin , dominates the duma , russia 's lower house of parliament .
it has won virtually every election over the past 10 years , receiving close to 100 percent of the vote in some regions .
in many ways , the party looks like a modern day copy of the communist party of the soviet era .
though support has been dwindling for some time , according to opinion polls , united russia once again emerged as the clear winner in the latest regional elections in october .
but independent observers said the outcome was marred by large-scale fraud .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regional elections were not above board , say observers lip service united russia also dominates television news broadcasts , where opposition parties not represented in parliament have no access whatsoever .
medvedev hardly addressed these concerns , instead devoting most of his time to what he said the government had done to improve the level of democracy in russia , and he clearly did not question whether or not elections held in russia can be called free and fair .
the ruling party , meanwhile , was quick to embrace medvedev 's criticism .
according to one of its leaders , andrei vorobyov , united russia supports the president 's initiatives , even though , he said , it means conditions will be tougher for his party . , " but politics is a struggle , " he said , " and we , as before , are ready to fight for each vote . "
observers in moscow said medvedev 's remarks may be aimed at creating a more liberal image , ahead of presidential and parliamentary elections next year . but neither medvedev nor putin have tipped their hands about which , if any , office they intend to stand for in the 2011 polls .

chancellor merkel was the target of pointed criticism during the annual budget debate in parliament .
but the conservative poltician rebuked the opposition , insisting her government was on the right political course . speaking during the annual debate on the budget , german chancellor angela merkel defended her center-right coalition 's handling of the economy , saying that after 13 months in power the government was on the right course .
" the economy is growing again and the number of unemployed has dropped to below three million , " said merkel .
merkel also reiterated that budget consolidation was her government 's primary task .
she argued that spending cuts came first but government plans for tax cuts had not been forgotten either .
however she declined to provide a specific timeline for lowering taxes .
the draft for the 2011 budget includes new borrowing of 48.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 64.6 billion -rrb- .
in the current 2010 budget year new borrowing of 50 billion euro is expected .
saving for the future countering opposition criticism that she was " skimping on the future " , merkel said that , on the contrary , she was " saving money to invest in the future . "
in an attack on the opposition green party , which is currently riding high in the opinion polls ahead of a number of state elections in 2011 , merkel sharply criticized what she called its " permanent blockade " politics .
the green 's parliamentary leader , renate kuenast , responded by calling the coalition 's social and ecological policies a " declaration of bankruptcy . "
social democrat parliamentary leader , frank-walter steinmeier said the coalition ruled far beyond its capabilities and that it had " squandered " the electorate 's trust .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de ukraine -pipe- 24.11.2010 ukraine demonstrators push for presidential veto on tax rules großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests against the stricter tax rules began last week ukraine 's capital kiev has been the scene of mass demonstrations calling for the president not to sanction a new tax code .
critics say the changes are targeted against smaller firms and could lead to mass unemployment . demonstrations by thousands on behalf of small and medium-sized businesses in ukraine brought traffic to a halt on monday , with demands for a presidential veto of a controversial tax reform bill .
traffic was blocked in the main street of the capital , kyiv , as more than 6,000 demonstrators assembled at the city 's independence square .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko vowed to push for new elections if the laws were not vetoed although a court had declared the demonstration illegal last week , protesters defied the ban with chants of " we wo n't leave , we wo n't leave . "
protests also took place in the cities of lviv and poltava , which , like the kyiv demonstration , were intended to pressure president viktor yanukovych to reject tax reform legislation .
the demonstrations began last week after parliament passed legislation for a hike in company operating fees and tough new tax accounting rules .
at the same time , some standards for larger businesses were relaxed .
the protests took place exactly six years after the orange revolution , which had brought yanukovych 's rivals to power .
the main difference was that now people from all over ukraine and belonging to various political groups gathered to voice their anger .
organizers kept the protest largely free from party politics .
former prime minister speaks out however , one of yanukovych 's political arch-rivals yulia tymoshenko , did join the protests .
tymoshenko , the country 's former prime minister , threatened to press for a referendum on early presidential and parliamentary elections if the president were to sign the new tax bill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics of the changes say they will strip firms of much-needed revenue " for a national referendum we need to collect three million signatures , " tymoshenko told the crowd .
" do you think we can do that ? "
critics say the new bill only favors big business , and that it could lead to mass unemployment , with many firms depending on tax breaks to survive .
one demonstrator told the ukrainian television station 5 kanal that he would keep demonstrating until the demands were met .
" i will stay here till the end , " he said .
" today the future of ukraine is at stake , the future of my children , my grandchildren and great-grandchildren .
it is us or them .
either we are citizens of our country , or just people that can be experimented with . "
softly , softly approach the authorities have reacted cautiously to the protests and an attempt on tuesday to dismantle the tent camp in the center of kyiv failed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovych has said he is willing to make compromises president yanukovich said he was prepared to listen to the demands , but added that the need to remove tax evasion loopholes in the law meant they could not be met fully .
" i understand their demands very well , " yanukovich was reported to have said on monday .
" they will not be satisfied 100 percent . "
ukrainian prime minister mykola azarov has defended the tax code , claiming that it is the most liberal in europe .

the judgment could be a record . a us jury has ordered german business software giant sap to pay its us rival oracle $ 1.3 billion -lrb- 970 million euros -rrb- in damages for copyright infringement .
the award could be the highest-ever in such a case .
according to court documents , the sap subsidiary tomorrownow downloaded and copied millions of oracle 's files by posing as clients .
oracle , which is the world 's second-largest maker of business software , sued sap in 2007 , asking the jury for $ 1.7 billion -lrb- 1.27 billion euros -rrb- in damages .
sap admitted that tomorrownow violated copyright laws by wrongfully downloading maintenance software from oracle 's website to avoid paying license fees .
but it argued that damages should be limited to just 30 million euros -lrb- $ 40 million -rrb- , as it did not profit greatly from the copyright violation .
the company has said it was disappointed by the verdict and might appeal .
the case has attracted additional attention because of the recent appointment of former sap chief leo apotheker as ceo of us computer giant hewlett-packard .
during the trial , oracle accused apotheker of involvement in the operations of tomorrownow .
however , it did not seem to produce any evidence of his knowing about the theft .
apotheker did not testify at the trial .
in after-hours trade , oracle 's share price rose 1.5 percent , while that of sap fell 1.4 percent .

the judgment could be a record . a us jury has ordered german business software giant sap to pay its us rival oracle $ 1.3 billion -lrb- 970 million euros -rrb- in damages for copyright infringement .
the award could be the highest-ever in such a case .
according to court documents , the sap subsidiary tomorrownow downloaded and copied millions of oracle 's files by posing as clients .
oracle , which is the world 's second-largest maker of business software , sued sap in 2007 , asking the jury for $ 1.7 billion -lrb- 1.27 billion euros -rrb- in damages .
sap admitted that tomorrownow violated copyright laws by wrongfully downloading maintenance software from oracle 's website to avoid paying license fees .
but it argued that damages should be limited to just 30 million euros -lrb- $ 40 million -rrb- , as it did not profit greatly from the copyright violation .
the company has said it was disappointed by the verdict and might appeal .
the case has attracted additional attention because of the recent appointment of former sap chief leo apotheker as ceo of us computer giant hewlett-packard .
during the trial , oracle accused apotheker of involvement in the operations of tomorrownow .
however , it did not seem to produce any evidence of his knowing about the theft .
apotheker did not testify at the trial .
in after-hours trade , oracle 's share price rose 1.5 percent , while that of sap fell 1.4 percent .

" as far as our party is concerned , we didn ’ t have much hope , ” she said .
" we took a deliberate decision not to work in alliance with other parties .
the results obviously indicate that our party has to start from scratch to rebuild itself .
and that is what we plan to do .

measures include reducing the minimum wage by one euro , slashing public sector jobs and pay and raising the sales tax from 21 percent to 23 percent in 2014 .

the cuts are necessary to secure a multi-billion-euro international bailout . ireland has set out a four-year plan to save 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- in order to secure an international bailout expected to be in the region of 85 billion euros .
under the national recovery plan , the irish republic aims to bring its budget deficit down from a projected 32 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- to three percent of gdp by 2014 by imposing tax increases , wage cuts and by curbing public spending .
" we can and we will pull through this as we have in the past , " prime minister brian cowen told a news conference in dublin .
" we are a smart , resilient , proud people and we are going to come through this challenge because we love our country . "
finance minister brian lenihan , meanwhile , stressed the urgency of the situation .
" if we do not make these savings , we have no credible way of borrowing money to pay for our social welfare and health and education sectors from the middle of next year , " he said .
optimistic on growth the program is based on an average growth projection of 2.75 percent for the next four years , which some experts say is optimistic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen could have a tough time selling his budget to the opposition " it 's certainly challenging , given the extent of fiscal tightening , which is around 10 percent of gdp , " grant lewis , head of economic research at daiwa capital markets europe told deutsche welle .
" but i think , the eu and the imf will sign up for that , as in the last 15 years , ireland has had a good track record in terms of growth , it 's a flexible economy with a well-educated workforce and good demographics . "
measures include reducing the minimum wage by one euro , slashing public sector jobs and pay and raising the sales tax from 21 percent to 23 percent in 2014 .
under the current tax regime , 45 percent of irish workers do not pay income tax , a situation the government calls " unsustainable " .
the eu 's commissioner for economic and financial affairs , olli rehn , welcomed the program , calling it " a sound basis for the negotiations " on the international bailout .
corporation tax non-negotiable one tax that will not be raised is ireland 's corporation tax - at 12.5 percent the lowest in the european union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banking sector is at the heart of the debt crisis .
" the government remains committed to the 12.5 percent corporation tax rate : it will not be increased under any circumstances , " was the clear message in wednesday 's statement .
it was a magnet for foreign investment during ireland 's boom years , but has been heavily criticized by its european neighbors .
countries like germany say it creates an unfair advantage , especially while ireland is drip-fed by eu bailout funds .
" it 's the heart of ireland 's business model and it 's attracted loads of multinationals .
germany and france as europe 's biggest economies have massive advantages compared to ireland , so its low corporation tax should n't matter so much , " lewis said .
banking sector recovery crucial years of economic growth in ireland , fueled by a property boom and reckless lending practices , turned to bust when the housing market collapsed , exacerbated by the global financial crisis .
ireland is set to take a majority stake of up to 80 percent in top lender bank of ireland that could leave the state with effective control of the country 's top three banks .
allied irish banks could join the anglo-irish bank in being fully nationalized .
lewis believes the irish government may have to do more further down the line .
" the banking sector is the great unknown , it has broken ireland 's back , we 'll have to see how the measures for the banking sector pan out , " lewis told deutsche welle .

a spokesman for the eu 's economic and monetary affairs commissioner , olli rehn , insisted that the euro was a " stable " currency and that its continued existence was not threatened by eurozone debt or banking crises .
he was reacting to a statement by angela merkel , in which the german chancellor said europe was in an " extraordinarily serious situation . "
merkel said germany 's support for ireland was conditional on ireland " making clear what steps -lrb- it -rrb- must take to get back on a path of stabilization . "
merkel added that europe should have the " courage " to set limits on markets by ensuring that private investors bear some of the risk of future eurozone bailouts .
the chancellor said germany would look " positively " on ireland 's request , reportedly worth some 85 billion euros -lrb- 114 billion dollars -rrb- .
future of euro at stake : minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says support for an irish bailout is conditional german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble told the bundestag on tuesday that the future of the euro was " at stake " in the irish crisis .
with its banking system in crisis and its budget deficit forecast to be 10 times the eu limit of three percent of gdp this year , ireland on sunday became the second eurozone member in six months to apply for a bailout after greece .
during wednesday 's parliamentary debate merkel argued in favor of involving private investors to bear some of the risk on government bonds .
merkel reiterated that the european union should set limits on the markets .
the opposition social democrats instead called for more equality on european tax rates .
some eu members states believe that ireland 's low corporate tax rate percent is unfair competition .
with the jury still out on whether germany 's contribution to the greek bailout is compatible with german law , the german constitutional court will be watching how the irish rescue package closely .
in reaction to the irish debt crisis and the portuguese general strike the euro on wednesday sank below 1.33 dollars for the first time in two months .

in a historic effort to save tigers from becoming extinct in the wild , the leaders endorsed plans to double tiger populations within the next 12 years via the global tiger recovery program .
measures include improving scientific monitoring to help restore the species ' habitats and trans-boundary corridors , halting poaching and illegal trade of tigers and tiger products , and creating incentives for local people to protect the animals rather than view them as competitors for land .
strengthening wildlife legislation , and the enforcement of current laws , will also be vital to achieving the ambitious st. petersburg targets , as wildlife rangers are often ill-equipped and underfunded compared to poachers .
wildlife conservation society 's joe walston , who recently took part in a study of the most promising locations for spurring the recovery of tiger populations , told deutsche welle that poachers often belong to " organized commercial " networks that span international borders .
over the last century , tiger numbers have plummeted from about 100,000 to less than 3,500 tigers in the wild today , and conservationists have warned that the animals face extinction by 2022 if nothing is done .
three sub-species of tigers have already disappeared and the fate of another six is at stake , conservationists say .
the last decade alone has seen a decline of almost 40 per cent in tiger numbers and habitat as a result of human-made threats such as habitat loss , illegal wildlife trade , poaching , and human-tiger conflicts .

" we have put the tiger on the agenda of the international community , " putin said at a summary news conference .
an additional $ 350 million is needed over the next five years to pay for the global tiger recovery program , which was initiated two years ago when a world bank employee told bank president zoellick that tigers were about to disappear .
" when you hear that , you 're shocked , " zoellick told the washington post in an interview on tuesday .
thereafter , the tiger became a world bank cause , and now zoellick says the bank will not finance infrastructure in core tiger areas .
it will also try to develop new means of sustainable financing for tiger habitats .
zoellick said the bank hopes to provide $ 100 million in financing to help prevent illegal trade in tiger parts and poaching in nepal , bangladesh , bhutan and possibly india .
financing has also been committed by the world wildlife fund for nature , the us , germany , the wildlife conservation society , and the global environment facility .

now a young german firm aims to join the major league of mining by reactivating abandoned deposits . situated in an office above a music school in heidelberg 's historic city center , the 15 employees of deutsche rohstoff are trying to profit from the rising prices of natural resources .
the company specializes in reactivating defunct sources of oil , gas , gold , silver , high-tech metals like indium or gallium , and rare earth elements .
an exception in a market dominated by large multinational players , deutsche rohstoff has been spending money with essentially no earnings since it was founded in 2006 .
but it has investors ' attention .
a recent sale of 320,000 new shares netted four million euros , with industry giants like the basf chemicals company buying stakes in the business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : titus gebel says there will always be projects larger companies miss " in the long term we want to fill the gap left behind by -lrb- former german mining companies -rrb- preussag and metallgesellschaft , " deutsche rohstoff executive titus gebel told deutsche welle .
" they were globally situated natural resource companies which could hold their own in the first division – or at least in the second division – during the 1980s . "
opportunity from rising prices there was a time when industrialized western countries had significantly more capacity to process their natural resources .
in the 1960s , for instance , germany was europe 's largest producer of oil .
as procurement from africa and asia became cheaper , oil prices dropped and domestic facilities were closed .
gebel , however , believes the rising cost of natural resources will make europe 's own deposits profitable again .
his company is betting on increased demand , which he 's sure is more than a temporary trend .
" because of the economic developments in china and india , the natural resources sector is experiencing what 's called a super-cycle – there will be a boom in the next 20 years . "
europe 's political stability is another factor to be taken into account .
many of the countries which have supplied the global economy with relatively inexpensive natural resources over recent years are politically volatile .
and those that are stable will increasingly choose to keep their resources for domestic production .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as resource prices rise , europe 's political stability will be a valuable asset china , for example , used 8 percent of the world 's demand for metal 16 years ago .
today it uses up to 25 percent .
" representatives from our industry are unified in their opinion , " gebel said .
" if growth in china and also india and brazil continues the way it has been so far , then in the next 25 years we will need to mine as much metal as we have in the combined history of mankind . "
spending without profits investors seem convinced by deutsche rohstoff 's logic .
the company went public in 2010 , and its stock price has risen by 35 percent .
but where are the profits ?
thus far deutsche rohstoff has primarily been investing in identifying investment opportunities and securing the rights to natural resource deposits .
in october it started production at the georgetown gold mine in australia , which is owned by a subsidiary company .
the first batch of gold bars are due to be processed by december and should see the project turn a profit by the end of this year or the next .
rhein petroleum – another affiliated company with oil and gas projects throughout germany – is also expected to generate its first revenues in 2011 , or 2012 at the latest .
when deutsche rohstoff picks a project , it is careful to make sure that production can be started as quickly as possible , according to gebel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche rohstoff picks projects which can be reactivated quickly " we look at deposits which were prospected in the past and calculate out whether modern technology and higher prices make it worthwhile , " he said .
" that way we can drastically shorten the time which customarily exists in mining between prospecting a deposit and beginning production . "
not afraid of big competition the basic idea behind deutsche rohstoff is n't just convincing to individual investors , it seems .
exxon mobile is on board along with glencore , the world 's largest supplier of raw materials , and wintershall , germany 's largest oil and gas trader .
gebel insists he is n't concerned about being squeezed out by from industry giants .
even with their combined forces , there will always be locations licensed for prospecting that major corporations wo n't get around to , he says .
so now small companies are cropping up around the world with plans to mull through archives in search of viable projects which are too small for their enormous counterparts .
one advantage deutsche rohstoff has is good industry contacts and the historic division of germany into a capitalist and communist states .
" it 's very interesting to note that in the area which used to be the former gdr -lrb- german democratic republic -rrb- , the countryside is perforated from where the gdr was searching for uranium and other natural resources , " he said .
" and we can draw on that information today . "
" we 've had access to gdr data .
we knew it existed – but that was n't common knowledge internationally . "

you just have to look closely , he says , reaching into the pile and pulling out a handful .
" there 's a lot of copper in here , " he says , showing it to a visitor .
" but you can see these small silver-colored bits . "
with his index finger he points to small silver splotches , no bigger than the head of a pin .
for 30 years , markowis has recycled precious metals for ami doduco , and for those three decades , he has watched how the manufacturing industry continually puts him and his company to the test .
while silver is found in a variety of industrial and consumer products - refrigerators , ointments and computer keyboards - the concentrations are often so low that it is n't worth the time and effort required to recover the metal .
silver recovery is an expensive process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : material is melted to determine its metal composition in doduco 's recycling area , large furnaces give the place the look of a steel mill .
up to 700 kilos of metal strips can be fed into the furnaces , which are heated to temperatures reaching 1,000 degrees celsius .
the resulting molten metal is then taken to the laboratory , where it is analyzed for precious elements and copper , and their weights are determined .
it is on this basis that doduco charges its clients , who can also choose to take their metal to an independent lab for analysis , if they want .
dirty laundry after the analysis is complete the real recovery work begins .
robert sorber , the product manger for silver powder at doduco , uses a burn-off method or chemical and electrolytic processes to recover the precious metal .
the more the workers processes the worker have to employ to separate the elements , the more expensive it becomes for clients .
sorber compares it to a laundry , where people pay money to get their clothes back clean .
" with us , they get their precious metals back , after they 've paid for the cleaning , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : copper is filtered out of metal plates through an electrolytic process doduco has electrical component production sites in spain , mexico and china , but all precious-metal recovery work is done in germany .
its foreign plants send all of their scrap to the headquarters in pforzheim in southwestern germany , with one important exception : china .
china has long recognized the potential of scrap as an important source of raw materials and does not allow its export .
it stores its scrap for later recycling .
in the past , doduco would only accept scrap that had a silver content of at least five percent , although today , one percent is enough for markowis to fire up his furnaces and start the recovery process .
a global leader in one rectangular basin filled with a bluish liquid , metal plates have been positioned at regular distances from each other and an electric current passes through them .
at their edges , silver crystals are growing .
" when women see this , they usually get pretty excited , " said markowis , looking at his visitor 's face for a second to confirm his observation before continuing .
the plates are lifted out of the liquid once every 20 minutes so the crystals fall off and can be taken out .
if the plates are left alone too long , the crystals would grow until they reached the neighboring plate , which would result in a short circuit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert sorber inspects a container with recovered silver worth about 550,000 euros doduco recycles about 400 tons of silver per year .
its biggest competitor , the allgemeine gold- und silberscheideanstalt , also based in pforzheim , processes about the same amount .
if doduco were a country , it would be the world 's 13th largest silver producer , according to armin nittel , head of the company 's precious-metals recovery unit .
if all german recovery companies were put together , they would jump to fifth place .
nittel thinks there is still room to grow .
he says 60 percent of used silver ends up in garbage dumps .
he wants to lower that number .
a kilo for a ton the high price of silver right now is helping nittel do that .
over the past five years , silver has risen from just over $ 8.00 per ounce to over $ 25.00 .
at the same time , the price increase makes his job harder as well .
manufacturers are continually looking for new ways to use less silver in their products than they do now .
despite that , the silver content of scrap is still higher than in ore , nittel says .
to recover two to three grams of gold or silver , it is necessary to mine about one ton of rock , while one kilo of scrap will yield the same result .
about one-fifth of silver comes from some kind of recovery process ; with gold , the percentage is even higher .
" recycling is an important factor in ensuring that industry has the amount of precious metals it needs , " nittel said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 24.11.2010 ireland bailout reignites fears about the future of the euro großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some irish voters would prefer a lynch to a loan germany has seen a number of its own currencies come and go : the deutschmark , the reichsmark and , before that , the mark .
now some analysts are grumbling that the euro may be on its way out too . this irish rescue package agreed this week – along with the greek bailout earlier in the year - has found the eurozone countries hopelessly divided over the question of how to save the common currency in the long term .
they have good reason to be concerned : the bond markets are n't showing a healthy interest in portugal , another likely bailout candidate .
nor are they particularly impressed with spain , an even bigger economy with a similarly troubling debt load , a high unemployment rate and a stagnating economy .
should these countries also seek relief , the future of the euro could be on the line .
worried in berlin the alarm bells are ringing in berlin .
the german government could end up paying 17 billion euros or more of the expected 90-billion-euro irish rescue package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble is worried about the euro on tuesday , german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble warned lawmakers that the irish debt crisis posed a huge risk .
he said the race to shore up ireland 's banking sector and public finances " puts our common currency at stake . "
the excessive debt levels in greece and now ireland , the minister added , only reinforce germany 's strategy of trimming its budget during a nascent recovery .
but berlin 's austerity strategy has drawn criticism from major partners , including the united states .
so has chancellor angela merkel 's suggestion that , in future euro crises , private bondholders should bear more of the losses .
merkel 's proposal is motivated , in part , by pressure from germany 's constitutional court , which could still declare the government 's participation in european bailouts illegal .
in addition to being promised that the euro would be as stable as the deutschmark , germans were told prior to the deutschmark-euro conversion that there would be a " no bailout clause " that would prevent europe 's richer countries from having to rescue the indigent .
irreconcilable camps with every new day of uncertainty , fears are mounting that the ongoing crisis in europe could lead to the default of individual countries and ultimately the collapse of the eurozone .
a deep divide now runs through the two almost irreconcilable camps : the one led by germany and supported by mainly northern european countries defending a culture of economic and monetary stability ; and the other consisting mostly of southern european countries referred to as piigs – portugal , italy , ireland , greece and spain .
european policymakers are now trying to achieve a consensus between the two camps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the euro still be around in a decade ?
" the europeans have a difficult task , " said friedrich heinemann , a director at the centre for european economic research in mannheim , germany .
" on the one side , they must avoid panics and irrational attacks on solvent governments .
on the other side , they must refrain from establishing a guarantee mechanism , which would smash consolidation incentives . " germany is " aware of both dangers , " heinemann told deutsche welle , and has taken what he calls " a highly responsible position . "
the government , he said , consented to the 750-billion-euro european financial stability facility but insisted on a crisis resolution mechanism that would include creditors in a solution for insolvent countries .
" the latter position may not be popular among highly indebted countries but it is important for the fiscal and political future of europe , " heinemann said .
" euro member countries must remain responsible for their own public finances . "
other analysts agree .
" i think germany is right in wanting to avoid a transfer union , " said marco annunziata , chief economist at unicredit group . there are two possible ways of avoiding this , according to annunziata .
the first , he said , would be to have a true centralization of european fiscal policy – something that would require a greater degree of political union than seems feasible at this stage . the second is to have a framework for sovereign debt restructuring - a credible signal to investors that the next time a eurozone country has difficulties servicing its debt , it will be helped only if at the same time private investors suffer haircuts .
this would make private investors more careful when assessing sovereign risk , and would therefore impose stricter discipline on countries by driving debt spreads wider at the first signs of fiscal indiscipline . " these issues need to be resolved soon , however , " annunziata told deutsche welle .
" otherwise , the risk is that popular support for the eurozone might disintegrate very quickly . " " a more german eurozone " some experts question , though , how big a role germany , europe 's largest economy , should play in stabilizing the eurozone .
turning the eurozone into a larger germany , says philip whyte with the centre for european reform in london , could have adverse consequences - not only for the country itself but also for europe and even the rest of the world .
he maintains that " a more german eurozone " would be afflicted by chronically weak demand , debilitating cycles of competitive wage cuts and prolonged economic slumps in the deficit countries .
like many others , whyte agrees the time has come to make some tough decisions .
" the genius of the european union has been to muddle its way through , " he said .
" i do n't think that muddling is an option this time . "
so should investors unload their euros while they are still worth something ?
expert heinemann is confident the common currency will survive .
" i do n't see the euro breaking apart , " he said .
" or does anybody see the us currency union breaking apart because of the imminent californian bankruptcy ?

now some analysts are grumbling that the euro may be on its way out too . this irish rescue package agreed this week – along with the greek bailout earlier in the year - has found the eurozone countries hopelessly divided over the question of how to save the common currency in the long term .
they have good reason to be concerned : the bond markets are n't showing a healthy interest in portugal , another likely bailout candidate .
nor are they particularly impressed with spain , an even bigger economy with a similarly troubling debt load , a high unemployment rate and a stagnating economy .
should these countries also seek relief , the future of the euro could be on the line .
worried in berlin the alarm bells are ringing in berlin .
the german government could end up paying 17 billion euros or more of the expected 90-billion-euro irish rescue package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble is worried about the euro on tuesday , german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble warned lawmakers that the irish debt crisis posed a huge risk .
he said the race to shore up ireland 's banking sector and public finances " puts our common currency at stake . "
the excessive debt levels in greece and now ireland , the minister added , only reinforce germany 's strategy of trimming its budget during a nascent recovery .
but berlin 's austerity strategy has drawn criticism from major partners , including the united states .
so has chancellor angela merkel 's suggestion that , in future euro crises , private bondholders should bear more of the losses .
merkel 's proposal is motivated , in part , by pressure from germany 's constitutional court , which could still declare the government 's participation in european bailouts illegal .
in addition to being promised that the euro would be as stable as the deutschmark , germans were told prior to the deutschmark-euro conversion that there would be a " no bailout clause " that would prevent europe 's richer countries from having to rescue the indigent .
irreconcilable camps with every new day of uncertainty , fears are mounting that the ongoing crisis in europe could lead to the default of individual countries and ultimately the collapse of the eurozone .
a deep divide now runs through the two almost irreconcilable camps : the one led by germany and supported by mainly northern european countries defending a culture of economic and monetary stability ; and the other consisting mostly of southern european countries referred to as piigs – portugal , italy , ireland , greece and spain .
european policymakers are now trying to achieve a consensus between the two camps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the euro still be around in a decade ?
" the europeans have a difficult task , " said friedrich heinemann , a director at the centre for european economic research in mannheim , germany .
" on the one side , they must avoid panics and irrational attacks on solvent governments .
on the other side , they must refrain from establishing a guarantee mechanism , which would smash consolidation incentives . " germany is " aware of both dangers , " heinemann told deutsche welle , and has taken what he calls " a highly responsible position . "
the government , he said , consented to the 750-billion-euro european financial stability facility but insisted on a crisis resolution mechanism that would include creditors in a solution for insolvent countries .
" the latter position may not be popular among highly indebted countries but it is important for the fiscal and political future of europe , " heinemann said .
" euro member countries must remain responsible for their own public finances . "
other analysts agree .
" i think germany is right in wanting to avoid a transfer union , " said marco annunziata , chief economist at unicredit group . there are two possible ways of avoiding this , according to annunziata .
the first , he said , would be to have a true centralization of european fiscal policy – something that would require a greater degree of political union than seems feasible at this stage . the second is to have a framework for sovereign debt restructuring - a credible signal to investors that the next time a eurozone country has difficulties servicing its debt , it will be helped only if at the same time private investors suffer haircuts .
this would make private investors more careful when assessing sovereign risk , and would therefore impose stricter discipline on countries by driving debt spreads wider at the first signs of fiscal indiscipline . " these issues need to be resolved soon , however , " annunziata told deutsche welle .
" otherwise , the risk is that popular support for the eurozone might disintegrate very quickly . " " a more german eurozone " some experts question , though , how big a role germany , europe 's largest economy , should play in stabilizing the eurozone .
turning the eurozone into a larger germany , says philip whyte with the centre for european reform in london , could have adverse consequences - not only for the country itself but also for europe and even the rest of the world .
he maintains that " a more german eurozone " would be afflicted by chronically weak demand , debilitating cycles of competitive wage cuts and prolonged economic slumps in the deficit countries .
like many others , whyte agrees the time has come to make some tough decisions .
" the genius of the european union has been to muddle its way through , " he said .
" i do n't think that muddling is an option this time . "
so should investors unload their euros while they are still worth something ?
expert heinemann is confident the common currency will survive .
" i do n't see the euro breaking apart , " he said .
" or does anybody see the us currency union breaking apart because of the imminent californian bankruptcy ?

but in the eyup district , a holy site for muslims , life is veiled in centuries of tradition . it is afternoon in eyup .
the call of the muezzin rings out over the square in front of the mosque .
women in colorful headscarves lead their children by the hand as men with prayer beads amble towards the entrance to the mosque . pairs of newlyweds pose for photos in front of the fountain ; the brides ' wedding dresses shimmering in the sunlight .
a young groom exclaims , " we are here to pray to allah for a good marriage ! "
his mother says softly , " god willing , they will always be a happy couple . " a few meters away , a couple proudly presents their five-year-old son .
the boy looks like a little sultan .
he is wearing a shiny white suit with gold edging and a turban-like headpiece .
in a few days he will participate in the " sunnet " - the turkish circumcision ceremony . before this important event , the boy 's parents take him to the eyup sultan mosque .
" you pray before circumcision - that 's the practice laid down by our prophet , " explains the boy 's father . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eyup is a popular place for wedding ceremonies pilgrims and tourists according to theologian and eyup 's cultural affairs coordinator irfan calisan , the district gets many regular visitors .
each year , eyup is visited by up to four million people - one and a half million in the fasting month of ramadan alone .
" on days of particular religious significance , like the festival of sacrifice , we sometimes have 100,000 visitors per day , " said calisan . muslims flock to eyup not only for special occasions or religious events .
there is also an old tradition , dating back over 500 years , of visiting the gravesite of abu ayyub al-ansari - the companion and standard-bearer of the prophet mohammed , believed to have died there in the seventh century .
the gravesite , located in the mosque 's inner courtyard , dates back to the 15th century .
the eyup district owes its name to this famous religious figure . " many mecca pilgrims make a stopover here , " said calisan .
" we call this tradition from the ottoman times ' little hajj . " ' hopes and prayers traditionally , the abu ayyub al-ansari gravesite is also visited by unmarried and childless women , who come to pray for a husband and offspring , as well as by students and the sick , who pray for good exam results and health . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sarcophagus of abu ayyub al-ansari is an important holy site those who come here have the chance to take advantage of the so-called " wishing window " at the entrance to the abu ayyub al-ansari mausoleum .
they can stand in front of it and pray in the hope of having their wish granted . the graveside is decorated with precious carpets and tiles .
the sarcophagus of abu ayyub al-ansari is in a separate room , behind a silver lattice door .
only the hafiz , the koran reciter , is allowed to enter it .
the mufti of eyup , isa gurler , gave deutsche welle the chance to look inside . " as the prophet left mecca and went to medina , he spent seven months in abu ayyub al-ansari 's house , " explained gurler .
" after the prophet 's death , ansari became a leading islamic scholar .
he told the muslims about the deeds and statements of the prophet . " eternal peace after visiting the gravesite , many pilgrims head to the old cemetery behind the mosque to honor the dead .
only very few can be buried there - it is reserved for special dignitaries .
but the spiritual atmosphere of the place puts a spell on everyone present , regardless of why they are there . irfan calisan smiles wisely .

now a young german firm aims to join the major league of mining by reactivating abandoned deposits . situated in an office above a music school in heidelberg 's historic city center , the 15 employees of deutsche rohstoff are trying to profit from the rising prices of natural resources .
the company specializes in reactivating defunct sources of oil , gas , gold , silver , high-tech metals like indium or gallium , and rare earth elements .
an exception in a market dominated by large multinational players , deutsche rohstoff has been spending money with essentially no earnings since it was founded in 2006 .
but it has investors ' attention .
a recent sale of 320,000 new shares netted four million euros , with industry giants like the basf chemicals company buying stakes in the business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : titus gebel says there will always be projects larger companies miss " in the long term we want to fill the gap left behind by -lrb- former german mining companies -rrb- preussag and metallgesellschaft , " deutsche rohstoff executive titus gebel told deutsche welle .
" they were globally situated natural resource companies which could hold their own in the first division – or at least in the second division – during the 1980s . "
opportunity from rising prices there was a time when industrialized western countries had significantly more capacity to process their natural resources .
in the 1960s , for instance , germany was europe 's largest producer of oil .
as procurement from africa and asia became cheaper , oil prices dropped and domestic facilities were closed .
gebel , however , believes the rising cost of natural resources will make europe 's own deposits profitable again .
his company is betting on increased demand , which he 's sure is more than a temporary trend .
" because of the economic developments in china and india , the natural resources sector is experiencing what 's called a super-cycle – there will be a boom in the next 20 years . "
europe 's political stability is another factor to be taken into account .
many of the countries which have supplied the global economy with relatively inexpensive natural resources over recent years are politically volatile .
and those that are stable will increasingly choose to keep their resources for domestic production .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as resource prices rise , europe 's political stability will be a valuable asset china , for example , used 8 percent of the world 's demand for metal 16 years ago .
today it uses up to 25 percent .
" representatives from our industry are unified in their opinion , " gebel said .
" if growth in china and also india and brazil continues the way it has been so far , then in the next 25 years we will need to mine as much metal as we have in the combined history of mankind . "
spending without profits investors seem convinced by deutsche rohstoff 's logic .
the company went public in 2010 , and its stock price has risen by 35 percent .
but where are the profits ?
thus far deutsche rohstoff has primarily been investing in identifying investment opportunities and securing the rights to natural resource deposits .
in october it started production at the georgetown gold mine in australia , which is owned by a subsidiary company .
the first batch of gold bars are due to be processed by december and should see the project turn a profit by the end of this year or the next .
rhein petroleum – another affiliated company with oil and gas projects throughout germany – is also expected to generate its first revenues in 2011 , or 2012 at the latest .
when deutsche rohstoff picks a project , it is careful to make sure that production can be started as quickly as possible , according to gebel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche rohstoff picks projects which can be reactivated quickly " we look at deposits which were prospected in the past and calculate out whether modern technology and higher prices make it worthwhile , " he said .
" that way we can drastically shorten the time which customarily exists in mining between prospecting a deposit and beginning production . "
not afraid of big competition the basic idea behind deutsche rohstoff is n't just convincing to individual investors , it seems .
exxon mobile is on board along with glencore , the world 's largest supplier of raw materials , and wintershall , germany 's largest oil and gas trader .
gebel insists he is n't concerned about being squeezed out by from industry giants .
even with their combined forces , there will always be locations licensed for prospecting that major corporations wo n't get around to , he says .
so now small companies are cropping up around the world with plans to mull through archives in search of viable projects which are too small for their enormous counterparts .
one advantage deutsche rohstoff has is good industry contacts and the historic division of germany into a capitalist and communist states .
" it 's very interesting to note that in the area which used to be the former gdr -lrb- german democratic republic -rrb- , the countryside is perforated from where the gdr was searching for uranium and other natural resources , " he said .
" and we can draw on that information today . "
" we 've had access to gdr data .
we knew it existed – but that was n't common knowledge internationally . "

werder bremen were convincingly defeated 3-0 by tottenham hotspur , eliminating them from the competition . schalke booked their place in the final 16 of the champions league with an impressive 3-0 win over french side , olympique lyon .
despite their poor bundesliga form , schalke reversed their fortunes to top their group and progress to the knock-out round with a game in hand .
lyon will also go through to the next round , just one point behind schalke .
schalke took control of the game from kick-off , racing to a 2-0 lead after just 20 minutes .
early pressure from raul and jefferson farfan exposed the french defense , and schalke threatened goal three times in the first five minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer was under a little more pressure in the second half the pressure paid off as farfan scored 14 minutes in , converting a pass from raul and firing home from 11 meters .
six minutes later , klaas-jan huntelaar picked up the ball on the edge of the area and netted schalke 's second goal .
huntelaar added his second goal of the game in an impressive solo effort in the last minutes .
the dutchman was fed a long ball and then held off two lyon defenders before looping the ball over goalkeeper hugo lloris .
the performance was a far cry from their bundesliga season , which sees them at 15th in the league , only having won three of their 13 games .
speaking after the game , schalke coach felix magath said it was " a nice feeling " to be through .
" for weeks we have been written off , but now we will play in the knockout stage , " magath said .
bremen crushed by spurs meanwhile the other german team in action on wednesday night saw themselves on the receiving end of a 3-0 defeat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tottenham 's younes kaboul -lrb- r . -rrb- opened scoring for spurs werder bremen were already at the bottom of their group table as they travelled away to white hart lane .
plagued by injury , bremen were on the back foot after just six minutes as younes kaboul gave spurs their first goal , volleying in a cross from aaron lennon at close range .
luka modric took the londoners into half time 2-0 up , with a neat dodge around bremen defender sebastian prodl before finding the back of the net .
despite spurs ' gareth bale missing a second-half penalty , peter crouch added a third after 79 minutes .
play-maker lennon set up the goal , getting past his marker to lay the ball back for crouch to finish .
the result sees tottenham through to the final 16 , while bremen were eliminated .
with one match in the group stage to go , 12 clubs are already through to the knock-out round .
spanish clubs valencia , barcelona and real madrid will join premier league clubs manchester united , chelsea and tottenham hotspurs , italian teams inter milan and ac milan , bundesliga sides schalke and bayern munich and french clubs marseille and olympique lyon .

analysts say beijing 's influence is not absolute . china is separated from north korea by the yalu river near the northern chinese city of dandong .
however , this river has proven to be less a barrier than a link between the two countries . the bridge over the river has seen goods worth more than one billion us dollars pass over it since the last six months .
north korea has been dependent on china for basic supplies and oil for decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yalu river at dandong separates china from north korea the two countries signed a friendship treaty in 1961 and pyongyang has had beijing 's tacit support ever since .
north korean leader kim jong-il has already visited china twice this year . earlier this year , china used its veto in the united nations security council against an international bid to enforce stronger sanctions against north korea . china 's influence should not be overestimated however , niu jun from the school of international studies at peking university says that although " china has more influence on north korea than any other country , this influence is not absolute . " british north korea expert jasper becker agrees : " kim jong-il does n't trust the chinese .
they are not involved in his inner circle or his decision-making process .
they are excluded from it and he ’ s definitely opposed to the chinese way . " bildunterschrift : china is worried that there will be a deluge of refugees if north korea collapses however , china is worried that a war or the collapse of the north korean regime will lead to a deluge of refugees from across the border .
" we will do our utmost to prevent that , " says shi yinhong from peking university . korean unification is also not an option for china .
if the border between the two divided countries were to fall , us troops would practically be on the chinese border .
this is why beijing is intent on maintaining the status quo , even if beijing has little sympathy for kim jong-il and his family . beijing has refused to condemn north korea for tuesday ’ s artillery attacks but it did urge both sides to show " calm and restraint " and to sit down for talks as soon as possible . japan calls on beijing to restrain pyongyang north korea 's neighbor japan also tried to ease the tension , with prime minister naoto kan calling on china to work with other partners and restrain pyongyang . in a telephone conversation with south korean president lee myung bak , kan underlined his country 's strong ties with washington and seoul . meanwhile , president lee myung bak was criticized at home for his " slow " response to the crisis with south korean defense minister kim tae yung being grilled by parliamentarians over intelligence glitches regarding information about the attack and his inadequate response to north korea ’ s artillery firing . kim said that north korea ’ s attempts to demonstrate its might were just a means for the upcoming leader kim jong-un to show off his status as a strong leader . author : manasi gopalakrishnan editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for 30 years , markowis has recycled precious metals for ami doduco , and for those three decades , he has watched how the manufacturing industry continually puts him and his company to the test .
while silver is found in a variety of industrial and consumer products - refrigerators , ointments and computer keyboards - the concentrations are often so low that it is n't worth the time and effort required to recover the metal .
silver recovery is an expensive process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : material is melted to determine its metal composition in doduco 's recycling area , large furnaces give the place the look of a steel mill .
up to 700 kilos of metal strips can be fed into the furnaces , which are heated to temperatures reaching 1,000 degrees celsius .
the resulting molten metal is then taken to the laboratory , where it is analyzed for precious elements and copper , and their weights are determined .
it is on this basis that doduco charges its clients , who can also choose to take their metal to an independent lab for analysis , if they want .
dirty laundry after the analysis is complete the real recovery work begins .
robert sorber , the product manger for silver powder at doduco , uses a burn-off method or chemical and electrolytic processes to recover the precious metal .
the more the workers processes the worker have to employ to separate the elements , the more expensive it becomes for clients .
sorber compares it to a laundry , where people pay money to get their clothes back clean .
" with us , they get their precious metals back , after they 've paid for the cleaning , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : copper is filtered out of metal plates through an electrolytic process doduco has electrical component production sites in spain , mexico and china , but all precious-metal recovery work is done in germany .
its foreign plants send all of their scrap to the headquarters in pforzheim in southwestern germany , with one important exception : china .
china has long recognized the potential of scrap as an important source of raw materials and does not allow its export .
it stores its scrap for later recycling .
in the past , doduco would only accept scrap that had a silver content of at least five percent , although today , one percent is enough for markowis to fire up his furnaces and start the recovery process .
a global leader in one rectangular basin filled with a bluish liquid , metal plates have been positioned at regular distances from each other and an electric current passes through them .
at their edges , silver crystals are growing .
" when women see this , they usually get pretty excited , " said markowis , looking at his visitor 's face for a second to confirm his observation before continuing .
the plates are lifted out of the liquid once every 20 minutes so the crystals fall off and can be taken out .
if the plates are left alone too long , the crystals would grow until they reached the neighboring plate , which would result in a short circuit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert sorber inspects a container with recovered silver worth about 550,000 euros doduco recycles about 400 tons of silver per year .
its biggest competitor , the allgemeine gold- und silberscheideanstalt , also based in pforzheim , processes about the same amount .
if doduco were a country , it would be the world 's 13th largest silver producer , according to armin nittel , head of the company 's precious-metals recovery unit .
if all german recovery companies were put together , they would jump to fifth place .
nittel thinks there is still room to grow .
he says 60 percent of used silver ends up in garbage dumps .
he wants to lower that number .
a kilo for a ton the high price of silver right now is helping nittel do that .
over the past five years , silver has risen from just over $ 8.00 per ounce to over $ 25.00 .
at the same time , the price increase makes his job harder as well .
manufacturers are continually looking for new ways to use less silver in their products than they do now .
despite that , the silver content of scrap is still higher than in ore , nittel says .
to recover two to three grams of gold or silver , it is necessary to mine about one ton of rock , while one kilo of scrap will yield the same result .
about one-fifth of silver comes from some kind of recovery process ; with gold , the percentage is even higher .
" recycling is an important factor in ensuring that industry has the amount of precious metals it needs , " nittel said .

analysts say beijing 's influence is not absolute . china is separated from north korea by the yalu river near the northern chinese city of dandong .
however , this river has proven to be less a barrier than a link between the two countries . the bridge over the river has seen goods worth more than one billion us dollars pass over it since the last six months .
north korea has been dependent on china for basic supplies and oil for decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yalu river at dandong separates china from north korea the two countries signed a friendship treaty in 1961 and pyongyang has had beijing 's tacit support ever since .
north korean leader kim jong-il has already visited china twice this year . earlier this year , china used its veto in the united nations security council against an international bid to enforce stronger sanctions against north korea . china 's influence should not be overestimated however , niu jun from the school of international studies at peking university says that although " china has more influence on north korea than any other country , this influence is not absolute . " british north korea expert jasper becker agrees : " kim jong-il does n't trust the chinese .
they are not involved in his inner circle or his decision-making process .
they are excluded from it and he ’ s definitely opposed to the chinese way . " bildunterschrift : china is worried that there will be a deluge of refugees if north korea collapses however , china is worried that a war or the collapse of the north korean regime will lead to a deluge of refugees from across the border .
" we will do our utmost to prevent that , " says shi yinhong from peking university . korean unification is also not an option for china .
if the border between the two divided countries were to fall , us troops would practically be on the chinese border .
this is why beijing is intent on maintaining the status quo , even if beijing has little sympathy for kim jong-il and his family . beijing has refused to condemn north korea for tuesday ’ s artillery attacks but it did urge both sides to show " calm and restraint " and to sit down for talks as soon as possible . japan calls on beijing to restrain pyongyang north korea 's neighbor japan also tried to ease the tension , with prime minister naoto kan calling on china to work with other partners and restrain pyongyang . in a telephone conversation with south korean president lee myung bak , kan underlined his country 's strong ties with washington and seoul . meanwhile , president lee myung bak was criticized at home for his " slow " response to the crisis with south korean defense minister kim tae yung being grilled by parliamentarians over intelligence glitches regarding information about the attack and his inadequate response to north korea ’ s artillery firing . kim said that north korea ’ s attempts to demonstrate its might were just a means for the upcoming leader kim jong-un to show off his status as a strong leader . author : manasi gopalakrishnan editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they have good reason to be concerned : the bond markets are n't showing a healthy interest in portugal , another likely bailout candidate .

should these countries also seek relief , the future of the euro could be on the line .
worried in berlin the alarm bells are ringing in berlin .
the german government could end up paying 17 billion euros or more of the expected 90-billion-euro irish rescue package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble is worried about the euro on tuesday , german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble warned lawmakers that the irish debt crisis posed a huge risk .

irreconcilable camps with every new day of uncertainty , fears are mounting that the ongoing crisis in europe could lead to the default of individual countries and ultimately the collapse of the eurozone .
a deep divide now runs through the two almost irreconcilable camps : the one led by germany and supported by mainly northern european countries defending a culture of economic and monetary stability ; and the other consisting mostly of southern european countries referred to as piigs – portugal , italy , ireland , greece and spain .
european policymakers are now trying to achieve a consensus between the two camps .

" the europeans have a difficult task , " said friedrich heinemann , a director at the centre for european economic research in mannheim , germany .
" on the one side , they must avoid panics and irrational attacks on solvent governments .
on the other side , they must refrain from establishing a guarantee mechanism , which would smash consolidation incentives . " germany is " aware of both dangers , " heinemann told deutsche welle , and has taken what he calls " a highly responsible position . "
the government , he said , consented to the 750-billion-euro european financial stability facility but insisted on a crisis resolution mechanism that would include creditors in a solution for insolvent countries .
" the latter position may not be popular among highly indebted countries but it is important for the fiscal and political future of europe , " heinemann said .
" euro member countries must remain responsible for their own public finances . "
other analysts agree .
" i think germany is right in wanting to avoid a transfer union , " said marco annunziata , chief economist at unicredit group . there are two possible ways of avoiding this , according to annunziata .
the first , he said , would be to have a true centralization of european fiscal policy – something that would require a greater degree of political union than seems feasible at this stage . the second is to have a framework for sovereign debt restructuring - a credible signal to investors that the next time a eurozone country has difficulties servicing its debt , it will be helped only if at the same time private investors suffer haircuts .
this would make private investors more careful when assessing sovereign risk , and would therefore impose stricter discipline on countries by driving debt spreads wider at the first signs of fiscal indiscipline . " these issues need to be resolved soon , however , " annunziata told deutsche welle .
" otherwise , the risk is that popular support for the eurozone might disintegrate very quickly . " " a more german eurozone " some experts question , though , how big a role germany , europe 's largest economy , should play in stabilizing the eurozone .

he maintains that " a more german eurozone " would be afflicted by chronically weak demand , debilitating cycles of competitive wage cuts and prolonged economic slumps in the deficit countries .
like many others , whyte agrees the time has come to make some tough decisions .
" the genius of the european union has been to muddle its way through , " he said .
" i do n't think that muddling is an option this time . "

as raw materials become scarcer , the economic importance of metal recycling is set to increase . the tangled mass of thin metal strips in a waist-high cardboard box has value , allegedly , even though they look like film that has been unspooled and tossed carelessly in a pile .
but bernhard markowis sees money here .
you just have to look closely , he says , reaching into the pile and pulling out a handful .
" there 's a lot of copper in here , " he says , showing it to a visitor .
" but you can see these small silver-colored bits . "
with his index finger he points to small silver splotches , no bigger than the head of a pin .
for 30 years , markowis has recycled precious metals for ami doduco , and for those three decades , he has watched how the manufacturing industry continually puts him and his company to the test .
while silver is found in a variety of industrial and consumer products - refrigerators , ointments and computer keyboards - the concentrations are often so low that it is n't worth the time and effort required to recover the metal .

it is on this basis that doduco charges its clients , who can also choose to take their metal to an independent lab for analysis , if they want .
dirty laundry after the analysis is complete the real recovery work begins .
robert sorber , the product manger for silver powder at doduco , uses a burn-off method or chemical and electrolytic processes to recover the precious metal .
the more the workers processes the worker have to employ to separate the elements , the more expensive it becomes for clients .
sorber compares it to a laundry , where people pay money to get their clothes back clean .
" with us , they get their precious metals back , after they 've paid for the cleaning , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : copper is filtered out of metal plates through an electrolytic process doduco has electrical component production sites in spain , mexico and china , but all precious-metal recovery work is done in germany .
its foreign plants send all of their scrap to the headquarters in pforzheim in southwestern germany , with one important exception : china .
china has long recognized the potential of scrap as an important source of raw materials and does not allow its export .
it stores its scrap for later recycling .
in the past , doduco would only accept scrap that had a silver content of at least five percent , although today , one percent is enough for markowis to fire up his furnaces and start the recovery process .
a global leader in one rectangular basin filled with a bluish liquid , metal plates have been positioned at regular distances from each other and an electric current passes through them .
at their edges , silver crystals are growing .
" when women see this , they usually get pretty excited , " said markowis , looking at his visitor 's face for a second to confirm his observation before continuing .
the plates are lifted out of the liquid once every 20 minutes so the crystals fall off and can be taken out .
if the plates are left alone too long , the crystals would grow until they reached the neighboring plate , which would result in a short circuit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert sorber inspects a container with recovered silver worth about 550,000 euros doduco recycles about 400 tons of silver per year .
its biggest competitor , the allgemeine gold- und silberscheideanstalt , also based in pforzheim , processes about the same amount .
if doduco were a country , it would be the world 's 13th largest silver producer , according to armin nittel , head of the company 's precious-metals recovery unit .
if all german recovery companies were put together , they would jump to fifth place .
nittel thinks there is still room to grow .
he says 60 percent of used silver ends up in garbage dumps .
he wants to lower that number .
a kilo for a ton the high price of silver right now is helping nittel do that .
over the past five years , silver has risen from just over $ 8.00 per ounce to over $ 25.00 .
at the same time , the price increase makes his job harder as well .
manufacturers are continually looking for new ways to use less silver in their products than they do now .
despite that , the silver content of scrap is still higher than in ore , nittel says .
to recover two to three grams of gold or silver , it is necessary to mine about one ton of rock , while one kilo of scrap will yield the same result .
about one-fifth of silver comes from some kind of recovery process ; with gold , the percentage is even higher .
" recycling is an important factor in ensuring that industry has the amount of precious metals it needs , " nittel said .

merkel also reiterated that budget consolidation was her government 's primary task .
she argued that spending cuts came first but government plans for tax cuts had not been forgotten either .

the draft for the 2011 budget includes new borrowing of 48.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 64.6 billion -rrb- .
in the current 2010 budget year new borrowing of 50 billion euro is expected .
saving for the future countering opposition criticism that she was " skimping on the future " , merkel said that , on the contrary , she was " saving money to invest in the future . "
in an attack on the opposition green party , which is currently riding high in the opinion polls ahead of a number of state elections in 2011 , merkel sharply criticized what she called its " permanent blockade " politics .
the green 's parliamentary leader , renate kuenast , responded by calling the coalition 's social and ecological policies a " declaration of bankruptcy . "
social democrat parliamentary leader , frank-walter steinmeier said the coalition ruled far beyond its capabilities and that it had " squandered " the electorate 's trust .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 24.11.2010 ireland bailout reignites fears about the future of the euro großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some irish voters would prefer a lynch to a loan germany has seen a number of its own currencies come and go : the deutschmark , the reichsmark and , before that , the mark .
now some analysts are grumbling that the euro may be on its way out too . this irish rescue package agreed this week – along with the greek bailout earlier in the year - has found the eurozone countries hopelessly divided over the question of how to save the common currency in the long term .
they have good reason to be concerned : the bond markets are n't showing a healthy interest in portugal , another likely bailout candidate .
nor are they particularly impressed with spain , an even bigger economy with a similarly troubling debt load , a high unemployment rate and a stagnating economy .
should these countries also seek relief , the future of the euro could be on the line .
worried in berlin the alarm bells are ringing in berlin .
the german government could end up paying 17 billion euros or more of the expected 90-billion-euro irish rescue package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble is worried about the euro on tuesday , german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble warned lawmakers that the irish debt crisis posed a huge risk .
he said the race to shore up ireland 's banking sector and public finances " puts our common currency at stake . "
the excessive debt levels in greece and now ireland , the minister added , only reinforce germany 's strategy of trimming its budget during a nascent recovery .
but berlin 's austerity strategy has drawn criticism from major partners , including the united states .
so has chancellor angela merkel 's suggestion that , in future euro crises , private bondholders should bear more of the losses .
merkel 's proposal is motivated , in part , by pressure from germany 's constitutional court , which could still declare the government 's participation in european bailouts illegal .
in addition to being promised that the euro would be as stable as the deutschmark , germans were told prior to the deutschmark-euro conversion that there would be a " no bailout clause " that would prevent europe 's richer countries from having to rescue the indigent .
irreconcilable camps with every new day of uncertainty , fears are mounting that the ongoing crisis in europe could lead to the default of individual countries and ultimately the collapse of the eurozone .
a deep divide now runs through the two almost irreconcilable camps : the one led by germany and supported by mainly northern european countries defending a culture of economic and monetary stability ; and the other consisting mostly of southern european countries referred to as piigs – portugal , italy , ireland , greece and spain .
european policymakers are now trying to achieve a consensus between the two camps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the euro still be around in a decade ?
" the europeans have a difficult task , " said friedrich heinemann , a director at the centre for european economic research in mannheim , germany .
" on the one side , they must avoid panics and irrational attacks on solvent governments .
on the other side , they must refrain from establishing a guarantee mechanism , which would smash consolidation incentives . " germany is " aware of both dangers , " heinemann told deutsche welle , and has taken what he calls " a highly responsible position . "
the government , he said , consented to the 750-billion-euro european financial stability facility but insisted on a crisis resolution mechanism that would include creditors in a solution for insolvent countries .
" the latter position may not be popular among highly indebted countries but it is important for the fiscal and political future of europe , " heinemann said .
" euro member countries must remain responsible for their own public finances . "
other analysts agree .
" i think germany is right in wanting to avoid a transfer union , " said marco annunziata , chief economist at unicredit group . there are two possible ways of avoiding this , according to annunziata .
the first , he said , would be to have a true centralization of european fiscal policy – something that would require a greater degree of political union than seems feasible at this stage . the second is to have a framework for sovereign debt restructuring - a credible signal to investors that the next time a eurozone country has difficulties servicing its debt , it will be helped only if at the same time private investors suffer haircuts .
this would make private investors more careful when assessing sovereign risk , and would therefore impose stricter discipline on countries by driving debt spreads wider at the first signs of fiscal indiscipline . " these issues need to be resolved soon , however , " annunziata told deutsche welle .
" otherwise , the risk is that popular support for the eurozone might disintegrate very quickly . " " a more german eurozone " some experts question , though , how big a role germany , europe 's largest economy , should play in stabilizing the eurozone .
turning the eurozone into a larger germany , says philip whyte with the centre for european reform in london , could have adverse consequences - not only for the country itself but also for europe and even the rest of the world .
he maintains that " a more german eurozone " would be afflicted by chronically weak demand , debilitating cycles of competitive wage cuts and prolonged economic slumps in the deficit countries .
like many others , whyte agrees the time has come to make some tough decisions .
" the genius of the european union has been to muddle its way through , " he said .
" i do n't think that muddling is an option this time . "
so should investors unload their euros while they are still worth something ?
expert heinemann is confident the common currency will survive .
" i do n't see the euro breaking apart , " he said .
" or does anybody see the us currency union breaking apart because of the imminent californian bankruptcy ?

analysts say beijing 's influence is not absolute . china is separated from north korea by the yalu river near the northern chinese city of dandong .
however , this river has proven to be less a barrier than a link between the two countries . the bridge over the river has seen goods worth more than one billion us dollars pass over it since the last six months .
north korea has been dependent on china for basic supplies and oil for decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yalu river at dandong separates china from north korea the two countries signed a friendship treaty in 1961 and pyongyang has had beijing 's tacit support ever since .
north korean leader kim jong-il has already visited china twice this year . earlier this year , china used its veto in the united nations security council against an international bid to enforce stronger sanctions against north korea . china 's influence should not be overestimated however , niu jun from the school of international studies at peking university says that although " china has more influence on north korea than any other country , this influence is not absolute . " british north korea expert jasper becker agrees : " kim jong-il does n't trust the chinese .
they are not involved in his inner circle or his decision-making process .
they are excluded from it and he ’ s definitely opposed to the chinese way . " bildunterschrift : china is worried that there will be a deluge of refugees if north korea collapses however , china is worried that a war or the collapse of the north korean regime will lead to a deluge of refugees from across the border .
" we will do our utmost to prevent that , " says shi yinhong from peking university . korean unification is also not an option for china .
if the border between the two divided countries were to fall , us troops would practically be on the chinese border .
this is why beijing is intent on maintaining the status quo , even if beijing has little sympathy for kim jong-il and his family . beijing has refused to condemn north korea for tuesday ’ s artillery attacks but it did urge both sides to show " calm and restraint " and to sit down for talks as soon as possible . japan calls on beijing to restrain pyongyang north korea 's neighbor japan also tried to ease the tension , with prime minister naoto kan calling on china to work with other partners and restrain pyongyang . in a telephone conversation with south korean president lee myung bak , kan underlined his country 's strong ties with washington and seoul . meanwhile , president lee myung bak was criticized at home for his " slow " response to the crisis with south korean defense minister kim tae yung being grilled by parliamentarians over intelligence glitches regarding information about the attack and his inadequate response to north korea ’ s artillery firing . kim said that north korea ’ s attempts to demonstrate its might were just a means for the upcoming leader kim jong-un to show off his status as a strong leader . author : manasi gopalakrishnan editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" on days of particular religious significance , like the festival of sacrifice , we sometimes have 100,000 visitors per day , " said calisan . muslims flock to eyup not only for special occasions or religious events .
there is also an old tradition , dating back over 500 years , of visiting the gravesite of abu ayyub al-ansari - the companion and standard-bearer of the prophet mohammed , believed to have died there in the seventh century .
the gravesite , located in the mosque 's inner courtyard , dates back to the 15th century .

they can stand in front of it and pray in the hope of having their wish granted . the graveside is decorated with precious carpets and tiles .
the sarcophagus of abu ayyub al-ansari is in a separate room , behind a silver lattice door .
only the hafiz , the koran reciter , is allowed to enter it .
the mufti of eyup , isa gurler , gave deutsche welle the chance to look inside . " as the prophet left mecca and went to medina , he spent seven months in abu ayyub al-ansari 's house , " explained gurler .

the cuts are necessary to secure a multi-billion-euro international bailout . ireland has set out a four-year plan to save 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- in order to secure an international bailout expected to be in the region of 85 billion euros .
under the national recovery plan , the irish republic aims to bring its budget deficit down from a projected 32 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- to three percent of gdp by 2014 by imposing tax increases , wage cuts and by curbing public spending .
" we can and we will pull through this as we have in the past , " prime minister brian cowen told a news conference in dublin .
" we are a smart , resilient , proud people and we are going to come through this challenge because we love our country . "
finance minister brian lenihan , meanwhile , stressed the urgency of the situation .
" if we do not make these savings , we have no credible way of borrowing money to pay for our social welfare and health and education sectors from the middle of next year , " he said .
optimistic on growth the program is based on an average growth projection of 2.75 percent for the next four years , which some experts say is optimistic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen could have a tough time selling his budget to the opposition " it 's certainly challenging , given the extent of fiscal tightening , which is around 10 percent of gdp , " grant lewis , head of economic research at daiwa capital markets europe told deutsche welle .
" but i think , the eu and the imf will sign up for that , as in the last 15 years , ireland has had a good track record in terms of growth , it 's a flexible economy with a well-educated workforce and good demographics . "
measures include reducing the minimum wage by one euro , slashing public sector jobs and pay and raising the sales tax from 21 percent to 23 percent in 2014 .
under the current tax regime , 45 percent of irish workers do not pay income tax , a situation the government calls " unsustainable " .
the eu 's commissioner for economic and financial affairs , olli rehn , welcomed the program , calling it " a sound basis for the negotiations " on the international bailout .
corporation tax non-negotiable one tax that will not be raised is ireland 's corporation tax - at 12.5 percent the lowest in the european union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banking sector is at the heart of the debt crisis .
" the government remains committed to the 12.5 percent corporation tax rate : it will not be increased under any circumstances , " was the clear message in wednesday 's statement .
it was a magnet for foreign investment during ireland 's boom years , but has been heavily criticized by its european neighbors .
countries like germany say it creates an unfair advantage , especially while ireland is drip-fed by eu bailout funds .
" it 's the heart of ireland 's business model and it 's attracted loads of multinationals .
germany and france as europe 's biggest economies have massive advantages compared to ireland , so its low corporation tax should n't matter so much , " lewis said .
banking sector recovery crucial years of economic growth in ireland , fueled by a property boom and reckless lending practices , turned to bust when the housing market collapsed , exacerbated by the global financial crisis .
ireland is set to take a majority stake of up to 80 percent in top lender bank of ireland that could leave the state with effective control of the country 's top three banks .
allied irish banks could join the anglo-irish bank in being fully nationalized .
lewis believes the irish government may have to do more further down the line .
" the banking sector is the great unknown , it has broken ireland 's back , we 'll have to see how the measures for the banking sector pan out , " lewis told deutsche welle .

huntelaar added his second goal of the game in an impressive solo effort in the last minutes .
the dutchman was fed a long ball and then held off two lyon defenders before looping the ball over goalkeeper hugo lloris .
the performance was a far cry from their bundesliga season , which sees them at 15th in the league , only having won three of their 13 games .
speaking after the game , schalke coach felix magath said it was " a nice feeling " to be through .
" for weeks we have been written off , but now we will play in the knockout stage , " magath said .

luka modric took the londoners into half time 2-0 up , with a neat dodge around bremen defender sebastian prodl before finding the back of the net .
despite spurs ' gareth bale missing a second-half penalty , peter crouch added a third after 79 minutes .
play-maker lennon set up the goal , getting past his marker to lay the ball back for crouch to finish .

the plans have raised the ire of workers , who went on general strike in protest . public sector workers across portugal went on strike on wednesday , disrupting transport and other services including healthcare .
the day-long strike was called by the country 's two biggest unions in protest at the government 's planned austerity measures .
three-quarters of train services and 60 percent of bus services were cancelled , while no flights took off or landed at any airport .
it was the first joint general strike held by the unions since 1988 .
together , they represent around 1.5 million workers .
the head of the main ugt union , joao proenca said , " it is the biggest strike ever staged . "
making the cuts the socialist government wants to implement the austerity program in a bid to cut a high national level of debt .
prime minister jose socrates has vowed to stick by his course of wage cuts and tax hikes , hoping to quash speculation that portugal will be the next european country to need a bailout after ireland and greece .
commenting during the strike , labor minister helena andre said without the austerity measures , " the consequences for the portuguese and the economy will be a great deal worse . "
the government 's austerity budget is due to be finally approved by parliament this week .
the measures include cutting public sector wages by five percent , freezing pensions and raising value added tax from 21 to 23 percent .
portugal has gone through many years of continuous low growth .
its unemployment rate stands at 10.9 percent - the highest since the 1980s - and it could rise further .
even though the economy has shown some growth this year , economists fear that higher taxes and wage cuts could cause a relapse into recession in 2011 as consumer spending falls .

a spokesman for the eu 's economic and monetary affairs commissioner , olli rehn , insisted that the euro was a " stable " currency and that its continued existence was not threatened by eurozone debt or banking crises .
he was reacting to a statement by angela merkel , in which the german chancellor said europe was in an " extraordinarily serious situation . "
merkel said germany 's support for ireland was conditional on ireland " making clear what steps -lrb- it -rrb- must take to get back on a path of stabilization . "
merkel added that europe should have the " courage " to set limits on markets by ensuring that private investors bear some of the risk of future eurozone bailouts .
the chancellor said germany would look " positively " on ireland 's request , reportedly worth some 85 billion euros -lrb- 114 billion dollars -rrb- .
future of euro at stake : minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says support for an irish bailout is conditional german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble told the bundestag on tuesday that the future of the euro was " at stake " in the irish crisis .
with its banking system in crisis and its budget deficit forecast to be 10 times the eu limit of three percent of gdp this year , ireland on sunday became the second eurozone member in six months to apply for a bailout after greece .
during wednesday 's parliamentary debate merkel argued in favor of involving private investors to bear some of the risk on government bonds .
merkel reiterated that the european union should set limits on the markets .
the opposition social democrats instead called for more equality on european tax rates .
some eu members states believe that ireland 's low corporate tax rate percent is unfair competition .
with the jury still out on whether germany 's contribution to the greek bailout is compatible with german law , the german constitutional court will be watching how the irish rescue package closely .
in reaction to the irish debt crisis and the portuguese general strike the euro on wednesday sank below 1.33 dollars for the first time in two months .

now a young german firm aims to join the major league of mining by reactivating abandoned deposits . situated in an office above a music school in heidelberg 's historic city center , the 15 employees of deutsche rohstoff are trying to profit from the rising prices of natural resources .
the company specializes in reactivating defunct sources of oil , gas , gold , silver , high-tech metals like indium or gallium , and rare earth elements .
an exception in a market dominated by large multinational players , deutsche rohstoff has been spending money with essentially no earnings since it was founded in 2006 .
but it has investors ' attention .
a recent sale of 320,000 new shares netted four million euros , with industry giants like the basf chemicals company buying stakes in the business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : titus gebel says there will always be projects larger companies miss " in the long term we want to fill the gap left behind by -lrb- former german mining companies -rrb- preussag and metallgesellschaft , " deutsche rohstoff executive titus gebel told deutsche welle .
" they were globally situated natural resource companies which could hold their own in the first division – or at least in the second division – during the 1980s . "
opportunity from rising prices there was a time when industrialized western countries had significantly more capacity to process their natural resources .
in the 1960s , for instance , germany was europe 's largest producer of oil .

gebel , however , believes the rising cost of natural resources will make europe 's own deposits profitable again .
his company is betting on increased demand , which he 's sure is more than a temporary trend .
" because of the economic developments in china and india , the natural resources sector is experiencing what 's called a super-cycle – there will be a boom in the next 20 years . "
europe 's political stability is another factor to be taken into account .
many of the countries which have supplied the global economy with relatively inexpensive natural resources over recent years are politically volatile .
and those that are stable will increasingly choose to keep their resources for domestic production .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as resource prices rise , europe 's political stability will be a valuable asset china , for example , used 8 percent of the world 's demand for metal 16 years ago .

" if growth in china and also india and brazil continues the way it has been so far , then in the next 25 years we will need to mine as much metal as we have in the combined history of mankind . "

the company went public in 2010 , and its stock price has risen by 35 percent .

rhein petroleum – another affiliated company with oil and gas projects throughout germany – is also expected to generate its first revenues in 2011 , or 2012 at the latest .

now some analysts are grumbling that the euro may be on its way out too . this irish rescue package agreed this week – along with the greek bailout earlier in the year - has found the eurozone countries hopelessly divided over the question of how to save the common currency in the long term .
they have good reason to be concerned : the bond markets are n't showing a healthy interest in portugal , another likely bailout candidate .
nor are they particularly impressed with spain , an even bigger economy with a similarly troubling debt load , a high unemployment rate and a stagnating economy .
should these countries also seek relief , the future of the euro could be on the line .
worried in berlin the alarm bells are ringing in berlin .
the german government could end up paying 17 billion euros or more of the expected 90-billion-euro irish rescue package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble is worried about the euro on tuesday , german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble warned lawmakers that the irish debt crisis posed a huge risk .
he said the race to shore up ireland 's banking sector and public finances " puts our common currency at stake . "
the excessive debt levels in greece and now ireland , the minister added , only reinforce germany 's strategy of trimming its budget during a nascent recovery .
but berlin 's austerity strategy has drawn criticism from major partners , including the united states .
so has chancellor angela merkel 's suggestion that , in future euro crises , private bondholders should bear more of the losses .
merkel 's proposal is motivated , in part , by pressure from germany 's constitutional court , which could still declare the government 's participation in european bailouts illegal .
in addition to being promised that the euro would be as stable as the deutschmark , germans were told prior to the deutschmark-euro conversion that there would be a " no bailout clause " that would prevent europe 's richer countries from having to rescue the indigent .
irreconcilable camps with every new day of uncertainty , fears are mounting that the ongoing crisis in europe could lead to the default of individual countries and ultimately the collapse of the eurozone .
a deep divide now runs through the two almost irreconcilable camps : the one led by germany and supported by mainly northern european countries defending a culture of economic and monetary stability ; and the other consisting mostly of southern european countries referred to as piigs – portugal , italy , ireland , greece and spain .
european policymakers are now trying to achieve a consensus between the two camps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the euro still be around in a decade ?
" the europeans have a difficult task , " said friedrich heinemann , a director at the centre for european economic research in mannheim , germany .
" on the one side , they must avoid panics and irrational attacks on solvent governments .
on the other side , they must refrain from establishing a guarantee mechanism , which would smash consolidation incentives . " germany is " aware of both dangers , " heinemann told deutsche welle , and has taken what he calls " a highly responsible position . "
the government , he said , consented to the 750-billion-euro european financial stability facility but insisted on a crisis resolution mechanism that would include creditors in a solution for insolvent countries .
" the latter position may not be popular among highly indebted countries but it is important for the fiscal and political future of europe , " heinemann said .
" euro member countries must remain responsible for their own public finances . "
other analysts agree .
" i think germany is right in wanting to avoid a transfer union , " said marco annunziata , chief economist at unicredit group . there are two possible ways of avoiding this , according to annunziata .
the first , he said , would be to have a true centralization of european fiscal policy – something that would require a greater degree of political union than seems feasible at this stage . the second is to have a framework for sovereign debt restructuring - a credible signal to investors that the next time a eurozone country has difficulties servicing its debt , it will be helped only if at the same time private investors suffer haircuts .
this would make private investors more careful when assessing sovereign risk , and would therefore impose stricter discipline on countries by driving debt spreads wider at the first signs of fiscal indiscipline . " these issues need to be resolved soon , however , " annunziata told deutsche welle .
" otherwise , the risk is that popular support for the eurozone might disintegrate very quickly . " " a more german eurozone " some experts question , though , how big a role germany , europe 's largest economy , should play in stabilizing the eurozone .
turning the eurozone into a larger germany , says philip whyte with the centre for european reform in london , could have adverse consequences - not only for the country itself but also for europe and even the rest of the world .
he maintains that " a more german eurozone " would be afflicted by chronically weak demand , debilitating cycles of competitive wage cuts and prolonged economic slumps in the deficit countries .
like many others , whyte agrees the time has come to make some tough decisions .
" the genius of the european union has been to muddle its way through , " he said .
" i do n't think that muddling is an option this time . "
so should investors unload their euros while they are still worth something ?
expert heinemann is confident the common currency will survive .
" i do n't see the euro breaking apart , " he said .
" or does anybody see the us currency union breaking apart because of the imminent californian bankruptcy ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press freedom -pipe- 24.11.2010 independent journalism in southeast europe seeks future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw and the southeast europe association hosted the two-day conference the media market in southeastern europe is one of the most dynamic in the world .
however , the independence of balkan journalism is less impressive , as a conference co-hosted by dw has shown . at the close of the " media in southeast europe " conference in bonn , one of the presenters summoned the words of bruce springsteen to characterize the media market in southeast-european countries : " 57 channels and nothing on . "
liana ganea of the romanian media watchdog active watch said that the media in southeastern europe was not only lacking in quality production but also in freedom of speech .
ganea cited the example of romanian tycoon sorin ovidiu vantu , who in 2009 ordered a journalist working for his media group , realitatea-catavencu , to " attack " certain political figures in romania .
" when i tell you to attack somebody , then you have to just attack him , " the multimillionaire commanded his reporter , who was recording the conversation and afterwards made it public .
romania joined the european union in 2007 ; however , ganea said that the situation had gotten worse ever since , mainly due to a " war " and an " earthquake . "
" the ' war ' was the political battle before the presidential election in 2009 , which unfortunately had a very negative impact on the media .
romanian news outlets were completely manipulated and polarized ; journalists were on one side or the other , and they acted like vicious fighters .
and then came the ' earthquake ' : the global economic crisis . "
' sandwiched ' journalism as a result of the desolate financial situation , several media institutions around southeast europe were forced to close departments , with even experienced journalists being laid off .
remzi lani , head of the tirana media organization in albania , told deutsche welle that journalists in his country often pandered to politicians and businessmen - and not the general public " the main problem is media ' clientelism ' - the media is sandwiched between politics and the economy .
it does n't serve the public interest , but rather that of big business and influential politicians .
and who pays the price ?
it 's the public , which is not represented and whose interests are forgotten , " lani said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zurovac is concerned about the influence of religion on reporting in bosnia in every balkan state , the media is officially free but not always independent .
in albania , lani added , corruption is an " inescapable nemesis " to the freedom of reporting .
apart from politics and business , there is a third influence that infringes on independent journalism , according to ljiliana zurovac , head of the press counsel in bosnia .
zurovac told deutsche welle that media coverage in her country was all too often swayed by religious conviction .
" unfortunately -lsb- religion -rsb- is very strong , but not because the religious centers in bosnia are too pushy .
many media organizations are very willing to cooperate ; and this is regardless of the faith , whether islamic , orthodox , or catholic .
independence or survival the diversity of the media market in southeast europe is indeed impressive ; in the capital of bulgaria , for instance , there are over 30 different radio broadcasters for fewer than 1.5 million people .
the online news offerings in bulgaria , as for the other countries in southeast europe , are too expansive for any single person to follow .
however , only very few media outlets are able to survive on their own .
without financial assistance , most private broadcasters and television stations would have already gone bankrupt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ganea said the choice was between independence and survival liana ganea , of active watch in romania , says many media organizations there are forced to choose between journalistic independence and bare survival .
" we have to scrutinize the desolate state of journalism in our country , for this may be the only way to start making changes to it .
we have to talk about the problems of the press openly .
to give our journalists confidence , we have to face the public and discuss our weaknesses .
to find solutions , we have to face the political and economic pressure , " ganea said .
a central part of the bonn conference was the debate on how journalism in southeast europe can be financed in the future while still allowing for independence from business and political interests .
the director the international federation of journalists , renate schroeder , said at the close of the two-day conference that " we all view journalism as a service for the common good , " referring to the federation 's plans to focus more on southeast europe in the future .

now a young german firm aims to join the major league of mining by reactivating abandoned deposits . situated in an office above a music school in heidelberg 's historic city center , the 15 employees of deutsche rohstoff are trying to profit from the rising prices of natural resources .
the company specializes in reactivating defunct sources of oil , gas , gold , silver , high-tech metals like indium or gallium , and rare earth elements .
an exception in a market dominated by large multinational players , deutsche rohstoff has been spending money with essentially no earnings since it was founded in 2006 .
but it has investors ' attention .
a recent sale of 320,000 new shares netted four million euros , with industry giants like the basf chemicals company buying stakes in the business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : titus gebel says there will always be projects larger companies miss " in the long term we want to fill the gap left behind by -lrb- former german mining companies -rrb- preussag and metallgesellschaft , " deutsche rohstoff executive titus gebel told deutsche welle .
" they were globally situated natural resource companies which could hold their own in the first division – or at least in the second division – during the 1980s . "
opportunity from rising prices there was a time when industrialized western countries had significantly more capacity to process their natural resources .
in the 1960s , for instance , germany was europe 's largest producer of oil .
as procurement from africa and asia became cheaper , oil prices dropped and domestic facilities were closed .
gebel , however , believes the rising cost of natural resources will make europe 's own deposits profitable again .

" the result indicates that it is a victory of hope over fear , a victory of optimism over despair .
that ’ s the changed agenda of bihar .
people now look forward to their state and its future development with a sense of pride . " bihar has long been beset with corruption and an electorate split along caste lines .
perhaps this electoral outcome marks the beginning of a new phase in the state 's politics . bihar notched a growth rate of over 11 percent in 2008/9 , making it india 's second fastest-growing state economy , just behind the western state of gujarat , which is run by the bjp . opting for development n k singh , a jd -lrb- u -rrb- mp , said that " people had opted for development , preferring this over historical , class , caste and sectarian divide .
nitish went to the people and was in a sense seeking a referendum on him and his style of government and its achievements , which are centered on development and performance . "
for its part , the congress party put up a dismal show , winning only six seats in the 243-member state assembly against nine in the previous assembly elections of 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bihar is one of india 's poorest states even election tours by the party 's star campaigner rahul gandhi failed to make an impact . in a rare appearance after the results , congress president sonia gandhi admitted the party had to do some soul-searching . " as far as our party is concerned , we didn ’ t have much hope , ” she said .
" we took a deliberate decision not to work in alliance with other parties .
the results obviously indicate that our party has to start from scratch to rebuild itself .
and that is what we plan to do . " although the results are unlikely to affect the government 's survival , they will have implications in new delhi where the opposition has trained its guns on the congress-led united progressive alliance government over allegations of graft . author : murali krishnan editor : arun chowdhury send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but in the eyup district , a holy site for muslims , life is veiled in centuries of tradition . it is afternoon in eyup .
the call of the muezzin rings out over the square in front of the mosque .
women in colorful headscarves lead their children by the hand as men with prayer beads amble towards the entrance to the mosque . pairs of newlyweds pose for photos in front of the fountain ; the brides ' wedding dresses shimmering in the sunlight .

the boy looks like a little sultan .
he is wearing a shiny white suit with gold edging and a turban-like headpiece .
in a few days he will participate in the " sunnet " - the turkish circumcision ceremony . before this important event , the boy 's parents take him to the eyup sultan mosque .

" on days of particular religious significance , like the festival of sacrifice , we sometimes have 100,000 visitors per day , " said calisan . muslims flock to eyup not only for special occasions or religious events .

they can stand in front of it and pray in the hope of having their wish granted . the graveside is decorated with precious carpets and tiles .
the sarcophagus of abu ayyub al-ansari is in a separate room , behind a silver lattice door .
only the hafiz , the koran reciter , is allowed to enter it .
the mufti of eyup , isa gurler , gave deutsche welle the chance to look inside . " as the prophet left mecca and went to medina , he spent seven months in abu ayyub al-ansari 's house , " explained gurler .
" after the prophet 's death , ansari became a leading islamic scholar .
he told the muslims about the deeds and statements of the prophet . " eternal peace after visiting the gravesite , many pilgrims head to the old cemetery behind the mosque to honor the dead .
only very few can be buried there - it is reserved for special dignitaries .
but the spiritual atmosphere of the place puts a spell on everyone present , regardless of why they are there . irfan calisan smiles wisely .

he has pledged to take measures to improve competition . in his harshest criticism yet of former presidentvladimir putin 's ruling party united russia , president dmitry medvedev warned on wednesday that russian politics faced stagnation because of a lack of competition .
for a full 11 minutes , russian president dmitry medvedev reviewed the state of russian democracy in his video blog , and the general impression was that he was happy with what he saw .
still , he said , the lack of political competition could lead to stagnation , a term usually used to describe the rule of former soviet leader leonid brezhnev , who ruled from 1964 to 1982 .
" it is no secret that at a certain point in our political life symptoms of stagnation began to emerge , " medvedev said in the blog .
" and the danger arose that stability would turn into stagnation .
and such a stagnation is equally damaging for both the ruling party and for opposition forces . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev warned of political stagnation in russia more competition needed medvedev suggested that the current state of events , with the ruling party winning most elections with a landslide , was ultimately harmful to the country and that more competition was sorely needed .
" if the opposition does not stand the slightest chance of winning in an honest battle , it is degraded and becomes marginalized .
but if the ruling party has no chance whatsoever to lose , it simply turns into bronze and ultimately also degrades , like any living organism which does not move , " he said .
united russia , whose leader is prime minister putin , dominates the duma , russia 's lower house of parliament .
it has won virtually every election over the past 10 years , receiving close to 100 percent of the vote in some regions .
in many ways , the party looks like a modern day copy of the communist party of the soviet era .
though support has been dwindling for some time , according to opinion polls , united russia once again emerged as the clear winner in the latest regional elections in october .
but independent observers said the outcome was marred by large-scale fraud .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regional elections were not above board , say observers lip service united russia also dominates television news broadcasts , where opposition parties not represented in parliament have no access whatsoever .
medvedev hardly addressed these concerns , instead devoting most of his time to what he said the government had done to improve the level of democracy in russia , and he clearly did not question whether or not elections held in russia can be called free and fair .
the ruling party , meanwhile , was quick to embrace medvedev 's criticism .
according to one of its leaders , andrei vorobyov , united russia supports the president 's initiatives , even though , he said , it means conditions will be tougher for his party . , " but politics is a struggle , " he said , " and we , as before , are ready to fight for each vote . "
observers in moscow said medvedev 's remarks may be aimed at creating a more liberal image , ahead of presidential and parliamentary elections next year . but neither medvedev nor putin have tipped their hands about which , if any , office they intend to stand for in the 2011 polls .

it was the first joint general strike held by the unions since 1988 .
together , they represent around 1.5 million workers .
the head of the main ugt union , joao proenca said , " it is the biggest strike ever staged . "
making the cuts the socialist government wants to implement the austerity program in a bid to cut a high national level of debt .
prime minister jose socrates has vowed to stick by his course of wage cuts and tax hikes , hoping to quash speculation that portugal will be the next european country to need a bailout after ireland and greece .
commenting during the strike , labor minister helena andre said without the austerity measures , " the consequences for the portuguese and the economy will be a great deal worse . "
the government 's austerity budget is due to be finally approved by parliament this week .
the measures include cutting public sector wages by five percent , freezing pensions and raising value added tax from 21 to 23 percent .

its unemployment rate stands at 10.9 percent - the highest since the 1980s - and it could rise further .
even though the economy has shown some growth this year , economists fear that higher taxes and wage cuts could cause a relapse into recession in 2011 as consumer spending falls .

the soho spacecraft is now ensured to be operational so that it can observe the sun during its next solar maximum in 2013 , when it reaches the highest point in its cyclical magnetic activity .
' a good day for space science ' another is the planck satellite , which in 2009 began studying cosmic microwave background radiation left over from the big bang approximately 14 billion years ago .
" it is not an easy time to make such commitments but we should not doubt the wisdom of the -lsb- science programme committee -rsb- in squeezing even more return from the big investments of the past , " said david southwood , esa 's director of science and robotic exploration , in the statement .
" the highest quality science will continue to flow from this armada of spacecraft .
it is a good day for european space science .
europe will continue to play an important part in unlocking the mysteries of our universe . "

buildings and woods were engulfed in flames .
south korean soldiers stationed on the island returned the fire .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yeonpyeong island is near the disputed yellow sea border between north and south korea incidents on the sea border putting the incident in context , walter klitz from the friedrich naumann foundation in seoul said there had always been " such incidents on the sea border , which has not been officially agreed upon by the north and the south . " " in march , we had the cheonan story , when a south korean frigate was sunk by a torpedo and 46 marines were killed .
in 1999 , in 2002 when six soldiers were killed , and in november when north korean soldiers were supposedly injured , " he said . " the provocations of the past have always had only one aim , " agreed markus tidten from the german institute for international and security affairs .
" they are there to explain : ' we are a strong power , we are now a nuclear power , we won ’ t let ourselves be ordered about and we want to be respected . " ' to underline its status as a nuclear power , pyongyang not only carried out another nuclear test last year , but just recently it allowed a us scientist to visit a previously-unknown , state-of-the-art uranium-enrichment nuclear facility . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 46 marines were killed when the cheonan warship was sunk in march a trump in the hand " this is a kind of north korean tactic to occupy the upper hand in the upcoming and possible negotiations with the outside world , " explained choi kang from the institute of foreign affairs and national security in seoul . in the past , north korea has demanded a high price for any type of concession it has given , often causing tension to escalate ahead of negotiations . but markus tidten points out that pyongyang is always very sure to not overstep the line , being aware that north korea could not win a full-scale war considering the army ’ s poor equipment . " i would say that they know exactly how far they will go with their provocations .
they want to retain a trump card so-to-speak , " he pointed out . a domestic dimension the escalation along the 38th parallel also has a domestic dimension .
there is a well-orchestrated succession game going on , which has already had several acts this year .
the appointment of kim jong-un as a four-star general was the first in september , with this being promptly followed by his nomination to the central committee and then to the leadership of the country ’ s military commission .
finally , he was presented to the north korean public and the international community at a military parade to mark the 65th anniversary of the ruling worker 's party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kim jong-un is widely expected to take over from his father , north korean leader kim jong-il choi kang thinks that this is perhaps another reason for north korea " to stage this kind of provocation against south korea to show the people that kim jong-un is the next leader and to manage these kinds of military affairs in a more dramatic way . " the lead-up to the nomination of kim jong-il , today 's " dear leader " almost 30 years ago , was accompanied by conflicts with the south .
in 1983 , north korean agents carried out an attack on a high-level south korean delegation in rangoon , the then capital of myanmar .
the south korean president survived the attack but the foreign minister and 16 others were killed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 24.11.2010 ireland bailout reignites fears about the future of the euro großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some irish voters would prefer a lynch to a loan germany has seen a number of its own currencies come and go : the deutschmark , the reichsmark and , before that , the mark .
now some analysts are grumbling that the euro may be on its way out too . this irish rescue package agreed this week – along with the greek bailout earlier in the year - has found the eurozone countries hopelessly divided over the question of how to save the common currency in the long term .
they have good reason to be concerned : the bond markets are n't showing a healthy interest in portugal , another likely bailout candidate .
nor are they particularly impressed with spain , an even bigger economy with a similarly troubling debt load , a high unemployment rate and a stagnating economy .
should these countries also seek relief , the future of the euro could be on the line .
worried in berlin the alarm bells are ringing in berlin .
the german government could end up paying 17 billion euros or more of the expected 90-billion-euro irish rescue package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble is worried about the euro on tuesday , german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble warned lawmakers that the irish debt crisis posed a huge risk .
he said the race to shore up ireland 's banking sector and public finances " puts our common currency at stake . "
the excessive debt levels in greece and now ireland , the minister added , only reinforce germany 's strategy of trimming its budget during a nascent recovery .
but berlin 's austerity strategy has drawn criticism from major partners , including the united states .
so has chancellor angela merkel 's suggestion that , in future euro crises , private bondholders should bear more of the losses .
merkel 's proposal is motivated , in part , by pressure from germany 's constitutional court , which could still declare the government 's participation in european bailouts illegal .
in addition to being promised that the euro would be as stable as the deutschmark , germans were told prior to the deutschmark-euro conversion that there would be a " no bailout clause " that would prevent europe 's richer countries from having to rescue the indigent .
irreconcilable camps with every new day of uncertainty , fears are mounting that the ongoing crisis in europe could lead to the default of individual countries and ultimately the collapse of the eurozone .
a deep divide now runs through the two almost irreconcilable camps : the one led by germany and supported by mainly northern european countries defending a culture of economic and monetary stability ; and the other consisting mostly of southern european countries referred to as piigs – portugal , italy , ireland , greece and spain .
european policymakers are now trying to achieve a consensus between the two camps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the euro still be around in a decade ?
" the europeans have a difficult task , " said friedrich heinemann , a director at the centre for european economic research in mannheim , germany .
" on the one side , they must avoid panics and irrational attacks on solvent governments .
on the other side , they must refrain from establishing a guarantee mechanism , which would smash consolidation incentives . " germany is " aware of both dangers , " heinemann told deutsche welle , and has taken what he calls " a highly responsible position . "
the government , he said , consented to the 750-billion-euro european financial stability facility but insisted on a crisis resolution mechanism that would include creditors in a solution for insolvent countries .
" the latter position may not be popular among highly indebted countries but it is important for the fiscal and political future of europe , " heinemann said .
" euro member countries must remain responsible for their own public finances . "
other analysts agree .
" i think germany is right in wanting to avoid a transfer union , " said marco annunziata , chief economist at unicredit group . there are two possible ways of avoiding this , according to annunziata .
the first , he said , would be to have a true centralization of european fiscal policy – something that would require a greater degree of political union than seems feasible at this stage . the second is to have a framework for sovereign debt restructuring - a credible signal to investors that the next time a eurozone country has difficulties servicing its debt , it will be helped only if at the same time private investors suffer haircuts .
this would make private investors more careful when assessing sovereign risk , and would therefore impose stricter discipline on countries by driving debt spreads wider at the first signs of fiscal indiscipline . " these issues need to be resolved soon , however , " annunziata told deutsche welle .
" otherwise , the risk is that popular support for the eurozone might disintegrate very quickly . " " a more german eurozone " some experts question , though , how big a role germany , europe 's largest economy , should play in stabilizing the eurozone .
turning the eurozone into a larger germany , says philip whyte with the centre for european reform in london , could have adverse consequences - not only for the country itself but also for europe and even the rest of the world .
he maintains that " a more german eurozone " would be afflicted by chronically weak demand , debilitating cycles of competitive wage cuts and prolonged economic slumps in the deficit countries .
like many others , whyte agrees the time has come to make some tough decisions .
" the genius of the european union has been to muddle its way through , " he said .
" i do n't think that muddling is an option this time . "
so should investors unload their euros while they are still worth something ?
expert heinemann is confident the common currency will survive .
" i do n't see the euro breaking apart , " he said .
" or does anybody see the us currency union breaking apart because of the imminent californian bankruptcy ?

the plans have raised the ire of workers , who went on general strike in protest . public sector workers across portugal went on strike on wednesday , disrupting transport and other services including healthcare .
the day-long strike was called by the country 's two biggest unions in protest at the government 's planned austerity measures .
three-quarters of train services and 60 percent of bus services were cancelled , while no flights took off or landed at any airport .
it was the first joint general strike held by the unions since 1988 .
together , they represent around 1.5 million workers .
the head of the main ugt union , joao proenca said , " it is the biggest strike ever staged . "
making the cuts the socialist government wants to implement the austerity program in a bid to cut a high national level of debt .
prime minister jose socrates has vowed to stick by his course of wage cuts and tax hikes , hoping to quash speculation that portugal will be the next european country to need a bailout after ireland and greece .
commenting during the strike , labor minister helena andre said without the austerity measures , " the consequences for the portuguese and the economy will be a great deal worse . "
the government 's austerity budget is due to be finally approved by parliament this week .
the measures include cutting public sector wages by five percent , freezing pensions and raising value added tax from 21 to 23 percent .
portugal has gone through many years of continuous low growth .
its unemployment rate stands at 10.9 percent - the highest since the 1980s - and it could rise further .
even though the economy has shown some growth this year , economists fear that higher taxes and wage cuts could cause a relapse into recession in 2011 as consumer spending falls .

werder bremen were convincingly defeated 3-0 by tottenham hotspur , eliminating them from the competition . schalke booked their place in the final 16 of the champions league with an impressive 3-0 win over french side , olympique lyon .
despite their poor bundesliga form , schalke reversed their fortunes to top their group and progress to the knock-out round with a game in hand .
lyon will also go through to the next round , just one point behind schalke .
schalke took control of the game from kick-off , racing to a 2-0 lead after just 20 minutes .
early pressure from raul and jefferson farfan exposed the french defense , and schalke threatened goal three times in the first five minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer was under a little more pressure in the second half the pressure paid off as farfan scored 14 minutes in , converting a pass from raul and firing home from 11 meters .
six minutes later , klaas-jan huntelaar picked up the ball on the edge of the area and netted schalke 's second goal .
huntelaar added his second goal of the game in an impressive solo effort in the last minutes .
the dutchman was fed a long ball and then held off two lyon defenders before looping the ball over goalkeeper hugo lloris .
the performance was a far cry from their bundesliga season , which sees them at 15th in the league , only having won three of their 13 games .
speaking after the game , schalke coach felix magath said it was " a nice feeling " to be through .
" for weeks we have been written off , but now we will play in the knockout stage , " magath said .

plagued by injury , bremen were on the back foot after just six minutes as younes kaboul gave spurs their first goal , volleying in a cross from aaron lennon at close range .
luka modric took the londoners into half time 2-0 up , with a neat dodge around bremen defender sebastian prodl before finding the back of the net .
despite spurs ' gareth bale missing a second-half penalty , peter crouch added a third after 79 minutes .
play-maker lennon set up the goal , getting past his marker to lay the ball back for crouch to finish .
the result sees tottenham through to the final 16 , while bremen were eliminated .

in a historic effort to save tigers from becoming extinct in the wild , the leaders endorsed plans to double tiger populations within the next 12 years via the global tiger recovery program .
measures include improving scientific monitoring to help restore the species ' habitats and trans-boundary corridors , halting poaching and illegal trade of tigers and tiger products , and creating incentives for local people to protect the animals rather than view them as competitors for land .
strengthening wildlife legislation , and the enforcement of current laws , will also be vital to achieving the ambitious st. petersburg targets , as wildlife rangers are often ill-equipped and underfunded compared to poachers .
wildlife conservation society 's joe walston , who recently took part in a study of the most promising locations for spurring the recovery of tiger populations , told deutsche welle that poachers often belong to " organized commercial " networks that span international borders .
over the last century , tiger numbers have plummeted from about 100,000 to less than 3,500 tigers in the wild today , and conservationists have warned that the animals face extinction by 2022 if nothing is done .
three sub-species of tigers have already disappeared and the fate of another six is at stake , conservationists say .
the last decade alone has seen a decline of almost 40 per cent in tiger numbers and habitat as a result of human-made threats such as habitat loss , illegal wildlife trade , poaching , and human-tiger conflicts .
promises of funding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside of zoos - where this tiger was born - the species has been dwindling russian prime minister vladimir putin led the meeting , together with chinese premier wen jiabao and world bank president robert zoellick .
also represented at the talks were leaders or representatives of nepal , burma , laos , malaysia , bangladesh , thailand , vietnam , india , indonesia , cambodia and north korea .
" we have put the tiger on the agenda of the international community , " putin said at a summary news conference .
an additional $ 350 million is needed over the next five years to pay for the global tiger recovery program , which was initiated two years ago when a world bank employee told bank president zoellick that tigers were about to disappear .
" when you hear that , you 're shocked , " zoellick told the washington post in an interview on tuesday .
thereafter , the tiger became a world bank cause , and now zoellick says the bank will not finance infrastructure in core tiger areas .
it will also try to develop new means of sustainable financing for tiger habitats .
zoellick said the bank hopes to provide $ 100 million in financing to help prevent illegal trade in tiger parts and poaching in nepal , bangladesh , bhutan and possibly india .
financing has also been committed by the world wildlife fund for nature , the us , germany , the wildlife conservation society , and the global environment facility .
leonardo dicaprio , a wwf board member who flew in to attend the meeting , has also committed $ 1 million in private funds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three sub-species of tigers have disappeared in the wild border cooperation ' crucial ' executive secretary elizabeth maruma mrema of the convention on migratory species stressed that safeguarding international migration corridors and trans-border habitats will be " crucial " for global efforts to save the tiger .
" the convention on migratory species is unique in that it can provide a framework to protect not only the animal , but also its habitat , " she said .
the tiger has played a very important role in asian nature and culture for centuries .
almost half of the world 's population - 3.3 billion people - live in the countries where tiger 's roam .
immediate and effective steps are necessary to create an economic and ecological balance matching the interests of these states with a safe future for the tiger .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 24.11.2010 ireland announces sweeping austerity measures to secure bailout großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are fears that the irish crisis could endanger the euro the irish government has given details of its most stringent austerity plan ever , aimed at saving 15 billion euros over the next four years .
the cuts are necessary to secure a multi-billion-euro international bailout . ireland has set out a four-year plan to save 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- in order to secure an international bailout expected to be in the region of 85 billion euros .
under the national recovery plan , the irish republic aims to bring its budget deficit down from a projected 32 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- to three percent of gdp by 2014 by imposing tax increases , wage cuts and by curbing public spending .
" we can and we will pull through this as we have in the past , " prime minister brian cowen told a news conference in dublin .
" we are a smart , resilient , proud people and we are going to come through this challenge because we love our country . "
finance minister brian lenihan , meanwhile , stressed the urgency of the situation .
" if we do not make these savings , we have no credible way of borrowing money to pay for our social welfare and health and education sectors from the middle of next year , " he said .
optimistic on growth the program is based on an average growth projection of 2.75 percent for the next four years , which some experts say is optimistic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen could have a tough time selling his budget to the opposition " it 's certainly challenging , given the extent of fiscal tightening , which is around 10 percent of gdp , " grant lewis , head of economic research at daiwa capital markets europe told deutsche welle .
" but i think , the eu and the imf will sign up for that , as in the last 15 years , ireland has had a good track record in terms of growth , it 's a flexible economy with a well-educated workforce and good demographics . "
measures include reducing the minimum wage by one euro , slashing public sector jobs and pay and raising the sales tax from 21 percent to 23 percent in 2014 .
under the current tax regime , 45 percent of irish workers do not pay income tax , a situation the government calls " unsustainable " .
the eu 's commissioner for economic and financial affairs , olli rehn , welcomed the program , calling it " a sound basis for the negotiations " on the international bailout .
corporation tax non-negotiable one tax that will not be raised is ireland 's corporation tax - at 12.5 percent the lowest in the european union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banking sector is at the heart of the debt crisis .
" the government remains committed to the 12.5 percent corporation tax rate : it will not be increased under any circumstances , " was the clear message in wednesday 's statement .
it was a magnet for foreign investment during ireland 's boom years , but has been heavily criticized by its european neighbors .
countries like germany say it creates an unfair advantage , especially while ireland is drip-fed by eu bailout funds .
" it 's the heart of ireland 's business model and it 's attracted loads of multinationals .
germany and france as europe 's biggest economies have massive advantages compared to ireland , so its low corporation tax should n't matter so much , " lewis said .
banking sector recovery crucial years of economic growth in ireland , fueled by a property boom and reckless lending practices , turned to bust when the housing market collapsed , exacerbated by the global financial crisis .
ireland is set to take a majority stake of up to 80 percent in top lender bank of ireland that could leave the state with effective control of the country 's top three banks .
allied irish banks could join the anglo-irish bank in being fully nationalized .
lewis believes the irish government may have to do more further down the line .
" the banking sector is the great unknown , it has broken ireland 's back , we 'll have to see how the measures for the banking sector pan out , " lewis told deutsche welle .

"
liana ganea of the romanian media watchdog active watch said that the media in southeastern europe was not only lacking in quality production but also in freedom of speech .
ganea cited the example of romanian tycoon sorin ovidiu vantu , who in 2009 ordered a journalist working for his media group , realitatea-catavencu , to " attack " certain political figures in romania .
" when i tell you to attack somebody , then you have to just attack him , " the multimillionaire commanded his reporter , who was recording the conversation and afterwards made it public .
romania joined the european union in 2007 ; however , ganea said that the situation had gotten worse ever since , mainly due to a " war " and an " earthquake . "
" the ' war ' was the political battle before the presidential election in 2009 , which unfortunately had a very negative impact on the media .
romanian news outlets were completely manipulated and polarized ; journalists were on one side or the other , and they acted like vicious fighters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.11.2010 european commission slams merkel over euro comment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comments by german officials ruffled feathers at the european central bank the european commission has distanced itself from remarks by germany 's chancellor and finance minister that the irish debt crisis could threaten the single currency . the european commission on wednesday rejected german suggestions that the bloc 's common currency was in danger .
a spokesman for the eu 's economic and monetary affairs commissioner , olli rehn , insisted that the euro was a " stable " currency and that its continued existence was not threatened by eurozone debt or banking crises .
he was reacting to a statement by angela merkel , in which the german chancellor said europe was in an " extraordinarily serious situation . "
merkel said germany 's support for ireland was conditional on ireland " making clear what steps -lrb- it -rrb- must take to get back on a path of stabilization . "
merkel added that europe should have the " courage " to set limits on markets by ensuring that private investors bear some of the risk of future eurozone bailouts .
the chancellor said germany would look " positively " on ireland 's request , reportedly worth some 85 billion euros -lrb- 114 billion dollars -rrb- .
future of euro at stake : minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says support for an irish bailout is conditional german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble told the bundestag on tuesday that the future of the euro was " at stake " in the irish crisis .
with its banking system in crisis and its budget deficit forecast to be 10 times the eu limit of three percent of gdp this year , ireland on sunday became the second eurozone member in six months to apply for a bailout after greece .
during wednesday 's parliamentary debate merkel argued in favor of involving private investors to bear some of the risk on government bonds .
merkel reiterated that the european union should set limits on the markets .
the opposition social democrats instead called for more equality on european tax rates .

a spokesman for the eu 's economic and monetary affairs commissioner , olli rehn , insisted that the euro was a " stable " currency and that its continued existence was not threatened by eurozone debt or banking crises .
he was reacting to a statement by angela merkel , in which the german chancellor said europe was in an " extraordinarily serious situation . "
merkel said germany 's support for ireland was conditional on ireland " making clear what steps -lrb- it -rrb- must take to get back on a path of stabilization . "
merkel added that europe should have the " courage " to set limits on markets by ensuring that private investors bear some of the risk of future eurozone bailouts .
the chancellor said germany would look " positively " on ireland 's request , reportedly worth some 85 billion euros -lrb- 114 billion dollars -rrb- .
future of euro at stake : minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says support for an irish bailout is conditional german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble told the bundestag on tuesday that the future of the euro was " at stake " in the irish crisis .
with its banking system in crisis and its budget deficit forecast to be 10 times the eu limit of three percent of gdp this year , ireland on sunday became the second eurozone member in six months to apply for a bailout after greece .
during wednesday 's parliamentary debate merkel argued in favor of involving private investors to bear some of the risk on government bonds .
merkel reiterated that the european union should set limits on the markets .
the opposition social democrats instead called for more equality on european tax rates .
some eu members states believe that ireland 's low corporate tax rate percent is unfair competition .
with the jury still out on whether germany 's contribution to the greek bailout is compatible with german law , the german constitutional court will be watching how the irish rescue package closely .

now some analysts are grumbling that the euro may be on its way out too . this irish rescue package agreed this week – along with the greek bailout earlier in the year - has found the eurozone countries hopelessly divided over the question of how to save the common currency in the long term .
they have good reason to be concerned : the bond markets are n't showing a healthy interest in portugal , another likely bailout candidate .
nor are they particularly impressed with spain , an even bigger economy with a similarly troubling debt load , a high unemployment rate and a stagnating economy .
should these countries also seek relief , the future of the euro could be on the line .
worried in berlin the alarm bells are ringing in berlin .
the german government could end up paying 17 billion euros or more of the expected 90-billion-euro irish rescue package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble is worried about the euro on tuesday , german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble warned lawmakers that the irish debt crisis posed a huge risk .
he said the race to shore up ireland 's banking sector and public finances " puts our common currency at stake . "
the excessive debt levels in greece and now ireland , the minister added , only reinforce germany 's strategy of trimming its budget during a nascent recovery .
but berlin 's austerity strategy has drawn criticism from major partners , including the united states .
so has chancellor angela merkel 's suggestion that , in future euro crises , private bondholders should bear more of the losses .
merkel 's proposal is motivated , in part , by pressure from germany 's constitutional court , which could still declare the government 's participation in european bailouts illegal .
in addition to being promised that the euro would be as stable as the deutschmark , germans were told prior to the deutschmark-euro conversion that there would be a " no bailout clause " that would prevent europe 's richer countries from having to rescue the indigent .
irreconcilable camps with every new day of uncertainty , fears are mounting that the ongoing crisis in europe could lead to the default of individual countries and ultimately the collapse of the eurozone .
a deep divide now runs through the two almost irreconcilable camps : the one led by germany and supported by mainly northern european countries defending a culture of economic and monetary stability ; and the other consisting mostly of southern european countries referred to as piigs – portugal , italy , ireland , greece and spain .
european policymakers are now trying to achieve a consensus between the two camps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the euro still be around in a decade ?
" the europeans have a difficult task , " said friedrich heinemann , a director at the centre for european economic research in mannheim , germany .
" on the one side , they must avoid panics and irrational attacks on solvent governments .
on the other side , they must refrain from establishing a guarantee mechanism , which would smash consolidation incentives . " germany is " aware of both dangers , " heinemann told deutsche welle , and has taken what he calls " a highly responsible position . "
the government , he said , consented to the 750-billion-euro european financial stability facility but insisted on a crisis resolution mechanism that would include creditors in a solution for insolvent countries .
" the latter position may not be popular among highly indebted countries but it is important for the fiscal and political future of europe , " heinemann said .
" euro member countries must remain responsible for their own public finances . "
other analysts agree .
" i think germany is right in wanting to avoid a transfer union , " said marco annunziata , chief economist at unicredit group . there are two possible ways of avoiding this , according to annunziata .
the first , he said , would be to have a true centralization of european fiscal policy – something that would require a greater degree of political union than seems feasible at this stage . the second is to have a framework for sovereign debt restructuring - a credible signal to investors that the next time a eurozone country has difficulties servicing its debt , it will be helped only if at the same time private investors suffer haircuts .
this would make private investors more careful when assessing sovereign risk , and would therefore impose stricter discipline on countries by driving debt spreads wider at the first signs of fiscal indiscipline . " these issues need to be resolved soon , however , " annunziata told deutsche welle .
" otherwise , the risk is that popular support for the eurozone might disintegrate very quickly . " " a more german eurozone " some experts question , though , how big a role germany , europe 's largest economy , should play in stabilizing the eurozone .
turning the eurozone into a larger germany , says philip whyte with the centre for european reform in london , could have adverse consequences - not only for the country itself but also for europe and even the rest of the world .
he maintains that " a more german eurozone " would be afflicted by chronically weak demand , debilitating cycles of competitive wage cuts and prolonged economic slumps in the deficit countries .
like many others , whyte agrees the time has come to make some tough decisions .
" the genius of the european union has been to muddle its way through , " he said .
" i do n't think that muddling is an option this time . "
so should investors unload their euros while they are still worth something ?
expert heinemann is confident the common currency will survive .
" i do n't see the euro breaking apart , " he said .
" or does anybody see the us currency union breaking apart because of the imminent californian bankruptcy ?

analysts say beijing 's influence is not absolute . china is separated from north korea by the yalu river near the northern chinese city of dandong .
however , this river has proven to be less a barrier than a link between the two countries . the bridge over the river has seen goods worth more than one billion us dollars pass over it since the last six months .
north korea has been dependent on china for basic supplies and oil for decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yalu river at dandong separates china from north korea the two countries signed a friendship treaty in 1961 and pyongyang has had beijing 's tacit support ever since .
north korean leader kim jong-il has already visited china twice this year . earlier this year , china used its veto in the united nations security council against an international bid to enforce stronger sanctions against north korea . china 's influence should not be overestimated however , niu jun from the school of international studies at peking university says that although " china has more influence on north korea than any other country , this influence is not absolute . " british north korea expert jasper becker agrees : " kim jong-il does n't trust the chinese .
they are not involved in his inner circle or his decision-making process .
they are excluded from it and he ’ s definitely opposed to the chinese way . " bildunterschrift : china is worried that there will be a deluge of refugees if north korea collapses however , china is worried that a war or the collapse of the north korean regime will lead to a deluge of refugees from across the border .
" we will do our utmost to prevent that , " says shi yinhong from peking university . korean unification is also not an option for china .
if the border between the two divided countries were to fall , us troops would practically be on the chinese border .
this is why beijing is intent on maintaining the status quo , even if beijing has little sympathy for kim jong-il and his family . beijing has refused to condemn north korea for tuesday ’ s artillery attacks but it did urge both sides to show " calm and restraint " and to sit down for talks as soon as possible . japan calls on beijing to restrain pyongyang north korea 's neighbor japan also tried to ease the tension , with prime minister naoto kan calling on china to work with other partners and restrain pyongyang . in a telephone conversation with south korean president lee myung bak , kan underlined his country 's strong ties with washington and seoul . meanwhile , president lee myung bak was criticized at home for his " slow " response to the crisis with south korean defense minister kim tae yung being grilled by parliamentarians over intelligence glitches regarding information about the attack and his inadequate response to north korea ’ s artillery firing . kim said that north korea ’ s attempts to demonstrate its might were just a means for the upcoming leader kim jong-un to show off his status as a strong leader . author : manasi gopalakrishnan editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many south koreans have mixed feelings over how their government should respond to the incident . in a phone call with south korean president lee myung bak , us president barack obama pledged his nation 's support in preventing more provocations from pyongyang on wednesday . the shelling of yeongpyeong island on tuesday , which killed two south korean marines and two civilians , is one of the most serious firefights to take place between the two koreas in decades . some south koreans , such as 64-year-old lee cheon-gu , are very angry about the bloodshed .
" the reason north korea keeps making these provocations is that the south korean government is too lenient , " he says . " seoul has not been strong enough to prevent more attacks from the north after the sinking of the cheonan , " he says .
this attack , which international investigators blame on a north korean torpedo , resulted in the death of 46 sailors in march .
pyongyang has denied any involvement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president barack obama has assured seoul of support part of succession game some analysts say that tuesday 's attack might have something to do with the power transition that is currently underway in the north . however , brian myers , the author of the " the cleanest race , how north koreans see themselves and why it matters , " thinks this is probably a secondary reason . but he concedes that all is not well : " we have heard reports from north korea that many citizens there are not comfortable with the succession ; they are not happy with the way the so-called young general is being presented .
we have heard reports of anti-regime graffiti popping up on walls . " fears about financial ramifications other south koreans seem less concerned with the reasons behind tuesday ’ s deadly attack than about the financial ramifications . bildunterschrift : villagers watched as smoke rose from south korea 's yeonpyeong island on tuesday 35-year-old lee jin-woo does not think " this incident will result in a war between south and north korea .
many incidents like this have happened before .
i am just worried it will hurt the economy here and the stock market . " some do not even believe seoul 's account of what happened on yeonpyeong .
one young woman , who did not want to give her name , said she did not trust her government . " i am not so sure that north korea is really responsible for starting the fires on the island , " she said , adding that she was " sympathetic to the north and would wait for more information before deciding on the truth . " koreans have a sense of allegiance to the nation brian myers thought this general apathy among south koreans or outright denial of north korea 's involvement in attacks could undermine seoul ’ s attempts to unify the people against the kim jong-il regime . " the people here feel much more of a sense of allegiance to the nation , in other words , the korean race , than they do to south korea as a separate republicm , " he explained . " so when north korea attacks south korean territory , they do not feel like they ’ ve been violated by a foreign power .
instead they feel that the governments of pyongyang and seoul have had a disagreement or perhaps a misunderstanding of some kind . " however , for seoul and washington , there is no misunderstanding about what took place .

he has pledged to take measures to improve competition . in his harshest criticism yet of former presidentvladimir putin 's ruling party united russia , president dmitry medvedev warned on wednesday that russian politics faced stagnation because of a lack of competition .
for a full 11 minutes , russian president dmitry medvedev reviewed the state of russian democracy in his video blog , and the general impression was that he was happy with what he saw .
still , he said , the lack of political competition could lead to stagnation , a term usually used to describe the rule of former soviet leader leonid brezhnev , who ruled from 1964 to 1982 .
" it is no secret that at a certain point in our political life symptoms of stagnation began to emerge , " medvedev said in the blog .
" and the danger arose that stability would turn into stagnation .
and such a stagnation is equally damaging for both the ruling party and for opposition forces . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev warned of political stagnation in russia more competition needed medvedev suggested that the current state of events , with the ruling party winning most elections with a landslide , was ultimately harmful to the country and that more competition was sorely needed .
" if the opposition does not stand the slightest chance of winning in an honest battle , it is degraded and becomes marginalized .
but if the ruling party has no chance whatsoever to lose , it simply turns into bronze and ultimately also degrades , like any living organism which does not move , " he said .
united russia , whose leader is prime minister putin , dominates the duma , russia 's lower house of parliament .
it has won virtually every election over the past 10 years , receiving close to 100 percent of the vote in some regions .
in many ways , the party looks like a modern day copy of the communist party of the soviet era .
though support has been dwindling for some time , according to opinion polls , united russia once again emerged as the clear winner in the latest regional elections in october .
but independent observers said the outcome was marred by large-scale fraud .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regional elections were not above board , say observers lip service united russia also dominates television news broadcasts , where opposition parties not represented in parliament have no access whatsoever .
medvedev hardly addressed these concerns , instead devoting most of his time to what he said the government had done to improve the level of democracy in russia , and he clearly did not question whether or not elections held in russia can be called free and fair .
the ruling party , meanwhile , was quick to embrace medvedev 's criticism .
according to one of its leaders , andrei vorobyov , united russia supports the president 's initiatives , even though , he said , it means conditions will be tougher for his party . , " but politics is a struggle , " he said , " and we , as before , are ready to fight for each vote . "
observers in moscow said medvedev 's remarks may be aimed at creating a more liberal image , ahead of presidential and parliamentary elections next year . but neither medvedev nor putin have tipped their hands about which , if any , office they intend to stand for in the 2011 polls .

critics say the changes are targeted against smaller firms and could lead to mass unemployment . demonstrations by thousands on behalf of small and medium-sized businesses in ukraine brought traffic to a halt on monday , with demands for a presidential veto of a controversial tax reform bill .
traffic was blocked in the main street of the capital , kyiv , as more than 6,000 demonstrators assembled at the city 's independence square .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko vowed to push for new elections if the laws were not vetoed although a court had declared the demonstration illegal last week , protesters defied the ban with chants of " we wo n't leave , we wo n't leave . "
protests also took place in the cities of lviv and poltava , which , like the kyiv demonstration , were intended to pressure president viktor yanukovych to reject tax reform legislation .
the demonstrations began last week after parliament passed legislation for a hike in company operating fees and tough new tax accounting rules .
at the same time , some standards for larger businesses were relaxed .
the protests took place exactly six years after the orange revolution , which had brought yanukovych 's rivals to power .
the main difference was that now people from all over ukraine and belonging to various political groups gathered to voice their anger .
organizers kept the protest largely free from party politics .
former prime minister speaks out however , one of yanukovych 's political arch-rivals yulia tymoshenko , did join the protests .
tymoshenko , the country 's former prime minister , threatened to press for a referendum on early presidential and parliamentary elections if the president were to sign the new tax bill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics of the changes say they will strip firms of much-needed revenue " for a national referendum we need to collect three million signatures , " tymoshenko told the crowd .
" do you think we can do that ? "
critics say the new bill only favors big business , and that it could lead to mass unemployment , with many firms depending on tax breaks to survive .
one demonstrator told the ukrainian television station 5 kanal that he would keep demonstrating until the demands were met .
" i will stay here till the end , " he said .
" today the future of ukraine is at stake , the future of my children , my grandchildren and great-grandchildren .
it is us or them .
either we are citizens of our country , or just people that can be experimented with . "
softly , softly approach the authorities have reacted cautiously to the protests and an attempt on tuesday to dismantle the tent camp in the center of kyiv failed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovych has said he is willing to make compromises president yanukovich said he was prepared to listen to the demands , but added that the need to remove tax evasion loopholes in the law meant they could not be met fully .
" i understand their demands very well , " yanukovich was reported to have said on monday .
" they will not be satisfied 100 percent . "
ukrainian prime minister mykola azarov has defended the tax code , claiming that it is the most liberal in europe .

the judgment could be a record . a us jury has ordered german business software giant sap to pay its us rival oracle $ 1.3 billion -lrb- 970 million euros -rrb- in damages for copyright infringement .
the award could be the highest-ever in such a case .
according to court documents , the sap subsidiary tomorrownow downloaded and copied millions of oracle 's files by posing as clients .
oracle , which is the world 's second-largest maker of business software , sued sap in 2007 , asking the jury for $ 1.7 billion -lrb- 1.27 billion euros -rrb- in damages .
sap admitted that tomorrownow violated copyright laws by wrongfully downloading maintenance software from oracle 's website to avoid paying license fees .
but it argued that damages should be limited to just 30 million euros -lrb- $ 40 million -rrb- , as it did not profit greatly from the copyright violation .
the company has said it was disappointed by the verdict and might appeal .
the case has attracted additional attention because of the recent appointment of former sap chief leo apotheker as ceo of us computer giant hewlett-packard .
during the trial , oracle accused apotheker of involvement in the operations of tomorrownow .
however , it did not seem to produce any evidence of his knowing about the theft .
apotheker did not testify at the trial .
in after-hours trade , oracle 's share price rose 1.5 percent , while that of sap fell 1.4 percent .

now a young german firm aims to join the major league of mining by reactivating abandoned deposits . situated in an office above a music school in heidelberg 's historic city center , the 15 employees of deutsche rohstoff are trying to profit from the rising prices of natural resources .
the company specializes in reactivating defunct sources of oil , gas , gold , silver , high-tech metals like indium or gallium , and rare earth elements .
an exception in a market dominated by large multinational players , deutsche rohstoff has been spending money with essentially no earnings since it was founded in 2006 .
but it has investors ' attention .
a recent sale of 320,000 new shares netted four million euros , with industry giants like the basf chemicals company buying stakes in the business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : titus gebel says there will always be projects larger companies miss " in the long term we want to fill the gap left behind by -lrb- former german mining companies -rrb- preussag and metallgesellschaft , " deutsche rohstoff executive titus gebel told deutsche welle .
" they were globally situated natural resource companies which could hold their own in the first division – or at least in the second division – during the 1980s . "
opportunity from rising prices there was a time when industrialized western countries had significantly more capacity to process their natural resources .
in the 1960s , for instance , germany was europe 's largest producer of oil .
as procurement from africa and asia became cheaper , oil prices dropped and domestic facilities were closed .
gebel , however , believes the rising cost of natural resources will make europe 's own deposits profitable again .
his company is betting on increased demand , which he 's sure is more than a temporary trend .
" because of the economic developments in china and india , the natural resources sector is experiencing what 's called a super-cycle – there will be a boom in the next 20 years . "
europe 's political stability is another factor to be taken into account .
many of the countries which have supplied the global economy with relatively inexpensive natural resources over recent years are politically volatile .
and those that are stable will increasingly choose to keep their resources for domestic production .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as resource prices rise , europe 's political stability will be a valuable asset china , for example , used 8 percent of the world 's demand for metal 16 years ago .
today it uses up to 25 percent .
" representatives from our industry are unified in their opinion , " gebel said .
" if growth in china and also india and brazil continues the way it has been so far , then in the next 25 years we will need to mine as much metal as we have in the combined history of mankind . "
spending without profits investors seem convinced by deutsche rohstoff 's logic .
the company went public in 2010 , and its stock price has risen by 35 percent .
but where are the profits ?
thus far deutsche rohstoff has primarily been investing in identifying investment opportunities and securing the rights to natural resource deposits .
in october it started production at the georgetown gold mine in australia , which is owned by a subsidiary company .
the first batch of gold bars are due to be processed by december and should see the project turn a profit by the end of this year or the next .
rhein petroleum – another affiliated company with oil and gas projects throughout germany – is also expected to generate its first revenues in 2011 , or 2012 at the latest .
when deutsche rohstoff picks a project , it is careful to make sure that production can be started as quickly as possible , according to gebel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche rohstoff picks projects which can be reactivated quickly " we look at deposits which were prospected in the past and calculate out whether modern technology and higher prices make it worthwhile , " he said .
" that way we can drastically shorten the time which customarily exists in mining between prospecting a deposit and beginning production . "
not afraid of big competition the basic idea behind deutsche rohstoff is n't just convincing to individual investors , it seems .
exxon mobile is on board along with glencore , the world 's largest supplier of raw materials , and wintershall , germany 's largest oil and gas trader .
gebel insists he is n't concerned about being squeezed out by from industry giants .
even with their combined forces , there will always be locations licensed for prospecting that major corporations wo n't get around to , he says .
so now small companies are cropping up around the world with plans to mull through archives in search of viable projects which are too small for their enormous counterparts .
one advantage deutsche rohstoff has is good industry contacts and the historic division of germany into a capitalist and communist states .
" it 's very interesting to note that in the area which used to be the former gdr -lrb- german democratic republic -rrb- , the countryside is perforated from where the gdr was searching for uranium and other natural resources , " he said .
" and we can draw on that information today . "
" we 've had access to gdr data .
we knew it existed – but that was n't common knowledge internationally . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 24.11.2010 ireland announces sweeping austerity measures to secure bailout großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are fears that the irish crisis could endanger the euro the irish government has given details of its most stringent austerity plan ever , aimed at saving 15 billion euros over the next four years .
the cuts are necessary to secure a multi-billion-euro international bailout . ireland has set out a four-year plan to save 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- in order to secure an international bailout expected to be in the region of 85 billion euros .
under the national recovery plan , the irish republic aims to bring its budget deficit down from a projected 32 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- to three percent of gdp by 2014 by imposing tax increases , wage cuts and by curbing public spending .
" we can and we will pull through this as we have in the past , " prime minister brian cowen told a news conference in dublin .
" we are a smart , resilient , proud people and we are going to come through this challenge because we love our country . "
finance minister brian lenihan , meanwhile , stressed the urgency of the situation .
" if we do not make these savings , we have no credible way of borrowing money to pay for our social welfare and health and education sectors from the middle of next year , " he said .
optimistic on growth the program is based on an average growth projection of 2.75 percent for the next four years , which some experts say is optimistic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen could have a tough time selling his budget to the opposition " it 's certainly challenging , given the extent of fiscal tightening , which is around 10 percent of gdp , " grant lewis , head of economic research at daiwa capital markets europe told deutsche welle .
" but i think , the eu and the imf will sign up for that , as in the last 15 years , ireland has had a good track record in terms of growth , it 's a flexible economy with a well-educated workforce and good demographics . "
measures include reducing the minimum wage by one euro , slashing public sector jobs and pay and raising the sales tax from 21 percent to 23 percent in 2014 .
under the current tax regime , 45 percent of irish workers do not pay income tax , a situation the government calls " unsustainable " .
the eu 's commissioner for economic and financial affairs , olli rehn , welcomed the program , calling it " a sound basis for the negotiations " on the international bailout .
corporation tax non-negotiable one tax that will not be raised is ireland 's corporation tax - at 12.5 percent the lowest in the european union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banking sector is at the heart of the debt crisis .
" the government remains committed to the 12.5 percent corporation tax rate : it will not be increased under any circumstances , " was the clear message in wednesday 's statement .
it was a magnet for foreign investment during ireland 's boom years , but has been heavily criticized by its european neighbors .
countries like germany say it creates an unfair advantage , especially while ireland is drip-fed by eu bailout funds .
" it 's the heart of ireland 's business model and it 's attracted loads of multinationals .
germany and france as europe 's biggest economies have massive advantages compared to ireland , so its low corporation tax should n't matter so much , " lewis said .
banking sector recovery crucial years of economic growth in ireland , fueled by a property boom and reckless lending practices , turned to bust when the housing market collapsed , exacerbated by the global financial crisis .
ireland is set to take a majority stake of up to 80 percent in top lender bank of ireland that could leave the state with effective control of the country 's top three banks .
allied irish banks could join the anglo-irish bank in being fully nationalized .
lewis believes the irish government may have to do more further down the line .
" the banking sector is the great unknown , it has broken ireland 's back , we 'll have to see how the measures for the banking sector pan out , " lewis told deutsche welle .

chancellor merkel was the target of pointed criticism during the annual budget debate in parliament .
but the conservative poltician rebuked the opposition , insisting her government was on the right political course . speaking during the annual debate on the budget , german chancellor angela merkel defended her center-right coalition 's handling of the economy , saying that after 13 months in power the government was on the right course .
" the economy is growing again and the number of unemployed has dropped to below three million , " said merkel .
merkel also reiterated that budget consolidation was her government 's primary task .
she argued that spending cuts came first but government plans for tax cuts had not been forgotten either .
however she declined to provide a specific timeline for lowering taxes .
the draft for the 2011 budget includes new borrowing of 48.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 64.6 billion -rrb- .
in the current 2010 budget year new borrowing of 50 billion euro is expected .
saving for the future countering opposition criticism that she was " skimping on the future " , merkel said that , on the contrary , she was " saving money to invest in the future . "
in an attack on the opposition green party , which is currently riding high in the opinion polls ahead of a number of state elections in 2011 , merkel sharply criticized what she called its " permanent blockade " politics .
the green 's parliamentary leader , renate kuenast , responded by calling the coalition 's social and ecological policies a " declaration of bankruptcy . "
social democrat parliamentary leader , frank-walter steinmeier said the coalition ruled far beyond its capabilities and that it had " squandered " the electorate 's trust .

analysts say beijing 's influence is not absolute . china is separated from north korea by the yalu river near the northern chinese city of dandong .
however , this river has proven to be less a barrier than a link between the two countries . the bridge over the river has seen goods worth more than one billion us dollars pass over it since the last six months .
north korea has been dependent on china for basic supplies and oil for decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yalu river at dandong separates china from north korea the two countries signed a friendship treaty in 1961 and pyongyang has had beijing 's tacit support ever since .
north korean leader kim jong-il has already visited china twice this year . earlier this year , china used its veto in the united nations security council against an international bid to enforce stronger sanctions against north korea . china 's influence should not be overestimated however , niu jun from the school of international studies at peking university says that although " china has more influence on north korea than any other country , this influence is not absolute . " british north korea expert jasper becker agrees : " kim jong-il does n't trust the chinese .
they are not involved in his inner circle or his decision-making process .
they are excluded from it and he ’ s definitely opposed to the chinese way . " bildunterschrift : china is worried that there will be a deluge of refugees if north korea collapses however , china is worried that a war or the collapse of the north korean regime will lead to a deluge of refugees from across the border .
" we will do our utmost to prevent that , " says shi yinhong from peking university . korean unification is also not an option for china .
if the border between the two divided countries were to fall , us troops would practically be on the chinese border .
this is why beijing is intent on maintaining the status quo , even if beijing has little sympathy for kim jong-il and his family . beijing has refused to condemn north korea for tuesday ’ s artillery attacks but it did urge both sides to show " calm and restraint " and to sit down for talks as soon as possible . japan calls on beijing to restrain pyongyang north korea 's neighbor japan also tried to ease the tension , with prime minister naoto kan calling on china to work with other partners and restrain pyongyang . in a telephone conversation with south korean president lee myung bak , kan underlined his country 's strong ties with washington and seoul . meanwhile , president lee myung bak was criticized at home for his " slow " response to the crisis with south korean defense minister kim tae yung being grilled by parliamentarians over intelligence glitches regarding information about the attack and his inadequate response to north korea ’ s artillery firing . kim said that north korea ’ s attempts to demonstrate its might were just a means for the upcoming leader kim jong-un to show off his status as a strong leader . author : manasi gopalakrishnan editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many south koreans have mixed feelings over how their government should respond to the incident . in a phone call with south korean president lee myung bak , us president barack obama pledged his nation 's support in preventing more provocations from pyongyang on wednesday . the shelling of yeongpyeong island on tuesday , which killed two south korean marines and two civilians , is one of the most serious firefights to take place between the two koreas in decades . some south koreans , such as 64-year-old lee cheon-gu , are very angry about the bloodshed .
" the reason north korea keeps making these provocations is that the south korean government is too lenient , " he says . " seoul has not been strong enough to prevent more attacks from the north after the sinking of the cheonan , " he says .
this attack , which international investigators blame on a north korean torpedo , resulted in the death of 46 sailors in march .
pyongyang has denied any involvement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president barack obama has assured seoul of support part of succession game some analysts say that tuesday 's attack might have something to do with the power transition that is currently underway in the north . however , brian myers , the author of the " the cleanest race , how north koreans see themselves and why it matters , " thinks this is probably a secondary reason . but he concedes that all is not well : " we have heard reports from north korea that many citizens there are not comfortable with the succession ; they are not happy with the way the so-called young general is being presented .
we have heard reports of anti-regime graffiti popping up on walls . " fears about financial ramifications other south koreans seem less concerned with the reasons behind tuesday ’ s deadly attack than about the financial ramifications . bildunterschrift : villagers watched as smoke rose from south korea 's yeonpyeong island on tuesday 35-year-old lee jin-woo does not think " this incident will result in a war between south and north korea .
many incidents like this have happened before .
i am just worried it will hurt the economy here and the stock market . " some do not even believe seoul 's account of what happened on yeonpyeong .
one young woman , who did not want to give her name , said she did not trust her government . " i am not so sure that north korea is really responsible for starting the fires on the island , " she said , adding that she was " sympathetic to the north and would wait for more information before deciding on the truth . " koreans have a sense of allegiance to the nation brian myers thought this general apathy among south koreans or outright denial of north korea 's involvement in attacks could undermine seoul ’ s attempts to unify the people against the kim jong-il regime . " the people here feel much more of a sense of allegiance to the nation , in other words , the korean race , than they do to south korea as a separate republicm , " he explained . " so when north korea attacks south korean territory , they do not feel like they ’ ve been violated by a foreign power .
instead they feel that the governments of pyongyang and seoul have had a disagreement or perhaps a misunderstanding of some kind . " however , for seoul and washington , there is no misunderstanding about what took place .
next week , as a show of strength , the two will hold joint naval drills in the yellow sea , which includes a us nuclear-powered aircraft carrier . author : jason strother -lrb- seoul -rrb- editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press freedom -pipe- 24.11.2010 independent journalism in southeast europe seeks future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw and the southeast europe association hosted the two-day conference the media market in southeastern europe is one of the most dynamic in the world .
however , the independence of balkan journalism is less impressive , as a conference co-hosted by dw has shown . at the close of the " media in southeast europe " conference in bonn , one of the presenters summoned the words of bruce springsteen to characterize the media market in southeast-european countries : " 57 channels and nothing on . "
liana ganea of the romanian media watchdog active watch said that the media in southeastern europe was not only lacking in quality production but also in freedom of speech .
ganea cited the example of romanian tycoon sorin ovidiu vantu , who in 2009 ordered a journalist working for his media group , realitatea-catavencu , to " attack " certain political figures in romania .
" when i tell you to attack somebody , then you have to just attack him , " the multimillionaire commanded his reporter , who was recording the conversation and afterwards made it public .
romania joined the european union in 2007 ; however , ganea said that the situation had gotten worse ever since , mainly due to a " war " and an " earthquake . "
" the ' war ' was the political battle before the presidential election in 2009 , which unfortunately had a very negative impact on the media .
romanian news outlets were completely manipulated and polarized ; journalists were on one side or the other , and they acted like vicious fighters .
and then came the ' earthquake ' : the global economic crisis . "
' sandwiched ' journalism as a result of the desolate financial situation , several media institutions around southeast europe were forced to close departments , with even experienced journalists being laid off .
remzi lani , head of the tirana media organization in albania , told deutsche welle that journalists in his country often pandered to politicians and businessmen - and not the general public " the main problem is media ' clientelism ' - the media is sandwiched between politics and the economy .
it does n't serve the public interest , but rather that of big business and influential politicians .
and who pays the price ?
it 's the public , which is not represented and whose interests are forgotten , " lani said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zurovac is concerned about the influence of religion on reporting in bosnia in every balkan state , the media is officially free but not always independent .
in albania , lani added , corruption is an " inescapable nemesis " to the freedom of reporting .
apart from politics and business , there is a third influence that infringes on independent journalism , according to ljiliana zurovac , head of the press counsel in bosnia .
zurovac told deutsche welle that media coverage in her country was all too often swayed by religious conviction .
" unfortunately -lsb- religion -rsb- is very strong , but not because the religious centers in bosnia are too pushy .
many media organizations are very willing to cooperate ; and this is regardless of the faith , whether islamic , orthodox , or catholic .
independence or survival the diversity of the media market in southeast europe is indeed impressive ; in the capital of bulgaria , for instance , there are over 30 different radio broadcasters for fewer than 1.5 million people .
the online news offerings in bulgaria , as for the other countries in southeast europe , are too expansive for any single person to follow .
however , only very few media outlets are able to survive on their own .
without financial assistance , most private broadcasters and television stations would have already gone bankrupt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ganea said the choice was between independence and survival liana ganea , of active watch in romania , says many media organizations there are forced to choose between journalistic independence and bare survival .
" we have to scrutinize the desolate state of journalism in our country , for this may be the only way to start making changes to it .
we have to talk about the problems of the press openly .
to give our journalists confidence , we have to face the public and discuss our weaknesses .
to find solutions , we have to face the political and economic pressure , " ganea said .
a central part of the bonn conference was the debate on how journalism in southeast europe can be financed in the future while still allowing for independence from business and political interests .
the director the international federation of journalists , renate schroeder , said at the close of the two-day conference that " we all view journalism as a service for the common good , " referring to the federation 's plans to focus more on southeast europe in the future .

lyon will also go through to the next round , just one point behind schalke .
schalke took control of the game from kick-off , racing to a 2-0 lead after just 20 minutes .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer was under a little more pressure in the second half the pressure paid off as farfan scored 14 minutes in , converting a pass from raul and firing home from 11 meters .
six minutes later , klaas-jan huntelaar picked up the ball on the edge of the area and netted schalke 's second goal .
huntelaar added his second goal of the game in an impressive solo effort in the last minutes .
the dutchman was fed a long ball and then held off two lyon defenders before looping the ball over goalkeeper hugo lloris .
the performance was a far cry from their bundesliga season , which sees them at 15th in the league , only having won three of their 13 games .
speaking after the game , schalke coach felix magath said it was " a nice feeling " to be through .

luka modric took the londoners into half time 2-0 up , with a neat dodge around bremen defender sebastian prodl before finding the back of the net .
despite spurs ' gareth bale missing a second-half penalty , peter crouch added a third after 79 minutes .
play-maker lennon set up the goal , getting past his marker to lay the ball back for crouch to finish .
the result sees tottenham through to the final 16 , while bremen were eliminated .

' a good day for space science ' another is the planck satellite , which in 2009 began studying cosmic microwave background radiation left over from the big bang approximately 14 billion years ago .
" it is not an easy time to make such commitments but we should not doubt the wisdom of the -lsb- science programme committee -rsb- in squeezing even more return from the big investments of the past , " said david southwood , esa 's director of science and robotic exploration , in the statement .
" the highest quality science will continue to flow from this armada of spacecraft .
it is a good day for european space science .
europe will continue to play an important part in unlocking the mysteries of our universe . "

a spokesman for the eu 's economic and monetary affairs commissioner , olli rehn , insisted that the euro was a " stable " currency and that its continued existence was not threatened by eurozone debt or banking crises .
he was reacting to a statement by angela merkel , in which the german chancellor said europe was in an " extraordinarily serious situation . "
merkel said germany 's support for ireland was conditional on ireland " making clear what steps -lrb- it -rrb- must take to get back on a path of stabilization . "
merkel added that europe should have the " courage " to set limits on markets by ensuring that private investors bear some of the risk of future eurozone bailouts .
the chancellor said germany would look " positively " on ireland 's request , reportedly worth some 85 billion euros -lrb- 114 billion dollars -rrb- .
future of euro at stake : minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says support for an irish bailout is conditional german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble told the bundestag on tuesday that the future of the euro was " at stake " in the irish crisis .
with its banking system in crisis and its budget deficit forecast to be 10 times the eu limit of three percent of gdp this year , ireland on sunday became the second eurozone member in six months to apply for a bailout after greece .
during wednesday 's parliamentary debate merkel argued in favor of involving private investors to bear some of the risk on government bonds .
merkel reiterated that the european union should set limits on the markets .
the opposition social democrats instead called for more equality on european tax rates .
some eu members states believe that ireland 's low corporate tax rate percent is unfair competition .
with the jury still out on whether germany 's contribution to the greek bailout is compatible with german law , the german constitutional court will be watching how the irish rescue package closely .
in reaction to the irish debt crisis and the portuguese general strike the euro on wednesday sank below 1.33 dollars for the first time in two months .

but in the eyup district , a holy site for muslims , life is veiled in centuries of tradition . it is afternoon in eyup .
the call of the muezzin rings out over the square in front of the mosque .
women in colorful headscarves lead their children by the hand as men with prayer beads amble towards the entrance to the mosque . pairs of newlyweds pose for photos in front of the fountain ; the brides ' wedding dresses shimmering in the sunlight .
a young groom exclaims , " we are here to pray to allah for a good marriage ! "
his mother says softly , " god willing , they will always be a happy couple . " a few meters away , a couple proudly presents their five-year-old son .
the boy looks like a little sultan .
he is wearing a shiny white suit with gold edging and a turban-like headpiece .
in a few days he will participate in the " sunnet " - the turkish circumcision ceremony . before this important event , the boy 's parents take him to the eyup sultan mosque .
" you pray before circumcision - that 's the practice laid down by our prophet , " explains the boy 's father . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eyup is a popular place for wedding ceremonies pilgrims and tourists according to theologian and eyup 's cultural affairs coordinator irfan calisan , the district gets many regular visitors .
each year , eyup is visited by up to four million people - one and a half million in the fasting month of ramadan alone .
" on days of particular religious significance , like the festival of sacrifice , we sometimes have 100,000 visitors per day , " said calisan . muslims flock to eyup not only for special occasions or religious events .
there is also an old tradition , dating back over 500 years , of visiting the gravesite of abu ayyub al-ansari - the companion and standard-bearer of the prophet mohammed , believed to have died there in the seventh century .
the gravesite , located in the mosque 's inner courtyard , dates back to the 15th century .
the eyup district owes its name to this famous religious figure . " many mecca pilgrims make a stopover here , " said calisan .
" we call this tradition from the ottoman times ' little hajj . " ' hopes and prayers traditionally , the abu ayyub al-ansari gravesite is also visited by unmarried and childless women , who come to pray for a husband and offspring , as well as by students and the sick , who pray for good exam results and health . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sarcophagus of abu ayyub al-ansari is an important holy site those who come here have the chance to take advantage of the so-called " wishing window " at the entrance to the abu ayyub al-ansari mausoleum .
they can stand in front of it and pray in the hope of having their wish granted . the graveside is decorated with precious carpets and tiles .
the sarcophagus of abu ayyub al-ansari is in a separate room , behind a silver lattice door .
only the hafiz , the koran reciter , is allowed to enter it .
the mufti of eyup , isa gurler , gave deutsche welle the chance to look inside . " as the prophet left mecca and went to medina , he spent seven months in abu ayyub al-ansari 's house , " explained gurler .
" after the prophet 's death , ansari became a leading islamic scholar .
he told the muslims about the deeds and statements of the prophet . " eternal peace after visiting the gravesite , many pilgrims head to the old cemetery behind the mosque to honor the dead .
only very few can be buried there - it is reserved for special dignitaries .
but the spiritual atmosphere of the place puts a spell on everyone present , regardless of why they are there . irfan calisan smiles wisely .

the company specializes in reactivating defunct sources of oil , gas , gold , silver , high-tech metals like indium or gallium , and rare earth elements .
an exception in a market dominated by large multinational players , deutsche rohstoff has been spending money with essentially no earnings since it was founded in 2006 .
but it has investors ' attention .
a recent sale of 320,000 new shares netted four million euros , with industry giants like the basf chemicals company buying stakes in the business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : titus gebel says there will always be projects larger companies miss " in the long term we want to fill the gap left behind by -lrb- former german mining companies -rrb- preussag and metallgesellschaft , " deutsche rohstoff executive titus gebel told deutsche welle .

opportunity from rising prices there was a time when industrialized western countries had significantly more capacity to process their natural resources .
in the 1960s , for instance , germany was europe 's largest producer of oil .
as procurement from africa and asia became cheaper , oil prices dropped and domestic facilities were closed .
gebel , however , believes the rising cost of natural resources will make europe 's own deposits profitable again .
his company is betting on increased demand , which he 's sure is more than a temporary trend .
" because of the economic developments in china and india , the natural resources sector is experiencing what 's called a super-cycle – there will be a boom in the next 20 years . "
europe 's political stability is another factor to be taken into account .
many of the countries which have supplied the global economy with relatively inexpensive natural resources over recent years are politically volatile .
and those that are stable will increasingly choose to keep their resources for domestic production .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as resource prices rise , europe 's political stability will be a valuable asset china , for example , used 8 percent of the world 's demand for metal 16 years ago .
today it uses up to 25 percent .
" representatives from our industry are unified in their opinion , " gebel said .
" if growth in china and also india and brazil continues the way it has been so far , then in the next 25 years we will need to mine as much metal as we have in the combined history of mankind . "
spending without profits investors seem convinced by deutsche rohstoff 's logic .
the company went public in 2010 , and its stock price has risen by 35 percent .
but where are the profits ?
thus far deutsche rohstoff has primarily been investing in identifying investment opportunities and securing the rights to natural resource deposits .
in october it started production at the georgetown gold mine in australia , which is owned by a subsidiary company .
the first batch of gold bars are due to be processed by december and should see the project turn a profit by the end of this year or the next .
rhein petroleum – another affiliated company with oil and gas projects throughout germany – is also expected to generate its first revenues in 2011 , or 2012 at the latest .
when deutsche rohstoff picks a project , it is careful to make sure that production can be started as quickly as possible , according to gebel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche rohstoff picks projects which can be reactivated quickly " we look at deposits which were prospected in the past and calculate out whether modern technology and higher prices make it worthwhile , " he said .
" that way we can drastically shorten the time which customarily exists in mining between prospecting a deposit and beginning production . "
not afraid of big competition the basic idea behind deutsche rohstoff is n't just convincing to individual investors , it seems .
exxon mobile is on board along with glencore , the world 's largest supplier of raw materials , and wintershall , germany 's largest oil and gas trader .

but in the eyup district , a holy site for muslims , life is veiled in centuries of tradition . it is afternoon in eyup .
the call of the muezzin rings out over the square in front of the mosque .
women in colorful headscarves lead their children by the hand as men with prayer beads amble towards the entrance to the mosque . pairs of newlyweds pose for photos in front of the fountain ; the brides ' wedding dresses shimmering in the sunlight .
a young groom exclaims , " we are here to pray to allah for a good marriage ! "
his mother says softly , " god willing , they will always be a happy couple . " a few meters away , a couple proudly presents their five-year-old son .
the boy looks like a little sultan .
he is wearing a shiny white suit with gold edging and a turban-like headpiece .
in a few days he will participate in the " sunnet " - the turkish circumcision ceremony . before this important event , the boy 's parents take him to the eyup sultan mosque .
" you pray before circumcision - that 's the practice laid down by our prophet , " explains the boy 's father . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eyup is a popular place for wedding ceremonies pilgrims and tourists according to theologian and eyup 's cultural affairs coordinator irfan calisan , the district gets many regular visitors .
each year , eyup is visited by up to four million people - one and a half million in the fasting month of ramadan alone .
" on days of particular religious significance , like the festival of sacrifice , we sometimes have 100,000 visitors per day , " said calisan . muslims flock to eyup not only for special occasions or religious events .
there is also an old tradition , dating back over 500 years , of visiting the gravesite of abu ayyub al-ansari - the companion and standard-bearer of the prophet mohammed , believed to have died there in the seventh century .
the gravesite , located in the mosque 's inner courtyard , dates back to the 15th century .
the eyup district owes its name to this famous religious figure . " many mecca pilgrims make a stopover here , " said calisan .
" we call this tradition from the ottoman times ' little hajj . " ' hopes and prayers traditionally , the abu ayyub al-ansari gravesite is also visited by unmarried and childless women , who come to pray for a husband and offspring , as well as by students and the sick , who pray for good exam results and health . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sarcophagus of abu ayyub al-ansari is an important holy site those who come here have the chance to take advantage of the so-called " wishing window " at the entrance to the abu ayyub al-ansari mausoleum .
they can stand in front of it and pray in the hope of having their wish granted . the graveside is decorated with precious carpets and tiles .
the sarcophagus of abu ayyub al-ansari is in a separate room , behind a silver lattice door .
only the hafiz , the koran reciter , is allowed to enter it .
the mufti of eyup , isa gurler , gave deutsche welle the chance to look inside . " as the prophet left mecca and went to medina , he spent seven months in abu ayyub al-ansari 's house , " explained gurler .
" after the prophet 's death , ansari became a leading islamic scholar .
he told the muslims about the deeds and statements of the prophet . " eternal peace after visiting the gravesite , many pilgrims head to the old cemetery behind the mosque to honor the dead .
only very few can be buried there - it is reserved for special dignitaries .
but the spiritual atmosphere of the place puts a spell on everyone present , regardless of why they are there . irfan calisan smiles wisely .
" that 's how it is in life is - happiness and sorrow are not far from each other .
it 's the same in eyup . " author : claudia hennen -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 24.11.2010 ireland announces sweeping austerity measures to secure bailout großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are fears that the irish crisis could endanger the euro the irish government has given details of its most stringent austerity plan ever , aimed at saving 15 billion euros over the next four years .
the cuts are necessary to secure a multi-billion-euro international bailout . ireland has set out a four-year plan to save 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- in order to secure an international bailout expected to be in the region of 85 billion euros .
under the national recovery plan , the irish republic aims to bring its budget deficit down from a projected 32 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- to three percent of gdp by 2014 by imposing tax increases , wage cuts and by curbing public spending .
" we can and we will pull through this as we have in the past , " prime minister brian cowen told a news conference in dublin .
" we are a smart , resilient , proud people and we are going to come through this challenge because we love our country . "
finance minister brian lenihan , meanwhile , stressed the urgency of the situation .
" if we do not make these savings , we have no credible way of borrowing money to pay for our social welfare and health and education sectors from the middle of next year , " he said .
optimistic on growth the program is based on an average growth projection of 2.75 percent for the next four years , which some experts say is optimistic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen could have a tough time selling his budget to the opposition " it 's certainly challenging , given the extent of fiscal tightening , which is around 10 percent of gdp , " grant lewis , head of economic research at daiwa capital markets europe told deutsche welle .
" but i think , the eu and the imf will sign up for that , as in the last 15 years , ireland has had a good track record in terms of growth , it 's a flexible economy with a well-educated workforce and good demographics . "
measures include reducing the minimum wage by one euro , slashing public sector jobs and pay and raising the sales tax from 21 percent to 23 percent in 2014 .
under the current tax regime , 45 percent of irish workers do not pay income tax , a situation the government calls " unsustainable " .
the eu 's commissioner for economic and financial affairs , olli rehn , welcomed the program , calling it " a sound basis for the negotiations " on the international bailout .
corporation tax non-negotiable one tax that will not be raised is ireland 's corporation tax - at 12.5 percent the lowest in the european union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banking sector is at the heart of the debt crisis .
" the government remains committed to the 12.5 percent corporation tax rate : it will not be increased under any circumstances , " was the clear message in wednesday 's statement .
it was a magnet for foreign investment during ireland 's boom years , but has been heavily criticized by its european neighbors .
countries like germany say it creates an unfair advantage , especially while ireland is drip-fed by eu bailout funds .
" it 's the heart of ireland 's business model and it 's attracted loads of multinationals .
germany and france as europe 's biggest economies have massive advantages compared to ireland , so its low corporation tax should n't matter so much , " lewis said .
banking sector recovery crucial years of economic growth in ireland , fueled by a property boom and reckless lending practices , turned to bust when the housing market collapsed , exacerbated by the global financial crisis .
ireland is set to take a majority stake of up to 80 percent in top lender bank of ireland that could leave the state with effective control of the country 's top three banks .
allied irish banks could join the anglo-irish bank in being fully nationalized .
lewis believes the irish government may have to do more further down the line .
" the banking sector is the great unknown , it has broken ireland 's back , we 'll have to see how the measures for the banking sector pan out , " lewis told deutsche welle .

existing projects studying solar activity and cosmic radiation will still provide data . in a statement posted to its website on monday , the european space agency has decided to extend 11 space-based scientific missions for four more years .
in 2008 , the esa decided that as a cost-cutting measure , scientific missions would be re-evaluated every two years .
the missions will subject to confirmation in late 2012 as part of the regular two-year cycle .
some of the esa 's current missions include the solar and heliospheric observatory -lrb- soho -rrb- , which is a collaborative effort between the european agency and its american counterpart , nasa , to study the sun in detail .
the soho spacecraft is now ensured to be operational so that it can observe the sun during its next solar maximum in 2013 , when it reaches the highest point in its cyclical magnetic activity .
' a good day for space science ' another is the planck satellite , which in 2009 began studying cosmic microwave background radiation left over from the big bang approximately 14 billion years ago .
" it is not an easy time to make such commitments but we should not doubt the wisdom of the -lsb- science programme committee -rsb- in squeezing even more return from the big investments of the past , " said david southwood , esa 's director of science and robotic exploration , in the statement .
" the highest quality science will continue to flow from this armada of spacecraft .
it is a good day for european space science .
europe will continue to play an important part in unlocking the mysteries of our universe . "

the plans have raised the ire of workers , who went on general strike in protest . public sector workers across portugal went on strike on wednesday , disrupting transport and other services including healthcare .
the day-long strike was called by the country 's two biggest unions in protest at the government 's planned austerity measures .
three-quarters of train services and 60 percent of bus services were cancelled , while no flights took off or landed at any airport .
it was the first joint general strike held by the unions since 1988 .
together , they represent around 1.5 million workers .
the head of the main ugt union , joao proenca said , " it is the biggest strike ever staged . "
making the cuts the socialist government wants to implement the austerity program in a bid to cut a high national level of debt .
prime minister jose socrates has vowed to stick by his course of wage cuts and tax hikes , hoping to quash speculation that portugal will be the next european country to need a bailout after ireland and greece .
commenting during the strike , labor minister helena andre said without the austerity measures , " the consequences for the portuguese and the economy will be a great deal worse . "
the government 's austerity budget is due to be finally approved by parliament this week .
the measures include cutting public sector wages by five percent , freezing pensions and raising value added tax from 21 to 23 percent .
portugal has gone through many years of continuous low growth .
its unemployment rate stands at 10.9 percent - the highest since the 1980s - and it could rise further .
even though the economy has shown some growth this year , economists fear that higher taxes and wage cuts could cause a relapse into recession in 2011 as consumer spending falls .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 24.11.2010 ireland bailout reignites fears about the future of the euro großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some irish voters would prefer a lynch to a loan germany has seen a number of its own currencies come and go : the deutschmark , the reichsmark and , before that , the mark .
now some analysts are grumbling that the euro may be on its way out too . this irish rescue package agreed this week – along with the greek bailout earlier in the year - has found the eurozone countries hopelessly divided over the question of how to save the common currency in the long term .
they have good reason to be concerned : the bond markets are n't showing a healthy interest in portugal , another likely bailout candidate .
nor are they particularly impressed with spain , an even bigger economy with a similarly troubling debt load , a high unemployment rate and a stagnating economy .
should these countries also seek relief , the future of the euro could be on the line .
worried in berlin the alarm bells are ringing in berlin .
the german government could end up paying 17 billion euros or more of the expected 90-billion-euro irish rescue package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble is worried about the euro on tuesday , german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble warned lawmakers that the irish debt crisis posed a huge risk .
he said the race to shore up ireland 's banking sector and public finances " puts our common currency at stake . "
the excessive debt levels in greece and now ireland , the minister added , only reinforce germany 's strategy of trimming its budget during a nascent recovery .
but berlin 's austerity strategy has drawn criticism from major partners , including the united states .
so has chancellor angela merkel 's suggestion that , in future euro crises , private bondholders should bear more of the losses .
merkel 's proposal is motivated , in part , by pressure from germany 's constitutional court , which could still declare the government 's participation in european bailouts illegal .
in addition to being promised that the euro would be as stable as the deutschmark , germans were told prior to the deutschmark-euro conversion that there would be a " no bailout clause " that would prevent europe 's richer countries from having to rescue the indigent .
irreconcilable camps with every new day of uncertainty , fears are mounting that the ongoing crisis in europe could lead to the default of individual countries and ultimately the collapse of the eurozone .
a deep divide now runs through the two almost irreconcilable camps : the one led by germany and supported by mainly northern european countries defending a culture of economic and monetary stability ; and the other consisting mostly of southern european countries referred to as piigs – portugal , italy , ireland , greece and spain .
european policymakers are now trying to achieve a consensus between the two camps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the euro still be around in a decade ?
" the europeans have a difficult task , " said friedrich heinemann , a director at the centre for european economic research in mannheim , germany .
" on the one side , they must avoid panics and irrational attacks on solvent governments .
on the other side , they must refrain from establishing a guarantee mechanism , which would smash consolidation incentives . " germany is " aware of both dangers , " heinemann told deutsche welle , and has taken what he calls " a highly responsible position . "
the government , he said , consented to the 750-billion-euro european financial stability facility but insisted on a crisis resolution mechanism that would include creditors in a solution for insolvent countries .
" the latter position may not be popular among highly indebted countries but it is important for the fiscal and political future of europe , " heinemann said .
" euro member countries must remain responsible for their own public finances . "
other analysts agree .
" i think germany is right in wanting to avoid a transfer union , " said marco annunziata , chief economist at unicredit group . there are two possible ways of avoiding this , according to annunziata .
the first , he said , would be to have a true centralization of european fiscal policy – something that would require a greater degree of political union than seems feasible at this stage . the second is to have a framework for sovereign debt restructuring - a credible signal to investors that the next time a eurozone country has difficulties servicing its debt , it will be helped only if at the same time private investors suffer haircuts .
this would make private investors more careful when assessing sovereign risk , and would therefore impose stricter discipline on countries by driving debt spreads wider at the first signs of fiscal indiscipline . " these issues need to be resolved soon , however , " annunziata told deutsche welle .
" otherwise , the risk is that popular support for the eurozone might disintegrate very quickly . " " a more german eurozone " some experts question , though , how big a role germany , europe 's largest economy , should play in stabilizing the eurozone .
turning the eurozone into a larger germany , says philip whyte with the centre for european reform in london , could have adverse consequences - not only for the country itself but also for europe and even the rest of the world .
he maintains that " a more german eurozone " would be afflicted by chronically weak demand , debilitating cycles of competitive wage cuts and prolonged economic slumps in the deficit countries .
like many others , whyte agrees the time has come to make some tough decisions .
" the genius of the european union has been to muddle its way through , " he said .
" i do n't think that muddling is an option this time . "
so should investors unload their euros while they are still worth something ?
expert heinemann is confident the common currency will survive .
" i do n't see the euro breaking apart , " he said .
" or does anybody see the us currency union breaking apart because of the imminent californian bankruptcy ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de raw materials -pipe- 24.11.2010 one man 's scrap is another man 's silver großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silver crystals resulting from the precious-metals recovery process at doduco the firm ami doduco 's primary business is electrical contacts , but it is also a leader in precious-metal recovery .
as raw materials become scarcer , the economic importance of metal recycling is set to increase . the tangled mass of thin metal strips in a waist-high cardboard box has value , allegedly , even though they look like film that has been unspooled and tossed carelessly in a pile .
but bernhard markowis sees money here .
you just have to look closely , he says , reaching into the pile and pulling out a handful .
" there 's a lot of copper in here , " he says , showing it to a visitor .
" but you can see these small silver-colored bits . "
with his index finger he points to small silver splotches , no bigger than the head of a pin .
for 30 years , markowis has recycled precious metals for ami doduco , and for those three decades , he has watched how the manufacturing industry continually puts him and his company to the test .
while silver is found in a variety of industrial and consumer products - refrigerators , ointments and computer keyboards - the concentrations are often so low that it is n't worth the time and effort required to recover the metal .
silver recovery is an expensive process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : material is melted to determine its metal composition in doduco 's recycling area , large furnaces give the place the look of a steel mill .
up to 700 kilos of metal strips can be fed into the furnaces , which are heated to temperatures reaching 1,000 degrees celsius .
the resulting molten metal is then taken to the laboratory , where it is analyzed for precious elements and copper , and their weights are determined .
it is on this basis that doduco charges its clients , who can also choose to take their metal to an independent lab for analysis , if they want .
dirty laundry after the analysis is complete the real recovery work begins .
robert sorber , the product manger for silver powder at doduco , uses a burn-off method or chemical and electrolytic processes to recover the precious metal .
the more the workers processes the worker have to employ to separate the elements , the more expensive it becomes for clients .
sorber compares it to a laundry , where people pay money to get their clothes back clean .
" with us , they get their precious metals back , after they 've paid for the cleaning , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : copper is filtered out of metal plates through an electrolytic process doduco has electrical component production sites in spain , mexico and china , but all precious-metal recovery work is done in germany .
its foreign plants send all of their scrap to the headquarters in pforzheim in southwestern germany , with one important exception : china .
china has long recognized the potential of scrap as an important source of raw materials and does not allow its export .
it stores its scrap for later recycling .
in the past , doduco would only accept scrap that had a silver content of at least five percent , although today , one percent is enough for markowis to fire up his furnaces and start the recovery process .
a global leader in one rectangular basin filled with a bluish liquid , metal plates have been positioned at regular distances from each other and an electric current passes through them .
at their edges , silver crystals are growing .
" when women see this , they usually get pretty excited , " said markowis , looking at his visitor 's face for a second to confirm his observation before continuing .
the plates are lifted out of the liquid once every 20 minutes so the crystals fall off and can be taken out .
if the plates are left alone too long , the crystals would grow until they reached the neighboring plate , which would result in a short circuit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert sorber inspects a container with recovered silver worth about 550,000 euros doduco recycles about 400 tons of silver per year .

if doduco were a country , it would be the world 's 13th largest silver producer , according to armin nittel , head of the company 's precious-metals recovery unit .

nittel thinks there is still room to grow .
he says 60 percent of used silver ends up in garbage dumps .
he wants to lower that number .

at the same time , the price increase makes his job harder as well .
manufacturers are continually looking for new ways to use less silver in their products than they do now .
despite that , the silver content of scrap is still higher than in ore , nittel says .
to recover two to three grams of gold or silver , it is necessary to mine about one ton of rock , while one kilo of scrap will yield the same result .
about one-fifth of silver comes from some kind of recovery process ; with gold , the percentage is even higher .
" recycling is an important factor in ensuring that industry has the amount of precious metals it needs , " nittel said .

as raw materials become scarcer , the economic importance of metal recycling is set to increase . the tangled mass of thin metal strips in a waist-high cardboard box has value , allegedly , even though they look like film that has been unspooled and tossed carelessly in a pile .
but bernhard markowis sees money here .
you just have to look closely , he says , reaching into the pile and pulling out a handful .
" there 's a lot of copper in here , " he says , showing it to a visitor .
" but you can see these small silver-colored bits . "
with his index finger he points to small silver splotches , no bigger than the head of a pin .
for 30 years , markowis has recycled precious metals for ami doduco , and for those three decades , he has watched how the manufacturing industry continually puts him and his company to the test .
while silver is found in a variety of industrial and consumer products - refrigerators , ointments and computer keyboards - the concentrations are often so low that it is n't worth the time and effort required to recover the metal .
silver recovery is an expensive process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : material is melted to determine its metal composition in doduco 's recycling area , large furnaces give the place the look of a steel mill .
up to 700 kilos of metal strips can be fed into the furnaces , which are heated to temperatures reaching 1,000 degrees celsius .
the resulting molten metal is then taken to the laboratory , where it is analyzed for precious elements and copper , and their weights are determined .
it is on this basis that doduco charges its clients , who can also choose to take their metal to an independent lab for analysis , if they want .
dirty laundry after the analysis is complete the real recovery work begins .
robert sorber , the product manger for silver powder at doduco , uses a burn-off method or chemical and electrolytic processes to recover the precious metal .
the more the workers processes the worker have to employ to separate the elements , the more expensive it becomes for clients .
sorber compares it to a laundry , where people pay money to get their clothes back clean .
" with us , they get their precious metals back , after they 've paid for the cleaning , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : copper is filtered out of metal plates through an electrolytic process doduco has electrical component production sites in spain , mexico and china , but all precious-metal recovery work is done in germany .
its foreign plants send all of their scrap to the headquarters in pforzheim in southwestern germany , with one important exception : china .
china has long recognized the potential of scrap as an important source of raw materials and does not allow its export .
it stores its scrap for later recycling .
in the past , doduco would only accept scrap that had a silver content of at least five percent , although today , one percent is enough for markowis to fire up his furnaces and start the recovery process .
a global leader in one rectangular basin filled with a bluish liquid , metal plates have been positioned at regular distances from each other and an electric current passes through them .
at their edges , silver crystals are growing .
" when women see this , they usually get pretty excited , " said markowis , looking at his visitor 's face for a second to confirm his observation before continuing .
the plates are lifted out of the liquid once every 20 minutes so the crystals fall off and can be taken out .
if the plates are left alone too long , the crystals would grow until they reached the neighboring plate , which would result in a short circuit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert sorber inspects a container with recovered silver worth about 550,000 euros doduco recycles about 400 tons of silver per year .
its biggest competitor , the allgemeine gold- und silberscheideanstalt , also based in pforzheim , processes about the same amount .
if doduco were a country , it would be the world 's 13th largest silver producer , according to armin nittel , head of the company 's precious-metals recovery unit .

chancellor merkel was the target of pointed criticism during the annual budget debate in parliament .
but the conservative poltician rebuked the opposition , insisting her government was on the right political course . speaking during the annual debate on the budget , german chancellor angela merkel defended her center-right coalition 's handling of the economy , saying that after 13 months in power the government was on the right course .
" the economy is growing again and the number of unemployed has dropped to below three million , " said merkel .
merkel also reiterated that budget consolidation was her government 's primary task .
she argued that spending cuts came first but government plans for tax cuts had not been forgotten either .
however she declined to provide a specific timeline for lowering taxes .
the draft for the 2011 budget includes new borrowing of 48.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 64.6 billion -rrb- .
in the current 2010 budget year new borrowing of 50 billion euro is expected .
saving for the future countering opposition criticism that she was " skimping on the future " , merkel said that , on the contrary , she was " saving money to invest in the future . "
in an attack on the opposition green party , which is currently riding high in the opinion polls ahead of a number of state elections in 2011 , merkel sharply criticized what she called its " permanent blockade " politics .
the green 's parliamentary leader , renate kuenast , responded by calling the coalition 's social and ecological policies a " declaration of bankruptcy . "
social democrat parliamentary leader , frank-walter steinmeier said the coalition ruled far beyond its capabilities and that it had " squandered " the electorate 's trust .

the missions will subject to confirmation in late 2012 as part of the regular two-year cycle .
some of the esa 's current missions include the solar and heliospheric observatory -lrb- soho -rrb- , which is a collaborative effort between the european agency and its american counterpart , nasa , to study the sun in detail .
the soho spacecraft is now ensured to be operational so that it can observe the sun during its next solar maximum in 2013 , when it reaches the highest point in its cyclical magnetic activity .
' a good day for space science ' another is the planck satellite , which in 2009 began studying cosmic microwave background radiation left over from the big bang approximately 14 billion years ago .
" it is not an easy time to make such commitments but we should not doubt the wisdom of the -lsb- science programme committee -rsb- in squeezing even more return from the big investments of the past , " said david southwood , esa 's director of science and robotic exploration , in the statement .
" the highest quality science will continue to flow from this armada of spacecraft .
it is a good day for european space science .
europe will continue to play an important part in unlocking the mysteries of our universe . "

werder bremen were convincingly defeated 3-0 by tottenham hotspur , eliminating them from the competition . schalke booked their place in the final 16 of the champions league with an impressive 3-0 win over french side , olympique lyon .
despite their poor bundesliga form , schalke reversed their fortunes to top their group and progress to the knock-out round with a game in hand .
lyon will also go through to the next round , just one point behind schalke .
schalke took control of the game from kick-off , racing to a 2-0 lead after just 20 minutes .
early pressure from raul and jefferson farfan exposed the french defense , and schalke threatened goal three times in the first five minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer was under a little more pressure in the second half the pressure paid off as farfan scored 14 minutes in , converting a pass from raul and firing home from 11 meters .
six minutes later , klaas-jan huntelaar picked up the ball on the edge of the area and netted schalke 's second goal .
huntelaar added his second goal of the game in an impressive solo effort in the last minutes .
the dutchman was fed a long ball and then held off two lyon defenders before looping the ball over goalkeeper hugo lloris .
the performance was a far cry from their bundesliga season , which sees them at 15th in the league , only having won three of their 13 games .
speaking after the game , schalke coach felix magath said it was " a nice feeling " to be through .
" for weeks we have been written off , but now we will play in the knockout stage , " magath said .
bremen crushed by spurs meanwhile the other german team in action on wednesday night saw themselves on the receiving end of a 3-0 defeat .

plagued by injury , bremen were on the back foot after just six minutes as younes kaboul gave spurs their first goal , volleying in a cross from aaron lennon at close range .
luka modric took the londoners into half time 2-0 up , with a neat dodge around bremen defender sebastian prodl before finding the back of the net .
despite spurs ' gareth bale missing a second-half penalty , peter crouch added a third after 79 minutes .
play-maker lennon set up the goal , getting past his marker to lay the ball back for crouch to finish .
the result sees tottenham through to the final 16 , while bremen were eliminated .
with one match in the group stage to go , 12 clubs are already through to the knock-out round .
spanish clubs valencia , barcelona and real madrid will join premier league clubs manchester united , chelsea and tottenham hotspurs , italian teams inter milan and ac milan , bundesliga sides schalke and bayern munich and french clubs marseille and olympique lyon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 24.11.2010 ireland announces sweeping austerity measures to secure bailout großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are fears that the irish crisis could endanger the euro the irish government has given details of its most stringent austerity plan ever , aimed at saving 15 billion euros over the next four years .
the cuts are necessary to secure a multi-billion-euro international bailout . ireland has set out a four-year plan to save 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- in order to secure an international bailout expected to be in the region of 85 billion euros .
under the national recovery plan , the irish republic aims to bring its budget deficit down from a projected 32 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- to three percent of gdp by 2014 by imposing tax increases , wage cuts and by curbing public spending .
" we can and we will pull through this as we have in the past , " prime minister brian cowen told a news conference in dublin .
" we are a smart , resilient , proud people and we are going to come through this challenge because we love our country . "
finance minister brian lenihan , meanwhile , stressed the urgency of the situation .
" if we do not make these savings , we have no credible way of borrowing money to pay for our social welfare and health and education sectors from the middle of next year , " he said .
optimistic on growth the program is based on an average growth projection of 2.75 percent for the next four years , which some experts say is optimistic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen could have a tough time selling his budget to the opposition " it 's certainly challenging , given the extent of fiscal tightening , which is around 10 percent of gdp , " grant lewis , head of economic research at daiwa capital markets europe told deutsche welle .
" but i think , the eu and the imf will sign up for that , as in the last 15 years , ireland has had a good track record in terms of growth , it 's a flexible economy with a well-educated workforce and good demographics . "
measures include reducing the minimum wage by one euro , slashing public sector jobs and pay and raising the sales tax from 21 percent to 23 percent in 2014 .
under the current tax regime , 45 percent of irish workers do not pay income tax , a situation the government calls " unsustainable " .
the eu 's commissioner for economic and financial affairs , olli rehn , welcomed the program , calling it " a sound basis for the negotiations " on the international bailout .
corporation tax non-negotiable one tax that will not be raised is ireland 's corporation tax - at 12.5 percent the lowest in the european union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banking sector is at the heart of the debt crisis .
" the government remains committed to the 12.5 percent corporation tax rate : it will not be increased under any circumstances , " was the clear message in wednesday 's statement .
it was a magnet for foreign investment during ireland 's boom years , but has been heavily criticized by its european neighbors .
countries like germany say it creates an unfair advantage , especially while ireland is drip-fed by eu bailout funds .
" it 's the heart of ireland 's business model and it 's attracted loads of multinationals .
germany and france as europe 's biggest economies have massive advantages compared to ireland , so its low corporation tax should n't matter so much , " lewis said .
banking sector recovery crucial years of economic growth in ireland , fueled by a property boom and reckless lending practices , turned to bust when the housing market collapsed , exacerbated by the global financial crisis .
ireland is set to take a majority stake of up to 80 percent in top lender bank of ireland that could leave the state with effective control of the country 's top three banks .
allied irish banks could join the anglo-irish bank in being fully nationalized .
lewis believes the irish government may have to do more further down the line .
" the banking sector is the great unknown , it has broken ireland 's back , we 'll have to see how the measures for the banking sector pan out , " lewis told deutsche welle .

now some analysts are grumbling that the euro may be on its way out too . this irish rescue package agreed this week – along with the greek bailout earlier in the year - has found the eurozone countries hopelessly divided over the question of how to save the common currency in the long term .
they have good reason to be concerned : the bond markets are n't showing a healthy interest in portugal , another likely bailout candidate .
nor are they particularly impressed with spain , an even bigger economy with a similarly troubling debt load , a high unemployment rate and a stagnating economy .
should these countries also seek relief , the future of the euro could be on the line .
worried in berlin the alarm bells are ringing in berlin .
the german government could end up paying 17 billion euros or more of the expected 90-billion-euro irish rescue package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble is worried about the euro on tuesday , german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble warned lawmakers that the irish debt crisis posed a huge risk .
he said the race to shore up ireland 's banking sector and public finances " puts our common currency at stake . "
the excessive debt levels in greece and now ireland , the minister added , only reinforce germany 's strategy of trimming its budget during a nascent recovery .
but berlin 's austerity strategy has drawn criticism from major partners , including the united states .
so has chancellor angela merkel 's suggestion that , in future euro crises , private bondholders should bear more of the losses .
merkel 's proposal is motivated , in part , by pressure from germany 's constitutional court , which could still declare the government 's participation in european bailouts illegal .
in addition to being promised that the euro would be as stable as the deutschmark , germans were told prior to the deutschmark-euro conversion that there would be a " no bailout clause " that would prevent europe 's richer countries from having to rescue the indigent .
irreconcilable camps with every new day of uncertainty , fears are mounting that the ongoing crisis in europe could lead to the default of individual countries and ultimately the collapse of the eurozone .
a deep divide now runs through the two almost irreconcilable camps : the one led by germany and supported by mainly northern european countries defending a culture of economic and monetary stability ; and the other consisting mostly of southern european countries referred to as piigs – portugal , italy , ireland , greece and spain .
european policymakers are now trying to achieve a consensus between the two camps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the euro still be around in a decade ?
" the europeans have a difficult task , " said friedrich heinemann , a director at the centre for european economic research in mannheim , germany .
" on the one side , they must avoid panics and irrational attacks on solvent governments .
on the other side , they must refrain from establishing a guarantee mechanism , which would smash consolidation incentives . " germany is " aware of both dangers , " heinemann told deutsche welle , and has taken what he calls " a highly responsible position . "
the government , he said , consented to the 750-billion-euro european financial stability facility but insisted on a crisis resolution mechanism that would include creditors in a solution for insolvent countries .
" the latter position may not be popular among highly indebted countries but it is important for the fiscal and political future of europe , " heinemann said .
" euro member countries must remain responsible for their own public finances . "
other analysts agree .
" i think germany is right in wanting to avoid a transfer union , " said marco annunziata , chief economist at unicredit group . there are two possible ways of avoiding this , according to annunziata .
the first , he said , would be to have a true centralization of european fiscal policy – something that would require a greater degree of political union than seems feasible at this stage . the second is to have a framework for sovereign debt restructuring - a credible signal to investors that the next time a eurozone country has difficulties servicing its debt , it will be helped only if at the same time private investors suffer haircuts .
this would make private investors more careful when assessing sovereign risk , and would therefore impose stricter discipline on countries by driving debt spreads wider at the first signs of fiscal indiscipline . " these issues need to be resolved soon , however , " annunziata told deutsche welle .
" otherwise , the risk is that popular support for the eurozone might disintegrate very quickly . " " a more german eurozone " some experts question , though , how big a role germany , europe 's largest economy , should play in stabilizing the eurozone .
turning the eurozone into a larger germany , says philip whyte with the centre for european reform in london , could have adverse consequences - not only for the country itself but also for europe and even the rest of the world .
he maintains that " a more german eurozone " would be afflicted by chronically weak demand , debilitating cycles of competitive wage cuts and prolonged economic slumps in the deficit countries .
like many others , whyte agrees the time has come to make some tough decisions .
" the genius of the european union has been to muddle its way through , " he said .
" i do n't think that muddling is an option this time . "
so should investors unload their euros while they are still worth something ?
expert heinemann is confident the common currency will survive .
" i do n't see the euro breaking apart , " he said .
" or does anybody see the us currency union breaking apart because of the imminent californian bankruptcy ?

but in the eyup district , a holy site for muslims , life is veiled in centuries of tradition . it is afternoon in eyup .
the call of the muezzin rings out over the square in front of the mosque .
women in colorful headscarves lead their children by the hand as men with prayer beads amble towards the entrance to the mosque . pairs of newlyweds pose for photos in front of the fountain ; the brides ' wedding dresses shimmering in the sunlight .
a young groom exclaims , " we are here to pray to allah for a good marriage ! "
his mother says softly , " god willing , they will always be a happy couple . " a few meters away , a couple proudly presents their five-year-old son .
the boy looks like a little sultan .
he is wearing a shiny white suit with gold edging and a turban-like headpiece .
in a few days he will participate in the " sunnet " - the turkish circumcision ceremony . before this important event , the boy 's parents take him to the eyup sultan mosque .
" you pray before circumcision - that 's the practice laid down by our prophet , " explains the boy 's father . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eyup is a popular place for wedding ceremonies pilgrims and tourists according to theologian and eyup 's cultural affairs coordinator irfan calisan , the district gets many regular visitors .
each year , eyup is visited by up to four million people - one and a half million in the fasting month of ramadan alone .
" on days of particular religious significance , like the festival of sacrifice , we sometimes have 100,000 visitors per day , " said calisan . muslims flock to eyup not only for special occasions or religious events .
there is also an old tradition , dating back over 500 years , of visiting the gravesite of abu ayyub al-ansari - the companion and standard-bearer of the prophet mohammed , believed to have died there in the seventh century .
the gravesite , located in the mosque 's inner courtyard , dates back to the 15th century .
the eyup district owes its name to this famous religious figure . " many mecca pilgrims make a stopover here , " said calisan .
" we call this tradition from the ottoman times ' little hajj . " ' hopes and prayers traditionally , the abu ayyub al-ansari gravesite is also visited by unmarried and childless women , who come to pray for a husband and offspring , as well as by students and the sick , who pray for good exam results and health . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sarcophagus of abu ayyub al-ansari is an important holy site those who come here have the chance to take advantage of the so-called " wishing window " at the entrance to the abu ayyub al-ansari mausoleum .
they can stand in front of it and pray in the hope of having their wish granted . the graveside is decorated with precious carpets and tiles .
the sarcophagus of abu ayyub al-ansari is in a separate room , behind a silver lattice door .
only the hafiz , the koran reciter , is allowed to enter it .
the mufti of eyup , isa gurler , gave deutsche welle the chance to look inside . " as the prophet left mecca and went to medina , he spent seven months in abu ayyub al-ansari 's house , " explained gurler .
" after the prophet 's death , ansari became a leading islamic scholar .
he told the muslims about the deeds and statements of the prophet . " eternal peace after visiting the gravesite , many pilgrims head to the old cemetery behind the mosque to honor the dead .
only very few can be buried there - it is reserved for special dignitaries .
but the spiritual atmosphere of the place puts a spell on everyone present , regardless of why they are there . irfan calisan smiles wisely .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 24.11.2010 ireland bailout reignites fears about the future of the euro großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some irish voters would prefer a lynch to a loan germany has seen a number of its own currencies come and go : the deutschmark , the reichsmark and , before that , the mark .
now some analysts are grumbling that the euro may be on its way out too . this irish rescue package agreed this week – along with the greek bailout earlier in the year - has found the eurozone countries hopelessly divided over the question of how to save the common currency in the long term .
they have good reason to be concerned : the bond markets are n't showing a healthy interest in portugal , another likely bailout candidate .
nor are they particularly impressed with spain , an even bigger economy with a similarly troubling debt load , a high unemployment rate and a stagnating economy .
should these countries also seek relief , the future of the euro could be on the line .
worried in berlin the alarm bells are ringing in berlin .
the german government could end up paying 17 billion euros or more of the expected 90-billion-euro irish rescue package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble is worried about the euro on tuesday , german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble warned lawmakers that the irish debt crisis posed a huge risk .
he said the race to shore up ireland 's banking sector and public finances " puts our common currency at stake . "
the excessive debt levels in greece and now ireland , the minister added , only reinforce germany 's strategy of trimming its budget during a nascent recovery .
but berlin 's austerity strategy has drawn criticism from major partners , including the united states .
so has chancellor angela merkel 's suggestion that , in future euro crises , private bondholders should bear more of the losses .
merkel 's proposal is motivated , in part , by pressure from germany 's constitutional court , which could still declare the government 's participation in european bailouts illegal .
in addition to being promised that the euro would be as stable as the deutschmark , germans were told prior to the deutschmark-euro conversion that there would be a " no bailout clause " that would prevent europe 's richer countries from having to rescue the indigent .
irreconcilable camps with every new day of uncertainty , fears are mounting that the ongoing crisis in europe could lead to the default of individual countries and ultimately the collapse of the eurozone .
a deep divide now runs through the two almost irreconcilable camps : the one led by germany and supported by mainly northern european countries defending a culture of economic and monetary stability ; and the other consisting mostly of southern european countries referred to as piigs – portugal , italy , ireland , greece and spain .
european policymakers are now trying to achieve a consensus between the two camps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the euro still be around in a decade ?
" the europeans have a difficult task , " said friedrich heinemann , a director at the centre for european economic research in mannheim , germany .
" on the one side , they must avoid panics and irrational attacks on solvent governments .
on the other side , they must refrain from establishing a guarantee mechanism , which would smash consolidation incentives . " germany is " aware of both dangers , " heinemann told deutsche welle , and has taken what he calls " a highly responsible position . "
the government , he said , consented to the 750-billion-euro european financial stability facility but insisted on a crisis resolution mechanism that would include creditors in a solution for insolvent countries .
" the latter position may not be popular among highly indebted countries but it is important for the fiscal and political future of europe , " heinemann said .
" euro member countries must remain responsible for their own public finances . "
other analysts agree .
" i think germany is right in wanting to avoid a transfer union , " said marco annunziata , chief economist at unicredit group . there are two possible ways of avoiding this , according to annunziata .
the first , he said , would be to have a true centralization of european fiscal policy – something that would require a greater degree of political union than seems feasible at this stage . the second is to have a framework for sovereign debt restructuring - a credible signal to investors that the next time a eurozone country has difficulties servicing its debt , it will be helped only if at the same time private investors suffer haircuts .
this would make private investors more careful when assessing sovereign risk , and would therefore impose stricter discipline on countries by driving debt spreads wider at the first signs of fiscal indiscipline . " these issues need to be resolved soon , however , " annunziata told deutsche welle .
" otherwise , the risk is that popular support for the eurozone might disintegrate very quickly . " " a more german eurozone " some experts question , though , how big a role germany , europe 's largest economy , should play in stabilizing the eurozone .
turning the eurozone into a larger germany , says philip whyte with the centre for european reform in london , could have adverse consequences - not only for the country itself but also for europe and even the rest of the world .
he maintains that " a more german eurozone " would be afflicted by chronically weak demand , debilitating cycles of competitive wage cuts and prolonged economic slumps in the deficit countries .
like many others , whyte agrees the time has come to make some tough decisions .
" the genius of the european union has been to muddle its way through , " he said .
" i do n't think that muddling is an option this time . "
so should investors unload their euros while they are still worth something ?
expert heinemann is confident the common currency will survive .
" i do n't see the euro breaking apart , " he said .
" or does anybody see the us currency union breaking apart because of the imminent californian bankruptcy ?

existing projects studying solar activity and cosmic radiation will still provide data . in a statement posted to its website on monday , the european space agency has decided to extend 11 space-based scientific missions for four more years .

a spokesman for the eu 's economic and monetary affairs commissioner , olli rehn , insisted that the euro was a " stable " currency and that its continued existence was not threatened by eurozone debt or banking crises .
he was reacting to a statement by angela merkel , in which the german chancellor said europe was in an " extraordinarily serious situation . "
merkel said germany 's support for ireland was conditional on ireland " making clear what steps -lrb- it -rrb- must take to get back on a path of stabilization . "
merkel added that europe should have the " courage " to set limits on markets by ensuring that private investors bear some of the risk of future eurozone bailouts .
the chancellor said germany would look " positively " on ireland 's request , reportedly worth some 85 billion euros -lrb- 114 billion dollars -rrb- .
future of euro at stake : minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says support for an irish bailout is conditional german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble told the bundestag on tuesday that the future of the euro was " at stake " in the irish crisis .
with its banking system in crisis and its budget deficit forecast to be 10 times the eu limit of three percent of gdp this year , ireland on sunday became the second eurozone member in six months to apply for a bailout after greece .
during wednesday 's parliamentary debate merkel argued in favor of involving private investors to bear some of the risk on government bonds .
merkel reiterated that the european union should set limits on the markets .
the opposition social democrats instead called for more equality on european tax rates .
some eu members states believe that ireland 's low corporate tax rate percent is unfair competition .
with the jury still out on whether germany 's contribution to the greek bailout is compatible with german law , the german constitutional court will be watching how the irish rescue package closely .
in reaction to the irish debt crisis and the portuguese general strike the euro on wednesday sank below 1.33 dollars for the first time in two months .

existing projects studying solar activity and cosmic radiation will still provide data . in a statement posted to its website on monday , the european space agency has decided to extend 11 space-based scientific missions for four more years .
in 2008 , the esa decided that as a cost-cutting measure , scientific missions would be re-evaluated every two years .
the missions will subject to confirmation in late 2012 as part of the regular two-year cycle .
some of the esa 's current missions include the solar and heliospheric observatory -lrb- soho -rrb- , which is a collaborative effort between the european agency and its american counterpart , nasa , to study the sun in detail .
the soho spacecraft is now ensured to be operational so that it can observe the sun during its next solar maximum in 2013 , when it reaches the highest point in its cyclical magnetic activity .
' a good day for space science ' another is the planck satellite , which in 2009 began studying cosmic microwave background radiation left over from the big bang approximately 14 billion years ago .
" it is not an easy time to make such commitments but we should not doubt the wisdom of the -lsb- science programme committee -rsb- in squeezing even more return from the big investments of the past , " said david southwood , esa 's director of science and robotic exploration , in the statement .
" the highest quality science will continue to flow from this armada of spacecraft .
it is a good day for european space science .
europe will continue to play an important part in unlocking the mysteries of our universe . "

werder bremen were convincingly defeated 3-0 by tottenham hotspur , eliminating them from the competition . schalke booked their place in the final 16 of the champions league with an impressive 3-0 win over french side , olympique lyon .
despite their poor bundesliga form , schalke reversed their fortunes to top their group and progress to the knock-out round with a game in hand .
lyon will also go through to the next round , just one point behind schalke .
schalke took control of the game from kick-off , racing to a 2-0 lead after just 20 minutes .
early pressure from raul and jefferson farfan exposed the french defense , and schalke threatened goal three times in the first five minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer was under a little more pressure in the second half the pressure paid off as farfan scored 14 minutes in , converting a pass from raul and firing home from 11 meters .
six minutes later , klaas-jan huntelaar picked up the ball on the edge of the area and netted schalke 's second goal .
huntelaar added his second goal of the game in an impressive solo effort in the last minutes .
the dutchman was fed a long ball and then held off two lyon defenders before looping the ball over goalkeeper hugo lloris .
the performance was a far cry from their bundesliga season , which sees them at 15th in the league , only having won three of their 13 games .
speaking after the game , schalke coach felix magath said it was " a nice feeling " to be through .
" for weeks we have been written off , but now we will play in the knockout stage , " magath said .
bremen crushed by spurs meanwhile the other german team in action on wednesday night saw themselves on the receiving end of a 3-0 defeat .

plagued by injury , bremen were on the back foot after just six minutes as younes kaboul gave spurs their first goal , volleying in a cross from aaron lennon at close range .
luka modric took the londoners into half time 2-0 up , with a neat dodge around bremen defender sebastian prodl before finding the back of the net .
despite spurs ' gareth bale missing a second-half penalty , peter crouch added a third after 79 minutes .
play-maker lennon set up the goal , getting past his marker to lay the ball back for crouch to finish .
the result sees tottenham through to the final 16 , while bremen were eliminated .
with one match in the group stage to go , 12 clubs are already through to the knock-out round .
spanish clubs valencia , barcelona and real madrid will join premier league clubs manchester united , chelsea and tottenham hotspurs , italian teams inter milan and ac milan , bundesliga sides schalke and bayern munich and french clubs marseille and olympique lyon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 24.11.2010 ireland bailout reignites fears about the future of the euro großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some irish voters would prefer a lynch to a loan germany has seen a number of its own currencies come and go : the deutschmark , the reichsmark and , before that , the mark .
now some analysts are grumbling that the euro may be on its way out too . this irish rescue package agreed this week – along with the greek bailout earlier in the year - has found the eurozone countries hopelessly divided over the question of how to save the common currency in the long term .
they have good reason to be concerned : the bond markets are n't showing a healthy interest in portugal , another likely bailout candidate .
nor are they particularly impressed with spain , an even bigger economy with a similarly troubling debt load , a high unemployment rate and a stagnating economy .
should these countries also seek relief , the future of the euro could be on the line .
worried in berlin the alarm bells are ringing in berlin .
the german government could end up paying 17 billion euros or more of the expected 90-billion-euro irish rescue package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble is worried about the euro on tuesday , german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble warned lawmakers that the irish debt crisis posed a huge risk .
he said the race to shore up ireland 's banking sector and public finances " puts our common currency at stake . "
the excessive debt levels in greece and now ireland , the minister added , only reinforce germany 's strategy of trimming its budget during a nascent recovery .
but berlin 's austerity strategy has drawn criticism from major partners , including the united states .
so has chancellor angela merkel 's suggestion that , in future euro crises , private bondholders should bear more of the losses .
merkel 's proposal is motivated , in part , by pressure from germany 's constitutional court , which could still declare the government 's participation in european bailouts illegal .
in addition to being promised that the euro would be as stable as the deutschmark , germans were told prior to the deutschmark-euro conversion that there would be a " no bailout clause " that would prevent europe 's richer countries from having to rescue the indigent .
irreconcilable camps with every new day of uncertainty , fears are mounting that the ongoing crisis in europe could lead to the default of individual countries and ultimately the collapse of the eurozone .
a deep divide now runs through the two almost irreconcilable camps : the one led by germany and supported by mainly northern european countries defending a culture of economic and monetary stability ; and the other consisting mostly of southern european countries referred to as piigs – portugal , italy , ireland , greece and spain .
european policymakers are now trying to achieve a consensus between the two camps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the euro still be around in a decade ?
" the europeans have a difficult task , " said friedrich heinemann , a director at the centre for european economic research in mannheim , germany .
" on the one side , they must avoid panics and irrational attacks on solvent governments .
on the other side , they must refrain from establishing a guarantee mechanism , which would smash consolidation incentives . " germany is " aware of both dangers , " heinemann told deutsche welle , and has taken what he calls " a highly responsible position . "
the government , he said , consented to the 750-billion-euro european financial stability facility but insisted on a crisis resolution mechanism that would include creditors in a solution for insolvent countries .
" the latter position may not be popular among highly indebted countries but it is important for the fiscal and political future of europe , " heinemann said .
" euro member countries must remain responsible for their own public finances . "
other analysts agree .
" i think germany is right in wanting to avoid a transfer union , " said marco annunziata , chief economist at unicredit group . there are two possible ways of avoiding this , according to annunziata .
the first , he said , would be to have a true centralization of european fiscal policy – something that would require a greater degree of political union than seems feasible at this stage . the second is to have a framework for sovereign debt restructuring - a credible signal to investors that the next time a eurozone country has difficulties servicing its debt , it will be helped only if at the same time private investors suffer haircuts .
this would make private investors more careful when assessing sovereign risk , and would therefore impose stricter discipline on countries by driving debt spreads wider at the first signs of fiscal indiscipline . " these issues need to be resolved soon , however , " annunziata told deutsche welle .
" otherwise , the risk is that popular support for the eurozone might disintegrate very quickly . " " a more german eurozone " some experts question , though , how big a role germany , europe 's largest economy , should play in stabilizing the eurozone .
turning the eurozone into a larger germany , says philip whyte with the centre for european reform in london , could have adverse consequences - not only for the country itself but also for europe and even the rest of the world .
he maintains that " a more german eurozone " would be afflicted by chronically weak demand , debilitating cycles of competitive wage cuts and prolonged economic slumps in the deficit countries .
like many others , whyte agrees the time has come to make some tough decisions .
" the genius of the european union has been to muddle its way through , " he said .
" i do n't think that muddling is an option this time . "
so should investors unload their euros while they are still worth something ?
expert heinemann is confident the common currency will survive .
" i do n't see the euro breaking apart , " he said .
" or does anybody see the us currency union breaking apart because of the imminent californian bankruptcy ?

now a young german firm aims to join the major league of mining by reactivating abandoned deposits . situated in an office above a music school in heidelberg 's historic city center , the 15 employees of deutsche rohstoff are trying to profit from the rising prices of natural resources .
the company specializes in reactivating defunct sources of oil , gas , gold , silver , high-tech metals like indium or gallium , and rare earth elements .
an exception in a market dominated by large multinational players , deutsche rohstoff has been spending money with essentially no earnings since it was founded in 2006 .
but it has investors ' attention .
a recent sale of 320,000 new shares netted four million euros , with industry giants like the basf chemicals company buying stakes in the business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : titus gebel says there will always be projects larger companies miss " in the long term we want to fill the gap left behind by -lrb- former german mining companies -rrb- preussag and metallgesellschaft , " deutsche rohstoff executive titus gebel told deutsche welle .
" they were globally situated natural resource companies which could hold their own in the first division – or at least in the second division – during the 1980s . "
opportunity from rising prices there was a time when industrialized western countries had significantly more capacity to process their natural resources .
in the 1960s , for instance , germany was europe 's largest producer of oil .
as procurement from africa and asia became cheaper , oil prices dropped and domestic facilities were closed .
gebel , however , believes the rising cost of natural resources will make europe 's own deposits profitable again .
his company is betting on increased demand , which he 's sure is more than a temporary trend .
" because of the economic developments in china and india , the natural resources sector is experiencing what 's called a super-cycle – there will be a boom in the next 20 years . "
europe 's political stability is another factor to be taken into account .
many of the countries which have supplied the global economy with relatively inexpensive natural resources over recent years are politically volatile .
and those that are stable will increasingly choose to keep their resources for domestic production .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as resource prices rise , europe 's political stability will be a valuable asset china , for example , used 8 percent of the world 's demand for metal 16 years ago .
today it uses up to 25 percent .
" representatives from our industry are unified in their opinion , " gebel said .
" if growth in china and also india and brazil continues the way it has been so far , then in the next 25 years we will need to mine as much metal as we have in the combined history of mankind . "
spending without profits investors seem convinced by deutsche rohstoff 's logic .
the company went public in 2010 , and its stock price has risen by 35 percent .
but where are the profits ?
thus far deutsche rohstoff has primarily been investing in identifying investment opportunities and securing the rights to natural resource deposits .
in october it started production at the georgetown gold mine in australia , which is owned by a subsidiary company .
the first batch of gold bars are due to be processed by december and should see the project turn a profit by the end of this year or the next .
rhein petroleum – another affiliated company with oil and gas projects throughout germany – is also expected to generate its first revenues in 2011 , or 2012 at the latest .
when deutsche rohstoff picks a project , it is careful to make sure that production can be started as quickly as possible , according to gebel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche rohstoff picks projects which can be reactivated quickly " we look at deposits which were prospected in the past and calculate out whether modern technology and higher prices make it worthwhile , " he said .
" that way we can drastically shorten the time which customarily exists in mining between prospecting a deposit and beginning production . "
not afraid of big competition the basic idea behind deutsche rohstoff is n't just convincing to individual investors , it seems .
exxon mobile is on board along with glencore , the world 's largest supplier of raw materials , and wintershall , germany 's largest oil and gas trader .
gebel insists he is n't concerned about being squeezed out by from industry giants .
even with their combined forces , there will always be locations licensed for prospecting that major corporations wo n't get around to , he says .
so now small companies are cropping up around the world with plans to mull through archives in search of viable projects which are too small for their enormous counterparts .
one advantage deutsche rohstoff has is good industry contacts and the historic division of germany into a capitalist and communist states .
" it 's very interesting to note that in the area which used to be the former gdr -lrb- german democratic republic -rrb- , the countryside is perforated from where the gdr was searching for uranium and other natural resources , " he said .
" and we can draw on that information today . "
" we 've had access to gdr data .
we knew it existed – but that was n't common knowledge internationally . "

existing projects studying solar activity and cosmic radiation will still provide data . in a statement posted to its website on monday , the european space agency has decided to extend 11 space-based scientific missions for four more years .
in 2008 , the esa decided that as a cost-cutting measure , scientific missions would be re-evaluated every two years .
the missions will subject to confirmation in late 2012 as part of the regular two-year cycle .
some of the esa 's current missions include the solar and heliospheric observatory -lrb- soho -rrb- , which is a collaborative effort between the european agency and its american counterpart , nasa , to study the sun in detail .
the soho spacecraft is now ensured to be operational so that it can observe the sun during its next solar maximum in 2013 , when it reaches the highest point in its cyclical magnetic activity .
' a good day for space science ' another is the planck satellite , which in 2009 began studying cosmic microwave background radiation left over from the big bang approximately 14 billion years ago .
" it is not an easy time to make such commitments but we should not doubt the wisdom of the -lsb- science programme committee -rsb- in squeezing even more return from the big investments of the past , " said david southwood , esa 's director of science and robotic exploration , in the statement .
" the highest quality science will continue to flow from this armada of spacecraft .
it is a good day for european space science .
europe will continue to play an important part in unlocking the mysteries of our universe . "
