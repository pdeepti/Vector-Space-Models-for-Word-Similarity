" i ask myself why it was not possible in the conservative camp to agree with the spd on gauck , " he told der spiegel magazine .
" i personally have huge sympathies for joachim gauck , " holger zastrow , head of the market-friendly liberal fdp , the cdu 's government coalition partner , in the state of saxony told newspaper welt am sonntag .
" we 're not going to automatically back christian wulff -lrb- the governing coalition 's candidate backed by chancellor merkel -rrb- . "
in an interview with deutsche welle on friday , gauck said the next president would have to restore people 's faith in politics .
" i do n't like this increasing divide between the political class and the average population , and many people in germany do n't like it either , " he said .
" we all have to work together to change this , to make sure that the people and the politicians come closer together . "
gauck also criticized a " mindset of worry " present in much of western europe .
" here , the presidential office can play a bigger role than others to banish fear and say to the people that they wo n't be victims of their own trepidation , but that they have a number of possibilities " he said .
" fear makes you short-sighted … and that 's why we need a broader effort to empower the people to find ways out of this crisis . "
not a mere politician the head of the social democrats , sigmar gabriel , praised gauck as someone " who comes with a full life to his candidacy , not just a political career . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gauck has the backing of the social democrats and the greens after reunification in 1990 , the 70-year-old gauck became the head of the stasi archives and led the organization that catalogues and analyzes documents from east germany 's secret police .
gauck , a protestant pastor from the former east , was a well-known civil rights activist before reunification .
he was a member of the new forum , a democratic opposition movement in east germany .
former german foreign minister and head of the social democrats in parliament , frank-walter steinmeier , said he is confident that gauck will gain broad support .
" i 'm sure he will not only be supported by the public , but that he will also motivate a few people in the federal convention to consider if their decision should be based on narrow-minded party political arguments . "
the social democrats as well as the greens criticized chancellor angela merkel 's government for choosing their candidate based on political aspects rather than suitability .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the support of the ruling coalition , wulff is likely to become the next german president government candidate germany 's governing coalition on thursday announced their candidate for president , the state premier of lower saxony , christian wulff .
chancellor angela merkel led the proposals for wulff as the successor to horst koehler , who resigned unexpectedly at the start of the week .
wulff has governed the state of lower saxony since 2003 and would be germany 's youngest-ever president .
he is a deputy leader of merkel 's christian democrat party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
in accepting the nomination , wulff said the office of president was " a great duty , with great responsibility . "
he added he " looked forward to the challenge " and would try to " bring optimism in difficult times . "
next stages the federal convention is scheduled to vote on the new president june 30 .
the assembly is made up of 1,244 state and federal lawmakers , and merkel 's coalition has a majority .
the role of the german president is largely ceremonial , although the president does sign off on legislation and is seen as a figurehead on national issues .

in its enthusiasm for fiscal discipline within the eu , the german government is promising to dramatically reduce its deficit .
" it 's vital that we readjust the balance between investment in the future and social welfare handouts , " said merkel .
" that can not just be done by simply increasing the revenue side .
it has to happen by making the structures of social security more efficient , " she said .

friedrich has suggested that income taxes on high earners could be increased .
in an interview with the german newspaper bild am sonntag , to be published sunday , stefan mappus , premier of the state of baden-wuerttemberg and a member of merkel 's christian democrats , said sales taxes could be raised on certain consumer products that are currently taxed at a low rate .

secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said nato 's doors " remain open , " despite the ukrainian parliament 's approval of a bill preventing the country from joining nato .
the move was widely seen as further evidence the new government in kyiv is overturning the previous government 's pro-western policies .
the draft law is expected to be signed by ukrainian president victor yanukovych in the weeks to come .
the bill excludes the goal of integration into euro-atlantic security and nato membership .
nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said nato would take no decision to reverse the bucharest agreement , welcoming membership for both ukraine and georgia .
" the bucharest decision still stands .
we have no intention to change that decision … .our door remains open , " rasmussen said .
an open door but the nato chief also stressed the organization is voluntary .
" it 's for each individual country in europe to decide its alliance affiliation , which means that it 's also for ukraine to decide how its relationship with nato should develop in the coming years , " rasmussen added .
ukraine 's decision to shelve its plans to join nato was crafted by the president himself .
the parliamentary bill commits ukraine to " a non-bloc policy which means non-participation in military-political alliances . "

" i ask myself why it was not possible in the conservative camp to agree with the spd on gauck , " he told der spiegel magazine .
" i personally have huge sympathies for joachim gauck , " holger zastrow , head of the market-friendly liberal fdp , the cdu 's government coalition partner , in the state of saxony told newspaper welt am sonntag .
" we 're not going to automatically back christian wulff -lrb- the governing coalition 's candidate backed by chancellor merkel -rrb- . "
in an interview with deutsche welle on friday , gauck said the next president would have to restore people 's faith in politics .
" i do n't like this increasing divide between the political class and the average population , and many people in germany do n't like it either , " he said .
" we all have to work together to change this , to make sure that the people and the politicians come closer together . "
gauck also criticized a " mindset of worry " present in much of western europe .
" here , the presidential office can play a bigger role than others to banish fear and say to the people that they wo n't be victims of their own trepidation , but that they have a number of possibilities " he said .
" fear makes you short-sighted … and that 's why we need a broader effort to empower the people to find ways out of this crisis . "
not a mere politician the head of the social democrats , sigmar gabriel , praised gauck as someone " who comes with a full life to his candidacy , not just a political career . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gauck has the backing of the social democrats and the greens after reunification in 1990 , the 70-year-old gauck became the head of the stasi archives and led the organization that catalogues and analyzes documents from east germany 's secret police .
gauck , a protestant pastor from the former east , was a well-known civil rights activist before reunification .
he was a member of the new forum , a democratic opposition movement in east germany .
former german foreign minister and head of the social democrats in parliament , frank-walter steinmeier , said he is confident that gauck will gain broad support .
" i 'm sure he will not only be supported by the public , but that he will also motivate a few people in the federal convention to consider if their decision should be based on narrow-minded party political arguments . "
the social democrats as well as the greens criticized chancellor angela merkel 's government for choosing their candidate based on political aspects rather than suitability .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the support of the ruling coalition , wulff is likely to become the next german president government candidate germany 's governing coalition on thursday announced their candidate for president , the state premier of lower saxony , christian wulff .
chancellor angela merkel led the proposals for wulff as the successor to horst koehler , who resigned unexpectedly at the start of the week .
wulff has governed the state of lower saxony since 2003 and would be germany 's youngest-ever president .
he is a deputy leader of merkel 's christian democrat party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
in accepting the nomination , wulff said the office of president was " a great duty , with great responsibility . "
he added he " looked forward to the challenge " and would try to " bring optimism in difficult times . "
next stages the federal convention is scheduled to vote on the new president june 30 .
the assembly is made up of 1,244 state and federal lawmakers , and merkel 's coalition has a majority .
the role of the german president is largely ceremonial , although the president does sign off on legislation and is seen as a figurehead on national issues .

the meeting , which was designed to work out an agenda for the g20 summit in toronto , canada , at the end of the month , produced a communique that endorses the need for budgetary discipline and regulation of financial markets , but shies away from a global bank levy proposed by the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , european countries , including germany , and the us .
resistance to global bank levy canada and australia are among those opposed to such a levy , as they believe they should not have to pay to clear up a mess they did not create .
canada 's finance minister jim flaherty told reporters that the debate on the bank levy had been " a distraction from core issues " and that most ministers " do not support the concept of a universal levy . "
german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , however , insisted that regulating the banking industry must remain a global priority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble has defended germany 's tough stance on fiscal restraint " i pointed out that we will need to make a decision in toronto , " he told the reuters news agency .
" there 's a lot of pressure to even go beyond a levy and impose a tax on banks , " he added .
balancing budgets and stimulating growth the g20 communique calls on member states to get their finances in order to reduce billowing budget deficits , while stimulating growth at the same time .
the imf and the united states in particular , have repeatedly called on low-growth economies like germany to boost domestic demand .
germany is europe 's top exporter , but consumer spending is traditionally lackluster , thus creating an imbalance in the country 's trade balance .
but schaeuble again dismissed the criticism , insisting that " we have to look at europe , or at least the eurozone , as a whole , " he told reuters , meaning that the trade balance of the entire eurozone shows no imbalances with other parts of the world .

" here , the presidential office can play a bigger role than others to banish fear and say to the people that they wo n't be victims of their own trepidation , but that they have a number of possibilities " he said .
" fear makes you short-sighted … and that 's why we need a broader effort to empower the people to find ways out of this crisis . "

" i 'm sure he will not only be supported by the public , but that he will also motivate a few people in the federal convention to consider if their decision should be based on narrow-minded party political arguments . "
the social democrats as well as the greens criticized chancellor angela merkel 's government for choosing their candidate based on political aspects rather than suitability .

" i ask myself why it was not possible in the conservative camp to agree with the spd on gauck , " he told der spiegel magazine .
" i personally have huge sympathies for joachim gauck , " holger zastrow , head of the market-friendly liberal fdp , the cdu 's government coalition partner , in the state of saxony told newspaper welt am sonntag .
" we 're not going to automatically back christian wulff -lrb- the governing coalition 's candidate backed by chancellor merkel -rrb- . "
in an interview with deutsche welle on friday , gauck said the next president would have to restore people 's faith in politics .
" i do n't like this increasing divide between the political class and the average population , and many people in germany do n't like it either , " he said .
" we all have to work together to change this , to make sure that the people and the politicians come closer together . "
gauck also criticized a " mindset of worry " present in much of western europe .
" here , the presidential office can play a bigger role than others to banish fear and say to the people that they wo n't be victims of their own trepidation , but that they have a number of possibilities " he said .
" fear makes you short-sighted … and that 's why we need a broader effort to empower the people to find ways out of this crisis . "

gauck , a protestant pastor from the former east , was a well-known civil rights activist before reunification .
he was a member of the new forum , a democratic opposition movement in east germany .
former german foreign minister and head of the social democrats in parliament , frank-walter steinmeier , said he is confident that gauck will gain broad support .
" i 'm sure he will not only be supported by the public , but that he will also motivate a few people in the federal convention to consider if their decision should be based on narrow-minded party political arguments . "
the social democrats as well as the greens criticized chancellor angela merkel 's government for choosing their candidate based on political aspects rather than suitability .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the support of the ruling coalition , wulff is likely to become the next german president government candidate germany 's governing coalition on thursday announced their candidate for president , the state premier of lower saxony , christian wulff .
chancellor angela merkel led the proposals for wulff as the successor to horst koehler , who resigned unexpectedly at the start of the week .
wulff has governed the state of lower saxony since 2003 and would be germany 's youngest-ever president .
he is a deputy leader of merkel 's christian democrat party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
in accepting the nomination , wulff said the office of president was " a great duty , with great responsibility . "
he added he " looked forward to the challenge " and would try to " bring optimism in difficult times . "
next stages the federal convention is scheduled to vote on the new president june 30 .
the assembly is made up of 1,244 state and federal lawmakers , and merkel 's coalition has a majority .
the role of the german president is largely ceremonial , although the president does sign off on legislation and is seen as a figurehead on national issues .

the meeting , which was designed to work out an agenda for the g20 summit in toronto , canada , at the end of the month , produced a communique that endorses the need for budgetary discipline and regulation of financial markets , but shies away from a global bank levy proposed by the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , european countries , including germany , and the us .
resistance to global bank levy canada and australia are among those opposed to such a levy , as they believe they should not have to pay to clear up a mess they did not create .
canada 's finance minister jim flaherty told reporters that the debate on the bank levy had been " a distraction from core issues " and that most ministers " do not support the concept of a universal levy . "
german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , however , insisted that regulating the banking industry must remain a global priority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble has defended germany 's tough stance on fiscal restraint " i pointed out that we will need to make a decision in toronto , " he told the reuters news agency .
" there 's a lot of pressure to even go beyond a levy and impose a tax on banks , " he added .
balancing budgets and stimulating growth the g20 communique calls on member states to get their finances in order to reduce billowing budget deficits , while stimulating growth at the same time .
the imf and the united states in particular , have repeatedly called on low-growth economies like germany to boost domestic demand .
germany is europe 's top exporter , but consumer spending is traditionally lackluster , thus creating an imbalance in the country 's trade balance .
but schaeuble again dismissed the criticism , insisting that " we have to look at europe , or at least the eurozone , as a whole , " he told reuters , meaning that the trade balance of the entire eurozone shows no imbalances with other parts of the world .

" i ask myself why it was not possible in the conservative camp to agree with the spd on gauck , " he told der spiegel magazine .
" i personally have huge sympathies for joachim gauck , " holger zastrow , head of the market-friendly liberal fdp , the cdu 's government coalition partner , in the state of saxony told newspaper welt am sonntag .
" we 're not going to automatically back christian wulff -lrb- the governing coalition 's candidate backed by chancellor merkel -rrb- . "
in an interview with deutsche welle on friday , gauck said the next president would have to restore people 's faith in politics .
" i do n't like this increasing divide between the political class and the average population , and many people in germany do n't like it either , " he said .
" we all have to work together to change this , to make sure that the people and the politicians come closer together . "
gauck also criticized a " mindset of worry " present in much of western europe .
" here , the presidential office can play a bigger role than others to banish fear and say to the people that they wo n't be victims of their own trepidation , but that they have a number of possibilities " he said .
" fear makes you short-sighted … and that 's why we need a broader effort to empower the people to find ways out of this crisis . "
not a mere politician the head of the social democrats , sigmar gabriel , praised gauck as someone " who comes with a full life to his candidacy , not just a political career . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gauck has the backing of the social democrats and the greens after reunification in 1990 , the 70-year-old gauck became the head of the stasi archives and led the organization that catalogues and analyzes documents from east germany 's secret police .
gauck , a protestant pastor from the former east , was a well-known civil rights activist before reunification .
he was a member of the new forum , a democratic opposition movement in east germany .
former german foreign minister and head of the social democrats in parliament , frank-walter steinmeier , said he is confident that gauck will gain broad support .
" i 'm sure he will not only be supported by the public , but that he will also motivate a few people in the federal convention to consider if their decision should be based on narrow-minded party political arguments . "

we look back at how the radio and tv corporation was born in post-war germany . just like the nation itself , public service broadcasters in the federal republic of germany grew up as separate insitutions in the various federal states .
sixty years ago this week , on 5th june 1950 , representatives of the individual regional radio stations came together to create the allgemeine rundfunkanstalt deutschlands -lrb- general german broadcasting corporation -rrb- .
the ard became the first nationwide public service broadcasting corporation .
the aim : to provide a platform for serious , independent , objective reporting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regional broadcasters form the core element of the overall system in germany " it is our deep conviction that radio stations should no longer be a mouth-piece of the respective government , " said the american controlling officer at the time , edmund schaechter .
" stations should represent every level of society and give all political groups and parties the opportunity to voice their opinion . "
the allies ' restructuring of german broadcasters german public sevice broadcasting was shaped by the post-war landscape .
in the aftermath of the second world war one of the immediate priorities for the allies was to break up the existing nazi structures .
radio was targeted in particular , because it had been abused as a propaganda tool during the third reich .
the allies were keen to re-establish radio as independent from the state , to act as a critical voice and to try to prevent extremism ever taking hold again .
in west germany , public service broadcasting was established on french , british and american models , notably the bbc .
the resulting ard united the various regional broadcasters , and for years , television viewers could only watch regional programmes , and one national programme .
only much later was competion established in the form of a second public broadcaster -lrb- in 1963 -rrb- and commercial broadcasting -lrb- in 1984 -rrb- .
in east germany , on the other side of the iron curtain , a separate system developed , along soviet lines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tagesschau has long established itself as germany 's main news show the western allies wanted the german public broadcaster to represent the whole of society , and reflect a range of views and political opinions .
independence from the state and political objectivity remain the hallmark of public service broadcasting in germany today .
however , politicians and parties have been accused over the decades of using public service broadcasters for their own means .
there is controversy over party political broadcasts which are aired in the run up to elections .
they are said to be propaganda for the parties .
but ard justifies this saying they are not responsible for the content .
furthermore , politicians sitting on the broadcasting council , have considerable influence over the choice for who runs the public service broadcaster .
it is not uncommon , therefore , that the top spot goes to someone who belongs to the most influential party at the time .
the federal structure of public service broadcasting in germany is seen as one of its key strengths , and has remained in place since its foundation .
the individual regional broadcasters are still responsible for their programmes .
they are largely protected from the long arm of the state by a guaranteed funding sytem .
a huge operation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular tv series such as tatort continue to top the ratings lists ard , the first german public service broadcaster , started out as a small institution .
the 9 regional stations now employ around 20,000 staff members , and many more freelancers .
they produce 11 television channels , 55 radio stations and have 16 orchestras and choirs under their belt .
the total budget for the public service broadcasters is around 6.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.7 billion -rrb- a year .
ard has a network of correspondents in 30 countries , as well as studios across germany .
in its 60 year history , ard has managed to establish itself as part of day-to-day life in germany .
the daily news show the ' tagesschau ' which airs every night at 8pm , has become an institution for millions of german families .
even the commercial television stations , which were founded in the 1980s and have since posed big competition for public broadcasters , can not touch it .
it still has around 10 million viewers a day .
other famous shows like the popular crime series , ' tatort ' , live sports broadcasts and family-orientated shows on saturday evenings mean that the first german broadcaster has maintained relatively high audience figures , although commercial broadcasters pose stiff competition .

the aim : to provide a platform for serious , independent , objective reporting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regional broadcasters form the core element of the overall system in germany " it is our deep conviction that radio stations should no longer be a mouth-piece of the respective government , " said the american controlling officer at the time , edmund schaechter .
" stations should represent every level of society and give all political groups and parties the opportunity to voice their opinion . "
the allies ' restructuring of german broadcasters german public sevice broadcasting was shaped by the post-war landscape .
in the aftermath of the second world war one of the immediate priorities for the allies was to break up the existing nazi structures .
radio was targeted in particular , because it had been abused as a propaganda tool during the third reich .
the allies were keen to re-establish radio as independent from the state , to act as a critical voice and to try to prevent extremism ever taking hold again .
in west germany , public service broadcasting was established on french , british and american models , notably the bbc .
the resulting ard united the various regional broadcasters , and for years , television viewers could only watch regional programmes , and one national programme .
only much later was competion established in the form of a second public broadcaster -lrb- in 1963 -rrb- and commercial broadcasting -lrb- in 1984 -rrb- .
in east germany , on the other side of the iron curtain , a separate system developed , along soviet lines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tagesschau has long established itself as germany 's main news show the western allies wanted the german public broadcaster to represent the whole of society , and reflect a range of views and political opinions .
independence from the state and political objectivity remain the hallmark of public service broadcasting in germany today .
however , politicians and parties have been accused over the decades of using public service broadcasters for their own means .
there is controversy over party political broadcasts which are aired in the run up to elections .
they are said to be propaganda for the parties .
but ard justifies this saying they are not responsible for the content .
furthermore , politicians sitting on the broadcasting council , have considerable influence over the choice for who runs the public service broadcaster .
it is not uncommon , therefore , that the top spot goes to someone who belongs to the most influential party at the time .
the federal structure of public service broadcasting in germany is seen as one of its key strengths , and has remained in place since its foundation .
the individual regional broadcasters are still responsible for their programmes .
they are largely protected from the long arm of the state by a guaranteed funding sytem .
a huge operation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular tv series such as tatort continue to top the ratings lists ard , the first german public service broadcaster , started out as a small institution .
the 9 regional stations now employ around 20,000 staff members , and many more freelancers .
they produce 11 television channels , 55 radio stations and have 16 orchestras and choirs under their belt .
the total budget for the public service broadcasters is around 6.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.7 billion -rrb- a year .
ard has a network of correspondents in 30 countries , as well as studios across germany .
in its 60 year history , ard has managed to establish itself as part of day-to-day life in germany .
the daily news show the ' tagesschau ' which airs every night at 8pm , has become an institution for millions of german families .
even the commercial television stations , which were founded in the 1980s and have since posed big competition for public broadcasters , can not touch it .
it still has around 10 million viewers a day .
other famous shows like the popular crime series , ' tatort ' , live sports broadcasts and family-orientated shows on saturday evenings mean that the first german broadcaster has maintained relatively high audience figures , although commercial broadcasters pose stiff competition .

the meeting , which was designed to work out an agenda for the g20 summit in toronto , canada , at the end of the month , produced a communique that endorses the need for budgetary discipline and regulation of financial markets , but shies away from a global bank levy proposed by the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , european countries , including germany , and the us .
resistance to global bank levy canada and australia are among those opposed to such a levy , as they believe they should not have to pay to clear up a mess they did not create .
canada 's finance minister jim flaherty told reporters that the debate on the bank levy had been " a distraction from core issues " and that most ministers " do not support the concept of a universal levy . "
german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , however , insisted that regulating the banking industry must remain a global priority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble has defended germany 's tough stance on fiscal restraint " i pointed out that we will need to make a decision in toronto , " he told the reuters news agency .
" there 's a lot of pressure to even go beyond a levy and impose a tax on banks , " he added .
balancing budgets and stimulating growth the g20 communique calls on member states to get their finances in order to reduce billowing budget deficits , while stimulating growth at the same time .
the imf and the united states in particular , have repeatedly called on low-growth economies like germany to boost domestic demand .
germany is europe 's top exporter , but consumer spending is traditionally lackluster , thus creating an imbalance in the country 's trade balance .
but schaeuble again dismissed the criticism , insisting that " we have to look at europe , or at least the eurozone , as a whole , " he told reuters , meaning that the trade balance of the entire eurozone shows no imbalances with other parts of the world .

the meeting , which was designed to work out an agenda for the g20 summit in toronto , canada , at the end of the month , produced a communique that endorses the need for budgetary discipline and regulation of financial markets , but shies away from a global bank levy proposed by the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , european countries , including germany , and the us .
resistance to global bank levy canada and australia are among those opposed to such a levy , as they believe they should not have to pay to clear up a mess they did not create .
canada 's finance minister jim flaherty told reporters that the debate on the bank levy had been " a distraction from core issues " and that most ministers " do not support the concept of a universal levy . "
german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , however , insisted that regulating the banking industry must remain a global priority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble has defended germany 's tough stance on fiscal restraint " i pointed out that we will need to make a decision in toronto , " he told the reuters news agency .
" there 's a lot of pressure to even go beyond a levy and impose a tax on banks , " he added .
balancing budgets and stimulating growth the g20 communique calls on member states to get their finances in order to reduce billowing budget deficits , while stimulating growth at the same time .
the imf and the united states in particular , have repeatedly called on low-growth economies like germany to boost domestic demand .
germany is europe 's top exporter , but consumer spending is traditionally lackluster , thus creating an imbalance in the country 's trade balance .
but schaeuble again dismissed the criticism , insisting that " we have to look at europe , or at least the eurozone , as a whole , " he told reuters , meaning that the trade balance of the entire eurozone shows no imbalances with other parts of the world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 05.06.2010 public broadcasting in germany marks 60 years of independent reporting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aim was to make radio and television independent of government influence germany 's first public service broadcaster is celebrating its sixtieth birthday .
we look back at how the radio and tv corporation was born in post-war germany . just like the nation itself , public service broadcasters in the federal republic of germany grew up as separate insitutions in the various federal states .
sixty years ago this week , on 5th june 1950 , representatives of the individual regional radio stations came together to create the allgemeine rundfunkanstalt deutschlands -lrb- general german broadcasting corporation -rrb- .
the ard became the first nationwide public service broadcasting corporation .
the aim : to provide a platform for serious , independent , objective reporting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regional broadcasters form the core element of the overall system in germany " it is our deep conviction that radio stations should no longer be a mouth-piece of the respective government , " said the american controlling officer at the time , edmund schaechter .
" stations should represent every level of society and give all political groups and parties the opportunity to voice their opinion . "
the allies ' restructuring of german broadcasters german public sevice broadcasting was shaped by the post-war landscape .
in the aftermath of the second world war one of the immediate priorities for the allies was to break up the existing nazi structures .
radio was targeted in particular , because it had been abused as a propaganda tool during the third reich .
the allies were keen to re-establish radio as independent from the state , to act as a critical voice and to try to prevent extremism ever taking hold again .
in west germany , public service broadcasting was established on french , british and american models , notably the bbc .
the resulting ard united the various regional broadcasters , and for years , television viewers could only watch regional programmes , and one national programme .
only much later was competion established in the form of a second public broadcaster -lrb- in 1963 -rrb- and commercial broadcasting -lrb- in 1984 -rrb- .
in east germany , on the other side of the iron curtain , a separate system developed , along soviet lines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tagesschau has long established itself as germany 's main news show the western allies wanted the german public broadcaster to represent the whole of society , and reflect a range of views and political opinions .
independence from the state and political objectivity remain the hallmark of public service broadcasting in germany today .
however , politicians and parties have been accused over the decades of using public service broadcasters for their own means .
there is controversy over party political broadcasts which are aired in the run up to elections .
they are said to be propaganda for the parties .
but ard justifies this saying they are not responsible for the content .
furthermore , politicians sitting on the broadcasting council , have considerable influence over the choice for who runs the public service broadcaster .
it is not uncommon , therefore , that the top spot goes to someone who belongs to the most influential party at the time .
the federal structure of public service broadcasting in germany is seen as one of its key strengths , and has remained in place since its foundation .
the individual regional broadcasters are still responsible for their programmes .
they are largely protected from the long arm of the state by a guaranteed funding sytem .
a huge operation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular tv series such as tatort continue to top the ratings lists ard , the first german public service broadcaster , started out as a small institution .
the 9 regional stations now employ around 20,000 staff members , and many more freelancers .
they produce 11 television channels , 55 radio stations and have 16 orchestras and choirs under their belt .
the total budget for the public service broadcasters is around 6.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.7 billion -rrb- a year .
ard has a network of correspondents in 30 countries , as well as studios across germany .
in its 60 year history , ard has managed to establish itself as part of day-to-day life in germany .
the daily news show the ' tagesschau ' which airs every night at 8pm , has become an institution for millions of german families .
even the commercial television stations , which were founded in the 1980s and have since posed big competition for public broadcasters , can not touch it .
it still has around 10 million viewers a day .
other famous shows like the popular crime series , ' tatort ' , live sports broadcasts and family-orientated shows on saturday evenings mean that the first german broadcaster has maintained relatively high audience figures , although commercial broadcasters pose stiff competition .

the long , thin plastic horn is a popular fan article and could dominate audio coverage at the upcoming world cup games . the vuvuzela sounds a bit like a lovesick elephant or an angry bull - at least to european ears .
but for most south africans , it 's the unmistakable sound of soccer .
it 's simply part of the game , according to johannesburg soccer fan clinton currie .
" for me personally , i would say it represents our country , what we 're about , " currie told deutsche welle .
" we 're a noisy bunch of people basically , so that what it represents to me is something uniquely south african . "
passion turned business currie first started playing the vuvuzela 12 years ago .
what began as a bit of fun with a simple instrument gradually evolved into a passion – and a business plan .
the entrepreneur took the horn , which was previously available only in a single color , and branded it by adding a range of printed designs and colors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton currie plans to sell a million colorfully printed vuvuzelas the idea has taken off .
recent months have seen currie and his employees at the vuvuzela branding company rush to complete orders for one million printed horns .
most of them will bear the south african flag .
other designs include the flags of the united states , the netherlands and australia .
all of them are made of a robust plastic well suited for use in crowded stadiums .
others producers have also joined the fray .
today , there 's a wide range of horns on the market , from smaller models covered in sparkling stones to larger trumpets hand-painted by local artists .
and their prices cover the entire gamut .
according to theresa granger , who works at a souvenir shop on long street in cape town , regular vuvuzelas made from plastic cost about six euros , while fancier collectors ' versions decorated with pearls can fetch up to 100 .
granger said she has been selling about 20 horns a week over the past few months .
they 're particularly popular with tourists from brazil .

earlier this year , south african media reported organizers were under pressure to ban the instruments from world cup venues because they were too loud and could intimidate foreign teams .

granger is among the many south africans who welcome the move .
" you ca n't ban it because it is a south african thing " and the event happens to be taking place in the country , she said .
the exact origin of the vuvuzela is unknown .
one theory points to the long , thin trumpets made from kudu horns , once used by community leaders to call village gatherings .
later , the trumpets were manufactured from sheet metal - and then , in the 1990s , soccer fans decided to put them to a new use , and plastic models emerged .

currie doubts , however , that this summer 's world cup games will be anywhere near as loud as normal south african league matches .
" the fans that are going to attend do n't know how to blow the vuvuzela , " he said .
that said , currie and many other south africans are confident that most visiting fans will have a good time with the instrument - as long as they practice a little before game day .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 05.06.2010 public broadcasting in germany marks 60 years of independent reporting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aim was to make radio and television independent of government influence germany 's first public service broadcaster is celebrating its sixtieth birthday .
we look back at how the radio and tv corporation was born in post-war germany . just like the nation itself , public service broadcasters in the federal republic of germany grew up as separate insitutions in the various federal states .
sixty years ago this week , on 5th june 1950 , representatives of the individual regional radio stations came together to create the allgemeine rundfunkanstalt deutschlands -lrb- general german broadcasting corporation -rrb- .
the ard became the first nationwide public service broadcasting corporation .
the aim : to provide a platform for serious , independent , objective reporting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regional broadcasters form the core element of the overall system in germany " it is our deep conviction that radio stations should no longer be a mouth-piece of the respective government , " said the american controlling officer at the time , edmund schaechter .
" stations should represent every level of society and give all political groups and parties the opportunity to voice their opinion . "
the allies ' restructuring of german broadcasters german public sevice broadcasting was shaped by the post-war landscape .
in the aftermath of the second world war one of the immediate priorities for the allies was to break up the existing nazi structures .
radio was targeted in particular , because it had been abused as a propaganda tool during the third reich .
the allies were keen to re-establish radio as independent from the state , to act as a critical voice and to try to prevent extremism ever taking hold again .
in west germany , public service broadcasting was established on french , british and american models , notably the bbc .
the resulting ard united the various regional broadcasters , and for years , television viewers could only watch regional programmes , and one national programme .
only much later was competion established in the form of a second public broadcaster -lrb- in 1963 -rrb- and commercial broadcasting -lrb- in 1984 -rrb- .
in east germany , on the other side of the iron curtain , a separate system developed , along soviet lines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tagesschau has long established itself as germany 's main news show the western allies wanted the german public broadcaster to represent the whole of society , and reflect a range of views and political opinions .
independence from the state and political objectivity remain the hallmark of public service broadcasting in germany today .
however , politicians and parties have been accused over the decades of using public service broadcasters for their own means .
there is controversy over party political broadcasts which are aired in the run up to elections .
they are said to be propaganda for the parties .
but ard justifies this saying they are not responsible for the content .
furthermore , politicians sitting on the broadcasting council , have considerable influence over the choice for who runs the public service broadcaster .
it is not uncommon , therefore , that the top spot goes to someone who belongs to the most influential party at the time .
the federal structure of public service broadcasting in germany is seen as one of its key strengths , and has remained in place since its foundation .
the individual regional broadcasters are still responsible for their programmes .
they are largely protected from the long arm of the state by a guaranteed funding sytem .
a huge operation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular tv series such as tatort continue to top the ratings lists ard , the first german public service broadcaster , started out as a small institution .
the 9 regional stations now employ around 20,000 staff members , and many more freelancers .
they produce 11 television channels , 55 radio stations and have 16 orchestras and choirs under their belt .
the total budget for the public service broadcasters is around 6.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.7 billion -rrb- a year .
ard has a network of correspondents in 30 countries , as well as studios across germany .
in its 60 year history , ard has managed to establish itself as part of day-to-day life in germany .
the daily news show the ' tagesschau ' which airs every night at 8pm , has become an institution for millions of german families .
even the commercial television stations , which were founded in the 1980s and have since posed big competition for public broadcasters , can not touch it .
it still has around 10 million viewers a day .
other famous shows like the popular crime series , ' tatort ' , live sports broadcasts and family-orientated shows on saturday evenings mean that the first german broadcaster has maintained relatively high audience figures , although commercial broadcasters pose stiff competition .

granger said she has been selling about 20 horns a week over the past few months .
they 're particularly popular with tourists from brazil .
bildunterschrift : will foreign visitors be able to match the noise produced at south african club matches ?
no ban at games but will visiting soccer fans really be able to take their vuvuzelas into the stadium on game day ?
earlier this year , south african media reported organizers were under pressure to ban the instruments from world cup venues because they were too loud and could intimidate foreign teams .
fifa officials in johannesburg have since announced that vuvuzelas are part of south african football culture , and will indeed be permitted in stadiums .
granger is among the many south africans who welcome the move .
" you ca n't ban it because it is a south african thing " and the event happens to be taking place in the country , she said .
the exact origin of the vuvuzela is unknown .
one theory points to the long , thin trumpets made from kudu horns , once used by community leaders to call village gatherings .
later , the trumpets were manufactured from sheet metal - and then , in the 1990s , soccer fans decided to put them to a new use , and plastic models emerged .
" practice before game day " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : currie : ' we 're a noisy bunch of people basically ' it does n't matter if it 's the kaizer chiefs playing the orlando pirates , or the mamelodi sundown tackling ajax cape town - the sound of the vuvuzela can be heard at every soccer match across the country .
currie doubts , however , that this summer 's world cup games will be anywhere near as loud as normal south african league matches .
" the fans that are going to attend do n't know how to blow the vuvuzela , " he said .
that said , currie and many other south africans are confident that most visiting fans will have a good time with the instrument - as long as they practice a little before game day .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 05.06.2010 public broadcasting in germany marks 60 years of independent reporting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aim was to make radio and television independent of government influence germany 's first public service broadcaster is celebrating its sixtieth birthday .
we look back at how the radio and tv corporation was born in post-war germany . just like the nation itself , public service broadcasters in the federal republic of germany grew up as separate insitutions in the various federal states .
sixty years ago this week , on 5th june 1950 , representatives of the individual regional radio stations came together to create the allgemeine rundfunkanstalt deutschlands -lrb- general german broadcasting corporation -rrb- .
the ard became the first nationwide public service broadcasting corporation .
the aim : to provide a platform for serious , independent , objective reporting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regional broadcasters form the core element of the overall system in germany " it is our deep conviction that radio stations should no longer be a mouth-piece of the respective government , " said the american controlling officer at the time , edmund schaechter .
" stations should represent every level of society and give all political groups and parties the opportunity to voice their opinion . "
the allies ' restructuring of german broadcasters german public sevice broadcasting was shaped by the post-war landscape .
in the aftermath of the second world war one of the immediate priorities for the allies was to break up the existing nazi structures .
radio was targeted in particular , because it had been abused as a propaganda tool during the third reich .
the allies were keen to re-establish radio as independent from the state , to act as a critical voice and to try to prevent extremism ever taking hold again .
in west germany , public service broadcasting was established on french , british and american models , notably the bbc .
the resulting ard united the various regional broadcasters , and for years , television viewers could only watch regional programmes , and one national programme .
only much later was competion established in the form of a second public broadcaster -lrb- in 1963 -rrb- and commercial broadcasting -lrb- in 1984 -rrb- .
in east germany , on the other side of the iron curtain , a separate system developed , along soviet lines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tagesschau has long established itself as germany 's main news show the western allies wanted the german public broadcaster to represent the whole of society , and reflect a range of views and political opinions .
independence from the state and political objectivity remain the hallmark of public service broadcasting in germany today .
however , politicians and parties have been accused over the decades of using public service broadcasters for their own means .
there is controversy over party political broadcasts which are aired in the run up to elections .
they are said to be propaganda for the parties .
but ard justifies this saying they are not responsible for the content .
furthermore , politicians sitting on the broadcasting council , have considerable influence over the choice for who runs the public service broadcaster .
it is not uncommon , therefore , that the top spot goes to someone who belongs to the most influential party at the time .
the federal structure of public service broadcasting in germany is seen as one of its key strengths , and has remained in place since its foundation .
the individual regional broadcasters are still responsible for their programmes .
they are largely protected from the long arm of the state by a guaranteed funding sytem .
a huge operation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular tv series such as tatort continue to top the ratings lists ard , the first german public service broadcaster , started out as a small institution .
the 9 regional stations now employ around 20,000 staff members , and many more freelancers .
they produce 11 television channels , 55 radio stations and have 16 orchestras and choirs under their belt .
the total budget for the public service broadcasters is around 6.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.7 billion -rrb- a year .
ard has a network of correspondents in 30 countries , as well as studios across germany .
in its 60 year history , ard has managed to establish itself as part of day-to-day life in germany .
the daily news show the ' tagesschau ' which airs every night at 8pm , has become an institution for millions of german families .
even the commercial television stations , which were founded in the 1980s and have since posed big competition for public broadcasters , can not touch it .
it still has around 10 million viewers a day .
other famous shows like the popular crime series , ' tatort ' , live sports broadcasts and family-orientated shows on saturday evenings mean that the first german broadcaster has maintained relatively high audience figures , although commercial broadcasters pose stiff competition .

we look back at how the radio and tv corporation was born in post-war germany . just like the nation itself , public service broadcasters in the federal republic of germany grew up as separate insitutions in the various federal states .
sixty years ago this week , on 5th june 1950 , representatives of the individual regional radio stations came together to create the allgemeine rundfunkanstalt deutschlands -lrb- general german broadcasting corporation -rrb- .
the ard became the first nationwide public service broadcasting corporation .
the aim : to provide a platform for serious , independent , objective reporting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regional broadcasters form the core element of the overall system in germany " it is our deep conviction that radio stations should no longer be a mouth-piece of the respective government , " said the american controlling officer at the time , edmund schaechter .
" stations should represent every level of society and give all political groups and parties the opportunity to voice their opinion . "
the allies ' restructuring of german broadcasters german public sevice broadcasting was shaped by the post-war landscape .
in the aftermath of the second world war one of the immediate priorities for the allies was to break up the existing nazi structures .
radio was targeted in particular , because it had been abused as a propaganda tool during the third reich .
the allies were keen to re-establish radio as independent from the state , to act as a critical voice and to try to prevent extremism ever taking hold again .
in west germany , public service broadcasting was established on french , british and american models , notably the bbc .
the resulting ard united the various regional broadcasters , and for years , television viewers could only watch regional programmes , and one national programme .
only much later was competion established in the form of a second public broadcaster -lrb- in 1963 -rrb- and commercial broadcasting -lrb- in 1984 -rrb- .
in east germany , on the other side of the iron curtain , a separate system developed , along soviet lines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tagesschau has long established itself as germany 's main news show the western allies wanted the german public broadcaster to represent the whole of society , and reflect a range of views and political opinions .
independence from the state and political objectivity remain the hallmark of public service broadcasting in germany today .
however , politicians and parties have been accused over the decades of using public service broadcasters for their own means .
there is controversy over party political broadcasts which are aired in the run up to elections .
they are said to be propaganda for the parties .
but ard justifies this saying they are not responsible for the content .
furthermore , politicians sitting on the broadcasting council , have considerable influence over the choice for who runs the public service broadcaster .
it is not uncommon , therefore , that the top spot goes to someone who belongs to the most influential party at the time .
the federal structure of public service broadcasting in germany is seen as one of its key strengths , and has remained in place since its foundation .
the individual regional broadcasters are still responsible for their programmes .
they are largely protected from the long arm of the state by a guaranteed funding sytem .
a huge operation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular tv series such as tatort continue to top the ratings lists ard , the first german public service broadcaster , started out as a small institution .
the 9 regional stations now employ around 20,000 staff members , and many more freelancers .
they produce 11 television channels , 55 radio stations and have 16 orchestras and choirs under their belt .
the total budget for the public service broadcasters is around 6.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.7 billion -rrb- a year .
ard has a network of correspondents in 30 countries , as well as studios across germany .
in its 60 year history , ard has managed to establish itself as part of day-to-day life in germany .
the daily news show the ' tagesschau ' which airs every night at 8pm , has become an institution for millions of german families .
even the commercial television stations , which were founded in the 1980s and have since posed big competition for public broadcasters , can not touch it .
it still has around 10 million viewers a day .
other famous shows like the popular crime series , ' tatort ' , live sports broadcasts and family-orientated shows on saturday evenings mean that the first german broadcaster has maintained relatively high audience figures , although commercial broadcasters pose stiff competition .

only much later was competion established in the form of a second public broadcaster -lrb- in 1963 -rrb- and commercial broadcasting -lrb- in 1984 -rrb- .
in east germany , on the other side of the iron curtain , a separate system developed , along soviet lines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tagesschau has long established itself as germany 's main news show the western allies wanted the german public broadcaster to represent the whole of society , and reflect a range of views and political opinions .
independence from the state and political objectivity remain the hallmark of public service broadcasting in germany today .
however , politicians and parties have been accused over the decades of using public service broadcasters for their own means .
there is controversy over party political broadcasts which are aired in the run up to elections .
they are said to be propaganda for the parties .
but ard justifies this saying they are not responsible for the content .
furthermore , politicians sitting on the broadcasting council , have considerable influence over the choice for who runs the public service broadcaster .
it is not uncommon , therefore , that the top spot goes to someone who belongs to the most influential party at the time .
the federal structure of public service broadcasting in germany is seen as one of its key strengths , and has remained in place since its foundation .
the individual regional broadcasters are still responsible for their programmes .
they are largely protected from the long arm of the state by a guaranteed funding sytem .
a huge operation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular tv series such as tatort continue to top the ratings lists ard , the first german public service broadcaster , started out as a small institution .
the 9 regional stations now employ around 20,000 staff members , and many more freelancers .
they produce 11 television channels , 55 radio stations and have 16 orchestras and choirs under their belt .
the total budget for the public service broadcasters is around 6.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.7 billion -rrb- a year .
ard has a network of correspondents in 30 countries , as well as studios across germany .
in its 60 year history , ard has managed to establish itself as part of day-to-day life in germany .
the daily news show the ' tagesschau ' which airs every night at 8pm , has become an institution for millions of german families .
even the commercial television stations , which were founded in the 1980s and have since posed big competition for public broadcasters , can not touch it .
it still has around 10 million viewers a day .
other famous shows like the popular crime series , ' tatort ' , live sports broadcasts and family-orientated shows on saturday evenings mean that the first german broadcaster has maintained relatively high audience figures , although commercial broadcasters pose stiff competition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 05.06.2010 a world cup conversation with kasabian frontman tom meighan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kasabian launched the new england shirt in paris kasabian are in germany this weekend performing at rock am ring .
but the big-selling british band 's first love is n't music - it 's football .
dw talked to singer tom meighan about the world cup . the connection between football and music is not a random one .
both occupy similar neighborhoods in the sprawling metropolis of popular culture and share many of the same traits , making them more than just nodding acquaintances .
both instill a loyalty in their followers which borders on obsession , both have supporters bound by a gang mentality and both can play havoc with emotions .
they are so intimate at times that it can be difficult to separate them .
for musicians , tapping into terrace culture can help their music reach a much wider audience and few current rock acts have so successfully blended fan bases than british band kasabian .
when it comes to ticking the cross-over boxes , the leicestershire four-piece are streets ahead of many of their rivals : they 're dyed-in-the-wool leicester city fans -lrb- so no evidence of glory hunting there -rrb- , guitarist serge pizzorno once had schoolboy trials with nottingham forest and as a celebrity team they 've taken on the likes of oasis and won .
their credentials as britain 's premier soccer-rockers were further enhanced in february when the english football association chose them to launch the new england away shirt for the 2010 world cup in south africa .
england kit launch in paris " i was really honored , " singer tom meighan told deutsche welle .
" but i had a few reservations about where they wanted us to do it . "
the fa , in their infinite wisdom , had chosen the band 's gig at the olympia in paris for the launch of the red shirt , modeled on the design of the 1966 world cup winning jersey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kasabian 's soccer roots inspire a matchday atmosphere " they asked me to do it and i said okay but i told them , ' it 's all on you – if it backfires , if it all kicks-off then it 's on your head . '
i wanted to know that if there was a riot , they would get us out .
we got booed a bit , but then we played another song and everything was cool . "
kasabian 's links to football culture are not confined to the british isles and european audiences find it just as easy to slip into a stadium mentality at their shows , which made debuting the new england shirt in front of a partisan french crowd a risky proposition .
thankfully , apart from some heckling , the only other abuse the band and the fa got was from sections of the british press who questioned the intelligence of the whole stunt .
" it was a laugh , " meigan says .
" we did it , no-one died so what 's the problem ? "
when pressed on his football allegiances , meighan makes it very clear where they lie .
" i 'm leicester city first , then england , " he says proudly .
" we all are .
serge even wore leicester socks under his forest kit when he was a boy .
but when the world cup is on , it 's all about england for me . "
limiting expectations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capello may be " the man " but england still face a tough task the world cup .
as ever , the three lions depart for south africa with the huge weight of expectation following in their vapor trail .
it 's the same with every major tournament england qualify for – regardless of what history has taught them , that going out on penalties in the quarter-finals is the best most of us can hope for .
the majority of england fans just ca n't help getting carried away .
the singer , however , puts himself squarely in the realist camp when it comes to england 's chances in south africa .
" i really hope we 'll win it , i really do , but i do n't think we will .
-lrb- coach fabio -rrb- capello is the man , and he 's made a huge difference , but i just do n't think we 're good enough . "
spain are dangerous but watch the dutch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meighan rates torres and villa as the best strike force " a lot of people are tipping spain to win it and when you look at the players they 've got , it 's hard to see who 's going to be better , " he says .
" if torres and villa are on song , then there 's no better strike force .
they have xavi , iniesta , fabregas , alonso – the midfield is just unreal .
the way they took people apart at the euros ... who is there out of the non-europeans who can beat them ?
brazil ?
past it .
argentina ?
too mental . "
so is the kasabian front man putting his next album advance on spain lifting the world cup this year ?
nope .
" i 'm telling you , man , " he says conspiratorially .
" keep an eye on the dutch .
you talk about the spanish midfield but look at robben , sneijder , van bommel ...
then they 've got huntelaar , van persie , even that carthorse kuyt does wonders in an orange shirt .
mark my words ... the dutch . "
write germany off at your peril bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany can play badly and still make it to the final and what about england 's nemesis , germany ?
" you 'd be stupid to right them off even though their squad is lacking star power , " he says .
" but it never matters to the germans , does it ?
they could be crap for months and scrape through in qualifying but when it comes to the tournament , they 're always in the final .
i do n't rate them but they 'll probably go and win it now just to show me up . "
kasabian 's summer festival dance card is booked through the world cup but another happy event planned for june could mean an opportunity comes their way for some concentrated football watching .
" chris our bass player and his wife are having their baby right when the world cup starts so we 'll take a week off for that and settle in for some serious viewing .
but then we 'll have to go back on the tour after that so we 'll try and see as much as we can . "

but the big-selling british band 's first love is n't music - it 's football .
dw talked to singer tom meighan about the world cup . the connection between football and music is not a random one .
both occupy similar neighborhoods in the sprawling metropolis of popular culture and share many of the same traits , making them more than just nodding acquaintances .
both instill a loyalty in their followers which borders on obsession , both have supporters bound by a gang mentality and both can play havoc with emotions .
they are so intimate at times that it can be difficult to separate them .
for musicians , tapping into terrace culture can help their music reach a much wider audience and few current rock acts have so successfully blended fan bases than british band kasabian .
when it comes to ticking the cross-over boxes , the leicestershire four-piece are streets ahead of many of their rivals : they 're dyed-in-the-wool leicester city fans -lrb- so no evidence of glory hunting there -rrb- , guitarist serge pizzorno once had schoolboy trials with nottingham forest and as a celebrity team they 've taken on the likes of oasis and won .
their credentials as britain 's premier soccer-rockers were further enhanced in february when the english football association chose them to launch the new england away shirt for the 2010 world cup in south africa .
england kit launch in paris " i was really honored , " singer tom meighan told deutsche welle .
" but i had a few reservations about where they wanted us to do it . "
the fa , in their infinite wisdom , had chosen the band 's gig at the olympia in paris for the launch of the red shirt , modeled on the design of the 1966 world cup winning jersey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kasabian 's soccer roots inspire a matchday atmosphere " they asked me to do it and i said okay but i told them , ' it 's all on you – if it backfires , if it all kicks-off then it 's on your head . '
i wanted to know that if there was a riot , they would get us out .
we got booed a bit , but then we played another song and everything was cool . "
kasabian 's links to football culture are not confined to the british isles and european audiences find it just as easy to slip into a stadium mentality at their shows , which made debuting the new england shirt in front of a partisan french crowd a risky proposition .
thankfully , apart from some heckling , the only other abuse the band and the fa got was from sections of the british press who questioned the intelligence of the whole stunt .
" it was a laugh , " meigan says .
" we did it , no-one died so what 's the problem ? "
when pressed on his football allegiances , meighan makes it very clear where they lie .
" i 'm leicester city first , then england , " he says proudly .
" we all are .
serge even wore leicester socks under his forest kit when he was a boy .
but when the world cup is on , it 's all about england for me . "
limiting expectations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capello may be " the man " but england still face a tough task the world cup .
as ever , the three lions depart for south africa with the huge weight of expectation following in their vapor trail .
it 's the same with every major tournament england qualify for – regardless of what history has taught them , that going out on penalties in the quarter-finals is the best most of us can hope for .
the majority of england fans just ca n't help getting carried away .
the singer , however , puts himself squarely in the realist camp when it comes to england 's chances in south africa .
" i really hope we 'll win it , i really do , but i do n't think we will .
-lrb- coach fabio -rrb- capello is the man , and he 's made a huge difference , but i just do n't think we 're good enough . "
spain are dangerous but watch the dutch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meighan rates torres and villa as the best strike force " a lot of people are tipping spain to win it and when you look at the players they 've got , it 's hard to see who 's going to be better , " he says .
" if torres and villa are on song , then there 's no better strike force .
they have xavi , iniesta , fabregas , alonso – the midfield is just unreal .
the way they took people apart at the euros ... who is there out of the non-europeans who can beat them ?
brazil ?
past it .
argentina ?
too mental . "
so is the kasabian front man putting his next album advance on spain lifting the world cup this year ?
nope .
" i 'm telling you , man , " he says conspiratorially .
" keep an eye on the dutch .
you talk about the spanish midfield but look at robben , sneijder , van bommel ...
then they 've got huntelaar , van persie , even that carthorse kuyt does wonders in an orange shirt .
mark my words ... the dutch . "
write germany off at your peril bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany can play badly and still make it to the final and what about england 's nemesis , germany ?
" you 'd be stupid to right them off even though their squad is lacking star power , " he says .
" but it never matters to the germans , does it ?
they could be crap for months and scrape through in qualifying but when it comes to the tournament , they 're always in the final .
i do n't rate them but they 'll probably go and win it now just to show me up . "
kasabian 's summer festival dance card is booked through the world cup but another happy event planned for june could mean an opportunity comes their way for some concentrated football watching .
" chris our bass player and his wife are having their baby right when the world cup starts so we 'll take a week off for that and settle in for some serious viewing .
but then we 'll have to go back on the tour after that so we 'll try and see as much as we can . "

but the big-selling british band 's first love is n't music - it 's football .
dw talked to singer tom meighan about the world cup . the connection between football and music is not a random one .
both occupy similar neighborhoods in the sprawling metropolis of popular culture and share many of the same traits , making them more than just nodding acquaintances .
both instill a loyalty in their followers which borders on obsession , both have supporters bound by a gang mentality and both can play havoc with emotions .
they are so intimate at times that it can be difficult to separate them .
for musicians , tapping into terrace culture can help their music reach a much wider audience and few current rock acts have so successfully blended fan bases than british band kasabian .
when it comes to ticking the cross-over boxes , the leicestershire four-piece are streets ahead of many of their rivals : they 're dyed-in-the-wool leicester city fans -lrb- so no evidence of glory hunting there -rrb- , guitarist serge pizzorno once had schoolboy trials with nottingham forest and as a celebrity team they 've taken on the likes of oasis and won .
their credentials as britain 's premier soccer-rockers were further enhanced in february when the english football association chose them to launch the new england away shirt for the 2010 world cup in south africa .
england kit launch in paris " i was really honored , " singer tom meighan told deutsche welle .
" but i had a few reservations about where they wanted us to do it . "
the fa , in their infinite wisdom , had chosen the band 's gig at the olympia in paris for the launch of the red shirt , modeled on the design of the 1966 world cup winning jersey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kasabian 's soccer roots inspire a matchday atmosphere " they asked me to do it and i said okay but i told them , ' it 's all on you – if it backfires , if it all kicks-off then it 's on your head . '
i wanted to know that if there was a riot , they would get us out .
we got booed a bit , but then we played another song and everything was cool . "
kasabian 's links to football culture are not confined to the british isles and european audiences find it just as easy to slip into a stadium mentality at their shows , which made debuting the new england shirt in front of a partisan french crowd a risky proposition .
thankfully , apart from some heckling , the only other abuse the band and the fa got was from sections of the british press who questioned the intelligence of the whole stunt .
" it was a laugh , " meigan says .
" we did it , no-one died so what 's the problem ? "
when pressed on his football allegiances , meighan makes it very clear where they lie .
" i 'm leicester city first , then england , " he says proudly .
" we all are .

the long , thin plastic horn is a popular fan article and could dominate audio coverage at the upcoming world cup games . the vuvuzela sounds a bit like a lovesick elephant or an angry bull - at least to european ears .
but for most south africans , it 's the unmistakable sound of soccer .
it 's simply part of the game , according to johannesburg soccer fan clinton currie .
" for me personally , i would say it represents our country , what we 're about , " currie told deutsche welle .
" we 're a noisy bunch of people basically , so that what it represents to me is something uniquely south african . "
passion turned business currie first started playing the vuvuzela 12 years ago .
what began as a bit of fun with a simple instrument gradually evolved into a passion – and a business plan .
the entrepreneur took the horn , which was previously available only in a single color , and branded it by adding a range of printed designs and colors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton currie plans to sell a million colorfully printed vuvuzelas the idea has taken off .
recent months have seen currie and his employees at the vuvuzela branding company rush to complete orders for one million printed horns .
most of them will bear the south african flag .
other designs include the flags of the united states , the netherlands and australia .
all of them are made of a robust plastic well suited for use in crowded stadiums .
others producers have also joined the fray .
today , there 's a wide range of horns on the market , from smaller models covered in sparkling stones to larger trumpets hand-painted by local artists .
and their prices cover the entire gamut .
according to theresa granger , who works at a souvenir shop on long street in cape town , regular vuvuzelas made from plastic cost about six euros , while fancier collectors ' versions decorated with pearls can fetch up to 100 .
granger said she has been selling about 20 horns a week over the past few months .
they 're particularly popular with tourists from brazil .
bildunterschrift : will foreign visitors be able to match the noise produced at south african club matches ?
no ban at games but will visiting soccer fans really be able to take their vuvuzelas into the stadium on game day ?
earlier this year , south african media reported organizers were under pressure to ban the instruments from world cup venues because they were too loud and could intimidate foreign teams .
fifa officials in johannesburg have since announced that vuvuzelas are part of south african football culture , and will indeed be permitted in stadiums .
granger is among the many south africans who welcome the move .
" you ca n't ban it because it is a south african thing " and the event happens to be taking place in the country , she said .
the exact origin of the vuvuzela is unknown .

the long , thin plastic horn is a popular fan article and could dominate audio coverage at the upcoming world cup games . the vuvuzela sounds a bit like a lovesick elephant or an angry bull - at least to european ears .
but for most south africans , it 's the unmistakable sound of soccer .
it 's simply part of the game , according to johannesburg soccer fan clinton currie .
" for me personally , i would say it represents our country , what we 're about , " currie told deutsche welle .
" we 're a noisy bunch of people basically , so that what it represents to me is something uniquely south african . "
passion turned business currie first started playing the vuvuzela 12 years ago .
what began as a bit of fun with a simple instrument gradually evolved into a passion – and a business plan .
the entrepreneur took the horn , which was previously available only in a single color , and branded it by adding a range of printed designs and colors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton currie plans to sell a million colorfully printed vuvuzelas the idea has taken off .
recent months have seen currie and his employees at the vuvuzela branding company rush to complete orders for one million printed horns .
most of them will bear the south african flag .
other designs include the flags of the united states , the netherlands and australia .
all of them are made of a robust plastic well suited for use in crowded stadiums .
others producers have also joined the fray .
today , there 's a wide range of horns on the market , from smaller models covered in sparkling stones to larger trumpets hand-painted by local artists .
and their prices cover the entire gamut .
according to theresa granger , who works at a souvenir shop on long street in cape town , regular vuvuzelas made from plastic cost about six euros , while fancier collectors ' versions decorated with pearls can fetch up to 100 .
granger said she has been selling about 20 horns a week over the past few months .
they 're particularly popular with tourists from brazil .
bildunterschrift : will foreign visitors be able to match the noise produced at south african club matches ?
no ban at games but will visiting soccer fans really be able to take their vuvuzelas into the stadium on game day ?
earlier this year , south african media reported organizers were under pressure to ban the instruments from world cup venues because they were too loud and could intimidate foreign teams .
fifa officials in johannesburg have since announced that vuvuzelas are part of south african football culture , and will indeed be permitted in stadiums .
granger is among the many south africans who welcome the move .
" you ca n't ban it because it is a south african thing " and the event happens to be taking place in the country , she said .
the exact origin of the vuvuzela is unknown .

the entrepreneur took the horn , which was previously available only in a single color , and branded it by adding a range of printed designs and colors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton currie plans to sell a million colorfully printed vuvuzelas the idea has taken off .
recent months have seen currie and his employees at the vuvuzela branding company rush to complete orders for one million printed horns .
most of them will bear the south african flag .
other designs include the flags of the united states , the netherlands and australia .
all of them are made of a robust plastic well suited for use in crowded stadiums .
others producers have also joined the fray .
today , there 's a wide range of horns on the market , from smaller models covered in sparkling stones to larger trumpets hand-painted by local artists .
and their prices cover the entire gamut .
according to theresa granger , who works at a souvenir shop on long street in cape town , regular vuvuzelas made from plastic cost about six euros , while fancier collectors ' versions decorated with pearls can fetch up to 100 .
granger said she has been selling about 20 horns a week over the past few months .
they 're particularly popular with tourists from brazil .
bildunterschrift : will foreign visitors be able to match the noise produced at south african club matches ?
no ban at games but will visiting soccer fans really be able to take their vuvuzelas into the stadium on game day ?
earlier this year , south african media reported organizers were under pressure to ban the instruments from world cup venues because they were too loud and could intimidate foreign teams .
fifa officials in johannesburg have since announced that vuvuzelas are part of south african football culture , and will indeed be permitted in stadiums .
granger is among the many south africans who welcome the move .
" you ca n't ban it because it is a south african thing " and the event happens to be taking place in the country , she said .
the exact origin of the vuvuzela is unknown .
one theory points to the long , thin trumpets made from kudu horns , once used by community leaders to call village gatherings .
later , the trumpets were manufactured from sheet metal - and then , in the 1990s , soccer fans decided to put them to a new use , and plastic models emerged .
" practice before game day " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : currie : ' we 're a noisy bunch of people basically ' it does n't matter if it 's the kaizer chiefs playing the orlando pirates , or the mamelodi sundown tackling ajax cape town - the sound of the vuvuzela can be heard at every soccer match across the country .
currie doubts , however , that this summer 's world cup games will be anywhere near as loud as normal south african league matches .
" the fans that are going to attend do n't know how to blow the vuvuzela , " he said .
that said , currie and many other south africans are confident that most visiting fans will have a good time with the instrument - as long as they practice a little before game day .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 05.06.2010 a world cup conversation with kasabian frontman tom meighan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kasabian launched the new england shirt in paris kasabian are in germany this weekend performing at rock am ring .
but the big-selling british band 's first love is n't music - it 's football .
dw talked to singer tom meighan about the world cup . the connection between football and music is not a random one .
both occupy similar neighborhoods in the sprawling metropolis of popular culture and share many of the same traits , making them more than just nodding acquaintances .
both instill a loyalty in their followers which borders on obsession , both have supporters bound by a gang mentality and both can play havoc with emotions .
they are so intimate at times that it can be difficult to separate them .
for musicians , tapping into terrace culture can help their music reach a much wider audience and few current rock acts have so successfully blended fan bases than british band kasabian .
when it comes to ticking the cross-over boxes , the leicestershire four-piece are streets ahead of many of their rivals : they 're dyed-in-the-wool leicester city fans -lrb- so no evidence of glory hunting there -rrb- , guitarist serge pizzorno once had schoolboy trials with nottingham forest and as a celebrity team they 've taken on the likes of oasis and won .
their credentials as britain 's premier soccer-rockers were further enhanced in february when the english football association chose them to launch the new england away shirt for the 2010 world cup in south africa .
england kit launch in paris " i was really honored , " singer tom meighan told deutsche welle .
" but i had a few reservations about where they wanted us to do it . "
the fa , in their infinite wisdom , had chosen the band 's gig at the olympia in paris for the launch of the red shirt , modeled on the design of the 1966 world cup winning jersey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kasabian 's soccer roots inspire a matchday atmosphere " they asked me to do it and i said okay but i told them , ' it 's all on you – if it backfires , if it all kicks-off then it 's on your head . '
i wanted to know that if there was a riot , they would get us out .
we got booed a bit , but then we played another song and everything was cool . "
kasabian 's links to football culture are not confined to the british isles and european audiences find it just as easy to slip into a stadium mentality at their shows , which made debuting the new england shirt in front of a partisan french crowd a risky proposition .
thankfully , apart from some heckling , the only other abuse the band and the fa got was from sections of the british press who questioned the intelligence of the whole stunt .
" it was a laugh , " meigan says .
" we did it , no-one died so what 's the problem ? "
when pressed on his football allegiances , meighan makes it very clear where they lie .
" i 'm leicester city first , then england , " he says proudly .
" we all are .
serge even wore leicester socks under his forest kit when he was a boy .
but when the world cup is on , it 's all about england for me . "
limiting expectations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capello may be " the man " but england still face a tough task the world cup .
as ever , the three lions depart for south africa with the huge weight of expectation following in their vapor trail .
it 's the same with every major tournament england qualify for – regardless of what history has taught them , that going out on penalties in the quarter-finals is the best most of us can hope for .
the majority of england fans just ca n't help getting carried away .
the singer , however , puts himself squarely in the realist camp when it comes to england 's chances in south africa .
" i really hope we 'll win it , i really do , but i do n't think we will .
-lrb- coach fabio -rrb- capello is the man , and he 's made a huge difference , but i just do n't think we 're good enough . "
spain are dangerous but watch the dutch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meighan rates torres and villa as the best strike force " a lot of people are tipping spain to win it and when you look at the players they 've got , it 's hard to see who 's going to be better , " he says .
" if torres and villa are on song , then there 's no better strike force .
they have xavi , iniesta , fabregas , alonso – the midfield is just unreal .
the way they took people apart at the euros ... who is there out of the non-europeans who can beat them ?
brazil ?
past it .
argentina ?
too mental . "
so is the kasabian front man putting his next album advance on spain lifting the world cup this year ?
nope .
" i 'm telling you , man , " he says conspiratorially .
" keep an eye on the dutch .
you talk about the spanish midfield but look at robben , sneijder , van bommel ...
then they 've got huntelaar , van persie , even that carthorse kuyt does wonders in an orange shirt .
mark my words ... the dutch . "
write germany off at your peril bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany can play badly and still make it to the final and what about england 's nemesis , germany ?
" you 'd be stupid to right them off even though their squad is lacking star power , " he says .
" but it never matters to the germans , does it ?
they could be crap for months and scrape through in qualifying but when it comes to the tournament , they 're always in the final .
i do n't rate them but they 'll probably go and win it now just to show me up . "
kasabian 's summer festival dance card is booked through the world cup but another happy event planned for june could mean an opportunity comes their way for some concentrated football watching .

but the big-selling british band 's first love is n't music - it 's football .
dw talked to singer tom meighan about the world cup . the connection between football and music is not a random one .
both occupy similar neighborhoods in the sprawling metropolis of popular culture and share many of the same traits , making them more than just nodding acquaintances .
both instill a loyalty in their followers which borders on obsession , both have supporters bound by a gang mentality and both can play havoc with emotions .
they are so intimate at times that it can be difficult to separate them .
for musicians , tapping into terrace culture can help their music reach a much wider audience and few current rock acts have so successfully blended fan bases than british band kasabian .
when it comes to ticking the cross-over boxes , the leicestershire four-piece are streets ahead of many of their rivals : they 're dyed-in-the-wool leicester city fans -lrb- so no evidence of glory hunting there -rrb- , guitarist serge pizzorno once had schoolboy trials with nottingham forest and as a celebrity team they 've taken on the likes of oasis and won .
their credentials as britain 's premier soccer-rockers were further enhanced in february when the english football association chose them to launch the new england away shirt for the 2010 world cup in south africa .
england kit launch in paris " i was really honored , " singer tom meighan told deutsche welle .
" but i had a few reservations about where they wanted us to do it . "
the fa , in their infinite wisdom , had chosen the band 's gig at the olympia in paris for the launch of the red shirt , modeled on the design of the 1966 world cup winning jersey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kasabian 's soccer roots inspire a matchday atmosphere " they asked me to do it and i said okay but i told them , ' it 's all on you – if it backfires , if it all kicks-off then it 's on your head . '
i wanted to know that if there was a riot , they would get us out .
we got booed a bit , but then we played another song and everything was cool . "
kasabian 's links to football culture are not confined to the british isles and european audiences find it just as easy to slip into a stadium mentality at their shows , which made debuting the new england shirt in front of a partisan french crowd a risky proposition .
thankfully , apart from some heckling , the only other abuse the band and the fa got was from sections of the british press who questioned the intelligence of the whole stunt .
" it was a laugh , " meigan says .
" we did it , no-one died so what 's the problem ? "
when pressed on his football allegiances , meighan makes it very clear where they lie .
" i 'm leicester city first , then england , " he says proudly .
" we all are .
serge even wore leicester socks under his forest kit when he was a boy .
but when the world cup is on , it 's all about england for me . "
limiting expectations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capello may be " the man " but england still face a tough task the world cup .
as ever , the three lions depart for south africa with the huge weight of expectation following in their vapor trail .
it 's the same with every major tournament england qualify for – regardless of what history has taught them , that going out on penalties in the quarter-finals is the best most of us can hope for .
the majority of england fans just ca n't help getting carried away .
the singer , however , puts himself squarely in the realist camp when it comes to england 's chances in south africa .
" i really hope we 'll win it , i really do , but i do n't think we will .
-lrb- coach fabio -rrb- capello is the man , and he 's made a huge difference , but i just do n't think we 're good enough . "
spain are dangerous but watch the dutch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meighan rates torres and villa as the best strike force " a lot of people are tipping spain to win it and when you look at the players they 've got , it 's hard to see who 's going to be better , " he says .
" if torres and villa are on song , then there 's no better strike force .
they have xavi , iniesta , fabregas , alonso – the midfield is just unreal .
the way they took people apart at the euros ... who is there out of the non-europeans who can beat them ?
brazil ?
past it .
argentina ?
too mental . "
so is the kasabian front man putting his next album advance on spain lifting the world cup this year ?
nope .
" i 'm telling you , man , " he says conspiratorially .
" keep an eye on the dutch .
you talk about the spanish midfield but look at robben , sneijder , van bommel ...
then they 've got huntelaar , van persie , even that carthorse kuyt does wonders in an orange shirt .
mark my words ... the dutch . "
write germany off at your peril bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany can play badly and still make it to the final and what about england 's nemesis , germany ?
" you 'd be stupid to right them off even though their squad is lacking star power , " he says .
" but it never matters to the germans , does it ?
they could be crap for months and scrape through in qualifying but when it comes to the tournament , they 're always in the final .
i do n't rate them but they 'll probably go and win it now just to show me up . "
kasabian 's summer festival dance card is booked through the world cup but another happy event planned for june could mean an opportunity comes their way for some concentrated football watching .
" chris our bass player and his wife are having their baby right when the world cup starts so we 'll take a week off for that and settle in for some serious viewing .
but then we 'll have to go back on the tour after that so we 'll try and see as much as we can . "

but the big-selling british band 's first love is n't music - it 's football .
dw talked to singer tom meighan about the world cup . the connection between football and music is not a random one .
both occupy similar neighborhoods in the sprawling metropolis of popular culture and share many of the same traits , making them more than just nodding acquaintances .
both instill a loyalty in their followers which borders on obsession , both have supporters bound by a gang mentality and both can play havoc with emotions .
they are so intimate at times that it can be difficult to separate them .
for musicians , tapping into terrace culture can help their music reach a much wider audience and few current rock acts have so successfully blended fan bases than british band kasabian .
when it comes to ticking the cross-over boxes , the leicestershire four-piece are streets ahead of many of their rivals : they 're dyed-in-the-wool leicester city fans -lrb- so no evidence of glory hunting there -rrb- , guitarist serge pizzorno once had schoolboy trials with nottingham forest and as a celebrity team they 've taken on the likes of oasis and won .
their credentials as britain 's premier soccer-rockers were further enhanced in february when the english football association chose them to launch the new england away shirt for the 2010 world cup in south africa .
england kit launch in paris " i was really honored , " singer tom meighan told deutsche welle .
" but i had a few reservations about where they wanted us to do it . "
the fa , in their infinite wisdom , had chosen the band 's gig at the olympia in paris for the launch of the red shirt , modeled on the design of the 1966 world cup winning jersey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kasabian 's soccer roots inspire a matchday atmosphere " they asked me to do it and i said okay but i told them , ' it 's all on you – if it backfires , if it all kicks-off then it 's on your head . '
i wanted to know that if there was a riot , they would get us out .
we got booed a bit , but then we played another song and everything was cool . "
kasabian 's links to football culture are not confined to the british isles and european audiences find it just as easy to slip into a stadium mentality at their shows , which made debuting the new england shirt in front of a partisan french crowd a risky proposition .
thankfully , apart from some heckling , the only other abuse the band and the fa got was from sections of the british press who questioned the intelligence of the whole stunt .
" it was a laugh , " meigan says .
" we did it , no-one died so what 's the problem ? "
when pressed on his football allegiances , meighan makes it very clear where they lie .
" i 'm leicester city first , then england , " he says proudly .
" we all are .
serge even wore leicester socks under his forest kit when he was a boy .
but when the world cup is on , it 's all about england for me . "
limiting expectations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capello may be " the man " but england still face a tough task the world cup .
as ever , the three lions depart for south africa with the huge weight of expectation following in their vapor trail .
it 's the same with every major tournament england qualify for – regardless of what history has taught them , that going out on penalties in the quarter-finals is the best most of us can hope for .
the majority of england fans just ca n't help getting carried away .
the singer , however , puts himself squarely in the realist camp when it comes to england 's chances in south africa .
" i really hope we 'll win it , i really do , but i do n't think we will .
-lrb- coach fabio -rrb- capello is the man , and he 's made a huge difference , but i just do n't think we 're good enough . "
spain are dangerous but watch the dutch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meighan rates torres and villa as the best strike force " a lot of people are tipping spain to win it and when you look at the players they 've got , it 's hard to see who 's going to be better , " he says .
" if torres and villa are on song , then there 's no better strike force .
they have xavi , iniesta , fabregas , alonso – the midfield is just unreal .
the way they took people apart at the euros ... who is there out of the non-europeans who can beat them ?
brazil ?
past it .
argentina ?
too mental . "
so is the kasabian front man putting his next album advance on spain lifting the world cup this year ?
nope .
" i 'm telling you , man , " he says conspiratorially .
" keep an eye on the dutch .
you talk about the spanish midfield but look at robben , sneijder , van bommel ...
then they 've got huntelaar , van persie , even that carthorse kuyt does wonders in an orange shirt .
mark my words ... the dutch . "
write germany off at your peril bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany can play badly and still make it to the final and what about england 's nemesis , germany ?
" you 'd be stupid to right them off even though their squad is lacking star power , " he says .
" but it never matters to the germans , does it ?
they could be crap for months and scrape through in qualifying but when it comes to the tournament , they 're always in the final .
i do n't rate them but they 'll probably go and win it now just to show me up . "
kasabian 's summer festival dance card is booked through the world cup but another happy event planned for june could mean an opportunity comes their way for some concentrated football watching .
" chris our bass player and his wife are having their baby right when the world cup starts so we 'll take a week off for that and settle in for some serious viewing .
but then we 'll have to go back on the tour after that so we 'll try and see as much as we can . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : on the sidelines of the world cup entrepreneurs bring ' high-tech ' vuvuzelas to germany european companies offer up possible goal-line technologies football changes girls ' lives in rural kenya world cup reinforces middle eastern animosities soccer -pipe- 05.06.2010 south africa 's vuvuzela is a high-volume business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south africa 's vuvuzelas promise to be a blast no visit to a soccer stadium in south africa is complete without a vuvuzela .
the long , thin plastic horn is a popular fan article and could dominate audio coverage at the upcoming world cup games . the vuvuzela sounds a bit like a lovesick elephant or an angry bull - at least to european ears .
but for most south africans , it 's the unmistakable sound of soccer .
it 's simply part of the game , according to johannesburg soccer fan clinton currie .
" for me personally , i would say it represents our country , what we 're about , " currie told deutsche welle .
" we 're a noisy bunch of people basically , so that what it represents to me is something uniquely south african . "
passion turned business currie first started playing the vuvuzela 12 years ago .
what began as a bit of fun with a simple instrument gradually evolved into a passion – and a business plan .
the entrepreneur took the horn , which was previously available only in a single color , and branded it by adding a range of printed designs and colors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton currie plans to sell a million colorfully printed vuvuzelas the idea has taken off .
recent months have seen currie and his employees at the vuvuzela branding company rush to complete orders for one million printed horns .
most of them will bear the south african flag .
other designs include the flags of the united states , the netherlands and australia .
all of them are made of a robust plastic well suited for use in crowded stadiums .
others producers have also joined the fray .
today , there 's a wide range of horns on the market , from smaller models covered in sparkling stones to larger trumpets hand-painted by local artists .
and their prices cover the entire gamut .
according to theresa granger , who works at a souvenir shop on long street in cape town , regular vuvuzelas made from plastic cost about six euros , while fancier collectors ' versions decorated with pearls can fetch up to 100 .
granger said she has been selling about 20 horns a week over the past few months .
they 're particularly popular with tourists from brazil .
bildunterschrift : will foreign visitors be able to match the noise produced at south african club matches ?
no ban at games but will visiting soccer fans really be able to take their vuvuzelas into the stadium on game day ?
earlier this year , south african media reported organizers were under pressure to ban the instruments from world cup venues because they were too loud and could intimidate foreign teams .
fifa officials in johannesburg have since announced that vuvuzelas are part of south african football culture , and will indeed be permitted in stadiums .
granger is among the many south africans who welcome the move .
" you ca n't ban it because it is a south african thing " and the event happens to be taking place in the country , she said .
the exact origin of the vuvuzela is unknown .

the long , thin plastic horn is a popular fan article and could dominate audio coverage at the upcoming world cup games . the vuvuzela sounds a bit like a lovesick elephant or an angry bull - at least to european ears .
but for most south africans , it 's the unmistakable sound of soccer .
it 's simply part of the game , according to johannesburg soccer fan clinton currie .
" for me personally , i would say it represents our country , what we 're about , " currie told deutsche welle .
" we 're a noisy bunch of people basically , so that what it represents to me is something uniquely south african . "
passion turned business currie first started playing the vuvuzela 12 years ago .
what began as a bit of fun with a simple instrument gradually evolved into a passion – and a business plan .
the entrepreneur took the horn , which was previously available only in a single color , and branded it by adding a range of printed designs and colors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton currie plans to sell a million colorfully printed vuvuzelas the idea has taken off .
recent months have seen currie and his employees at the vuvuzela branding company rush to complete orders for one million printed horns .
most of them will bear the south african flag .
other designs include the flags of the united states , the netherlands and australia .
all of them are made of a robust plastic well suited for use in crowded stadiums .
others producers have also joined the fray .
today , there 's a wide range of horns on the market , from smaller models covered in sparkling stones to larger trumpets hand-painted by local artists .
and their prices cover the entire gamut .
according to theresa granger , who works at a souvenir shop on long street in cape town , regular vuvuzelas made from plastic cost about six euros , while fancier collectors ' versions decorated with pearls can fetch up to 100 .
granger said she has been selling about 20 horns a week over the past few months .
they 're particularly popular with tourists from brazil .
bildunterschrift : will foreign visitors be able to match the noise produced at south african club matches ?
no ban at games but will visiting soccer fans really be able to take their vuvuzelas into the stadium on game day ?
earlier this year , south african media reported organizers were under pressure to ban the instruments from world cup venues because they were too loud and could intimidate foreign teams .
fifa officials in johannesburg have since announced that vuvuzelas are part of south african football culture , and will indeed be permitted in stadiums .
granger is among the many south africans who welcome the move .
" you ca n't ban it because it is a south african thing " and the event happens to be taking place in the country , she said .
the exact origin of the vuvuzela is unknown .

recent months have seen currie and his employees at the vuvuzela branding company rush to complete orders for one million printed horns .
most of them will bear the south african flag .
other designs include the flags of the united states , the netherlands and australia .
all of them are made of a robust plastic well suited for use in crowded stadiums .
others producers have also joined the fray .
today , there 's a wide range of horns on the market , from smaller models covered in sparkling stones to larger trumpets hand-painted by local artists .
and their prices cover the entire gamut .
according to theresa granger , who works at a souvenir shop on long street in cape town , regular vuvuzelas made from plastic cost about six euros , while fancier collectors ' versions decorated with pearls can fetch up to 100 .
granger said she has been selling about 20 horns a week over the past few months .
they 're particularly popular with tourists from brazil .
bildunterschrift : will foreign visitors be able to match the noise produced at south african club matches ?
no ban at games but will visiting soccer fans really be able to take their vuvuzelas into the stadium on game day ?
earlier this year , south african media reported organizers were under pressure to ban the instruments from world cup venues because they were too loud and could intimidate foreign teams .
fifa officials in johannesburg have since announced that vuvuzelas are part of south african football culture , and will indeed be permitted in stadiums .
granger is among the many south africans who welcome the move .
" you ca n't ban it because it is a south african thing " and the event happens to be taking place in the country , she said .
the exact origin of the vuvuzela is unknown .
one theory points to the long , thin trumpets made from kudu horns , once used by community leaders to call village gatherings .
later , the trumpets were manufactured from sheet metal - and then , in the 1990s , soccer fans decided to put them to a new use , and plastic models emerged .
" practice before game day " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : currie : ' we 're a noisy bunch of people basically ' it does n't matter if it 's the kaizer chiefs playing the orlando pirates , or the mamelodi sundown tackling ajax cape town - the sound of the vuvuzela can be heard at every soccer match across the country .
currie doubts , however , that this summer 's world cup games will be anywhere near as loud as normal south african league matches .
" the fans that are going to attend do n't know how to blow the vuvuzela , " he said .
that said , currie and many other south africans are confident that most visiting fans will have a good time with the instrument - as long as they practice a little before game day .

rescue workers and firefighters were working to strengthen dikes recently repaired after flooding first hit the area in may .
prime minister donald tusk on saturday described the situation in the south of the country as " dangerous . "
last month , at least 22 people died as the country experienced its worst flooding in decades .
on saturday , the vistula opened a 20-meter -lrb- 22 yard -rrb- wide hole in flood defenses protecting the village of slupiec .
amphibious army vessels were used to help rescue some 3,000 people as well as animals from the endangered area .
further north , in the region where some 20 villages were flooded last month , water was also reported to be breaching flood defenses .
at least three people have died in the latest round of flooding , while an additional two have been reported missing .

rising waters forced the evacuation of 1,500 people in slovakia 's second largest city of kosice on saturday amid fears the swollen hornad river would overflow and flood surrounding areas .
prime minister robert fico held a government meeting on saturday to discuss the floods , which he said were the worst in a century .
the eastern and southern parts of the country have been worst hit .
so far , only three deaths have been reported in slovakia .
" we are lucky that slovakia does not have to cope with a larger number of flood victims , " fico told reporters .
bridges and railway lines in the country have been severely damaged , fico said , and more than 3,000 soldiers had been drafted into the affected areas to support civilian emergency services .

both occupy similar neighborhoods in the sprawling metropolis of popular culture and share many of the same traits , making them more than just nodding acquaintances .
both instill a loyalty in their followers which borders on obsession , both have supporters bound by a gang mentality and both can play havoc with emotions .
they are so intimate at times that it can be difficult to separate them .

their credentials as britain 's premier soccer-rockers were further enhanced in february when the english football association chose them to launch the new england away shirt for the 2010 world cup in south africa .

kasabian 's links to football culture are not confined to the british isles and european audiences find it just as easy to slip into a stadium mentality at their shows , which made debuting the new england shirt in front of a partisan french crowd a risky proposition .
thankfully , apart from some heckling , the only other abuse the band and the fa got was from sections of the british press who questioned the intelligence of the whole stunt .
" it was a laugh , " meigan says .
" we did it , no-one died so what 's the problem ? "
when pressed on his football allegiances , meighan makes it very clear where they lie .
" i 'm leicester city first , then england , " he says proudly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : on the sidelines of the world cup entrepreneurs bring ' high-tech ' vuvuzelas to germany european companies offer up possible goal-line technologies football changes girls ' lives in rural kenya world cup reinforces middle eastern animosities soccer -pipe- 05.06.2010 south africa 's vuvuzela is a high-volume business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south africa 's vuvuzelas promise to be a blast no visit to a soccer stadium in south africa is complete without a vuvuzela .
the long , thin plastic horn is a popular fan article and could dominate audio coverage at the upcoming world cup games . the vuvuzela sounds a bit like a lovesick elephant or an angry bull - at least to european ears .
but for most south africans , it 's the unmistakable sound of soccer .
it 's simply part of the game , according to johannesburg soccer fan clinton currie .
" for me personally , i would say it represents our country , what we 're about , " currie told deutsche welle .
" we 're a noisy bunch of people basically , so that what it represents to me is something uniquely south african . "
passion turned business currie first started playing the vuvuzela 12 years ago .
what began as a bit of fun with a simple instrument gradually evolved into a passion – and a business plan .
the entrepreneur took the horn , which was previously available only in a single color , and branded it by adding a range of printed designs and colors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton currie plans to sell a million colorfully printed vuvuzelas the idea has taken off .
recent months have seen currie and his employees at the vuvuzela branding company rush to complete orders for one million printed horns .
most of them will bear the south african flag .
other designs include the flags of the united states , the netherlands and australia .
all of them are made of a robust plastic well suited for use in crowded stadiums .
others producers have also joined the fray .
today , there 's a wide range of horns on the market , from smaller models covered in sparkling stones to larger trumpets hand-painted by local artists .
and their prices cover the entire gamut .
according to theresa granger , who works at a souvenir shop on long street in cape town , regular vuvuzelas made from plastic cost about six euros , while fancier collectors ' versions decorated with pearls can fetch up to 100 .
granger said she has been selling about 20 horns a week over the past few months .
they 're particularly popular with tourists from brazil .
bildunterschrift : will foreign visitors be able to match the noise produced at south african club matches ?
no ban at games but will visiting soccer fans really be able to take their vuvuzelas into the stadium on game day ?
earlier this year , south african media reported organizers were under pressure to ban the instruments from world cup venues because they were too loud and could intimidate foreign teams .
fifa officials in johannesburg have since announced that vuvuzelas are part of south african football culture , and will indeed be permitted in stadiums .
granger is among the many south africans who welcome the move .
" you ca n't ban it because it is a south african thing " and the event happens to be taking place in the country , she said .
the exact origin of the vuvuzela is unknown .
one theory points to the long , thin trumpets made from kudu horns , once used by community leaders to call village gatherings .
later , the trumpets were manufactured from sheet metal - and then , in the 1990s , soccer fans decided to put them to a new use , and plastic models emerged .

however , political allies have said that tax hikes would be preferable . german chancellor angela merkel said that she would prefer to cut social welfare rather than raise taxes , as the country looks to balance its budget .

making her comments after meeting russian president dmitry medvedev , she said she did not favor tax hikes or increased social welfare premiums to help plug the gap .
in its enthusiasm for fiscal discipline within the eu , the german government is promising to dramatically reduce its deficit .
" it 's vital that we readjust the balance between investment in the future and social welfare handouts , " said merkel .

it has to happen by making the structures of social security more efficient , " she said .

friedrich has suggested that income taxes on high earners could be increased .
in an interview with the german newspaper bild am sonntag , to be published sunday , stefan mappus , premier of the state of baden-wuerttemberg and a member of merkel 's christian democrats , said sales taxes could be raised on certain consumer products that are currently taxed at a low rate .
germany had a budget deficit of more then 86 billion euros -lrb- $ 103 billion -rrb- this year .
the government aims to cut at least 10 billion euros each year until 2016 .

" i ask myself why it was not possible in the conservative camp to agree with the spd on gauck , " he told der spiegel magazine .
" i personally have huge sympathies for joachim gauck , " holger zastrow , head of the market-friendly liberal fdp , the cdu 's government coalition partner , in the state of saxony told newspaper welt am sonntag .
" we 're not going to automatically back christian wulff -lrb- the governing coalition 's candidate backed by chancellor merkel -rrb- . "
in an interview with deutsche welle on friday , gauck said the next president would have to restore people 's faith in politics .
" i do n't like this increasing divide between the political class and the average population , and many people in germany do n't like it either , " he said .
" we all have to work together to change this , to make sure that the people and the politicians come closer together . "
gauck also criticized a " mindset of worry " present in much of western europe .
" here , the presidential office can play a bigger role than others to banish fear and say to the people that they wo n't be victims of their own trepidation , but that they have a number of possibilities " he said .
" fear makes you short-sighted … and that 's why we need a broader effort to empower the people to find ways out of this crisis . "
not a mere politician the head of the social democrats , sigmar gabriel , praised gauck as someone " who comes with a full life to his candidacy , not just a political career . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gauck has the backing of the social democrats and the greens after reunification in 1990 , the 70-year-old gauck became the head of the stasi archives and led the organization that catalogues and analyzes documents from east germany 's secret police .
gauck , a protestant pastor from the former east , was a well-known civil rights activist before reunification .
he was a member of the new forum , a democratic opposition movement in east germany .
former german foreign minister and head of the social democrats in parliament , frank-walter steinmeier , said he is confident that gauck will gain broad support .
" i 'm sure he will not only be supported by the public , but that he will also motivate a few people in the federal convention to consider if their decision should be based on narrow-minded party political arguments . "
the social democrats as well as the greens criticized chancellor angela merkel 's government for choosing their candidate based on political aspects rather than suitability .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the support of the ruling coalition , wulff is likely to become the next german president government candidate germany 's governing coalition on thursday announced their candidate for president , the state premier of lower saxony , christian wulff .
chancellor angela merkel led the proposals for wulff as the successor to horst koehler , who resigned unexpectedly at the start of the week .
wulff has governed the state of lower saxony since 2003 and would be germany 's youngest-ever president .
he is a deputy leader of merkel 's christian democrat party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
in accepting the nomination , wulff said the office of president was " a great duty , with great responsibility . "
he added he " looked forward to the challenge " and would try to " bring optimism in difficult times . "
next stages the federal convention is scheduled to vote on the new president june 30 .
the assembly is made up of 1,244 state and federal lawmakers , and merkel 's coalition has a majority .
the role of the german president is largely ceremonial , although the president does sign off on legislation and is seen as a figurehead on national issues .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : on the sidelines of the world cup entrepreneurs bring ' high-tech ' vuvuzelas to germany european companies offer up possible goal-line technologies football changes girls ' lives in rural kenya world cup reinforces middle eastern animosities soccer -pipe- 05.06.2010 south africa 's vuvuzela is a high-volume business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south africa 's vuvuzelas promise to be a blast no visit to a soccer stadium in south africa is complete without a vuvuzela .
the long , thin plastic horn is a popular fan article and could dominate audio coverage at the upcoming world cup games . the vuvuzela sounds a bit like a lovesick elephant or an angry bull - at least to european ears .
but for most south africans , it 's the unmistakable sound of soccer .
it 's simply part of the game , according to johannesburg soccer fan clinton currie .
" for me personally , i would say it represents our country , what we 're about , " currie told deutsche welle .
" we 're a noisy bunch of people basically , so that what it represents to me is something uniquely south african . "
passion turned business currie first started playing the vuvuzela 12 years ago .
what began as a bit of fun with a simple instrument gradually evolved into a passion – and a business plan .
the entrepreneur took the horn , which was previously available only in a single color , and branded it by adding a range of printed designs and colors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton currie plans to sell a million colorfully printed vuvuzelas the idea has taken off .
recent months have seen currie and his employees at the vuvuzela branding company rush to complete orders for one million printed horns .
most of them will bear the south african flag .
other designs include the flags of the united states , the netherlands and australia .
all of them are made of a robust plastic well suited for use in crowded stadiums .
others producers have also joined the fray .
today , there 's a wide range of horns on the market , from smaller models covered in sparkling stones to larger trumpets hand-painted by local artists .
and their prices cover the entire gamut .
according to theresa granger , who works at a souvenir shop on long street in cape town , regular vuvuzelas made from plastic cost about six euros , while fancier collectors ' versions decorated with pearls can fetch up to 100 .
granger said she has been selling about 20 horns a week over the past few months .
they 're particularly popular with tourists from brazil .
bildunterschrift : will foreign visitors be able to match the noise produced at south african club matches ?
no ban at games but will visiting soccer fans really be able to take their vuvuzelas into the stadium on game day ?
earlier this year , south african media reported organizers were under pressure to ban the instruments from world cup venues because they were too loud and could intimidate foreign teams .
fifa officials in johannesburg have since announced that vuvuzelas are part of south african football culture , and will indeed be permitted in stadiums .
granger is among the many south africans who welcome the move .
" you ca n't ban it because it is a south african thing " and the event happens to be taking place in the country , she said .
the exact origin of the vuvuzela is unknown .
one theory points to the long , thin trumpets made from kudu horns , once used by community leaders to call village gatherings .
later , the trumpets were manufactured from sheet metal - and then , in the 1990s , soccer fans decided to put them to a new use , and plastic models emerged .
" practice before game day " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : currie : ' we 're a noisy bunch of people basically ' it does n't matter if it 's the kaizer chiefs playing the orlando pirates , or the mamelodi sundown tackling ajax cape town - the sound of the vuvuzela can be heard at every soccer match across the country .
currie doubts , however , that this summer 's world cup games will be anywhere near as loud as normal south african league matches .
" the fans that are going to attend do n't know how to blow the vuvuzela , " he said .
that said , currie and many other south africans are confident that most visiting fans will have a good time with the instrument - as long as they practice a little before game day .

secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said nato 's doors " remain open , " despite the ukrainian parliament 's approval of a bill preventing the country from joining nato .
the move was widely seen as further evidence the new government in kyiv is overturning the previous government 's pro-western policies .
the draft law is expected to be signed by ukrainian president victor yanukovych in the weeks to come .
the bill excludes the goal of integration into euro-atlantic security and nato membership .
nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said nato would take no decision to reverse the bucharest agreement , welcoming membership for both ukraine and georgia .
" the bucharest decision still stands .
we have no intention to change that decision … .our door remains open , " rasmussen said .
an open door but the nato chief also stressed the organization is voluntary .
" it 's for each individual country in europe to decide its alliance affiliation , which means that it 's also for ukraine to decide how its relationship with nato should develop in the coming years , " rasmussen added .
ukraine 's decision to shelve its plans to join nato was crafted by the president himself .
the parliamentary bill commits ukraine to " a non-bloc policy which means non-participation in military-political alliances . "
but nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said that does not mean nato 's cooperation with ukraine is over .
he confirmed the ukrainian defense minister would be participating in an upcoming nato-ukraine meeting .

"
censorship concerns earlier this week , officials from the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe expressed concern about media censorship and physical attacks on journalists in ukraine - charges viktor yanukovych 's government denies .
in brussels , nato officials publicly insist ukraine makes its own decisions , and is welcome to join the alliance should it change its mind .
but there is still lingering concern that ukraine is drifting away from europe , in an effort to get closer to moscow .

secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said nato 's doors " remain open , " despite the ukrainian parliament 's approval of a bill preventing the country from joining nato .
the move was widely seen as further evidence the new government in kyiv is overturning the previous government 's pro-western policies .
the draft law is expected to be signed by ukrainian president victor yanukovych in the weeks to come .
the bill excludes the goal of integration into euro-atlantic security and nato membership .
nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said nato would take no decision to reverse the bucharest agreement , welcoming membership for both ukraine and georgia .
" the bucharest decision still stands .
we have no intention to change that decision … .our door remains open , " rasmussen said .
an open door but the nato chief also stressed the organization is voluntary .
" it 's for each individual country in europe to decide its alliance affiliation , which means that it 's also for ukraine to decide how its relationship with nato should develop in the coming years , " rasmussen added .
ukraine 's decision to shelve its plans to join nato was crafted by the president himself .
the parliamentary bill commits ukraine to " a non-bloc policy which means non-participation in military-political alliances . "
but nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said that does not mean nato 's cooperation with ukraine is over .
he confirmed the ukrainian defense minister would be participating in an upcoming nato-ukraine meeting .

"
censorship concerns earlier this week , officials from the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe expressed concern about media censorship and physical attacks on journalists in ukraine - charges viktor yanukovych 's government denies .
in brussels , nato officials publicly insist ukraine makes its own decisions , and is welcome to join the alliance should it change its mind .
but there is still lingering concern that ukraine is drifting away from europe , in an effort to get closer to moscow .

we look back at how the radio and tv corporation was born in post-war germany . just like the nation itself , public service broadcasters in the federal republic of germany grew up as separate insitutions in the various federal states .
sixty years ago this week , on 5th june 1950 , representatives of the individual regional radio stations came together to create the allgemeine rundfunkanstalt deutschlands -lrb- general german broadcasting corporation -rrb- .
the ard became the first nationwide public service broadcasting corporation .
the aim : to provide a platform for serious , independent , objective reporting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regional broadcasters form the core element of the overall system in germany " it is our deep conviction that radio stations should no longer be a mouth-piece of the respective government , " said the american controlling officer at the time , edmund schaechter .
" stations should represent every level of society and give all political groups and parties the opportunity to voice their opinion . "
the allies ' restructuring of german broadcasters german public sevice broadcasting was shaped by the post-war landscape .
in the aftermath of the second world war one of the immediate priorities for the allies was to break up the existing nazi structures .
radio was targeted in particular , because it had been abused as a propaganda tool during the third reich .
the allies were keen to re-establish radio as independent from the state , to act as a critical voice and to try to prevent extremism ever taking hold again .
in west germany , public service broadcasting was established on french , british and american models , notably the bbc .
the resulting ard united the various regional broadcasters , and for years , television viewers could only watch regional programmes , and one national programme .
only much later was competion established in the form of a second public broadcaster -lrb- in 1963 -rrb- and commercial broadcasting -lrb- in 1984 -rrb- .
in east germany , on the other side of the iron curtain , a separate system developed , along soviet lines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tagesschau has long established itself as germany 's main news show the western allies wanted the german public broadcaster to represent the whole of society , and reflect a range of views and political opinions .
independence from the state and political objectivity remain the hallmark of public service broadcasting in germany today .
however , politicians and parties have been accused over the decades of using public service broadcasters for their own means .
there is controversy over party political broadcasts which are aired in the run up to elections .
they are said to be propaganda for the parties .
but ard justifies this saying they are not responsible for the content .
furthermore , politicians sitting on the broadcasting council , have considerable influence over the choice for who runs the public service broadcaster .
it is not uncommon , therefore , that the top spot goes to someone who belongs to the most influential party at the time .
the federal structure of public service broadcasting in germany is seen as one of its key strengths , and has remained in place since its foundation .
the individual regional broadcasters are still responsible for their programmes .
they are largely protected from the long arm of the state by a guaranteed funding sytem .
a huge operation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular tv series such as tatort continue to top the ratings lists ard , the first german public service broadcaster , started out as a small institution .
the 9 regional stations now employ around 20,000 staff members , and many more freelancers .
they produce 11 television channels , 55 radio stations and have 16 orchestras and choirs under their belt .
the total budget for the public service broadcasters is around 6.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.7 billion -rrb- a year .
ard has a network of correspondents in 30 countries , as well as studios across germany .
in its 60 year history , ard has managed to establish itself as part of day-to-day life in germany .
the daily news show the ' tagesschau ' which airs every night at 8pm , has become an institution for millions of german families .
even the commercial television stations , which were founded in the 1980s and have since posed big competition for public broadcasters , can not touch it .
it still has around 10 million viewers a day .
other famous shows like the popular crime series , ' tatort ' , live sports broadcasts and family-orientated shows on saturday evenings mean that the first german broadcaster has maintained relatively high audience figures , although commercial broadcasters pose stiff competition .

the meeting , which was designed to work out an agenda for the g20 summit in toronto , canada , at the end of the month , produced a communique that endorses the need for budgetary discipline and regulation of financial markets , but shies away from a global bank levy proposed by the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , european countries , including germany , and the us .
resistance to global bank levy canada and australia are among those opposed to such a levy , as they believe they should not have to pay to clear up a mess they did not create .
canada 's finance minister jim flaherty told reporters that the debate on the bank levy had been " a distraction from core issues " and that most ministers " do not support the concept of a universal levy . "
german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , however , insisted that regulating the banking industry must remain a global priority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble has defended germany 's tough stance on fiscal restraint " i pointed out that we will need to make a decision in toronto , " he told the reuters news agency .

balancing budgets and stimulating growth the g20 communique calls on member states to get their finances in order to reduce billowing budget deficits , while stimulating growth at the same time .
the imf and the united states in particular , have repeatedly called on low-growth economies like germany to boost domestic demand .
germany is europe 's top exporter , but consumer spending is traditionally lackluster , thus creating an imbalance in the country 's trade balance .
but schaeuble again dismissed the criticism , insisting that " we have to look at europe , or at least the eurozone , as a whole , " he told reuters , meaning that the trade balance of the entire eurozone shows no imbalances with other parts of the world .

the meeting , which was designed to work out an agenda for the g20 summit in toronto , canada , at the end of the month , produced a communique that endorses the need for budgetary discipline and regulation of financial markets , but shies away from a global bank levy proposed by the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , european countries , including germany , and the us .
resistance to global bank levy canada and australia are among those opposed to such a levy , as they believe they should not have to pay to clear up a mess they did not create .
canada 's finance minister jim flaherty told reporters that the debate on the bank levy had been " a distraction from core issues " and that most ministers " do not support the concept of a universal levy . "
german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , however , insisted that regulating the banking industry must remain a global priority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble has defended germany 's tough stance on fiscal restraint " i pointed out that we will need to make a decision in toronto , " he told the reuters news agency .
" there 's a lot of pressure to even go beyond a levy and impose a tax on banks , " he added .
balancing budgets and stimulating growth the g20 communique calls on member states to get their finances in order to reduce billowing budget deficits , while stimulating growth at the same time .
the imf and the united states in particular , have repeatedly called on low-growth economies like germany to boost domestic demand .
germany is europe 's top exporter , but consumer spending is traditionally lackluster , thus creating an imbalance in the country 's trade balance .
but schaeuble again dismissed the criticism , insisting that " we have to look at europe , or at least the eurozone , as a whole , " he told reuters , meaning that the trade balance of the entire eurozone shows no imbalances with other parts of the world .

the long , thin plastic horn is a popular fan article and could dominate audio coverage at the upcoming world cup games . the vuvuzela sounds a bit like a lovesick elephant or an angry bull - at least to european ears .
but for most south africans , it 's the unmistakable sound of soccer .
it 's simply part of the game , according to johannesburg soccer fan clinton currie .
" for me personally , i would say it represents our country , what we 're about , " currie told deutsche welle .
" we 're a noisy bunch of people basically , so that what it represents to me is something uniquely south african . "
passion turned business currie first started playing the vuvuzela 12 years ago .
what began as a bit of fun with a simple instrument gradually evolved into a passion – and a business plan .
the entrepreneur took the horn , which was previously available only in a single color , and branded it by adding a range of printed designs and colors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton currie plans to sell a million colorfully printed vuvuzelas the idea has taken off .
recent months have seen currie and his employees at the vuvuzela branding company rush to complete orders for one million printed horns .
most of them will bear the south african flag .
other designs include the flags of the united states , the netherlands and australia .
all of them are made of a robust plastic well suited for use in crowded stadiums .
others producers have also joined the fray .
today , there 's a wide range of horns on the market , from smaller models covered in sparkling stones to larger trumpets hand-painted by local artists .
and their prices cover the entire gamut .
according to theresa granger , who works at a souvenir shop on long street in cape town , regular vuvuzelas made from plastic cost about six euros , while fancier collectors ' versions decorated with pearls can fetch up to 100 .
granger said she has been selling about 20 horns a week over the past few months .
they 're particularly popular with tourists from brazil .
bildunterschrift : will foreign visitors be able to match the noise produced at south african club matches ?
no ban at games but will visiting soccer fans really be able to take their vuvuzelas into the stadium on game day ?
earlier this year , south african media reported organizers were under pressure to ban the instruments from world cup venues because they were too loud and could intimidate foreign teams .
fifa officials in johannesburg have since announced that vuvuzelas are part of south african football culture , and will indeed be permitted in stadiums .
granger is among the many south africans who welcome the move .
" you ca n't ban it because it is a south african thing " and the event happens to be taking place in the country , she said .
the exact origin of the vuvuzela is unknown .
one theory points to the long , thin trumpets made from kudu horns , once used by community leaders to call village gatherings .
later , the trumpets were manufactured from sheet metal - and then , in the 1990s , soccer fans decided to put them to a new use , and plastic models emerged .
" practice before game day " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : currie : ' we 're a noisy bunch of people basically ' it does n't matter if it 's the kaizer chiefs playing the orlando pirates , or the mamelodi sundown tackling ajax cape town - the sound of the vuvuzela can be heard at every soccer match across the country .
currie doubts , however , that this summer 's world cup games will be anywhere near as loud as normal south african league matches .
" the fans that are going to attend do n't know how to blow the vuvuzela , " he said .
that said , currie and many other south africans are confident that most visiting fans will have a good time with the instrument - as long as they practice a little before game day .

we look back at how the radio and tv corporation was born in post-war germany . just like the nation itself , public service broadcasters in the federal republic of germany grew up as separate insitutions in the various federal states .
sixty years ago this week , on 5th june 1950 , representatives of the individual regional radio stations came together to create the allgemeine rundfunkanstalt deutschlands -lrb- general german broadcasting corporation -rrb- .
the ard became the first nationwide public service broadcasting corporation .
the aim : to provide a platform for serious , independent , objective reporting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regional broadcasters form the core element of the overall system in germany " it is our deep conviction that radio stations should no longer be a mouth-piece of the respective government , " said the american controlling officer at the time , edmund schaechter .
" stations should represent every level of society and give all political groups and parties the opportunity to voice their opinion . "
the allies ' restructuring of german broadcasters german public sevice broadcasting was shaped by the post-war landscape .
in the aftermath of the second world war one of the immediate priorities for the allies was to break up the existing nazi structures .
radio was targeted in particular , because it had been abused as a propaganda tool during the third reich .
the allies were keen to re-establish radio as independent from the state , to act as a critical voice and to try to prevent extremism ever taking hold again .
in west germany , public service broadcasting was established on french , british and american models , notably the bbc .
the resulting ard united the various regional broadcasters , and for years , television viewers could only watch regional programmes , and one national programme .
only much later was competion established in the form of a second public broadcaster -lrb- in 1963 -rrb- and commercial broadcasting -lrb- in 1984 -rrb- .
in east germany , on the other side of the iron curtain , a separate system developed , along soviet lines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tagesschau has long established itself as germany 's main news show the western allies wanted the german public broadcaster to represent the whole of society , and reflect a range of views and political opinions .
independence from the state and political objectivity remain the hallmark of public service broadcasting in germany today .
however , politicians and parties have been accused over the decades of using public service broadcasters for their own means .
there is controversy over party political broadcasts which are aired in the run up to elections .
they are said to be propaganda for the parties .
but ard justifies this saying they are not responsible for the content .
furthermore , politicians sitting on the broadcasting council , have considerable influence over the choice for who runs the public service broadcaster .
it is not uncommon , therefore , that the top spot goes to someone who belongs to the most influential party at the time .
the federal structure of public service broadcasting in germany is seen as one of its key strengths , and has remained in place since its foundation .
the individual regional broadcasters are still responsible for their programmes .
they are largely protected from the long arm of the state by a guaranteed funding sytem .
a huge operation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular tv series such as tatort continue to top the ratings lists ard , the first german public service broadcaster , started out as a small institution .
the 9 regional stations now employ around 20,000 staff members , and many more freelancers .
they produce 11 television channels , 55 radio stations and have 16 orchestras and choirs under their belt .
the total budget for the public service broadcasters is around 6.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.7 billion -rrb- a year .
ard has a network of correspondents in 30 countries , as well as studios across germany .
in its 60 year history , ard has managed to establish itself as part of day-to-day life in germany .
the daily news show the ' tagesschau ' which airs every night at 8pm , has become an institution for millions of german families .
even the commercial television stations , which were founded in the 1980s and have since posed big competition for public broadcasters , can not touch it .
it still has around 10 million viewers a day .
other famous shows like the popular crime series , ' tatort ' , live sports broadcasts and family-orientated shows on saturday evenings mean that the first german broadcaster has maintained relatively high audience figures , although commercial broadcasters pose stiff competition .

the meeting , which was designed to work out an agenda for the g20 summit in toronto , canada , at the end of the month , produced a communique that endorses the need for budgetary discipline and regulation of financial markets , but shies away from a global bank levy proposed by the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , european countries , including germany , and the us .
resistance to global bank levy canada and australia are among those opposed to such a levy , as they believe they should not have to pay to clear up a mess they did not create .
canada 's finance minister jim flaherty told reporters that the debate on the bank levy had been " a distraction from core issues " and that most ministers " do not support the concept of a universal levy . "
german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , however , insisted that regulating the banking industry must remain a global priority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble has defended germany 's tough stance on fiscal restraint " i pointed out that we will need to make a decision in toronto , " he told the reuters news agency .
" there 's a lot of pressure to even go beyond a levy and impose a tax on banks , " he added .
balancing budgets and stimulating growth the g20 communique calls on member states to get their finances in order to reduce billowing budget deficits , while stimulating growth at the same time .
the imf and the united states in particular , have repeatedly called on low-growth economies like germany to boost domestic demand .
germany is europe 's top exporter , but consumer spending is traditionally lackluster , thus creating an imbalance in the country 's trade balance .
but schaeuble again dismissed the criticism , insisting that " we have to look at europe , or at least the eurozone , as a whole , " he told reuters , meaning that the trade balance of the entire eurozone shows no imbalances with other parts of the world .

secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said nato 's doors " remain open , " despite the ukrainian parliament 's approval of a bill preventing the country from joining nato .
the move was widely seen as further evidence the new government in kyiv is overturning the previous government 's pro-western policies .
the draft law is expected to be signed by ukrainian president victor yanukovych in the weeks to come .
the bill excludes the goal of integration into euro-atlantic security and nato membership .
nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said nato would take no decision to reverse the bucharest agreement , welcoming membership for both ukraine and georgia .
" the bucharest decision still stands .
we have no intention to change that decision … .our door remains open , " rasmussen said .
an open door but the nato chief also stressed the organization is voluntary .
" it 's for each individual country in europe to decide its alliance affiliation , which means that it 's also for ukraine to decide how its relationship with nato should develop in the coming years , " rasmussen added .
ukraine 's decision to shelve its plans to join nato was crafted by the president himself .
the parliamentary bill commits ukraine to " a non-bloc policy which means non-participation in military-political alliances . "
but nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said that does not mean nato 's cooperation with ukraine is over .
he confirmed the ukrainian defense minister would be participating in an upcoming nato-ukraine meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear ukraine is drifting away from europe , in an effort to get closer to moscow " our cooperation with ukraine will continue within the existing framework and then it 's for ukraine to decide how this relationship and partnership should develop in the coming years . "
censorship concerns earlier this week , officials from the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe expressed concern about media censorship and physical attacks on journalists in ukraine - charges viktor yanukovych 's government denies .
in brussels , nato officials publicly insist ukraine makes its own decisions , and is welcome to join the alliance should it change its mind .
but there is still lingering concern that ukraine is drifting away from europe , in an effort to get closer to moscow .

" i ask myself why it was not possible in the conservative camp to agree with the spd on gauck , " he told der spiegel magazine .
" i personally have huge sympathies for joachim gauck , " holger zastrow , head of the market-friendly liberal fdp , the cdu 's government coalition partner , in the state of saxony told newspaper welt am sonntag .
" we 're not going to automatically back christian wulff -lrb- the governing coalition 's candidate backed by chancellor merkel -rrb- . "
in an interview with deutsche welle on friday , gauck said the next president would have to restore people 's faith in politics .
" i do n't like this increasing divide between the political class and the average population , and many people in germany do n't like it either , " he said .
" we all have to work together to change this , to make sure that the people and the politicians come closer together . "
gauck also criticized a " mindset of worry " present in much of western europe .
" here , the presidential office can play a bigger role than others to banish fear and say to the people that they wo n't be victims of their own trepidation , but that they have a number of possibilities " he said .
" fear makes you short-sighted … and that 's why we need a broader effort to empower the people to find ways out of this crisis . "
not a mere politician the head of the social democrats , sigmar gabriel , praised gauck as someone " who comes with a full life to his candidacy , not just a political career . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gauck has the backing of the social democrats and the greens after reunification in 1990 , the 70-year-old gauck became the head of the stasi archives and led the organization that catalogues and analyzes documents from east germany 's secret police .
gauck , a protestant pastor from the former east , was a well-known civil rights activist before reunification .
he was a member of the new forum , a democratic opposition movement in east germany .
former german foreign minister and head of the social democrats in parliament , frank-walter steinmeier , said he is confident that gauck will gain broad support .
" i 'm sure he will not only be supported by the public , but that he will also motivate a few people in the federal convention to consider if their decision should be based on narrow-minded party political arguments . "
the social democrats as well as the greens criticized chancellor angela merkel 's government for choosing their candidate based on political aspects rather than suitability .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the support of the ruling coalition , wulff is likely to become the next german president government candidate germany 's governing coalition on thursday announced their candidate for president , the state premier of lower saxony , christian wulff .
chancellor angela merkel led the proposals for wulff as the successor to horst koehler , who resigned unexpectedly at the start of the week .
wulff has governed the state of lower saxony since 2003 and would be germany 's youngest-ever president .
he is a deputy leader of merkel 's christian democrat party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
in accepting the nomination , wulff said the office of president was " a great duty , with great responsibility . "
he added he " looked forward to the challenge " and would try to " bring optimism in difficult times . "
next stages the federal convention is scheduled to vote on the new president june 30 .
the assembly is made up of 1,244 state and federal lawmakers , and merkel 's coalition has a majority .
the role of the german president is largely ceremonial , although the president does sign off on legislation and is seen as a figurehead on national issues .

the long , thin plastic horn is a popular fan article and could dominate audio coverage at the upcoming world cup games . the vuvuzela sounds a bit like a lovesick elephant or an angry bull - at least to european ears .
but for most south africans , it 's the unmistakable sound of soccer .
it 's simply part of the game , according to johannesburg soccer fan clinton currie .
" for me personally , i would say it represents our country , what we 're about , " currie told deutsche welle .
" we 're a noisy bunch of people basically , so that what it represents to me is something uniquely south african . "
passion turned business currie first started playing the vuvuzela 12 years ago .
what began as a bit of fun with a simple instrument gradually evolved into a passion – and a business plan .
the entrepreneur took the horn , which was previously available only in a single color , and branded it by adding a range of printed designs and colors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton currie plans to sell a million colorfully printed vuvuzelas the idea has taken off .
recent months have seen currie and his employees at the vuvuzela branding company rush to complete orders for one million printed horns .
most of them will bear the south african flag .
other designs include the flags of the united states , the netherlands and australia .
all of them are made of a robust plastic well suited for use in crowded stadiums .
others producers have also joined the fray .
today , there 's a wide range of horns on the market , from smaller models covered in sparkling stones to larger trumpets hand-painted by local artists .
and their prices cover the entire gamut .
according to theresa granger , who works at a souvenir shop on long street in cape town , regular vuvuzelas made from plastic cost about six euros , while fancier collectors ' versions decorated with pearls can fetch up to 100 .
granger said she has been selling about 20 horns a week over the past few months .
they 're particularly popular with tourists from brazil .
bildunterschrift : will foreign visitors be able to match the noise produced at south african club matches ?
no ban at games but will visiting soccer fans really be able to take their vuvuzelas into the stadium on game day ?
earlier this year , south african media reported organizers were under pressure to ban the instruments from world cup venues because they were too loud and could intimidate foreign teams .
fifa officials in johannesburg have since announced that vuvuzelas are part of south african football culture , and will indeed be permitted in stadiums .
granger is among the many south africans who welcome the move .
" you ca n't ban it because it is a south african thing " and the event happens to be taking place in the country , she said .
the exact origin of the vuvuzela is unknown .
one theory points to the long , thin trumpets made from kudu horns , once used by community leaders to call village gatherings .
later , the trumpets were manufactured from sheet metal - and then , in the 1990s , soccer fans decided to put them to a new use , and plastic models emerged .
" practice before game day " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : currie : ' we 're a noisy bunch of people basically ' it does n't matter if it 's the kaizer chiefs playing the orlando pirates , or the mamelodi sundown tackling ajax cape town - the sound of the vuvuzela can be heard at every soccer match across the country .
currie doubts , however , that this summer 's world cup games will be anywhere near as loud as normal south african league matches .
" the fans that are going to attend do n't know how to blow the vuvuzela , " he said .
that said , currie and many other south africans are confident that most visiting fans will have a good time with the instrument - as long as they practice a little before game day .

" i ask myself why it was not possible in the conservative camp to agree with the spd on gauck , " he told der spiegel magazine .
" i personally have huge sympathies for joachim gauck , " holger zastrow , head of the market-friendly liberal fdp , the cdu 's government coalition partner , in the state of saxony told newspaper welt am sonntag .
" we 're not going to automatically back christian wulff -lrb- the governing coalition 's candidate backed by chancellor merkel -rrb- . "
in an interview with deutsche welle on friday , gauck said the next president would have to restore people 's faith in politics .
" i do n't like this increasing divide between the political class and the average population , and many people in germany do n't like it either , " he said .
" we all have to work together to change this , to make sure that the people and the politicians come closer together . "
gauck also criticized a " mindset of worry " present in much of western europe .
" here , the presidential office can play a bigger role than others to banish fear and say to the people that they wo n't be victims of their own trepidation , but that they have a number of possibilities " he said .
" fear makes you short-sighted … and that 's why we need a broader effort to empower the people to find ways out of this crisis . "
not a mere politician the head of the social democrats , sigmar gabriel , praised gauck as someone " who comes with a full life to his candidacy , not just a political career . "

gauck , a protestant pastor from the former east , was a well-known civil rights activist before reunification .
he was a member of the new forum , a democratic opposition movement in east germany .
former german foreign minister and head of the social democrats in parliament , frank-walter steinmeier , said he is confident that gauck will gain broad support .
" i 'm sure he will not only be supported by the public , but that he will also motivate a few people in the federal convention to consider if their decision should be based on narrow-minded party political arguments . "
the social democrats as well as the greens criticized chancellor angela merkel 's government for choosing their candidate based on political aspects rather than suitability .

he is a deputy leader of merkel 's christian democrat party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
in accepting the nomination , wulff said the office of president was " a great duty , with great responsibility . "
he added he " looked forward to the challenge " and would try to " bring optimism in difficult times . "

secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said nato 's doors " remain open , " despite the ukrainian parliament 's approval of a bill preventing the country from joining nato .
the move was widely seen as further evidence the new government in kyiv is overturning the previous government 's pro-western policies .
the draft law is expected to be signed by ukrainian president victor yanukovych in the weeks to come .
the bill excludes the goal of integration into euro-atlantic security and nato membership .
nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said nato would take no decision to reverse the bucharest agreement , welcoming membership for both ukraine and georgia .
" the bucharest decision still stands .
we have no intention to change that decision … .our door remains open , " rasmussen said .
an open door but the nato chief also stressed the organization is voluntary .
" it 's for each individual country in europe to decide its alliance affiliation , which means that it 's also for ukraine to decide how its relationship with nato should develop in the coming years , " rasmussen added .
ukraine 's decision to shelve its plans to join nato was crafted by the president himself .
the parliamentary bill commits ukraine to " a non-bloc policy which means non-participation in military-political alliances . "
but nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said that does not mean nato 's cooperation with ukraine is over .
he confirmed the ukrainian defense minister would be participating in an upcoming nato-ukraine meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear ukraine is drifting away from europe , in an effort to get closer to moscow " our cooperation with ukraine will continue within the existing framework and then it 's for ukraine to decide how this relationship and partnership should develop in the coming years . "
censorship concerns earlier this week , officials from the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe expressed concern about media censorship and physical attacks on journalists in ukraine - charges viktor yanukovych 's government denies .
in brussels , nato officials publicly insist ukraine makes its own decisions , and is welcome to join the alliance should it change its mind .
but there is still lingering concern that ukraine is drifting away from europe , in an effort to get closer to moscow .

secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said nato 's doors " remain open , " despite the ukrainian parliament 's approval of a bill preventing the country from joining nato .
the move was widely seen as further evidence the new government in kyiv is overturning the previous government 's pro-western policies .
the draft law is expected to be signed by ukrainian president victor yanukovych in the weeks to come .
the bill excludes the goal of integration into euro-atlantic security and nato membership .
nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said nato would take no decision to reverse the bucharest agreement , welcoming membership for both ukraine and georgia .
" the bucharest decision still stands .
we have no intention to change that decision … .our door remains open , " rasmussen said .
an open door but the nato chief also stressed the organization is voluntary .
" it 's for each individual country in europe to decide its alliance affiliation , which means that it 's also for ukraine to decide how its relationship with nato should develop in the coming years , " rasmussen added .
ukraine 's decision to shelve its plans to join nato was crafted by the president himself .
the parliamentary bill commits ukraine to " a non-bloc policy which means non-participation in military-political alliances . "
but nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said that does not mean nato 's cooperation with ukraine is over .
he confirmed the ukrainian defense minister would be participating in an upcoming nato-ukraine meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear ukraine is drifting away from europe , in an effort to get closer to moscow " our cooperation with ukraine will continue within the existing framework and then it 's for ukraine to decide how this relationship and partnership should develop in the coming years . "
censorship concerns earlier this week , officials from the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe expressed concern about media censorship and physical attacks on journalists in ukraine - charges viktor yanukovych 's government denies .
in brussels , nato officials publicly insist ukraine makes its own decisions , and is welcome to join the alliance should it change its mind .
but there is still lingering concern that ukraine is drifting away from europe , in an effort to get closer to moscow .

but the big-selling british band 's first love is n't music - it 's football .
dw talked to singer tom meighan about the world cup . the connection between football and music is not a random one .
both occupy similar neighborhoods in the sprawling metropolis of popular culture and share many of the same traits , making them more than just nodding acquaintances .
both instill a loyalty in their followers which borders on obsession , both have supporters bound by a gang mentality and both can play havoc with emotions .
they are so intimate at times that it can be difficult to separate them .
for musicians , tapping into terrace culture can help their music reach a much wider audience and few current rock acts have so successfully blended fan bases than british band kasabian .
when it comes to ticking the cross-over boxes , the leicestershire four-piece are streets ahead of many of their rivals : they 're dyed-in-the-wool leicester city fans -lrb- so no evidence of glory hunting there -rrb- , guitarist serge pizzorno once had schoolboy trials with nottingham forest and as a celebrity team they 've taken on the likes of oasis and won .
their credentials as britain 's premier soccer-rockers were further enhanced in february when the english football association chose them to launch the new england away shirt for the 2010 world cup in south africa .
england kit launch in paris " i was really honored , " singer tom meighan told deutsche welle .
" but i had a few reservations about where they wanted us to do it . "
the fa , in their infinite wisdom , had chosen the band 's gig at the olympia in paris for the launch of the red shirt , modeled on the design of the 1966 world cup winning jersey .

i wanted to know that if there was a riot , they would get us out .
we got booed a bit , but then we played another song and everything was cool . "
kasabian 's links to football culture are not confined to the british isles and european audiences find it just as easy to slip into a stadium mentality at their shows , which made debuting the new england shirt in front of a partisan french crowd a risky proposition .
thankfully , apart from some heckling , the only other abuse the band and the fa got was from sections of the british press who questioned the intelligence of the whole stunt .
" it was a laugh , " meigan says .
" we did it , no-one died so what 's the problem ? "
when pressed on his football allegiances , meighan makes it very clear where they lie .
" i 'm leicester city first , then england , " he says proudly .
" we all are .
serge even wore leicester socks under his forest kit when he was a boy .
but when the world cup is on , it 's all about england for me . "

it 's the same with every major tournament england qualify for – regardless of what history has taught them , that going out on penalties in the quarter-finals is the best most of us can hope for .
the majority of england fans just ca n't help getting carried away .
the singer , however , puts himself squarely in the realist camp when it comes to england 's chances in south africa .
" i really hope we 'll win it , i really do , but i do n't think we will .

" i ask myself why it was not possible in the conservative camp to agree with the spd on gauck , " he told der spiegel magazine .
" i personally have huge sympathies for joachim gauck , " holger zastrow , head of the market-friendly liberal fdp , the cdu 's government coalition partner , in the state of saxony told newspaper welt am sonntag .
" we 're not going to automatically back christian wulff -lrb- the governing coalition 's candidate backed by chancellor merkel -rrb- . "
in an interview with deutsche welle on friday , gauck said the next president would have to restore people 's faith in politics .
" i do n't like this increasing divide between the political class and the average population , and many people in germany do n't like it either , " he said .
" we all have to work together to change this , to make sure that the people and the politicians come closer together . "
gauck also criticized a " mindset of worry " present in much of western europe .
" here , the presidential office can play a bigger role than others to banish fear and say to the people that they wo n't be victims of their own trepidation , but that they have a number of possibilities " he said .
" fear makes you short-sighted … and that 's why we need a broader effort to empower the people to find ways out of this crisis . "
not a mere politician the head of the social democrats , sigmar gabriel , praised gauck as someone " who comes with a full life to his candidacy , not just a political career . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gauck has the backing of the social democrats and the greens after reunification in 1990 , the 70-year-old gauck became the head of the stasi archives and led the organization that catalogues and analyzes documents from east germany 's secret police .
gauck , a protestant pastor from the former east , was a well-known civil rights activist before reunification .
he was a member of the new forum , a democratic opposition movement in east germany .
former german foreign minister and head of the social democrats in parliament , frank-walter steinmeier , said he is confident that gauck will gain broad support .
" i 'm sure he will not only be supported by the public , but that he will also motivate a few people in the federal convention to consider if their decision should be based on narrow-minded party political arguments . "
the social democrats as well as the greens criticized chancellor angela merkel 's government for choosing their candidate based on political aspects rather than suitability .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the support of the ruling coalition , wulff is likely to become the next german president government candidate germany 's governing coalition on thursday announced their candidate for president , the state premier of lower saxony , christian wulff .
chancellor angela merkel led the proposals for wulff as the successor to horst koehler , who resigned unexpectedly at the start of the week .
wulff has governed the state of lower saxony since 2003 and would be germany 's youngest-ever president .
he is a deputy leader of merkel 's christian democrat party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
in accepting the nomination , wulff said the office of president was " a great duty , with great responsibility . "
he added he " looked forward to the challenge " and would try to " bring optimism in difficult times . "
next stages the federal convention is scheduled to vote on the new president june 30 .
the assembly is made up of 1,244 state and federal lawmakers , and merkel 's coalition has a majority .
the role of the german president is largely ceremonial , although the president does sign off on legislation and is seen as a figurehead on national issues .

the meeting , which was designed to work out an agenda for the g20 summit in toronto , canada , at the end of the month , produced a communique that endorses the need for budgetary discipline and regulation of financial markets , but shies away from a global bank levy proposed by the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , european countries , including germany , and the us .
resistance to global bank levy canada and australia are among those opposed to such a levy , as they believe they should not have to pay to clear up a mess they did not create .

the meeting , which was designed to work out an agenda for the g20 summit in toronto , canada , at the end of the month , produced a communique that endorses the need for budgetary discipline and regulation of financial markets , but shies away from a global bank levy proposed by the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , european countries , including germany , and the us .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 05.06.2010 a world cup conversation with kasabian frontman tom meighan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kasabian launched the new england shirt in paris kasabian are in germany this weekend performing at rock am ring .
but the big-selling british band 's first love is n't music - it 's football .
dw talked to singer tom meighan about the world cup . the connection between football and music is not a random one .
both occupy similar neighborhoods in the sprawling metropolis of popular culture and share many of the same traits , making them more than just nodding acquaintances .
both instill a loyalty in their followers which borders on obsession , both have supporters bound by a gang mentality and both can play havoc with emotions .
they are so intimate at times that it can be difficult to separate them .
for musicians , tapping into terrace culture can help their music reach a much wider audience and few current rock acts have so successfully blended fan bases than british band kasabian .
when it comes to ticking the cross-over boxes , the leicestershire four-piece are streets ahead of many of their rivals : they 're dyed-in-the-wool leicester city fans -lrb- so no evidence of glory hunting there -rrb- , guitarist serge pizzorno once had schoolboy trials with nottingham forest and as a celebrity team they 've taken on the likes of oasis and won .
their credentials as britain 's premier soccer-rockers were further enhanced in february when the english football association chose them to launch the new england away shirt for the 2010 world cup in south africa .
england kit launch in paris " i was really honored , " singer tom meighan told deutsche welle .
" but i had a few reservations about where they wanted us to do it . "
the fa , in their infinite wisdom , had chosen the band 's gig at the olympia in paris for the launch of the red shirt , modeled on the design of the 1966 world cup winning jersey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kasabian 's soccer roots inspire a matchday atmosphere " they asked me to do it and i said okay but i told them , ' it 's all on you – if it backfires , if it all kicks-off then it 's on your head . '
i wanted to know that if there was a riot , they would get us out .
we got booed a bit , but then we played another song and everything was cool . "
kasabian 's links to football culture are not confined to the british isles and european audiences find it just as easy to slip into a stadium mentality at their shows , which made debuting the new england shirt in front of a partisan french crowd a risky proposition .
thankfully , apart from some heckling , the only other abuse the band and the fa got was from sections of the british press who questioned the intelligence of the whole stunt .
" it was a laugh , " meigan says .
" we did it , no-one died so what 's the problem ? "
when pressed on his football allegiances , meighan makes it very clear where they lie .
" i 'm leicester city first , then england , " he says proudly .
" we all are .
serge even wore leicester socks under his forest kit when he was a boy .
but when the world cup is on , it 's all about england for me . "
limiting expectations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capello may be " the man " but england still face a tough task the world cup .
as ever , the three lions depart for south africa with the huge weight of expectation following in their vapor trail .
it 's the same with every major tournament england qualify for – regardless of what history has taught them , that going out on penalties in the quarter-finals is the best most of us can hope for .
the majority of england fans just ca n't help getting carried away .
the singer , however , puts himself squarely in the realist camp when it comes to england 's chances in south africa .
" i really hope we 'll win it , i really do , but i do n't think we will .
-lrb- coach fabio -rrb- capello is the man , and he 's made a huge difference , but i just do n't think we 're good enough . "
spain are dangerous but watch the dutch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meighan rates torres and villa as the best strike force " a lot of people are tipping spain to win it and when you look at the players they 've got , it 's hard to see who 's going to be better , " he says .
" if torres and villa are on song , then there 's no better strike force .
they have xavi , iniesta , fabregas , alonso – the midfield is just unreal .
the way they took people apart at the euros ... who is there out of the non-europeans who can beat them ?
brazil ?
past it .
argentina ?
too mental . "
so is the kasabian front man putting his next album advance on spain lifting the world cup this year ?
nope .
" i 'm telling you , man , " he says conspiratorially .
" keep an eye on the dutch .
you talk about the spanish midfield but look at robben , sneijder , van bommel ...
then they 've got huntelaar , van persie , even that carthorse kuyt does wonders in an orange shirt .
mark my words ... the dutch . "
write germany off at your peril bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany can play badly and still make it to the final and what about england 's nemesis , germany ?
" you 'd be stupid to right them off even though their squad is lacking star power , " he says .
" but it never matters to the germans , does it ?
they could be crap for months and scrape through in qualifying but when it comes to the tournament , they 're always in the final .
i do n't rate them but they 'll probably go and win it now just to show me up . "
kasabian 's summer festival dance card is booked through the world cup but another happy event planned for june could mean an opportunity comes their way for some concentrated football watching .
" chris our bass player and his wife are having their baby right when the world cup starts so we 'll take a week off for that and settle in for some serious viewing .
but then we 'll have to go back on the tour after that so we 'll try and see as much as we can . "

" i ask myself why it was not possible in the conservative camp to agree with the spd on gauck , " he told der spiegel magazine .
" i personally have huge sympathies for joachim gauck , " holger zastrow , head of the market-friendly liberal fdp , the cdu 's government coalition partner , in the state of saxony told newspaper welt am sonntag .
" we 're not going to automatically back christian wulff -lrb- the governing coalition 's candidate backed by chancellor merkel -rrb- . "
in an interview with deutsche welle on friday , gauck said the next president would have to restore people 's faith in politics .
" i do n't like this increasing divide between the political class and the average population , and many people in germany do n't like it either , " he said .
" we all have to work together to change this , to make sure that the people and the politicians come closer together . "
gauck also criticized a " mindset of worry " present in much of western europe .
" here , the presidential office can play a bigger role than others to banish fear and say to the people that they wo n't be victims of their own trepidation , but that they have a number of possibilities " he said .
" fear makes you short-sighted … and that 's why we need a broader effort to empower the people to find ways out of this crisis . "
not a mere politician the head of the social democrats , sigmar gabriel , praised gauck as someone " who comes with a full life to his candidacy , not just a political career . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gauck has the backing of the social democrats and the greens after reunification in 1990 , the 70-year-old gauck became the head of the stasi archives and led the organization that catalogues and analyzes documents from east germany 's secret police .
gauck , a protestant pastor from the former east , was a well-known civil rights activist before reunification .
he was a member of the new forum , a democratic opposition movement in east germany .
former german foreign minister and head of the social democrats in parliament , frank-walter steinmeier , said he is confident that gauck will gain broad support .
" i 'm sure he will not only be supported by the public , but that he will also motivate a few people in the federal convention to consider if their decision should be based on narrow-minded party political arguments . "
the social democrats as well as the greens criticized chancellor angela merkel 's government for choosing their candidate based on political aspects rather than suitability .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the support of the ruling coalition , wulff is likely to become the next german president government candidate germany 's governing coalition on thursday announced their candidate for president , the state premier of lower saxony , christian wulff .
chancellor angela merkel led the proposals for wulff as the successor to horst koehler , who resigned unexpectedly at the start of the week .
wulff has governed the state of lower saxony since 2003 and would be germany 's youngest-ever president .
he is a deputy leader of merkel 's christian democrat party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
in accepting the nomination , wulff said the office of president was " a great duty , with great responsibility . "
he added he " looked forward to the challenge " and would try to " bring optimism in difficult times . "
next stages the federal convention is scheduled to vote on the new president june 30 .
the assembly is made up of 1,244 state and federal lawmakers , and merkel 's coalition has a majority .
the role of the german president is largely ceremonial , although the president does sign off on legislation and is seen as a figurehead on national issues .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : on the sidelines of the world cup entrepreneurs bring ' high-tech ' vuvuzelas to germany european companies offer up possible goal-line technologies football changes girls ' lives in rural kenya world cup reinforces middle eastern animosities soccer -pipe- 05.06.2010 south africa 's vuvuzela is a high-volume business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south africa 's vuvuzelas promise to be a blast no visit to a soccer stadium in south africa is complete without a vuvuzela .
the long , thin plastic horn is a popular fan article and could dominate audio coverage at the upcoming world cup games . the vuvuzela sounds a bit like a lovesick elephant or an angry bull - at least to european ears .
but for most south africans , it 's the unmistakable sound of soccer .
it 's simply part of the game , according to johannesburg soccer fan clinton currie .
" for me personally , i would say it represents our country , what we 're about , " currie told deutsche welle .
" we 're a noisy bunch of people basically , so that what it represents to me is something uniquely south african . "
passion turned business currie first started playing the vuvuzela 12 years ago .
what began as a bit of fun with a simple instrument gradually evolved into a passion – and a business plan .
the entrepreneur took the horn , which was previously available only in a single color , and branded it by adding a range of printed designs and colors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton currie plans to sell a million colorfully printed vuvuzelas the idea has taken off .
recent months have seen currie and his employees at the vuvuzela branding company rush to complete orders for one million printed horns .
most of them will bear the south african flag .
other designs include the flags of the united states , the netherlands and australia .
all of them are made of a robust plastic well suited for use in crowded stadiums .
others producers have also joined the fray .
today , there 's a wide range of horns on the market , from smaller models covered in sparkling stones to larger trumpets hand-painted by local artists .
and their prices cover the entire gamut .
according to theresa granger , who works at a souvenir shop on long street in cape town , regular vuvuzelas made from plastic cost about six euros , while fancier collectors ' versions decorated with pearls can fetch up to 100 .
granger said she has been selling about 20 horns a week over the past few months .
they 're particularly popular with tourists from brazil .
bildunterschrift : will foreign visitors be able to match the noise produced at south african club matches ?
no ban at games but will visiting soccer fans really be able to take their vuvuzelas into the stadium on game day ?
earlier this year , south african media reported organizers were under pressure to ban the instruments from world cup venues because they were too loud and could intimidate foreign teams .
fifa officials in johannesburg have since announced that vuvuzelas are part of south african football culture , and will indeed be permitted in stadiums .
granger is among the many south africans who welcome the move .
" you ca n't ban it because it is a south african thing " and the event happens to be taking place in the country , she said .
the exact origin of the vuvuzela is unknown .
one theory points to the long , thin trumpets made from kudu horns , once used by community leaders to call village gatherings .
later , the trumpets were manufactured from sheet metal - and then , in the 1990s , soccer fans decided to put them to a new use , and plastic models emerged .
" practice before game day " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : currie : ' we 're a noisy bunch of people basically ' it does n't matter if it 's the kaizer chiefs playing the orlando pirates , or the mamelodi sundown tackling ajax cape town - the sound of the vuvuzela can be heard at every soccer match across the country .
currie doubts , however , that this summer 's world cup games will be anywhere near as loud as normal south african league matches .
" the fans that are going to attend do n't know how to blow the vuvuzela , " he said .
that said , currie and many other south africans are confident that most visiting fans will have a good time with the instrument - as long as they practice a little before game day .

the long , thin plastic horn is a popular fan article and could dominate audio coverage at the upcoming world cup games . the vuvuzela sounds a bit like a lovesick elephant or an angry bull - at least to european ears .
but for most south africans , it 's the unmistakable sound of soccer .
it 's simply part of the game , according to johannesburg soccer fan clinton currie .
" for me personally , i would say it represents our country , what we 're about , " currie told deutsche welle .
" we 're a noisy bunch of people basically , so that what it represents to me is something uniquely south african . "
passion turned business currie first started playing the vuvuzela 12 years ago .
what began as a bit of fun with a simple instrument gradually evolved into a passion – and a business plan .
the entrepreneur took the horn , which was previously available only in a single color , and branded it by adding a range of printed designs and colors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton currie plans to sell a million colorfully printed vuvuzelas the idea has taken off .
recent months have seen currie and his employees at the vuvuzela branding company rush to complete orders for one million printed horns .
most of them will bear the south african flag .
other designs include the flags of the united states , the netherlands and australia .
all of them are made of a robust plastic well suited for use in crowded stadiums .
others producers have also joined the fray .
today , there 's a wide range of horns on the market , from smaller models covered in sparkling stones to larger trumpets hand-painted by local artists .
and their prices cover the entire gamut .
according to theresa granger , who works at a souvenir shop on long street in cape town , regular vuvuzelas made from plastic cost about six euros , while fancier collectors ' versions decorated with pearls can fetch up to 100 .
granger said she has been selling about 20 horns a week over the past few months .
they 're particularly popular with tourists from brazil .
bildunterschrift : will foreign visitors be able to match the noise produced at south african club matches ?
no ban at games but will visiting soccer fans really be able to take their vuvuzelas into the stadium on game day ?
earlier this year , south african media reported organizers were under pressure to ban the instruments from world cup venues because they were too loud and could intimidate foreign teams .
fifa officials in johannesburg have since announced that vuvuzelas are part of south african football culture , and will indeed be permitted in stadiums .
granger is among the many south africans who welcome the move .
" you ca n't ban it because it is a south african thing " and the event happens to be taking place in the country , she said .
the exact origin of the vuvuzela is unknown .
one theory points to the long , thin trumpets made from kudu horns , once used by community leaders to call village gatherings .
later , the trumpets were manufactured from sheet metal - and then , in the 1990s , soccer fans decided to put them to a new use , and plastic models emerged .
" practice before game day " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : currie : ' we 're a noisy bunch of people basically ' it does n't matter if it 's the kaizer chiefs playing the orlando pirates , or the mamelodi sundown tackling ajax cape town - the sound of the vuvuzela can be heard at every soccer match across the country .
currie doubts , however , that this summer 's world cup games will be anywhere near as loud as normal south african league matches .
" the fans that are going to attend do n't know how to blow the vuvuzela , " he said .
that said , currie and many other south africans are confident that most visiting fans will have a good time with the instrument - as long as they practice a little before game day .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 05.06.2010 public broadcasting in germany marks 60 years of independent reporting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aim was to make radio and television independent of government influence germany 's first public service broadcaster is celebrating its sixtieth birthday .
we look back at how the radio and tv corporation was born in post-war germany . just like the nation itself , public service broadcasters in the federal republic of germany grew up as separate insitutions in the various federal states .
sixty years ago this week , on 5th june 1950 , representatives of the individual regional radio stations came together to create the allgemeine rundfunkanstalt deutschlands -lrb- general german broadcasting corporation -rrb- .
the ard became the first nationwide public service broadcasting corporation .
the aim : to provide a platform for serious , independent , objective reporting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regional broadcasters form the core element of the overall system in germany " it is our deep conviction that radio stations should no longer be a mouth-piece of the respective government , " said the american controlling officer at the time , edmund schaechter .
" stations should represent every level of society and give all political groups and parties the opportunity to voice their opinion . "
the allies ' restructuring of german broadcasters german public sevice broadcasting was shaped by the post-war landscape .
in the aftermath of the second world war one of the immediate priorities for the allies was to break up the existing nazi structures .
radio was targeted in particular , because it had been abused as a propaganda tool during the third reich .
the allies were keen to re-establish radio as independent from the state , to act as a critical voice and to try to prevent extremism ever taking hold again .
in west germany , public service broadcasting was established on french , british and american models , notably the bbc .
the resulting ard united the various regional broadcasters , and for years , television viewers could only watch regional programmes , and one national programme .
only much later was competion established in the form of a second public broadcaster -lrb- in 1963 -rrb- and commercial broadcasting -lrb- in 1984 -rrb- .
in east germany , on the other side of the iron curtain , a separate system developed , along soviet lines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tagesschau has long established itself as germany 's main news show the western allies wanted the german public broadcaster to represent the whole of society , and reflect a range of views and political opinions .
independence from the state and political objectivity remain the hallmark of public service broadcasting in germany today .
however , politicians and parties have been accused over the decades of using public service broadcasters for their own means .
there is controversy over party political broadcasts which are aired in the run up to elections .
they are said to be propaganda for the parties .
but ard justifies this saying they are not responsible for the content .
furthermore , politicians sitting on the broadcasting council , have considerable influence over the choice for who runs the public service broadcaster .
it is not uncommon , therefore , that the top spot goes to someone who belongs to the most influential party at the time .
the federal structure of public service broadcasting in germany is seen as one of its key strengths , and has remained in place since its foundation .
the individual regional broadcasters are still responsible for their programmes .
they are largely protected from the long arm of the state by a guaranteed funding sytem .
a huge operation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular tv series such as tatort continue to top the ratings lists ard , the first german public service broadcaster , started out as a small institution .
the 9 regional stations now employ around 20,000 staff members , and many more freelancers .
they produce 11 television channels , 55 radio stations and have 16 orchestras and choirs under their belt .
the total budget for the public service broadcasters is around 6.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.7 billion -rrb- a year .
ard has a network of correspondents in 30 countries , as well as studios across germany .
in its 60 year history , ard has managed to establish itself as part of day-to-day life in germany .
the daily news show the ' tagesschau ' which airs every night at 8pm , has become an institution for millions of german families .
even the commercial television stations , which were founded in the 1980s and have since posed big competition for public broadcasters , can not touch it .
it still has around 10 million viewers a day .
other famous shows like the popular crime series , ' tatort ' , live sports broadcasts and family-orientated shows on saturday evenings mean that the first german broadcaster has maintained relatively high audience figures , although commercial broadcasters pose stiff competition .

the long , thin plastic horn is a popular fan article and could dominate audio coverage at the upcoming world cup games . the vuvuzela sounds a bit like a lovesick elephant or an angry bull - at least to european ears .
but for most south africans , it 's the unmistakable sound of soccer .
it 's simply part of the game , according to johannesburg soccer fan clinton currie .
" for me personally , i would say it represents our country , what we 're about , " currie told deutsche welle .
" we 're a noisy bunch of people basically , so that what it represents to me is something uniquely south african . "
passion turned business currie first started playing the vuvuzela 12 years ago .
what began as a bit of fun with a simple instrument gradually evolved into a passion – and a business plan .
the entrepreneur took the horn , which was previously available only in a single color , and branded it by adding a range of printed designs and colors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton currie plans to sell a million colorfully printed vuvuzelas the idea has taken off .
recent months have seen currie and his employees at the vuvuzela branding company rush to complete orders for one million printed horns .
most of them will bear the south african flag .
other designs include the flags of the united states , the netherlands and australia .
all of them are made of a robust plastic well suited for use in crowded stadiums .
others producers have also joined the fray .
today , there 's a wide range of horns on the market , from smaller models covered in sparkling stones to larger trumpets hand-painted by local artists .
and their prices cover the entire gamut .
according to theresa granger , who works at a souvenir shop on long street in cape town , regular vuvuzelas made from plastic cost about six euros , while fancier collectors ' versions decorated with pearls can fetch up to 100 .
granger said she has been selling about 20 horns a week over the past few months .
they 're particularly popular with tourists from brazil .
bildunterschrift : will foreign visitors be able to match the noise produced at south african club matches ?
no ban at games but will visiting soccer fans really be able to take their vuvuzelas into the stadium on game day ?
earlier this year , south african media reported organizers were under pressure to ban the instruments from world cup venues because they were too loud and could intimidate foreign teams .
fifa officials in johannesburg have since announced that vuvuzelas are part of south african football culture , and will indeed be permitted in stadiums .
granger is among the many south africans who welcome the move .
" you ca n't ban it because it is a south african thing " and the event happens to be taking place in the country , she said .
the exact origin of the vuvuzela is unknown .
one theory points to the long , thin trumpets made from kudu horns , once used by community leaders to call village gatherings .
later , the trumpets were manufactured from sheet metal - and then , in the 1990s , soccer fans decided to put them to a new use , and plastic models emerged .
" practice before game day " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : currie : ' we 're a noisy bunch of people basically ' it does n't matter if it 's the kaizer chiefs playing the orlando pirates , or the mamelodi sundown tackling ajax cape town - the sound of the vuvuzela can be heard at every soccer match across the country .
currie doubts , however , that this summer 's world cup games will be anywhere near as loud as normal south african league matches .
" the fans that are going to attend do n't know how to blow the vuvuzela , " he said .
that said , currie and many other south africans are confident that most visiting fans will have a good time with the instrument - as long as they practice a little before game day .

we look back at how the radio and tv corporation was born in post-war germany . just like the nation itself , public service broadcasters in the federal republic of germany grew up as separate insitutions in the various federal states .
sixty years ago this week , on 5th june 1950 , representatives of the individual regional radio stations came together to create the allgemeine rundfunkanstalt deutschlands -lrb- general german broadcasting corporation -rrb- .
the ard became the first nationwide public service broadcasting corporation .
the aim : to provide a platform for serious , independent , objective reporting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regional broadcasters form the core element of the overall system in germany " it is our deep conviction that radio stations should no longer be a mouth-piece of the respective government , " said the american controlling officer at the time , edmund schaechter .
" stations should represent every level of society and give all political groups and parties the opportunity to voice their opinion . "
the allies ' restructuring of german broadcasters german public sevice broadcasting was shaped by the post-war landscape .
in the aftermath of the second world war one of the immediate priorities for the allies was to break up the existing nazi structures .
radio was targeted in particular , because it had been abused as a propaganda tool during the third reich .
the allies were keen to re-establish radio as independent from the state , to act as a critical voice and to try to prevent extremism ever taking hold again .
in west germany , public service broadcasting was established on french , british and american models , notably the bbc .
the resulting ard united the various regional broadcasters , and for years , television viewers could only watch regional programmes , and one national programme .
only much later was competion established in the form of a second public broadcaster -lrb- in 1963 -rrb- and commercial broadcasting -lrb- in 1984 -rrb- .
in east germany , on the other side of the iron curtain , a separate system developed , along soviet lines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tagesschau has long established itself as germany 's main news show the western allies wanted the german public broadcaster to represent the whole of society , and reflect a range of views and political opinions .
independence from the state and political objectivity remain the hallmark of public service broadcasting in germany today .
however , politicians and parties have been accused over the decades of using public service broadcasters for their own means .
there is controversy over party political broadcasts which are aired in the run up to elections .
they are said to be propaganda for the parties .
but ard justifies this saying they are not responsible for the content .
furthermore , politicians sitting on the broadcasting council , have considerable influence over the choice for who runs the public service broadcaster .
it is not uncommon , therefore , that the top spot goes to someone who belongs to the most influential party at the time .
the federal structure of public service broadcasting in germany is seen as one of its key strengths , and has remained in place since its foundation .
the individual regional broadcasters are still responsible for their programmes .
they are largely protected from the long arm of the state by a guaranteed funding sytem .
a huge operation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular tv series such as tatort continue to top the ratings lists ard , the first german public service broadcaster , started out as a small institution .
the 9 regional stations now employ around 20,000 staff members , and many more freelancers .
they produce 11 television channels , 55 radio stations and have 16 orchestras and choirs under their belt .
the total budget for the public service broadcasters is around 6.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.7 billion -rrb- a year .
ard has a network of correspondents in 30 countries , as well as studios across germany .
in its 60 year history , ard has managed to establish itself as part of day-to-day life in germany .
the daily news show the ' tagesschau ' which airs every night at 8pm , has become an institution for millions of german families .
even the commercial television stations , which were founded in the 1980s and have since posed big competition for public broadcasters , can not touch it .
it still has around 10 million viewers a day .
other famous shows like the popular crime series , ' tatort ' , live sports broadcasts and family-orientated shows on saturday evenings mean that the first german broadcaster has maintained relatively high audience figures , although commercial broadcasters pose stiff competition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : on the sidelines of the world cup entrepreneurs bring ' high-tech ' vuvuzelas to germany european companies offer up possible goal-line technologies football changes girls ' lives in rural kenya world cup reinforces middle eastern animosities soccer -pipe- 05.06.2010 south africa 's vuvuzela is a high-volume business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south africa 's vuvuzelas promise to be a blast no visit to a soccer stadium in south africa is complete without a vuvuzela .
the long , thin plastic horn is a popular fan article and could dominate audio coverage at the upcoming world cup games . the vuvuzela sounds a bit like a lovesick elephant or an angry bull - at least to european ears .
but for most south africans , it 's the unmistakable sound of soccer .
it 's simply part of the game , according to johannesburg soccer fan clinton currie .
" for me personally , i would say it represents our country , what we 're about , " currie told deutsche welle .
" we 're a noisy bunch of people basically , so that what it represents to me is something uniquely south african . "
passion turned business currie first started playing the vuvuzela 12 years ago .
what began as a bit of fun with a simple instrument gradually evolved into a passion – and a business plan .
the entrepreneur took the horn , which was previously available only in a single color , and branded it by adding a range of printed designs and colors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton currie plans to sell a million colorfully printed vuvuzelas the idea has taken off .
recent months have seen currie and his employees at the vuvuzela branding company rush to complete orders for one million printed horns .
most of them will bear the south african flag .
other designs include the flags of the united states , the netherlands and australia .
all of them are made of a robust plastic well suited for use in crowded stadiums .
others producers have also joined the fray .
today , there 's a wide range of horns on the market , from smaller models covered in sparkling stones to larger trumpets hand-painted by local artists .
and their prices cover the entire gamut .
according to theresa granger , who works at a souvenir shop on long street in cape town , regular vuvuzelas made from plastic cost about six euros , while fancier collectors ' versions decorated with pearls can fetch up to 100 .
granger said she has been selling about 20 horns a week over the past few months .
they 're particularly popular with tourists from brazil .
bildunterschrift : will foreign visitors be able to match the noise produced at south african club matches ?
no ban at games but will visiting soccer fans really be able to take their vuvuzelas into the stadium on game day ?
earlier this year , south african media reported organizers were under pressure to ban the instruments from world cup venues because they were too loud and could intimidate foreign teams .
fifa officials in johannesburg have since announced that vuvuzelas are part of south african football culture , and will indeed be permitted in stadiums .
granger is among the many south africans who welcome the move .
" you ca n't ban it because it is a south african thing " and the event happens to be taking place in the country , she said .
the exact origin of the vuvuzela is unknown .
one theory points to the long , thin trumpets made from kudu horns , once used by community leaders to call village gatherings .
later , the trumpets were manufactured from sheet metal - and then , in the 1990s , soccer fans decided to put them to a new use , and plastic models emerged .
" practice before game day " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : currie : ' we 're a noisy bunch of people basically ' it does n't matter if it 's the kaizer chiefs playing the orlando pirates , or the mamelodi sundown tackling ajax cape town - the sound of the vuvuzela can be heard at every soccer match across the country .
currie doubts , however , that this summer 's world cup games will be anywhere near as loud as normal south african league matches .
" the fans that are going to attend do n't know how to blow the vuvuzela , " he said .
that said , currie and many other south africans are confident that most visiting fans will have a good time with the instrument - as long as they practice a little before game day .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 05.06.2010 a world cup conversation with kasabian frontman tom meighan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kasabian launched the new england shirt in paris kasabian are in germany this weekend performing at rock am ring .
but the big-selling british band 's first love is n't music - it 's football .
dw talked to singer tom meighan about the world cup . the connection between football and music is not a random one .
both occupy similar neighborhoods in the sprawling metropolis of popular culture and share many of the same traits , making them more than just nodding acquaintances .
both instill a loyalty in their followers which borders on obsession , both have supporters bound by a gang mentality and both can play havoc with emotions .
they are so intimate at times that it can be difficult to separate them .
for musicians , tapping into terrace culture can help their music reach a much wider audience and few current rock acts have so successfully blended fan bases than british band kasabian .
when it comes to ticking the cross-over boxes , the leicestershire four-piece are streets ahead of many of their rivals : they 're dyed-in-the-wool leicester city fans -lrb- so no evidence of glory hunting there -rrb- , guitarist serge pizzorno once had schoolboy trials with nottingham forest and as a celebrity team they 've taken on the likes of oasis and won .
their credentials as britain 's premier soccer-rockers were further enhanced in february when the english football association chose them to launch the new england away shirt for the 2010 world cup in south africa .
england kit launch in paris " i was really honored , " singer tom meighan told deutsche welle .
" but i had a few reservations about where they wanted us to do it . "
the fa , in their infinite wisdom , had chosen the band 's gig at the olympia in paris for the launch of the red shirt , modeled on the design of the 1966 world cup winning jersey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kasabian 's soccer roots inspire a matchday atmosphere " they asked me to do it and i said okay but i told them , ' it 's all on you – if it backfires , if it all kicks-off then it 's on your head . '
i wanted to know that if there was a riot , they would get us out .
we got booed a bit , but then we played another song and everything was cool . "
kasabian 's links to football culture are not confined to the british isles and european audiences find it just as easy to slip into a stadium mentality at their shows , which made debuting the new england shirt in front of a partisan french crowd a risky proposition .
thankfully , apart from some heckling , the only other abuse the band and the fa got was from sections of the british press who questioned the intelligence of the whole stunt .
" it was a laugh , " meigan says .
" we did it , no-one died so what 's the problem ? "
when pressed on his football allegiances , meighan makes it very clear where they lie .
" i 'm leicester city first , then england , " he says proudly .
" we all are .
serge even wore leicester socks under his forest kit when he was a boy .
but when the world cup is on , it 's all about england for me . "
limiting expectations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capello may be " the man " but england still face a tough task the world cup .
as ever , the three lions depart for south africa with the huge weight of expectation following in their vapor trail .
it 's the same with every major tournament england qualify for – regardless of what history has taught them , that going out on penalties in the quarter-finals is the best most of us can hope for .
the majority of england fans just ca n't help getting carried away .
the singer , however , puts himself squarely in the realist camp when it comes to england 's chances in south africa .
" i really hope we 'll win it , i really do , but i do n't think we will .
-lrb- coach fabio -rrb- capello is the man , and he 's made a huge difference , but i just do n't think we 're good enough . "
spain are dangerous but watch the dutch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meighan rates torres and villa as the best strike force " a lot of people are tipping spain to win it and when you look at the players they 've got , it 's hard to see who 's going to be better , " he says .
" if torres and villa are on song , then there 's no better strike force .
they have xavi , iniesta , fabregas , alonso – the midfield is just unreal .
the way they took people apart at the euros ... who is there out of the non-europeans who can beat them ?
brazil ?
past it .
argentina ?
too mental . "
so is the kasabian front man putting his next album advance on spain lifting the world cup this year ?
nope .
" i 'm telling you , man , " he says conspiratorially .
" keep an eye on the dutch .
you talk about the spanish midfield but look at robben , sneijder , van bommel ...
then they 've got huntelaar , van persie , even that carthorse kuyt does wonders in an orange shirt .
mark my words ... the dutch . "
write germany off at your peril bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany can play badly and still make it to the final and what about england 's nemesis , germany ?
" you 'd be stupid to right them off even though their squad is lacking star power , " he says .
" but it never matters to the germans , does it ?
they could be crap for months and scrape through in qualifying but when it comes to the tournament , they 're always in the final .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 05.06.2010 a world cup conversation with kasabian frontman tom meighan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kasabian launched the new england shirt in paris kasabian are in germany this weekend performing at rock am ring .
but the big-selling british band 's first love is n't music - it 's football .
dw talked to singer tom meighan about the world cup . the connection between football and music is not a random one .
both occupy similar neighborhoods in the sprawling metropolis of popular culture and share many of the same traits , making them more than just nodding acquaintances .
both instill a loyalty in their followers which borders on obsession , both have supporters bound by a gang mentality and both can play havoc with emotions .
they are so intimate at times that it can be difficult to separate them .
for musicians , tapping into terrace culture can help their music reach a much wider audience and few current rock acts have so successfully blended fan bases than british band kasabian .
when it comes to ticking the cross-over boxes , the leicestershire four-piece are streets ahead of many of their rivals : they 're dyed-in-the-wool leicester city fans -lrb- so no evidence of glory hunting there -rrb- , guitarist serge pizzorno once had schoolboy trials with nottingham forest and as a celebrity team they 've taken on the likes of oasis and won .
their credentials as britain 's premier soccer-rockers were further enhanced in february when the english football association chose them to launch the new england away shirt for the 2010 world cup in south africa .
england kit launch in paris " i was really honored , " singer tom meighan told deutsche welle .
" but i had a few reservations about where they wanted us to do it . "
the fa , in their infinite wisdom , had chosen the band 's gig at the olympia in paris for the launch of the red shirt , modeled on the design of the 1966 world cup winning jersey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kasabian 's soccer roots inspire a matchday atmosphere " they asked me to do it and i said okay but i told them , ' it 's all on you – if it backfires , if it all kicks-off then it 's on your head . '
i wanted to know that if there was a riot , they would get us out .
we got booed a bit , but then we played another song and everything was cool . "
kasabian 's links to football culture are not confined to the british isles and european audiences find it just as easy to slip into a stadium mentality at their shows , which made debuting the new england shirt in front of a partisan french crowd a risky proposition .
thankfully , apart from some heckling , the only other abuse the band and the fa got was from sections of the british press who questioned the intelligence of the whole stunt .
" it was a laugh , " meigan says .
" we did it , no-one died so what 's the problem ? "
when pressed on his football allegiances , meighan makes it very clear where they lie .
" i 'm leicester city first , then england , " he says proudly .
" we all are .
serge even wore leicester socks under his forest kit when he was a boy .
but when the world cup is on , it 's all about england for me . "
limiting expectations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capello may be " the man " but england still face a tough task the world cup .
as ever , the three lions depart for south africa with the huge weight of expectation following in their vapor trail .
it 's the same with every major tournament england qualify for – regardless of what history has taught them , that going out on penalties in the quarter-finals is the best most of us can hope for .
the majority of england fans just ca n't help getting carried away .
the singer , however , puts himself squarely in the realist camp when it comes to england 's chances in south africa .
" i really hope we 'll win it , i really do , but i do n't think we will .
-lrb- coach fabio -rrb- capello is the man , and he 's made a huge difference , but i just do n't think we 're good enough . "
spain are dangerous but watch the dutch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meighan rates torres and villa as the best strike force " a lot of people are tipping spain to win it and when you look at the players they 've got , it 's hard to see who 's going to be better , " he says .
" if torres and villa are on song , then there 's no better strike force .
they have xavi , iniesta , fabregas , alonso – the midfield is just unreal .
the way they took people apart at the euros ... who is there out of the non-europeans who can beat them ?
brazil ?
past it .
argentina ?
too mental . "
so is the kasabian front man putting his next album advance on spain lifting the world cup this year ?
nope .
" i 'm telling you , man , " he says conspiratorially .
" keep an eye on the dutch .
you talk about the spanish midfield but look at robben , sneijder , van bommel ...
then they 've got huntelaar , van persie , even that carthorse kuyt does wonders in an orange shirt .
mark my words ... the dutch . "
write germany off at your peril bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany can play badly and still make it to the final and what about england 's nemesis , germany ?
" you 'd be stupid to right them off even though their squad is lacking star power , " he says .
" but it never matters to the germans , does it ?
they could be crap for months and scrape through in qualifying but when it comes to the tournament , they 're always in the final .
i do n't rate them but they 'll probably go and win it now just to show me up . "
kasabian 's summer festival dance card is booked through the world cup but another happy event planned for june could mean an opportunity comes their way for some concentrated football watching .
" chris our bass player and his wife are having their baby right when the world cup starts so we 'll take a week off for that and settle in for some serious viewing .

the meeting , which was designed to work out an agenda for the g20 summit in toronto , canada , at the end of the month , produced a communique that endorses the need for budgetary discipline and regulation of financial markets , but shies away from a global bank levy proposed by the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , european countries , including germany , and the us .
resistance to global bank levy canada and australia are among those opposed to such a levy , as they believe they should not have to pay to clear up a mess they did not create .
canada 's finance minister jim flaherty told reporters that the debate on the bank levy had been " a distraction from core issues " and that most ministers " do not support the concept of a universal levy . "
german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , however , insisted that regulating the banking industry must remain a global priority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble has defended germany 's tough stance on fiscal restraint " i pointed out that we will need to make a decision in toronto , " he told the reuters news agency .
" there 's a lot of pressure to even go beyond a levy and impose a tax on banks , " he added .
balancing budgets and stimulating growth the g20 communique calls on member states to get their finances in order to reduce billowing budget deficits , while stimulating growth at the same time .
the imf and the united states in particular , have repeatedly called on low-growth economies like germany to boost domestic demand .
germany is europe 's top exporter , but consumer spending is traditionally lackluster , thus creating an imbalance in the country 's trade balance .
but schaeuble again dismissed the criticism , insisting that " we have to look at europe , or at least the eurozone , as a whole , " he told reuters , meaning that the trade balance of the entire eurozone shows no imbalances with other parts of the world .

" we 're not going to automatically back christian wulff -lrb- the governing coalition 's candidate backed by chancellor merkel -rrb- . "
in an interview with deutsche welle on friday , gauck said the next president would have to restore people 's faith in politics .
" i do n't like this increasing divide between the political class and the average population , and many people in germany do n't like it either , " he said .
" we all have to work together to change this , to make sure that the people and the politicians come closer together . "
gauck also criticized a " mindset of worry " present in much of western europe .
" here , the presidential office can play a bigger role than others to banish fear and say to the people that they wo n't be victims of their own trepidation , but that they have a number of possibilities " he said .
" fear makes you short-sighted … and that 's why we need a broader effort to empower the people to find ways out of this crisis . "
not a mere politician the head of the social democrats , sigmar gabriel , praised gauck as someone " who comes with a full life to his candidacy , not just a political career . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gauck has the backing of the social democrats and the greens after reunification in 1990 , the 70-year-old gauck became the head of the stasi archives and led the organization that catalogues and analyzes documents from east germany 's secret police .
gauck , a protestant pastor from the former east , was a well-known civil rights activist before reunification .
he was a member of the new forum , a democratic opposition movement in east germany .
former german foreign minister and head of the social democrats in parliament , frank-walter steinmeier , said he is confident that gauck will gain broad support .
" i 'm sure he will not only be supported by the public , but that he will also motivate a few people in the federal convention to consider if their decision should be based on narrow-minded party political arguments . "
the social democrats as well as the greens criticized chancellor angela merkel 's government for choosing their candidate based on political aspects rather than suitability .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the support of the ruling coalition , wulff is likely to become the next german president government candidate germany 's governing coalition on thursday announced their candidate for president , the state premier of lower saxony , christian wulff .
chancellor angela merkel led the proposals for wulff as the successor to horst koehler , who resigned unexpectedly at the start of the week .
wulff has governed the state of lower saxony since 2003 and would be germany 's youngest-ever president .
he is a deputy leader of merkel 's christian democrat party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
in accepting the nomination , wulff said the office of president was " a great duty , with great responsibility . "
he added he " looked forward to the challenge " and would try to " bring optimism in difficult times . "
next stages the federal convention is scheduled to vote on the new president june 30 .
the assembly is made up of 1,244 state and federal lawmakers , and merkel 's coalition has a majority .
the role of the german president is largely ceremonial , although the president does sign off on legislation and is seen as a figurehead on national issues .

the meeting , which was designed to work out an agenda for the g20 summit in toronto , canada , at the end of the month , produced a communique that endorses the need for budgetary discipline and regulation of financial markets , but shies away from a global bank levy proposed by the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , european countries , including germany , and the us .
resistance to global bank levy canada and australia are among those opposed to such a levy , as they believe they should not have to pay to clear up a mess they did not create .

but the big-selling british band 's first love is n't music - it 's football .
dw talked to singer tom meighan about the world cup . the connection between football and music is not a random one .
both occupy similar neighborhoods in the sprawling metropolis of popular culture and share many of the same traits , making them more than just nodding acquaintances .
both instill a loyalty in their followers which borders on obsession , both have supporters bound by a gang mentality and both can play havoc with emotions .
they are so intimate at times that it can be difficult to separate them .
for musicians , tapping into terrace culture can help their music reach a much wider audience and few current rock acts have so successfully blended fan bases than british band kasabian .
when it comes to ticking the cross-over boxes , the leicestershire four-piece are streets ahead of many of their rivals : they 're dyed-in-the-wool leicester city fans -lrb- so no evidence of glory hunting there -rrb- , guitarist serge pizzorno once had schoolboy trials with nottingham forest and as a celebrity team they 've taken on the likes of oasis and won .
their credentials as britain 's premier soccer-rockers were further enhanced in february when the english football association chose them to launch the new england away shirt for the 2010 world cup in south africa .
england kit launch in paris " i was really honored , " singer tom meighan told deutsche welle .
" but i had a few reservations about where they wanted us to do it . "
the fa , in their infinite wisdom , had chosen the band 's gig at the olympia in paris for the launch of the red shirt , modeled on the design of the 1966 world cup winning jersey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kasabian 's soccer roots inspire a matchday atmosphere " they asked me to do it and i said okay but i told them , ' it 's all on you – if it backfires , if it all kicks-off then it 's on your head . '
i wanted to know that if there was a riot , they would get us out .
we got booed a bit , but then we played another song and everything was cool . "
kasabian 's links to football culture are not confined to the british isles and european audiences find it just as easy to slip into a stadium mentality at their shows , which made debuting the new england shirt in front of a partisan french crowd a risky proposition .
thankfully , apart from some heckling , the only other abuse the band and the fa got was from sections of the british press who questioned the intelligence of the whole stunt .
" it was a laugh , " meigan says .
" we did it , no-one died so what 's the problem ? "
when pressed on his football allegiances , meighan makes it very clear where they lie .
" i 'm leicester city first , then england , " he says proudly .
" we all are .
serge even wore leicester socks under his forest kit when he was a boy .
but when the world cup is on , it 's all about england for me . "
limiting expectations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capello may be " the man " but england still face a tough task the world cup .
as ever , the three lions depart for south africa with the huge weight of expectation following in their vapor trail .
it 's the same with every major tournament england qualify for – regardless of what history has taught them , that going out on penalties in the quarter-finals is the best most of us can hope for .
the majority of england fans just ca n't help getting carried away .
the singer , however , puts himself squarely in the realist camp when it comes to england 's chances in south africa .
" i really hope we 'll win it , i really do , but i do n't think we will .
-lrb- coach fabio -rrb- capello is the man , and he 's made a huge difference , but i just do n't think we 're good enough . "
spain are dangerous but watch the dutch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meighan rates torres and villa as the best strike force " a lot of people are tipping spain to win it and when you look at the players they 've got , it 's hard to see who 's going to be better , " he says .
" if torres and villa are on song , then there 's no better strike force .
they have xavi , iniesta , fabregas , alonso – the midfield is just unreal .
the way they took people apart at the euros ... who is there out of the non-europeans who can beat them ?
brazil ?
past it .
argentina ?
too mental . "
so is the kasabian front man putting his next album advance on spain lifting the world cup this year ?
nope .
" i 'm telling you , man , " he says conspiratorially .
" keep an eye on the dutch .
you talk about the spanish midfield but look at robben , sneijder , van bommel ...
then they 've got huntelaar , van persie , even that carthorse kuyt does wonders in an orange shirt .
mark my words ... the dutch . "

we look back at how the radio and tv corporation was born in post-war germany . just like the nation itself , public service broadcasters in the federal republic of germany grew up as separate insitutions in the various federal states .
sixty years ago this week , on 5th june 1950 , representatives of the individual regional radio stations came together to create the allgemeine rundfunkanstalt deutschlands -lrb- general german broadcasting corporation -rrb- .
the ard became the first nationwide public service broadcasting corporation .
the aim : to provide a platform for serious , independent , objective reporting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regional broadcasters form the core element of the overall system in germany " it is our deep conviction that radio stations should no longer be a mouth-piece of the respective government , " said the american controlling officer at the time , edmund schaechter .
" stations should represent every level of society and give all political groups and parties the opportunity to voice their opinion . "
the allies ' restructuring of german broadcasters german public sevice broadcasting was shaped by the post-war landscape .
in the aftermath of the second world war one of the immediate priorities for the allies was to break up the existing nazi structures .
radio was targeted in particular , because it had been abused as a propaganda tool during the third reich .
the allies were keen to re-establish radio as independent from the state , to act as a critical voice and to try to prevent extremism ever taking hold again .
in west germany , public service broadcasting was established on french , british and american models , notably the bbc .
the resulting ard united the various regional broadcasters , and for years , television viewers could only watch regional programmes , and one national programme .
only much later was competion established in the form of a second public broadcaster -lrb- in 1963 -rrb- and commercial broadcasting -lrb- in 1984 -rrb- .
in east germany , on the other side of the iron curtain , a separate system developed , along soviet lines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tagesschau has long established itself as germany 's main news show the western allies wanted the german public broadcaster to represent the whole of society , and reflect a range of views and political opinions .
independence from the state and political objectivity remain the hallmark of public service broadcasting in germany today .
however , politicians and parties have been accused over the decades of using public service broadcasters for their own means .
there is controversy over party political broadcasts which are aired in the run up to elections .
they are said to be propaganda for the parties .
but ard justifies this saying they are not responsible for the content .
furthermore , politicians sitting on the broadcasting council , have considerable influence over the choice for who runs the public service broadcaster .
it is not uncommon , therefore , that the top spot goes to someone who belongs to the most influential party at the time .
the federal structure of public service broadcasting in germany is seen as one of its key strengths , and has remained in place since its foundation .
the individual regional broadcasters are still responsible for their programmes .
they are largely protected from the long arm of the state by a guaranteed funding sytem .
a huge operation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular tv series such as tatort continue to top the ratings lists ard , the first german public service broadcaster , started out as a small institution .
the 9 regional stations now employ around 20,000 staff members , and many more freelancers .
they produce 11 television channels , 55 radio stations and have 16 orchestras and choirs under their belt .
the total budget for the public service broadcasters is around 6.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.7 billion -rrb- a year .
ard has a network of correspondents in 30 countries , as well as studios across germany .
in its 60 year history , ard has managed to establish itself as part of day-to-day life in germany .
the daily news show the ' tagesschau ' which airs every night at 8pm , has become an institution for millions of german families .
even the commercial television stations , which were founded in the 1980s and have since posed big competition for public broadcasters , can not touch it .
it still has around 10 million viewers a day .
other famous shows like the popular crime series , ' tatort ' , live sports broadcasts and family-orientated shows on saturday evenings mean that the first german broadcaster has maintained relatively high audience figures , although commercial broadcasters pose stiff competition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 05.06.2010 a world cup conversation with kasabian frontman tom meighan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kasabian launched the new england shirt in paris kasabian are in germany this weekend performing at rock am ring .
but the big-selling british band 's first love is n't music - it 's football .
dw talked to singer tom meighan about the world cup . the connection between football and music is not a random one .
both occupy similar neighborhoods in the sprawling metropolis of popular culture and share many of the same traits , making them more than just nodding acquaintances .
both instill a loyalty in their followers which borders on obsession , both have supporters bound by a gang mentality and both can play havoc with emotions .
they are so intimate at times that it can be difficult to separate them .
for musicians , tapping into terrace culture can help their music reach a much wider audience and few current rock acts have so successfully blended fan bases than british band kasabian .
when it comes to ticking the cross-over boxes , the leicestershire four-piece are streets ahead of many of their rivals : they 're dyed-in-the-wool leicester city fans -lrb- so no evidence of glory hunting there -rrb- , guitarist serge pizzorno once had schoolboy trials with nottingham forest and as a celebrity team they 've taken on the likes of oasis and won .
their credentials as britain 's premier soccer-rockers were further enhanced in february when the english football association chose them to launch the new england away shirt for the 2010 world cup in south africa .
england kit launch in paris " i was really honored , " singer tom meighan told deutsche welle .
" but i had a few reservations about where they wanted us to do it . "
the fa , in their infinite wisdom , had chosen the band 's gig at the olympia in paris for the launch of the red shirt , modeled on the design of the 1966 world cup winning jersey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kasabian 's soccer roots inspire a matchday atmosphere " they asked me to do it and i said okay but i told them , ' it 's all on you – if it backfires , if it all kicks-off then it 's on your head . '
i wanted to know that if there was a riot , they would get us out .
we got booed a bit , but then we played another song and everything was cool . "
kasabian 's links to football culture are not confined to the british isles and european audiences find it just as easy to slip into a stadium mentality at their shows , which made debuting the new england shirt in front of a partisan french crowd a risky proposition .
thankfully , apart from some heckling , the only other abuse the band and the fa got was from sections of the british press who questioned the intelligence of the whole stunt .
" it was a laugh , " meigan says .
" we did it , no-one died so what 's the problem ? "
when pressed on his football allegiances , meighan makes it very clear where they lie .
" i 'm leicester city first , then england , " he says proudly .
" we all are .
serge even wore leicester socks under his forest kit when he was a boy .
but when the world cup is on , it 's all about england for me . "
limiting expectations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capello may be " the man " but england still face a tough task the world cup .
as ever , the three lions depart for south africa with the huge weight of expectation following in their vapor trail .
it 's the same with every major tournament england qualify for – regardless of what history has taught them , that going out on penalties in the quarter-finals is the best most of us can hope for .
the majority of england fans just ca n't help getting carried away .
the singer , however , puts himself squarely in the realist camp when it comes to england 's chances in south africa .
" i really hope we 'll win it , i really do , but i do n't think we will .
-lrb- coach fabio -rrb- capello is the man , and he 's made a huge difference , but i just do n't think we 're good enough . "
spain are dangerous but watch the dutch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meighan rates torres and villa as the best strike force " a lot of people are tipping spain to win it and when you look at the players they 've got , it 's hard to see who 's going to be better , " he says .
" if torres and villa are on song , then there 's no better strike force .
they have xavi , iniesta , fabregas , alonso – the midfield is just unreal .
the way they took people apart at the euros ... who is there out of the non-europeans who can beat them ?
brazil ?
past it .
argentina ?
too mental . "
so is the kasabian front man putting his next album advance on spain lifting the world cup this year ?
nope .
" i 'm telling you , man , " he says conspiratorially .
" keep an eye on the dutch .
you talk about the spanish midfield but look at robben , sneijder , van bommel ...
then they 've got huntelaar , van persie , even that carthorse kuyt does wonders in an orange shirt .
mark my words ... the dutch . "
write germany off at your peril bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany can play badly and still make it to the final and what about england 's nemesis , germany ?
" you 'd be stupid to right them off even though their squad is lacking star power , " he says .
" but it never matters to the germans , does it ?
they could be crap for months and scrape through in qualifying but when it comes to the tournament , they 're always in the final .
i do n't rate them but they 'll probably go and win it now just to show me up . "

but the big-selling british band 's first love is n't music - it 's football .
dw talked to singer tom meighan about the world cup . the connection between football and music is not a random one .
both occupy similar neighborhoods in the sprawling metropolis of popular culture and share many of the same traits , making them more than just nodding acquaintances .
both instill a loyalty in their followers which borders on obsession , both have supporters bound by a gang mentality and both can play havoc with emotions .
they are so intimate at times that it can be difficult to separate them .
for musicians , tapping into terrace culture can help their music reach a much wider audience and few current rock acts have so successfully blended fan bases than british band kasabian .
when it comes to ticking the cross-over boxes , the leicestershire four-piece are streets ahead of many of their rivals : they 're dyed-in-the-wool leicester city fans -lrb- so no evidence of glory hunting there -rrb- , guitarist serge pizzorno once had schoolboy trials with nottingham forest and as a celebrity team they 've taken on the likes of oasis and won .
their credentials as britain 's premier soccer-rockers were further enhanced in february when the english football association chose them to launch the new england away shirt for the 2010 world cup in south africa .
england kit launch in paris " i was really honored , " singer tom meighan told deutsche welle .
" but i had a few reservations about where they wanted us to do it . "
the fa , in their infinite wisdom , had chosen the band 's gig at the olympia in paris for the launch of the red shirt , modeled on the design of the 1966 world cup winning jersey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kasabian 's soccer roots inspire a matchday atmosphere " they asked me to do it and i said okay but i told them , ' it 's all on you – if it backfires , if it all kicks-off then it 's on your head . '
i wanted to know that if there was a riot , they would get us out .
we got booed a bit , but then we played another song and everything was cool . "
kasabian 's links to football culture are not confined to the british isles and european audiences find it just as easy to slip into a stadium mentality at their shows , which made debuting the new england shirt in front of a partisan french crowd a risky proposition .
thankfully , apart from some heckling , the only other abuse the band and the fa got was from sections of the british press who questioned the intelligence of the whole stunt .
" it was a laugh , " meigan says .
" we did it , no-one died so what 's the problem ? "
when pressed on his football allegiances , meighan makes it very clear where they lie .
" i 'm leicester city first , then england , " he says proudly .
" we all are .
serge even wore leicester socks under his forest kit when he was a boy .
but when the world cup is on , it 's all about england for me . "
limiting expectations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capello may be " the man " but england still face a tough task the world cup .
as ever , the three lions depart for south africa with the huge weight of expectation following in their vapor trail .
it 's the same with every major tournament england qualify for – regardless of what history has taught them , that going out on penalties in the quarter-finals is the best most of us can hope for .
the majority of england fans just ca n't help getting carried away .
the singer , however , puts himself squarely in the realist camp when it comes to england 's chances in south africa .
" i really hope we 'll win it , i really do , but i do n't think we will .
-lrb- coach fabio -rrb- capello is the man , and he 's made a huge difference , but i just do n't think we 're good enough . "
spain are dangerous but watch the dutch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meighan rates torres and villa as the best strike force " a lot of people are tipping spain to win it and when you look at the players they 've got , it 's hard to see who 's going to be better , " he says .
" if torres and villa are on song , then there 's no better strike force .
they have xavi , iniesta , fabregas , alonso – the midfield is just unreal .
the way they took people apart at the euros ... who is there out of the non-europeans who can beat them ?
brazil ?
past it .
argentina ?
too mental . "
so is the kasabian front man putting his next album advance on spain lifting the world cup this year ?
nope .
" i 'm telling you , man , " he says conspiratorially .
" keep an eye on the dutch .
you talk about the spanish midfield but look at robben , sneijder , van bommel ...
then they 've got huntelaar , van persie , even that carthorse kuyt does wonders in an orange shirt .
mark my words ... the dutch . "
write germany off at your peril bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany can play badly and still make it to the final and what about england 's nemesis , germany ?
" you 'd be stupid to right them off even though their squad is lacking star power , " he says .
" but it never matters to the germans , does it ?
they could be crap for months and scrape through in qualifying but when it comes to the tournament , they 're always in the final .
i do n't rate them but they 'll probably go and win it now just to show me up . "

but the big-selling british band 's first love is n't music - it 's football .
dw talked to singer tom meighan about the world cup . the connection between football and music is not a random one .
both occupy similar neighborhoods in the sprawling metropolis of popular culture and share many of the same traits , making them more than just nodding acquaintances .
both instill a loyalty in their followers which borders on obsession , both have supporters bound by a gang mentality and both can play havoc with emotions .
they are so intimate at times that it can be difficult to separate them .
for musicians , tapping into terrace culture can help their music reach a much wider audience and few current rock acts have so successfully blended fan bases than british band kasabian .
when it comes to ticking the cross-over boxes , the leicestershire four-piece are streets ahead of many of their rivals : they 're dyed-in-the-wool leicester city fans -lrb- so no evidence of glory hunting there -rrb- , guitarist serge pizzorno once had schoolboy trials with nottingham forest and as a celebrity team they 've taken on the likes of oasis and won .
their credentials as britain 's premier soccer-rockers were further enhanced in february when the english football association chose them to launch the new england away shirt for the 2010 world cup in south africa .
england kit launch in paris " i was really honored , " singer tom meighan told deutsche welle .
" but i had a few reservations about where they wanted us to do it . "
the fa , in their infinite wisdom , had chosen the band 's gig at the olympia in paris for the launch of the red shirt , modeled on the design of the 1966 world cup winning jersey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kasabian 's soccer roots inspire a matchday atmosphere " they asked me to do it and i said okay but i told them , ' it 's all on you – if it backfires , if it all kicks-off then it 's on your head . '
i wanted to know that if there was a riot , they would get us out .
we got booed a bit , but then we played another song and everything was cool . "
kasabian 's links to football culture are not confined to the british isles and european audiences find it just as easy to slip into a stadium mentality at their shows , which made debuting the new england shirt in front of a partisan french crowd a risky proposition .
thankfully , apart from some heckling , the only other abuse the band and the fa got was from sections of the british press who questioned the intelligence of the whole stunt .
" it was a laugh , " meigan says .
" we did it , no-one died so what 's the problem ? "
when pressed on his football allegiances , meighan makes it very clear where they lie .
" i 'm leicester city first , then england , " he says proudly .
" we all are .
serge even wore leicester socks under his forest kit when he was a boy .
but when the world cup is on , it 's all about england for me . "
limiting expectations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capello may be " the man " but england still face a tough task the world cup .
as ever , the three lions depart for south africa with the huge weight of expectation following in their vapor trail .
it 's the same with every major tournament england qualify for – regardless of what history has taught them , that going out on penalties in the quarter-finals is the best most of us can hope for .
the majority of england fans just ca n't help getting carried away .
the singer , however , puts himself squarely in the realist camp when it comes to england 's chances in south africa .
" i really hope we 'll win it , i really do , but i do n't think we will .
-lrb- coach fabio -rrb- capello is the man , and he 's made a huge difference , but i just do n't think we 're good enough . "
spain are dangerous but watch the dutch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meighan rates torres and villa as the best strike force " a lot of people are tipping spain to win it and when you look at the players they 've got , it 's hard to see who 's going to be better , " he says .
" if torres and villa are on song , then there 's no better strike force .
they have xavi , iniesta , fabregas , alonso – the midfield is just unreal .
the way they took people apart at the euros ... who is there out of the non-europeans who can beat them ?
brazil ?
past it .
argentina ?
too mental . "
so is the kasabian front man putting his next album advance on spain lifting the world cup this year ?
nope .
" i 'm telling you , man , " he says conspiratorially .
" keep an eye on the dutch .
you talk about the spanish midfield but look at robben , sneijder , van bommel ...
then they 've got huntelaar , van persie , even that carthorse kuyt does wonders in an orange shirt .
mark my words ... the dutch . "
write germany off at your peril bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany can play badly and still make it to the final and what about england 's nemesis , germany ?
" you 'd be stupid to right them off even though their squad is lacking star power , " he says .
" but it never matters to the germans , does it ?
they could be crap for months and scrape through in qualifying but when it comes to the tournament , they 're always in the final .
i do n't rate them but they 'll probably go and win it now just to show me up . "
kasabian 's summer festival dance card is booked through the world cup but another happy event planned for june could mean an opportunity comes their way for some concentrated football watching .
" chris our bass player and his wife are having their baby right when the world cup starts so we 'll take a week off for that and settle in for some serious viewing .
but then we 'll have to go back on the tour after that so we 'll try and see as much as we can . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 05.06.2010 public broadcasting in germany marks 60 years of independent reporting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aim was to make radio and television independent of government influence germany 's first public service broadcaster is celebrating its sixtieth birthday .
we look back at how the radio and tv corporation was born in post-war germany . just like the nation itself , public service broadcasters in the federal republic of germany grew up as separate insitutions in the various federal states .
sixty years ago this week , on 5th june 1950 , representatives of the individual regional radio stations came together to create the allgemeine rundfunkanstalt deutschlands -lrb- general german broadcasting corporation -rrb- .
the ard became the first nationwide public service broadcasting corporation .
the aim : to provide a platform for serious , independent , objective reporting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regional broadcasters form the core element of the overall system in germany " it is our deep conviction that radio stations should no longer be a mouth-piece of the respective government , " said the american controlling officer at the time , edmund schaechter .
" stations should represent every level of society and give all political groups and parties the opportunity to voice their opinion . "
the allies ' restructuring of german broadcasters german public sevice broadcasting was shaped by the post-war landscape .
in the aftermath of the second world war one of the immediate priorities for the allies was to break up the existing nazi structures .
radio was targeted in particular , because it had been abused as a propaganda tool during the third reich .
the allies were keen to re-establish radio as independent from the state , to act as a critical voice and to try to prevent extremism ever taking hold again .
in west germany , public service broadcasting was established on french , british and american models , notably the bbc .
the resulting ard united the various regional broadcasters , and for years , television viewers could only watch regional programmes , and one national programme .
only much later was competion established in the form of a second public broadcaster -lrb- in 1963 -rrb- and commercial broadcasting -lrb- in 1984 -rrb- .
in east germany , on the other side of the iron curtain , a separate system developed , along soviet lines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tagesschau has long established itself as germany 's main news show the western allies wanted the german public broadcaster to represent the whole of society , and reflect a range of views and political opinions .
independence from the state and political objectivity remain the hallmark of public service broadcasting in germany today .
however , politicians and parties have been accused over the decades of using public service broadcasters for their own means .
there is controversy over party political broadcasts which are aired in the run up to elections .
they are said to be propaganda for the parties .
but ard justifies this saying they are not responsible for the content .
furthermore , politicians sitting on the broadcasting council , have considerable influence over the choice for who runs the public service broadcaster .
it is not uncommon , therefore , that the top spot goes to someone who belongs to the most influential party at the time .
the federal structure of public service broadcasting in germany is seen as one of its key strengths , and has remained in place since its foundation .
the individual regional broadcasters are still responsible for their programmes .
they are largely protected from the long arm of the state by a guaranteed funding sytem .
a huge operation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular tv series such as tatort continue to top the ratings lists ard , the first german public service broadcaster , started out as a small institution .
the 9 regional stations now employ around 20,000 staff members , and many more freelancers .
they produce 11 television channels , 55 radio stations and have 16 orchestras and choirs under their belt .
the total budget for the public service broadcasters is around 6.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.7 billion -rrb- a year .
ard has a network of correspondents in 30 countries , as well as studios across germany .
in its 60 year history , ard has managed to establish itself as part of day-to-day life in germany .
the daily news show the ' tagesschau ' which airs every night at 8pm , has become an institution for millions of german families .
even the commercial television stations , which were founded in the 1980s and have since posed big competition for public broadcasters , can not touch it .
it still has around 10 million viewers a day .
other famous shows like the popular crime series , ' tatort ' , live sports broadcasts and family-orientated shows on saturday evenings mean that the first german broadcaster has maintained relatively high audience figures , although commercial broadcasters pose stiff competition .

the long , thin plastic horn is a popular fan article and could dominate audio coverage at the upcoming world cup games . the vuvuzela sounds a bit like a lovesick elephant or an angry bull - at least to european ears .
but for most south africans , it 's the unmistakable sound of soccer .
it 's simply part of the game , according to johannesburg soccer fan clinton currie .
" for me personally , i would say it represents our country , what we 're about , " currie told deutsche welle .
" we 're a noisy bunch of people basically , so that what it represents to me is something uniquely south african . "
passion turned business currie first started playing the vuvuzela 12 years ago .
what began as a bit of fun with a simple instrument gradually evolved into a passion – and a business plan .
the entrepreneur took the horn , which was previously available only in a single color , and branded it by adding a range of printed designs and colors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton currie plans to sell a million colorfully printed vuvuzelas the idea has taken off .
recent months have seen currie and his employees at the vuvuzela branding company rush to complete orders for one million printed horns .
most of them will bear the south african flag .
other designs include the flags of the united states , the netherlands and australia .
all of them are made of a robust plastic well suited for use in crowded stadiums .
others producers have also joined the fray .
today , there 's a wide range of horns on the market , from smaller models covered in sparkling stones to larger trumpets hand-painted by local artists .
and their prices cover the entire gamut .
according to theresa granger , who works at a souvenir shop on long street in cape town , regular vuvuzelas made from plastic cost about six euros , while fancier collectors ' versions decorated with pearls can fetch up to 100 .
granger said she has been selling about 20 horns a week over the past few months .
they 're particularly popular with tourists from brazil .
bildunterschrift : will foreign visitors be able to match the noise produced at south african club matches ?
no ban at games but will visiting soccer fans really be able to take their vuvuzelas into the stadium on game day ?
earlier this year , south african media reported organizers were under pressure to ban the instruments from world cup venues because they were too loud and could intimidate foreign teams .
fifa officials in johannesburg have since announced that vuvuzelas are part of south african football culture , and will indeed be permitted in stadiums .
granger is among the many south africans who welcome the move .
" you ca n't ban it because it is a south african thing " and the event happens to be taking place in the country , she said .
the exact origin of the vuvuzela is unknown .
one theory points to the long , thin trumpets made from kudu horns , once used by community leaders to call village gatherings .
later , the trumpets were manufactured from sheet metal - and then , in the 1990s , soccer fans decided to put them to a new use , and plastic models emerged .
" practice before game day " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : currie : ' we 're a noisy bunch of people basically ' it does n't matter if it 's the kaizer chiefs playing the orlando pirates , or the mamelodi sundown tackling ajax cape town - the sound of the vuvuzela can be heard at every soccer match across the country .
currie doubts , however , that this summer 's world cup games will be anywhere near as loud as normal south african league matches .
" the fans that are going to attend do n't know how to blow the vuvuzela , " he said .
that said , currie and many other south africans are confident that most visiting fans will have a good time with the instrument - as long as they practice a little before game day .

the long , thin plastic horn is a popular fan article and could dominate audio coverage at the upcoming world cup games . the vuvuzela sounds a bit like a lovesick elephant or an angry bull - at least to european ears .
but for most south africans , it 's the unmistakable sound of soccer .
it 's simply part of the game , according to johannesburg soccer fan clinton currie .
" for me personally , i would say it represents our country , what we 're about , " currie told deutsche welle .
" we 're a noisy bunch of people basically , so that what it represents to me is something uniquely south african . "
passion turned business currie first started playing the vuvuzela 12 years ago .
what began as a bit of fun with a simple instrument gradually evolved into a passion – and a business plan .
the entrepreneur took the horn , which was previously available only in a single color , and branded it by adding a range of printed designs and colors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton currie plans to sell a million colorfully printed vuvuzelas the idea has taken off .
recent months have seen currie and his employees at the vuvuzela branding company rush to complete orders for one million printed horns .
most of them will bear the south african flag .
other designs include the flags of the united states , the netherlands and australia .
all of them are made of a robust plastic well suited for use in crowded stadiums .
others producers have also joined the fray .
today , there 's a wide range of horns on the market , from smaller models covered in sparkling stones to larger trumpets hand-painted by local artists .
and their prices cover the entire gamut .
according to theresa granger , who works at a souvenir shop on long street in cape town , regular vuvuzelas made from plastic cost about six euros , while fancier collectors ' versions decorated with pearls can fetch up to 100 .
granger said she has been selling about 20 horns a week over the past few months .
they 're particularly popular with tourists from brazil .
bildunterschrift : will foreign visitors be able to match the noise produced at south african club matches ?
no ban at games but will visiting soccer fans really be able to take their vuvuzelas into the stadium on game day ?
earlier this year , south african media reported organizers were under pressure to ban the instruments from world cup venues because they were too loud and could intimidate foreign teams .
fifa officials in johannesburg have since announced that vuvuzelas are part of south african football culture , and will indeed be permitted in stadiums .
granger is among the many south africans who welcome the move .
" you ca n't ban it because it is a south african thing " and the event happens to be taking place in the country , she said .
the exact origin of the vuvuzela is unknown .
one theory points to the long , thin trumpets made from kudu horns , once used by community leaders to call village gatherings .
later , the trumpets were manufactured from sheet metal - and then , in the 1990s , soccer fans decided to put them to a new use , and plastic models emerged .
" practice before game day " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : currie : ' we 're a noisy bunch of people basically ' it does n't matter if it 's the kaizer chiefs playing the orlando pirates , or the mamelodi sundown tackling ajax cape town - the sound of the vuvuzela can be heard at every soccer match across the country .
currie doubts , however , that this summer 's world cup games will be anywhere near as loud as normal south african league matches .
" the fans that are going to attend do n't know how to blow the vuvuzela , " he said .
that said , currie and many other south africans are confident that most visiting fans will have a good time with the instrument - as long as they practice a little before game day .
