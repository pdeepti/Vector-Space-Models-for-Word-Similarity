public prosecutors in stuttgart are investigating too . traders and hedge fund managers hate the weekends because they ca n't take react immediately to corporate announcements until trading floors reopen on monday .
sunday , october 26 , 2008 was a particularly bad day for 35 american hedge funds .
that was the day german sports carmaker porsche announced that it owned 42.6 percent of volkswagen 's common stock and options for another 31.5 percent - bringing its total stake in the company to 74.1 percent .
the announcement then declared porsche was seeking to obtain 75 percent of vw shares - a plan that eventually backfired .
the following morning saw a frenzy of trading activity .
hedge fund managers had long been betting that the price of vw stock would fall .
the financial crisis caused demand for cars to fall in the us , driving down american automakers ' share prices .
they figured it was only a matter of time until german carmakers suffered a similar fate .
as a result , their funds were borrowing vw shares and selling them on in the hope they could buy them back later at a lower price - a speculative strategy known as short selling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us fund managers say wendelin wiedeking misled investors about his plans but porsche 's weekend announcement made it clear that fund managers had sold more than double the number of vw shares actually available on the market .
the news drove vw 's stock price up from 290 euros to 1,005 euros per share , making it the world 's most valuable company for a short period of time .
the financial times estimates that hedge funds lost about 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- in two days of trading as a result .
transatlatic battle now the funds want porsche to pay them more than 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2 billion -rrb- in damages .
lawyers representing the hedge funds told a new york court that porsche committed securities fraud by leading investors to believe it was only seeking a 51-percent stake in vw .
porsche 's defense team is due to file a petition to dismiss the lawsuit on wednesday , according to german media .
analysts expect porsche to argue that it was only required to publicly disclose its takeover plans once they were approved by the board - and that that had not been the case prior to october 26 , 2008 .
the hedge funds ' claims may be helped by the fact that german prosecutors in the city of stuttgart are also examining claims that porsche managers manipulated the markets .
investigators are trying to establish whether former porsche chief wendelin wiedeking and his financial director holger haerter influenced stock prices by passing on insider information or misleading investors about the porsche 's plans to increase its stake in vw .
the american plaintiffs will have to be patient if they want to rely on evidence from germany , however .
the stuttgart prosecutors ' preliminary findings are n't due to be released until the end of 2010 or early 2011 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 30.08.2010 coach marco kurz and new-look kaiserslautern are turning heads großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marco kurz - disciplined and passionate few predicted newly promoted kasierslautern would win their first two matches , especially as one of their foes was bayern munich .
deutsche welle spoke with coach marco kurz about the embattled club 's change of fortune . when marco kurz took over kaiserslautern in summer 2009 , the red devils ' situation was truly diabolical .
the former league champions had been reduced to battling against relegation from the second division - a consequence of poor investments and financial difficulties in the early years of the millennium . the club was also running through coaches at the rate of one roughly every 12 months . fast forward a little over a year to the second round of the 2010-11 season , and kaiserslautern are not just back in the top flight , but have beaten bayern munich . lautern 's 2-0 win over the reigning champs on friday was more about perspiration than inspiration .
the red devils stymied bayern with tight defending in midfield , and their thrusts forward were incisive enough to exploit lapses in concentration by munich . " we knew that this was a good time to play bayern munich , " kurz told deutsche welle after the victory .
" our opponents had a lot of national team players in their ranks who had n't yet gotten into the rhythm of practices .
we hoped that would give us a physical advantage . " kaiserslautern played physically against the champions , without a doubt .
but there was more to their game than just kicking their opponents ' shins . and while kurz remains modest , a lot of credit for their performance has to go to their coach . stay cool and read the rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mood has n't been this good at lautern since the 1990s in his playing career as a defender , kurz had the opportunity to work with and learn from some excellent coaches .
in 1994-5 , he was part of the borussia dortmund side that won the bundesliga under coach ottmar hitzfeld .
and two years later , he won the uefa cup with schalke under coach huub stevens . both hitzfeld and stevens are coaches who stress tactical discipline , and that quality seems to have rubbed off on kurz . " i had coaches with whom we trained really hard and i noticed , ' wow , physical fitness is definitely the basis for successful football , " ' kurz said .
" we had unbelievable discipline under huub stevens , especially in his treatment of the team .
i learned that footballers need that .
footballers need hard and fast rules . " those rules are not just about behavior , but what players do on the pitch . " the players have clear instructions in matches how they are to play their positions , " kurz said .
" the individual parts of the team - defense , midfield and attack - receive clear instructions , and you hope they work as a collective .
there 's no one on the pitch without instructions and a plan . " but the skill has to be there for players to execute the coach 's plan .
and this kaiserslautern squad features a very particular collection of skills . bildunterschrift : striker srdjan lakic is one of lautern 's new , inexpensive stars the cast-off crew kaiserslautern used to be a breeding ground for german talent - club alumni include andy brehme , miroslav klose and michael ballack .
those days are long gone .
of the current starting 11 , only goalkeeper tobias sippel is a homegrown product . instead , kaiserslautern have built their squad around eastern european players and underrated castoffs from other clubs .
lautern 's offensive duo srdan lakic and ivo ilicevic came for cheap from hertha berlin and bochum respectively . those two clubs now play in division two , while lakic and ilicevic scored five goals between them in the first pair of matches in the top flight . martin amedick and rodnei , the heart of the defense , were also picked up for a song from bigger clubs where they failed to make their mark . " in terms of the makeup of the squad , we chose players who have reason to be hungry , who have to show they 're good enough for division one , " kurz said .
" we did without established veterans , because we wanted to say , ' look , the guys who got us promoted have the necessary quality . " ' bildunterschrift : the red devils are once again inspiring fear in foes kaiserslautern 's career revivalists have also reanimated crowds . with a home city of only around 100,000 inhabitants , kaiserslautern inhabit one of the smallest markets in the bundesliga .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de publishing -pipe- 30.08.2010 internet killed the dictionary star großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the market for traditional dictionaries is disappearing , says the oed publisher falling sales and the growing popularity of online dictionaries mean the oxford english dictionary may never be printed again , its publisher says . for over two decades , dozens of writers have been working on a book that will probably never grace a bookshelf .
online dictionaries have gained so much popularity over their printed counterparts that the next edition of the oxford english dictionary will probably appear only in electronic form , according to its publisher , the oxford university press .
" the print dictionary market is just disappearing , it is falling away by tens of per cent a year , " nigel portwood , the chief executive of the oxford university press , told uk newspaper the sunday times .
he told the uk newspaper he did not think the third edition would be printed .
the second and most recent oed has existed online for more than a decade , where it receives two million hits a month from subscribers who pay an annual fee of almost 300 euros to access it .
a wider trend towards online simon winchester , author of the meaning of everything : the story of the oxford english dictionary , said the oxford university press 's move away from print editions of the dictionary " reflects an inevitability " and is part of a growing trend of readers moving away from printed books toward digital editions and electronic e-readers like the kindle or the ipad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dictionary-users are increasingly turning to the internet for their answers " i think the electronic book is going to achieve ascendancy over the printed book , and i think that the printed book is just starting now to vanish , " winchester said .
though he owns three sets of the printed version of the oxford english dictionary , he said he relies on the digital version .
" on my ipad , i 've used the oed twice if not three times today .
but i never ever go to the hardback version .
it sits there on the shelf gathering dust , looking beautiful , but i never use it . "
online dictionary keeps better pace the move away from printed dictionaries could also be helping to create a more accessible oed , and one that evolves better alongside the language that it documents , said charlotte brewer , professor of english language and literature at oxford university and author of treasure-house of the language : the living oed .
" when the first dictionaries were produced in the victorian period , the edwardian period in the uk , there were all sorts of assumptions about what was proper to go into a dictionary – so words to do with sex , and the body , sometimes did n't get in or sometimes were defined in a way that we would regard as inadequate , " she said .
many of the quotations used in older editions of the oed were drawn from historical and literary sources .
now , brewer said , " the lexicographers can use the web , they can use google , they have access to an enormous variety of language online , they can instantly access a far broader range of sources .
in this way … it 's likely to become more democratic . "

online dictionaries have gained so much popularity over their printed counterparts that the next edition of the oxford english dictionary will probably appear only in electronic form , according to its publisher , the oxford university press .
" the print dictionary market is just disappearing , it is falling away by tens of per cent a year , " nigel portwood , the chief executive of the oxford university press , told uk newspaper the sunday times .
he told the uk newspaper he did not think the third edition would be printed .

a wider trend towards online simon winchester , author of the meaning of everything : the story of the oxford english dictionary , said the oxford university press 's move away from print editions of the dictionary " reflects an inevitability " and is part of a growing trend of readers moving away from printed books toward digital editions and electronic e-readers like the kindle or the ipad .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 30.08.2010 coach marco kurz and new-look kaiserslautern are turning heads großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marco kurz - disciplined and passionate few predicted newly promoted kasierslautern would win their first two matches , especially as one of their foes was bayern munich .
deutsche welle spoke with coach marco kurz about the embattled club 's change of fortune . when marco kurz took over kaiserslautern in summer 2009 , the red devils ' situation was truly diabolical .
the former league champions had been reduced to battling against relegation from the second division - a consequence of poor investments and financial difficulties in the early years of the millennium . the club was also running through coaches at the rate of one roughly every 12 months . fast forward a little over a year to the second round of the 2010-11 season , and kaiserslautern are not just back in the top flight , but have beaten bayern munich . lautern 's 2-0 win over the reigning champs on friday was more about perspiration than inspiration .
the red devils stymied bayern with tight defending in midfield , and their thrusts forward were incisive enough to exploit lapses in concentration by munich . " we knew that this was a good time to play bayern munich , " kurz told deutsche welle after the victory .
" our opponents had a lot of national team players in their ranks who had n't yet gotten into the rhythm of practices .
we hoped that would give us a physical advantage . " kaiserslautern played physically against the champions , without a doubt .
but there was more to their game than just kicking their opponents ' shins . and while kurz remains modest , a lot of credit for their performance has to go to their coach . stay cool and read the rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mood has n't been this good at lautern since the 1990s in his playing career as a defender , kurz had the opportunity to work with and learn from some excellent coaches .
in 1994-5 , he was part of the borussia dortmund side that won the bundesliga under coach ottmar hitzfeld .
and two years later , he won the uefa cup with schalke under coach huub stevens . both hitzfeld and stevens are coaches who stress tactical discipline , and that quality seems to have rubbed off on kurz . " i had coaches with whom we trained really hard and i noticed , ' wow , physical fitness is definitely the basis for successful football , " ' kurz said .
" we had unbelievable discipline under huub stevens , especially in his treatment of the team .
i learned that footballers need that .
footballers need hard and fast rules . " those rules are not just about behavior , but what players do on the pitch . " the players have clear instructions in matches how they are to play their positions , " kurz said .
" the individual parts of the team - defense , midfield and attack - receive clear instructions , and you hope they work as a collective .
there 's no one on the pitch without instructions and a plan . " but the skill has to be there for players to execute the coach 's plan .
and this kaiserslautern squad features a very particular collection of skills . bildunterschrift : striker srdjan lakic is one of lautern 's new , inexpensive stars the cast-off crew kaiserslautern used to be a breeding ground for german talent - club alumni include andy brehme , miroslav klose and michael ballack .
those days are long gone .
of the current starting 11 , only goalkeeper tobias sippel is a homegrown product . instead , kaiserslautern have built their squad around eastern european players and underrated castoffs from other clubs .
lautern 's offensive duo srdan lakic and ivo ilicevic came for cheap from hertha berlin and bochum respectively . those two clubs now play in division two , while lakic and ilicevic scored five goals between them in the first pair of matches in the top flight . martin amedick and rodnei , the heart of the defense , were also picked up for a song from bigger clubs where they failed to make their mark . " in terms of the makeup of the squad , we chose players who have reason to be hungry , who have to show they 're good enough for division one , " kurz said .
" we did without established veterans , because we wanted to say , ' look , the guys who got us promoted have the necessary quality . " ' bildunterschrift : the red devils are once again inspiring fear in foes kaiserslautern 's career revivalists have also reanimated crowds . with a home city of only around 100,000 inhabitants , kaiserslautern inhabit one of the smallest markets in the bundesliga .
the football club play an especially important role in local culture , and in the team 's heyday , opponents used to hate playing in fritz walter stadium in front of especially passionate fans . that twelfth-man spirit is now back . " you could see how everyone was drinking in the first division , " kurz said .
" everyone was slavering for it , and now it 's here , and we have a duty to show we 're up to the top flight . with a perfect record , three points earned against germany 's top team and a restored relationship with their supporters , marco kurz 's kaiserslautern are well on their way to proving precisely that . marco kurz was interviewed by kamilla jarzina for dw-tv 's bundesliga kick-off , which is broadcast every monday / tuesday .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel paid a visit to several power plants over the last week ensuring energy supplies the chancellor , citing an independent consultants ' report published this week , said such a time frame would ensure germany 's energy needs are met as the country transitions to renewable energy sources .
energy prices would remain under control and goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions would be reached with an extra 10 to 15 years of nuclear power , merkel added . " i have to consider , as head of government , how we integrate safety as the overriding principle of nuclear energy , " she said . sigmar gabriel , head of the opposition social democratic party , criticized merkel 's decision . " the chancellor 's statement shows that the decision is n't based on a sustainable energy plan but the hard-nosed lobbying work done by nuclear power companies , " he told reporters on sunday . clean energy groups agree with the opposition and point out that using nuclear and renewable energy sources in tandem is not efficient . " renewable energies are feeding into the system in a flexible way , depending on weather conditions for example , " bjoern klusmann , director of germany 's renewable energy association told deutsche welle . " because of the priority given to renewables in the german grid , the conventional power stations , so coal and nuclear and other fossil power stations , have to react in a flexible way to the production from renewables .
nuclear energy is not as flexible as is needed for this future concept of renewable energy being the dominant part in our grid , " he explained . in a statement on friday , merkel said renewable energies should supply half of all energy needs by 2050 and that nuclear and coal power would continue until supplies could be met entirely by clean energy , a strategy that clean energy experts like klusmann say is a false economy . " eighty percent of german power supply is in the hands of four big companies ... what we need is more competition in the field of energy and we get that if we phase out nuclear and allow investors to install new production capacity , " klusmann said . as long as nuclear power is granted such a high standing in the market , he argues , investment in renewables will be low , especially since the government has announced funding cuts in some types of renewables . legal question the debate over extending the running time of germany 's nuclear plants has sparked a deep debate in the german parliament .
merkel said any extension would come in a form that circumvents germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat . however , doubts have been raised by the interior and justice ministries that an extension of more than 10 years could be illegal if it were not approved by the bundesrat , which is made up of the governments of germany 's 16 states . germany has 17 nuclear power plants , but it is not certain how many would be given extensions if one is granted . a poll published on friday found that 56 percent of germans are against keeping nuclear power plants beyond 2021 . author : matt zuvela , nicole goebel -lrb- reuters / dpa / afp -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press freedom -pipe- 30.08.2010 ukraine 's president defends record on press freedom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovych wanted to focus on economic matters ukrainian president viktor yanukovych faced a tough grilling over press freedom in an interview with the german media before a visit to berlin on monday .
the president had hoped to focus on economic issues . in an interview with deutsche welle and other german media ahead of his visit to berlin on monday , ukrainian president viktor yanukovych said he hopes to focus on economic issues when he meets german chancellor angela merkel .
however , it appears that concerns about freedom of the press threaten to overshadow the visit .
the role of valeriy khoroshkovskyi , who is both the head of ukraine 's security intelligence service and a media entrepreneur , also came under focus .
what expectation do you have of this trip to germany ?
what do you hope for from this visit ?
viktor yanukovych : i hope this visit will open up a new chapter in relations between ukraine and germany .
the main aim of our foreign policy is that we fulfill our obligations .
we are involved in pursuing these commitments .
an important issue that we are paying special attention to is making the economy more important in our foreign policy .
in practice , that means the reform plan that i announced recently should serve to create new possibilities for foreign investors .
we are trying to overcome a lot of bureaucratic hurdles that stand in the way of investors .
the system of permits and licenses in place until now has placed a considerable burden on the economy .
we have already halved the number of licenses and different permits .
this system will conform to european standards .
for that reason , i expect only positive outcomes from this visit to germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's questions may extend to the case of nico lang it is expected that the german chancellor will address the case of nico lang .
the ukrainan director of the konrad-adenauer political foundation was denied entry to ukraine and detained at kiev airport -lsb- the matter was settled after intervention from the german embassy -rsb- .
initially it was said that there had been a misunderstanding .
then there was talk of interference in internal affairs .
what was that about ?
every security service has its job to do .
information gets shared .
conflicts that arise are resolved through negotiations between both sides .
i gave my personal instructions to the chief of staff of the security service and also to the foreign minister .
we were able to resolve this very quickly with germany and therefore the case for us is settled .
we hear that you lightly admonished intelligence chief valeriy khoroshkovskyi after this incident , to put it mildly .
is that true ?
when conflicts arise , one must be careful .
there is no doubt , a warning had to be given .
and that 's what i did .
one subject that is also closely watched in germany is the issue of press freedom .
journalists report growing political pressure and in some cases , abuse .
in court , there is a case being contested about whether two tv stations should be allowed to keep their licenses .
several days ago , a journalist in the east of the country disappeared .
how do you assess these developments ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : press freedom is an issue of growing concern in ukraine i am of the view that all conflicts must be solved through the courts .
i can not imagine that in these cases pressure would be put on the court and that courts would make biased decisions .
every court decision is binding for the executive and also must be observed by the mass media . ´ i have had many meetings and encounters concerning freedom of expression and i sometimes ask journalists to tell me or give me proper examples where there is obstruction of freedom of expression .
for me it is important to have concrete , named cases and until i have them , it would not be right to pass judgment .
i have two cases .
first , the director of the television channel tvi claims he was shadowed by people from the secret service .
secondly , i heard from my own contact here in the ukraine that she was summoned to have conversations with people from the intelligence service and asked about my work .
i consider that to be an attempt to intimidate my contact .
are these cases known to you , and how would you categorize them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : questions were raised about intelligence boss valeriy khoroshkovskyi well , this is the first time i have heard that there are such cases .
when there really are such cases then you need to report them officially .
where the first issue is concerned , it hardly seems realistic to me that journalists would be monitored in this way .
i do n't believe that .
anyway , there has been no case that i have been informed about .
as far as journalists being summoned to have conversations with the intelligence service is concerned , i am also hearing that for the first time .
i really would ask you to tell me specifically which journalist was summoned , when , and where to .
i have already submitted these cases officially to the intelligence service a couple of weeks ago .
apparently it has not been forwarded .
so , i would pose the question : do you believe , after so many incidents , that your secret services chief is still the right man to be in this position ?
i ask this in consideration of his connected interests as intelligence chief , media entrepreneur and member of the highest council of justice .
i would say the security chief performs his job in a quite normal manner .
this work has no connection at all with the activities of the mass media .
regarding his assets , he has handed over their administration of his assets to relatives .
we have many officials who also have had assets and , according to the law , the management of these assets have been handed over to trustees .
as far as i know , that happens not only in the ukraine , but also all over the world .

the president had hoped to focus on economic issues . in an interview with deutsche welle and other german media ahead of his visit to berlin on monday , ukrainian president viktor yanukovych said he hopes to focus on economic issues when he meets german chancellor angela merkel .
however , it appears that concerns about freedom of the press threaten to overshadow the visit .
the role of valeriy khoroshkovskyi , who is both the head of ukraine 's security intelligence service and a media entrepreneur , also came under focus .
what expectation do you have of this trip to germany ?
what do you hope for from this visit ?
viktor yanukovych : i hope this visit will open up a new chapter in relations between ukraine and germany .
the main aim of our foreign policy is that we fulfill our obligations .
we are involved in pursuing these commitments .
an important issue that we are paying special attention to is making the economy more important in our foreign policy .
in practice , that means the reform plan that i announced recently should serve to create new possibilities for foreign investors .
we are trying to overcome a lot of bureaucratic hurdles that stand in the way of investors .
the system of permits and licenses in place until now has placed a considerable burden on the economy .
we have already halved the number of licenses and different permits .
this system will conform to european standards .
for that reason , i expect only positive outcomes from this visit to germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's questions may extend to the case of nico lang it is expected that the german chancellor will address the case of nico lang .
the ukrainan director of the konrad-adenauer political foundation was denied entry to ukraine and detained at kiev airport -lsb- the matter was settled after intervention from the german embassy -rsb- .
initially it was said that there had been a misunderstanding .
then there was talk of interference in internal affairs .
what was that about ?
every security service has its job to do .
information gets shared .
conflicts that arise are resolved through negotiations between both sides .
i gave my personal instructions to the chief of staff of the security service and also to the foreign minister .
we were able to resolve this very quickly with germany and therefore the case for us is settled .
we hear that you lightly admonished intelligence chief valeriy khoroshkovskyi after this incident , to put it mildly .
is that true ?
when conflicts arise , one must be careful .
there is no doubt , a warning had to be given .
and that 's what i did .
one subject that is also closely watched in germany is the issue of press freedom .
journalists report growing political pressure and in some cases , abuse .
in court , there is a case being contested about whether two tv stations should be allowed to keep their licenses .
several days ago , a journalist in the east of the country disappeared .
how do you assess these developments ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : press freedom is an issue of growing concern in ukraine i am of the view that all conflicts must be solved through the courts .
i can not imagine that in these cases pressure would be put on the court and that courts would make biased decisions .
every court decision is binding for the executive and also must be observed by the mass media . ´ i have had many meetings and encounters concerning freedom of expression and i sometimes ask journalists to tell me or give me proper examples where there is obstruction of freedom of expression .

the southern city of thatta has apparently been saved from being inundated , and many citizens who fled earlier are returning there . slowly , the focus is turning to the giant task of rebuilding the devastated areas .
the pakistani ngo akhuwat pakistan has launched an innovative plan to help flood victims in southern punjab stand on their own feet as soon as possible .
under the plan by akhuwat pakistan , flood-affected families are to receive microcredits in order to create employment opportunities for them .
the interest-free loans will come without difficult conditions attached .
the organisation 's executive director amjad saqib explains : " look , whatever is happening right now is relief work .
people need food , shelter , medicine . "
but this relief work will be over in one or two months , he adds . bildunterschrift : a boy receives food at a camp on the outskirt of sukkur in southern pakistan " and then the real challenge will come up - how to rehabilitate all these people !
how can they stand on their own feet again ?
so whereas we from akhuwat have been continuously engaged in relief work in the field , within two months we want to shift our focus on one of the worst-affected areas , rajanpur district .
our preparation , fund raising and resource mobilisation are going well , and god willing we 'll select 10,000 badly affected families and provide them with interest-free loans , thus enabling them to re-start the businesses they 've had to abandon due to this flood . "
rebuilding small businesses the flood victims will get between 10,000 and 30,000 rupees -lrb- between 92 and 276 euros -rrb- per family as an interest-free loan .
no security or documents are required , nor will there be any service charges .
according to izhar hashmi , director of akhuwat pakistan , the recipients will be able to buy seeds or raise goats or cattle with the money .
they might also open a small shop in their village or buy a donkey cart and start a transport business .
with the income generated , they 'll have to repay the loans within 30 months .
the money will then be free to be distributed again to other needy persons .
akhuwat plans to raise 150 million rupees -lrb- almost 1.4 million euros -rrb- in donations from pakistanis for the program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crossing a flooded road in punjab province on monday " we wo n't turn pakistanis into beggars , " says amjad saqib , " but want to harness their potential to work hard for a better future .
they 'll rise up on their own and stand on their own feet again . "
an alternative approach to microcredit akhuwat means " brotherhood " in arabic .
the organisation 's philosophy of providing loan-free microcredit is inspired by islamic teaching which prohibits the charging of interest , but it equally provides loans to non-muslims , such as members of the christian minority , relying on the local mosque and church infrastructure . akhuwat , which has been working in pakistan for more than nine years and claims a recovery rate for its loans of almost 100 per cent , is an interesting exception among the growing number of micro-finance institutions worldwide .
recently , criticism has grown of these microcredit groups , as many have been demanding high interest rates , which can become a problem for those who accept their loans .
some development experts have pointed to the akhuwat model , funded by charitable donations and charging no interest at all , as an alternative way .
for pakistani flood victims , it definitely comes as a welcome support in this time of crisis .

recently , criticism has grown of these microcredit groups , as many have been demanding high interest rates , which can become a problem for those who accept their loans .
some development experts have pointed to the akhuwat model , funded by charitable donations and charging no interest at all , as an alternative way .
for pakistani flood victims , it definitely comes as a welcome support in this time of crisis .

online dictionaries have gained so much popularity over their printed counterparts that the next edition of the oxford english dictionary will probably appear only in electronic form , according to its publisher , the oxford university press .
" the print dictionary market is just disappearing , it is falling away by tens of per cent a year , " nigel portwood , the chief executive of the oxford university press , told uk newspaper the sunday times .
he told the uk newspaper he did not think the third edition would be printed .
the second and most recent oed has existed online for more than a decade , where it receives two million hits a month from subscribers who pay an annual fee of almost 300 euros to access it .
a wider trend towards online simon winchester , author of the meaning of everything : the story of the oxford english dictionary , said the oxford university press 's move away from print editions of the dictionary " reflects an inevitability " and is part of a growing trend of readers moving away from printed books toward digital editions and electronic e-readers like the kindle or the ipad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dictionary-users are increasingly turning to the internet for their answers " i think the electronic book is going to achieve ascendancy over the printed book , and i think that the printed book is just starting now to vanish , " winchester said .
though he owns three sets of the printed version of the oxford english dictionary , he said he relies on the digital version .
" on my ipad , i 've used the oed twice if not three times today .
but i never ever go to the hardback version .
it sits there on the shelf gathering dust , looking beautiful , but i never use it . "
online dictionary keeps better pace the move away from printed dictionaries could also be helping to create a more accessible oed , and one that evolves better alongside the language that it documents , said charlotte brewer , professor of english language and literature at oxford university and author of treasure-house of the language : the living oed .
" when the first dictionaries were produced in the victorian period , the edwardian period in the uk , there were all sorts of assumptions about what was proper to go into a dictionary – so words to do with sex , and the body , sometimes did n't get in or sometimes were defined in a way that we would regard as inadequate , " she said .
many of the quotations used in older editions of the oed were drawn from historical and literary sources .
now , brewer said , " the lexicographers can use the web , they can use google , they have access to an enormous variety of language online , they can instantly access a far broader range of sources .
in this way … it 's likely to become more democratic . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet offers lexicographers a broader range of sources to draw upon an ' absolutely enormous ' undertaking almost one third of a million entries were contained in the second version of the oed , published in hard copy in 1989 .
since then , a team of 80 lexicographers have been working on the third edition , though they have completed only 28 percent of the dictionary .
" we 're talking about an absolutely enormous amount of data , which in its last printed form occupied 20 volumes , " brewer said .
she said the third edition of the dictionary would likely be even larger .
" i think the point is that the cost of this work would be unbelievable - you know , you have to wonder who could possibly afford to buy it , " brewer said .
with the most recent edition weighing in at a hefty 62.9 kilos , an electronic version of edition three would not only be lighter on the hip pocket – it would also be easier on the back .

the pavilion called the " balancity " featured hip-hop during a month long program with graffiti , break-dance and music . hip-hop beats echoing around the area in front of the german pavilion have been attracting scores of young chinese people .
they are excited and sing along loudly with the artists .
" it is different here in comparison to berlin , " says rafael schall from berlin , who is blown away by the response .
" here you can really get the people high on music , dance with them on the stage and really go ballistic .
people really go crazy here . "
schall is one of 50 german hip-hop artists who have come to shangai to perform at the german pavilion .
together with 50 chinese hip-hop artists they have turned it into a laboratory of urban youth culture .

" hip-hop is a youth culture , which can also be seen in cities represented in words through graffiti but also in the form of various performances .
with the help of our ' balancity ' pavilion at the shanghai expo , we are trying to show the versatility of a city .
and in a city , giving space to young people is as important as it is to provide space for high or elite culture . "
graffiti is important for hip-hoppers all over the world .
and one can also see this at the german pavilion .
at the graffiti corner there are not only huge pictures , but also graffiti t-shirts , umbrellas and bags for the visitors .
but in shanghai one hardly gets to see any graffiti .
stan wu works with the " invasion " magazine in hong kong .
he explains why so few walls are painted in shanghai .
" we first had the olympics and now we have the shanghai expo .
so the government and the city are trying to wipe out the whole country .
zero tolerance of ' dirty ' surface , you know .
so there is no chance that you will see a lot of graffiti in the city . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mc wesley from beijing in the ' balancity ' power of graffiti asia 's largest graffiti competition " wall lords finals 2010 " , which was held on sunday at the shanghai expo was also a part of the german hip-hop project .
it was initiated by akim walta from berlin , who has been active in the hip-hop scene there for almost 30 years .
walta talks about a graffiti project by german artists in shanghai .
" our boys also painted something for the residents here .
what was interesting was that they tried to come into contact with the locals .
and suddenly the sad grey street became colorful , with some connection to the locals .
and in the course of time there was some problem and we were asked to remove the graffiti .
but then , little children and families stood up for us and said that we had come from a far away land and the graffiti was a gift for them .
they said it was their picture and they did not want it to be removed . "
walta has been to china many times and has been involved in various graffiti projects .
he hopes that the hip-hop project at the shanghai expo is not the last one .

public prosecutors in stuttgart are investigating too . traders and hedge fund managers hate the weekends because they ca n't take react immediately to corporate announcements until trading floors reopen on monday .
sunday , october 26 , 2008 was a particularly bad day for 35 american hedge funds .
that was the day german sports carmaker porsche announced that it owned 42.6 percent of volkswagen 's common stock and options for another 31.5 percent - bringing its total stake in the company to 74.1 percent .
the announcement then declared porsche was seeking to obtain 75 percent of vw shares - a plan that eventually backfired .
the following morning saw a frenzy of trading activity .
hedge fund managers had long been betting that the price of vw stock would fall .
the financial crisis caused demand for cars to fall in the us , driving down american automakers ' share prices .
they figured it was only a matter of time until german carmakers suffered a similar fate .
as a result , their funds were borrowing vw shares and selling them on in the hope they could buy them back later at a lower price - a speculative strategy known as short selling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us fund managers say wendelin wiedeking misled investors about his plans but porsche 's weekend announcement made it clear that fund managers had sold more than double the number of vw shares actually available on the market .
the news drove vw 's stock price up from 290 euros to 1,005 euros per share , making it the world 's most valuable company for a short period of time .
the financial times estimates that hedge funds lost about 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- in two days of trading as a result .
transatlatic battle now the funds want porsche to pay them more than 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2 billion -rrb- in damages .
lawyers representing the hedge funds told a new york court that porsche committed securities fraud by leading investors to believe it was only seeking a 51-percent stake in vw .
porsche 's defense team is due to file a petition to dismiss the lawsuit on wednesday , according to german media .
analysts expect porsche to argue that it was only required to publicly disclose its takeover plans once they were approved by the board - and that that had not been the case prior to october 26 , 2008 .
the hedge funds ' claims may be helped by the fact that german prosecutors in the city of stuttgart are also examining claims that porsche managers manipulated the markets .
investigators are trying to establish whether former porsche chief wendelin wiedeking and his financial director holger haerter influenced stock prices by passing on insider information or misleading investors about the porsche 's plans to increase its stake in vw .
the american plaintiffs will have to be patient if they want to rely on evidence from germany , however .
the stuttgart prosecutors ' preliminary findings are n't due to be released until the end of 2010 or early 2011 .

public prosecutors in stuttgart are investigating too . traders and hedge fund managers hate the weekends because they ca n't take react immediately to corporate announcements until trading floors reopen on monday .
sunday , october 26 , 2008 was a particularly bad day for 35 american hedge funds .
that was the day german sports carmaker porsche announced that it owned 42.6 percent of volkswagen 's common stock and options for another 31.5 percent - bringing its total stake in the company to 74.1 percent .
the announcement then declared porsche was seeking to obtain 75 percent of vw shares - a plan that eventually backfired .
the following morning saw a frenzy of trading activity .
hedge fund managers had long been betting that the price of vw stock would fall .
the financial crisis caused demand for cars to fall in the us , driving down american automakers ' share prices .
they figured it was only a matter of time until german carmakers suffered a similar fate .
as a result , their funds were borrowing vw shares and selling them on in the hope they could buy them back later at a lower price - a speculative strategy known as short selling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us fund managers say wendelin wiedeking misled investors about his plans but porsche 's weekend announcement made it clear that fund managers had sold more than double the number of vw shares actually available on the market .
the news drove vw 's stock price up from 290 euros to 1,005 euros per share , making it the world 's most valuable company for a short period of time .
the financial times estimates that hedge funds lost about 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- in two days of trading as a result .
transatlatic battle now the funds want porsche to pay them more than 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2 billion -rrb- in damages .
lawyers representing the hedge funds told a new york court that porsche committed securities fraud by leading investors to believe it was only seeking a 51-percent stake in vw .
porsche 's defense team is due to file a petition to dismiss the lawsuit on wednesday , according to german media .
analysts expect porsche to argue that it was only required to publicly disclose its takeover plans once they were approved by the board - and that that had not been the case prior to october 26 , 2008 .
the hedge funds ' claims may be helped by the fact that german prosecutors in the city of stuttgart are also examining claims that porsche managers manipulated the markets .
investigators are trying to establish whether former porsche chief wendelin wiedeking and his financial director holger haerter influenced stock prices by passing on insider information or misleading investors about the porsche 's plans to increase its stake in vw .
the american plaintiffs will have to be patient if they want to rely on evidence from germany , however .
the stuttgart prosecutors ' preliminary findings are n't due to be released until the end of 2010 or early 2011 .

the pakistani ngo akhuwat pakistan has launched an innovative plan to help flood victims in southern punjab stand on their own feet as soon as possible .
under the plan by akhuwat pakistan , flood-affected families are to receive microcredits in order to create employment opportunities for them .
the interest-free loans will come without difficult conditions attached .
the organisation 's executive director amjad saqib explains : " look , whatever is happening right now is relief work .

so whereas we from akhuwat have been continuously engaged in relief work in the field , within two months we want to shift our focus on one of the worst-affected areas , rajanpur district .

an alternative approach to microcredit akhuwat means " brotherhood " in arabic .
the organisation 's philosophy of providing loan-free microcredit is inspired by islamic teaching which prohibits the charging of interest , but it equally provides loans to non-muslims , such as members of the christian minority , relying on the local mosque and church infrastructure . akhuwat , which has been working in pakistan for more than nine years and claims a recovery rate for its loans of almost 100 per cent , is an interesting exception among the growing number of micro-finance institutions worldwide .
recently , criticism has grown of these microcredit groups , as many have been demanding high interest rates , which can become a problem for those who accept their loans .
some development experts have pointed to the akhuwat model , funded by charitable donations and charging no interest at all , as an alternative way .
for pakistani flood victims , it definitely comes as a welcome support in this time of crisis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de festivals -pipe- 30.08.2010 bayreuth festival closes with tribute to director schlingensief großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the curtain has been drawn on the green hill until next summer the bayreuth festival is bound with tradition and founder richard wagner 's vision for the event .
but it closed this year with a tribute to festival innovator christoph schlingensief and a glimpse of changes to come . the 99th richard wagner festival in bayreuth closed sunday with a performance of wagner 's opera " the mastersingers of nuremberg . " the performance was dedicated to the provocative german film and theater director christoph schlingensief , who staged " parsifal " at the 2004 festival .
his production shocked some fans and was credited with bringing a new impulse to bayreuth .
schlingensief died of lung cancer on august 21 . composer richard wagner founded the bayreuth festival 134 years ago .
since then , his works - 10 operas - have been the sole basis for festival performances .
this fact alone makes it clear how important tradition is in bayreuth . tradition and renewal however , some signs point to change following the era of long-time festival director wolfgang wagner , who died early in 2010 .
his daughters and successors , eva wagner-pasquier and katharina wagner , have exhibited both openness and savvy in taking over direction of the festival . in 2010 , the festival continued its media push by offering public viewings and livestreams of selected performances .
on august 21 , 20,000 viewers came to watch " the valkyrie " transmitted live from the festspielhaus to a big screen at a market square in bayreuth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wager-pasquier assured audiences that wagner 's operas will not be upstaged according to a survey , 70 percent of the guests had never attended a wagner opera .
while visitors ate sausage , beer and pretzels , they could follow the performance featuring close-ups and subtitles .
the opera was also streamed live online and broadcast on japanese television .
the concept will continue next year with german broadcasters presenting " lohengrin " live from the festival . " wagner for kids " has also established itself as part of the event in bayreuth .
in the project 's second year , " tannhaeuser " was performed in a 70 minute kid-friendly version , targeted at six-to-12-year-olds .
the children followed the opera with great interest , and the crowd 's favorite was clearly love goddess venus , who sported a punk outfit and a skateboard . the beginning of the 2010 season also brought the announcement that an independent commission will receive complete access to the wagner house archives in order to examine the role of the festival during the third reich .
but at least one element is not up for discussion . " it 's certain that no other composer will be presented here , " said co-director eva wagner-pasquier .
" we will of course uphold the vision of the foundation and wagner house as well as the festival concept itself . " a shock for conservatives those who want to attend the bayreuth festival generally have to prepare for a long wait .
this year brought 408,000 ticket requests from 80 countries for the just 54,000 available seats .
it 's regarded as a privilege to be in bayreuth , even for the employees , who often had to work for low pay in previous years . changing attitudes toward compensation also mark the beginning of a new era for the festival .
following a salary dispute with stage workers last year , ticket prices had to be raised .
stage workers also succeeded in lobbying for mandatory breaks , which led to a new playing schedule this season .
this time , the four operas in the ring cycle - " the rheingold , " " the valkyrie , " " siegfried , " and " twilight of the gods " - were n't played consecutively .
that may not seem like a monumental change , but it would have been nearly unimaginable under wolfgang wagner 's direction and runs counter to the intentions of festival father richard wagner . many conservative wagnerians belong to the society of friends of bayreuth , an organization founded in 1949 by wolfgang wagner that since its inception has contributed more than 55 million euros -lrb- $ 70 million -rrb- to the festival .
following his death , the organization became a festival shareholder with the right to help make decisions related to the event .
disagreements and even public disputes have since erupted between the society and the festival leadership , which has strongly backed a newly-founded fundraising organization called the team of active festival supporters . a year of beautiful voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tenor lance ryan garnered praise this year in his bayreuth debut as siegfried in their second year heading the festival , wagner 's great-granddaughters katharina wagner and eva wagner-pasquier were able to fill the operas ' ranks with better singers than in recent decades .
the much-anticipated debuts included jonas kaufmann as lohengrin , james rutherford as hans sachs , johan botha as siegmund and lance ryan as siegfried .
ryan , a tenor from canada , has been hailed as unsurpassed in the role . 2010 was the last year of the " ring " production with director tankred dorst and conductor christian thielemann .
next year , thielemann will not conduct the orchestra but still be heavily involved with the event .
as musical advisor to the festival , he will have a say in who takes the bayreuth stage as a vocalist or conductor . looking ahead the 100th richard wagner festival next year will feature a new production of " tannhaeuser " directed by sebastian baumgarten and with thomas hengelbrock as conductor .
2013 will also bring a new staging of wagner 's masterpiece , " the ring of the nibelung , " to mark the composer 's 200th birthday .
the stage director for that production has yet to be announced , but kirill petrenko of russia is set to conduct the orchestra .
plans are also underway to debut three of wagner 's early operas in bayreuth -lrb- " the fairies , " " the ban on love " and " rienzi " -rrb- , not in the festival hall but in a tent elsewhere in the town . katharina wagner said her aim is to bring bayreuth " eventually to the absolute cutting edge of wagner productions .

but it closed this year with a tribute to festival innovator christoph schlingensief and a glimpse of changes to come . the 99th richard wagner festival in bayreuth closed sunday with a performance of wagner 's opera " the mastersingers of nuremberg . " the performance was dedicated to the provocative german film and theater director christoph schlingensief , who staged " parsifal " at the 2004 festival .
his production shocked some fans and was credited with bringing a new impulse to bayreuth .
schlingensief died of lung cancer on august 21 . composer richard wagner founded the bayreuth festival 134 years ago .
since then , his works - 10 operas - have been the sole basis for festival performances .
this fact alone makes it clear how important tradition is in bayreuth . tradition and renewal however , some signs point to change following the era of long-time festival director wolfgang wagner , who died early in 2010 .
his daughters and successors , eva wagner-pasquier and katharina wagner , have exhibited both openness and savvy in taking over direction of the festival . in 2010 , the festival continued its media push by offering public viewings and livestreams of selected performances .
on august 21 , 20,000 viewers came to watch " the valkyrie " transmitted live from the festspielhaus to a big screen at a market square in bayreuth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wager-pasquier assured audiences that wagner 's operas will not be upstaged according to a survey , 70 percent of the guests had never attended a wagner opera .
while visitors ate sausage , beer and pretzels , they could follow the performance featuring close-ups and subtitles .
the opera was also streamed live online and broadcast on japanese television .
the concept will continue next year with german broadcasters presenting " lohengrin " live from the festival . " wagner for kids " has also established itself as part of the event in bayreuth .
in the project 's second year , " tannhaeuser " was performed in a 70 minute kid-friendly version , targeted at six-to-12-year-olds .
the children followed the opera with great interest , and the crowd 's favorite was clearly love goddess venus , who sported a punk outfit and a skateboard . the beginning of the 2010 season also brought the announcement that an independent commission will receive complete access to the wagner house archives in order to examine the role of the festival during the third reich .
but at least one element is not up for discussion . " it 's certain that no other composer will be presented here , " said co-director eva wagner-pasquier .
" we will of course uphold the vision of the foundation and wagner house as well as the festival concept itself . " a shock for conservatives those who want to attend the bayreuth festival generally have to prepare for a long wait .
this year brought 408,000 ticket requests from 80 countries for the just 54,000 available seats .
it 's regarded as a privilege to be in bayreuth , even for the employees , who often had to work for low pay in previous years . changing attitudes toward compensation also mark the beginning of a new era for the festival .
following a salary dispute with stage workers last year , ticket prices had to be raised .
stage workers also succeeded in lobbying for mandatory breaks , which led to a new playing schedule this season .
this time , the four operas in the ring cycle - " the rheingold , " " the valkyrie , " " siegfried , " and " twilight of the gods " - were n't played consecutively .
that may not seem like a monumental change , but it would have been nearly unimaginable under wolfgang wagner 's direction and runs counter to the intentions of festival father richard wagner . many conservative wagnerians belong to the society of friends of bayreuth , an organization founded in 1949 by wolfgang wagner that since its inception has contributed more than 55 million euros -lrb- $ 70 million -rrb- to the festival .
following his death , the organization became a festival shareholder with the right to help make decisions related to the event .
disagreements and even public disputes have since erupted between the society and the festival leadership , which has strongly backed a newly-founded fundraising organization called the team of active festival supporters . a year of beautiful voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tenor lance ryan garnered praise this year in his bayreuth debut as siegfried in their second year heading the festival , wagner 's great-granddaughters katharina wagner and eva wagner-pasquier were able to fill the operas ' ranks with better singers than in recent decades .
the much-anticipated debuts included jonas kaufmann as lohengrin , james rutherford as hans sachs , johan botha as siegmund and lance ryan as siegfried .
ryan , a tenor from canada , has been hailed as unsurpassed in the role . 2010 was the last year of the " ring " production with director tankred dorst and conductor christian thielemann .
next year , thielemann will not conduct the orchestra but still be heavily involved with the event .
as musical advisor to the festival , he will have a say in who takes the bayreuth stage as a vocalist or conductor . looking ahead the 100th richard wagner festival next year will feature a new production of " tannhaeuser " directed by sebastian baumgarten and with thomas hengelbrock as conductor .
2013 will also bring a new staging of wagner 's masterpiece , " the ring of the nibelung , " to mark the composer 's 200th birthday .
the stage director for that production has yet to be announced , but kirill petrenko of russia is set to conduct the orchestra .
plans are also underway to debut three of wagner 's early operas in bayreuth -lrb- " the fairies , " " the ban on love " and " rienzi " -rrb- , not in the festival hall but in a tent elsewhere in the town . katharina wagner said her aim is to bring bayreuth " eventually to the absolute cutting edge of wagner productions .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel paid a visit to several power plants over the last week ensuring energy supplies the chancellor , citing an independent consultants ' report published this week , said such a time frame would ensure germany 's energy needs are met as the country transitions to renewable energy sources .
energy prices would remain under control and goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions would be reached with an extra 10 to 15 years of nuclear power , merkel added . " i have to consider , as head of government , how we integrate safety as the overriding principle of nuclear energy , " she said . sigmar gabriel , head of the opposition social democratic party , criticized merkel 's decision . " the chancellor 's statement shows that the decision is n't based on a sustainable energy plan but the hard-nosed lobbying work done by nuclear power companies , " he told reporters on sunday . clean energy groups agree with the opposition and point out that using nuclear and renewable energy sources in tandem is not efficient . " renewable energies are feeding into the system in a flexible way , depending on weather conditions for example , " bjoern klusmann , director of germany 's renewable energy association told deutsche welle . " because of the priority given to renewables in the german grid , the conventional power stations , so coal and nuclear and other fossil power stations , have to react in a flexible way to the production from renewables .
nuclear energy is not as flexible as is needed for this future concept of renewable energy being the dominant part in our grid , " he explained . in a statement on friday , merkel said renewable energies should supply half of all energy needs by 2050 and that nuclear and coal power would continue until supplies could be met entirely by clean energy , a strategy that clean energy experts like klusmann say is a false economy . " eighty percent of german power supply is in the hands of four big companies ... what we need is more competition in the field of energy and we get that if we phase out nuclear and allow investors to install new production capacity , " klusmann said . as long as nuclear power is granted such a high standing in the market , he argues , investment in renewables will be low , especially since the government has announced funding cuts in some types of renewables . legal question the debate over extending the running time of germany 's nuclear plants has sparked a deep debate in the german parliament .
merkel said any extension would come in a form that circumvents germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat . however , doubts have been raised by the interior and justice ministries that an extension of more than 10 years could be illegal if it were not approved by the bundesrat , which is made up of the governments of germany 's 16 states . germany has 17 nuclear power plants , but it is not certain how many would be given extensions if one is granted . a poll published on friday found that 56 percent of germans are against keeping nuclear power plants beyond 2021 . author : matt zuvela , nicole goebel -lrb- reuters / dpa / afp -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu is preparing a strategy paper to secure a long-term supply of the increasingly necessary materials . it 's a little known fact that in order to stay in the technology manufacturing game , europe has to import some 40 rare metals and minerals .
it 's also a worrying fact because many of the materials used in the production of objects like cell phones and energy efficient lamps are either in limited supply or kept at artificially low levels by china . according to the eu commission , 14 of these rare earths , as they are called , are particularly scarce and are either only available in china or are mined for unrealistic prices elsewhere . while china is key to these materials finding their way to the world market , gwenole cozigou , the commission 's director for chemical , metals , forest-based and textile industries , is worried about the length of beijing 's arm . he said although negotiations with the chinese government over commodity trade are ongoing , foreign buyers are being forced to process rare earths into half-finished products on chinese soil . " china wants to build an industry and that is a perfectly acceptable goal , but if it violates trade regulations we will take action , " cozigou said .
in this case , that means teaming up with the united states and mexico to contact a world trade organization arbitration tribunal . taking on china hubertus bardt , raw materials expert from the institute for economic research in cologne , told deutsche welle it 's up to the eu to make sure china does not exploit its monopoly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tantal is used in micro-processors " one could threaten to impose import restrictions on chinese products , but nobody wants that and ultimately it would harm us , too , " he said .
" but there are always new trade talks and political discussions , and it 's important to use them to prioritize this problem . " it 's a problem which he said he believes will only get worse as fast-growing , emerging nations become ever more dependent upon technology . " there are a number of indications to suggest an increase in demand for these raw materials , " he said .
" firstly there is growth in china , then growth in india and brazil and then technical developments such as electromobility , solar panels and energy efficient lamps . " the role of developing countries besides entering into trade talks and exerting political pressure to secure itself a supply of rare earths , the eu is also keen to work in close cooperation with other developing countries known to have reserves of the raw materials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the democratic republic of congo has deposits of coltan the bloc has already begun negotiations with the african union , but is not , cozigou stressed , offering development aid in return for rare earths . " african countries have to realize that the extraction of raw materials at a fair price is advantageous for their own advancement , " he said , adding that it was the only way to attract potential european investors . but bardt said there is a place for development aid if it helps countries with reserves to establish the kind of market systems and institutions which would ultimately be of benefit to europe . time to recycle according to the eu 's observations , beijing secures entry to the coveted raw materials through the aggressive acquisition of foreign mining companies and land and by making donations to the relevant regimes .
experts say it is a problem , not least because there are very few rare earth mining companies left around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old phones should be recycled to recover reusable materials - not binned that being the case , the european union is supporting scientists looking for rare earths and is pushing for more recycling of raw materials from old mobile phones , televisions and cars . " we have our own mines in our cities across europe , " cozigou said , adding that the eu is currently working towards tightening regulations governing the export of electronic scrap and car wrecks .
" the eu wants what has previously been considered electronic garbage to be deemed valuable raw materials . " autor : bernd riegert / tkw editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i have to consider , as head of government , how we integrate safety as the overriding principle of nuclear energy , " she said . sigmar gabriel , head of the opposition social democratic party , criticized merkel 's decision . " the chancellor 's statement shows that the decision is n't based on a sustainable energy plan but the hard-nosed lobbying work done by nuclear power companies , " he told reporters on sunday . clean energy groups agree with the opposition and point out that using nuclear and renewable energy sources in tandem is not efficient .

" because of the priority given to renewables in the german grid , the conventional power stations , so coal and nuclear and other fossil power stations , have to react in a flexible way to the production from renewables .
nuclear energy is not as flexible as is needed for this future concept of renewable energy being the dominant part in our grid , " he explained . in a statement on friday , merkel said renewable energies should supply half of all energy needs by 2050 and that nuclear and coal power would continue until supplies could be met entirely by clean energy , a strategy that clean energy experts like klusmann say is a false economy . " eighty percent of german power supply is in the hands of four big companies ... what we need is more competition in the field of energy and we get that if we phase out nuclear and allow investors to install new production capacity , " klusmann said . as long as nuclear power is granted such a high standing in the market , he argues , investment in renewables will be low , especially since the government has announced funding cuts in some types of renewables . legal question the debate over extending the running time of germany 's nuclear plants has sparked a deep debate in the german parliament .
merkel said any extension would come in a form that circumvents germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat . however , doubts have been raised by the interior and justice ministries that an extension of more than 10 years could be illegal if it were not approved by the bundesrat , which is made up of the governments of germany 's 16 states . germany has 17 nuclear power plants , but it is not certain how many would be given extensions if one is granted . a poll published on friday found that 56 percent of germans are against keeping nuclear power plants beyond 2021 . author : matt zuvela , nicole goebel -lrb- reuters / dpa / afp -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

socialist leader elio di rupo has offered to step down , saying he could not reconcile deep political differences . belgium 's french-speaking socialist party leader elio di rupo has been told he must press ahead with talks to form a new government , 10 weeks after parliamentary elections failed to produce a clear winner .
di rupo visited the palace of monarch king albert ii on sunday to offer his resignation after failing to build a working coalition government .
the pair were in discussion for three hours , a palace statement said .
" the king refused and asked him -lsb- di rupo -rsb- to pursue his mission , " the statement read , and di rupo had " accepted " the task .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the dispute is over funding to brussels a marathon 10 hours of crisis talks broke up without a deal earlier on sunday , with di rupo telling reporters there was no agreement between his party and two flemish parties - the nationalist n-va and the center-right christian democrats .
di rupo added that the sides were " incompatible . "
linguistic and economic divide parliamentary elections in june led to the deadlock , with neither the parties from dutch-speaking flanders nor center-left parties from french-speaking wallonia winning an outright majority .
di rupo has been tasked with balancing flemish demands for more powers for flanders and the concerns of french speakers , who worry that their less-prosperous region will lose out in any devolution process .
another major point of division between the two sides is over government finances for the officially-bilingual capital of brussels .
the failure to establish a government is widely viewed as an embarrassment for belgium , which currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu .

deutsche welle spoke with coach marco kurz about the embattled club 's change of fortune . when marco kurz took over kaiserslautern in summer 2009 , the red devils ' situation was truly diabolical .
the former league champions had been reduced to battling against relegation from the second division - a consequence of poor investments and financial difficulties in the early years of the millennium . the club was also running through coaches at the rate of one roughly every 12 months . fast forward a little over a year to the second round of the 2010-11 season , and kaiserslautern are not just back in the top flight , but have beaten bayern munich . lautern 's 2-0 win over the reigning champs on friday was more about perspiration than inspiration .
the red devils stymied bayern with tight defending in midfield , and their thrusts forward were incisive enough to exploit lapses in concentration by munich . " we knew that this was a good time to play bayern munich , " kurz told deutsche welle after the victory .
" our opponents had a lot of national team players in their ranks who had n't yet gotten into the rhythm of practices .
we hoped that would give us a physical advantage . " kaiserslautern played physically against the champions , without a doubt .
but there was more to their game than just kicking their opponents ' shins . and while kurz remains modest , a lot of credit for their performance has to go to their coach . stay cool and read the rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mood has n't been this good at lautern since the 1990s in his playing career as a defender , kurz had the opportunity to work with and learn from some excellent coaches .
in 1994-5 , he was part of the borussia dortmund side that won the bundesliga under coach ottmar hitzfeld .
and two years later , he won the uefa cup with schalke under coach huub stevens . both hitzfeld and stevens are coaches who stress tactical discipline , and that quality seems to have rubbed off on kurz . " i had coaches with whom we trained really hard and i noticed , ' wow , physical fitness is definitely the basis for successful football , " ' kurz said .
" we had unbelievable discipline under huub stevens , especially in his treatment of the team .
i learned that footballers need that .
footballers need hard and fast rules . " those rules are not just about behavior , but what players do on the pitch . " the players have clear instructions in matches how they are to play their positions , " kurz said .
" the individual parts of the team - defense , midfield and attack - receive clear instructions , and you hope they work as a collective .
there 's no one on the pitch without instructions and a plan . " but the skill has to be there for players to execute the coach 's plan .
and this kaiserslautern squad features a very particular collection of skills . bildunterschrift : striker srdjan lakic is one of lautern 's new , inexpensive stars the cast-off crew kaiserslautern used to be a breeding ground for german talent - club alumni include andy brehme , miroslav klose and michael ballack .
those days are long gone .
of the current starting 11 , only goalkeeper tobias sippel is a homegrown product . instead , kaiserslautern have built their squad around eastern european players and underrated castoffs from other clubs .

" in terms of the makeup of the squad , we chose players who have reason to be hungry , who have to show they 're good enough for division one , " kurz said .
" we did without established veterans , because we wanted to say , ' look , the guys who got us promoted have the necessary quality . " ' bildunterschrift : the red devils are once again inspiring fear in foes kaiserslautern 's career revivalists have also reanimated crowds . with a home city of only around 100,000 inhabitants , kaiserslautern inhabit one of the smallest markets in the bundesliga .

the eu is preparing a strategy paper to secure a long-term supply of the increasingly necessary materials . it 's a little known fact that in order to stay in the technology manufacturing game , europe has to import some 40 rare metals and minerals .
it 's also a worrying fact because many of the materials used in the production of objects like cell phones and energy efficient lamps are either in limited supply or kept at artificially low levels by china . according to the eu commission , 14 of these rare earths , as they are called , are particularly scarce and are either only available in china or are mined for unrealistic prices elsewhere . while china is key to these materials finding their way to the world market , gwenole cozigou , the commission 's director for chemical , metals , forest-based and textile industries , is worried about the length of beijing 's arm . he said although negotiations with the chinese government over commodity trade are ongoing , foreign buyers are being forced to process rare earths into half-finished products on chinese soil .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : floods in pakistan very little support for flood victims in punjab german red cross brings clean water to pakistan pakistani volunteers bring relief to flood victims pakistani islamist groups very visible in the flood-affected regions finance -pipe- 30.08.2010 microcredit to support reconstruction after floods großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pakistani flood survivor rebuilds his house in nowshera there has been a slight improvement in the flood situation in pakistan .
the southern city of thatta has apparently been saved from being inundated , and many citizens who fled earlier are returning there . slowly , the focus is turning to the giant task of rebuilding the devastated areas .
the pakistani ngo akhuwat pakistan has launched an innovative plan to help flood victims in southern punjab stand on their own feet as soon as possible .
under the plan by akhuwat pakistan , flood-affected families are to receive microcredits in order to create employment opportunities for them .
the interest-free loans will come without difficult conditions attached .
the organisation 's executive director amjad saqib explains : " look , whatever is happening right now is relief work .
people need food , shelter , medicine . "
but this relief work will be over in one or two months , he adds . bildunterschrift : a boy receives food at a camp on the outskirt of sukkur in southern pakistan " and then the real challenge will come up - how to rehabilitate all these people !
how can they stand on their own feet again ?
so whereas we from akhuwat have been continuously engaged in relief work in the field , within two months we want to shift our focus on one of the worst-affected areas , rajanpur district .
our preparation , fund raising and resource mobilisation are going well , and god willing we 'll select 10,000 badly affected families and provide them with interest-free loans , thus enabling them to re-start the businesses they 've had to abandon due to this flood . "
rebuilding small businesses the flood victims will get between 10,000 and 30,000 rupees -lrb- between 92 and 276 euros -rrb- per family as an interest-free loan .
no security or documents are required , nor will there be any service charges .
according to izhar hashmi , director of akhuwat pakistan , the recipients will be able to buy seeds or raise goats or cattle with the money .
they might also open a small shop in their village or buy a donkey cart and start a transport business .
with the income generated , they 'll have to repay the loans within 30 months .
the money will then be free to be distributed again to other needy persons .
akhuwat plans to raise 150 million rupees -lrb- almost 1.4 million euros -rrb- in donations from pakistanis for the program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crossing a flooded road in punjab province on monday " we wo n't turn pakistanis into beggars , " says amjad saqib , " but want to harness their potential to work hard for a better future .
they 'll rise up on their own and stand on their own feet again . "
an alternative approach to microcredit akhuwat means " brotherhood " in arabic .
the organisation 's philosophy of providing loan-free microcredit is inspired by islamic teaching which prohibits the charging of interest , but it equally provides loans to non-muslims , such as members of the christian minority , relying on the local mosque and church infrastructure . akhuwat , which has been working in pakistan for more than nine years and claims a recovery rate for its loans of almost 100 per cent , is an interesting exception among the growing number of micro-finance institutions worldwide .
recently , criticism has grown of these microcredit groups , as many have been demanding high interest rates , which can become a problem for those who accept their loans .
some development experts have pointed to the akhuwat model , funded by charitable donations and charging no interest at all , as an alternative way .
for pakistani flood victims , it definitely comes as a welcome support in this time of crisis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 30.08.2010 us hedge funds sue porsche großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche 's attempt to acquire vw is still under investigation us hedge funds are taking legal action against porsche in a new york court for allegedly manipulating stock prices during its 2008 takeover tangle with volkswagen .
public prosecutors in stuttgart are investigating too . traders and hedge fund managers hate the weekends because they ca n't take react immediately to corporate announcements until trading floors reopen on monday .
sunday , october 26 , 2008 was a particularly bad day for 35 american hedge funds .
that was the day german sports carmaker porsche announced that it owned 42.6 percent of volkswagen 's common stock and options for another 31.5 percent - bringing its total stake in the company to 74.1 percent .
the announcement then declared porsche was seeking to obtain 75 percent of vw shares - a plan that eventually backfired .
the following morning saw a frenzy of trading activity .
hedge fund managers had long been betting that the price of vw stock would fall .
the financial crisis caused demand for cars to fall in the us , driving down american automakers ' share prices .
they figured it was only a matter of time until german carmakers suffered a similar fate .
as a result , their funds were borrowing vw shares and selling them on in the hope they could buy them back later at a lower price - a speculative strategy known as short selling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us fund managers say wendelin wiedeking misled investors about his plans but porsche 's weekend announcement made it clear that fund managers had sold more than double the number of vw shares actually available on the market .
the news drove vw 's stock price up from 290 euros to 1,005 euros per share , making it the world 's most valuable company for a short period of time .
the financial times estimates that hedge funds lost about 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- in two days of trading as a result .
transatlatic battle now the funds want porsche to pay them more than 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2 billion -rrb- in damages .
lawyers representing the hedge funds told a new york court that porsche committed securities fraud by leading investors to believe it was only seeking a 51-percent stake in vw .
porsche 's defense team is due to file a petition to dismiss the lawsuit on wednesday , according to german media .
analysts expect porsche to argue that it was only required to publicly disclose its takeover plans once they were approved by the board - and that that had not been the case prior to october 26 , 2008 .
the hedge funds ' claims may be helped by the fact that german prosecutors in the city of stuttgart are also examining claims that porsche managers manipulated the markets .
investigators are trying to establish whether former porsche chief wendelin wiedeking and his financial director holger haerter influenced stock prices by passing on insider information or misleading investors about the porsche 's plans to increase its stake in vw .
the american plaintiffs will have to be patient if they want to rely on evidence from germany , however .
the stuttgart prosecutors ' preliminary findings are n't due to be released until the end of 2010 or early 2011 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de publishing -pipe- 30.08.2010 internet killed the dictionary star großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the market for traditional dictionaries is disappearing , says the oed publisher falling sales and the growing popularity of online dictionaries mean the oxford english dictionary may never be printed again , its publisher says . for over two decades , dozens of writers have been working on a book that will probably never grace a bookshelf .
online dictionaries have gained so much popularity over their printed counterparts that the next edition of the oxford english dictionary will probably appear only in electronic form , according to its publisher , the oxford university press .
" the print dictionary market is just disappearing , it is falling away by tens of per cent a year , " nigel portwood , the chief executive of the oxford university press , told uk newspaper the sunday times .
he told the uk newspaper he did not think the third edition would be printed .
the second and most recent oed has existed online for more than a decade , where it receives two million hits a month from subscribers who pay an annual fee of almost 300 euros to access it .
a wider trend towards online simon winchester , author of the meaning of everything : the story of the oxford english dictionary , said the oxford university press 's move away from print editions of the dictionary " reflects an inevitability " and is part of a growing trend of readers moving away from printed books toward digital editions and electronic e-readers like the kindle or the ipad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dictionary-users are increasingly turning to the internet for their answers " i think the electronic book is going to achieve ascendancy over the printed book , and i think that the printed book is just starting now to vanish , " winchester said .
though he owns three sets of the printed version of the oxford english dictionary , he said he relies on the digital version .
" on my ipad , i 've used the oed twice if not three times today .
but i never ever go to the hardback version .
it sits there on the shelf gathering dust , looking beautiful , but i never use it . "
online dictionary keeps better pace the move away from printed dictionaries could also be helping to create a more accessible oed , and one that evolves better alongside the language that it documents , said charlotte brewer , professor of english language and literature at oxford university and author of treasure-house of the language : the living oed .
" when the first dictionaries were produced in the victorian period , the edwardian period in the uk , there were all sorts of assumptions about what was proper to go into a dictionary – so words to do with sex , and the body , sometimes did n't get in or sometimes were defined in a way that we would regard as inadequate , " she said .
many of the quotations used in older editions of the oed were drawn from historical and literary sources .
now , brewer said , " the lexicographers can use the web , they can use google , they have access to an enormous variety of language online , they can instantly access a far broader range of sources .
in this way … it 's likely to become more democratic . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet offers lexicographers a broader range of sources to draw upon an ' absolutely enormous ' undertaking almost one third of a million entries were contained in the second version of the oed , published in hard copy in 1989 .
since then , a team of 80 lexicographers have been working on the third edition , though they have completed only 28 percent of the dictionary .
" we 're talking about an absolutely enormous amount of data , which in its last printed form occupied 20 volumes , " brewer said .
she said the third edition of the dictionary would likely be even larger .
" i think the point is that the cost of this work would be unbelievable - you know , you have to wonder who could possibly afford to buy it , " brewer said .
with the most recent edition weighing in at a hefty 62.9 kilos , an electronic version of edition three would not only be lighter on the hip pocket – it would also be easier on the back .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 30.08.2010 german hip-hop at the shanghai expo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hip-hoppers at the german pavilion in shanghai at the german expo pavilion in shanghai , one could easily see how hip-hop is transcending borders .
the pavilion called the " balancity " featured hip-hop during a month long program with graffiti , break-dance and music . hip-hop beats echoing around the area in front of the german pavilion have been attracting scores of young chinese people .
they are excited and sing along loudly with the artists .
" it is different here in comparison to berlin , " says rafael schall from berlin , who is blown away by the response .
" here you can really get the people high on music , dance with them on the stage and really go ballistic .
people really go crazy here . "
schall is one of 50 german hip-hop artists who have come to shangai to perform at the german pavilion .
together with 50 chinese hip-hop artists they have turned it into a laboratory of urban youth culture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanghai singer cha-cha says the project is " quite a cool thing " giving space to young people marion conrady , spokesperson of the german pavilion explains why germany has chosen to present itself at this world fair in this way .
" hip-hop is a youth culture , which can also be seen in cities represented in words through graffiti but also in the form of various performances .
with the help of our ' balancity ' pavilion at the shanghai expo , we are trying to show the versatility of a city .
and in a city , giving space to young people is as important as it is to provide space for high or elite culture . "
graffiti is important for hip-hoppers all over the world .
and one can also see this at the german pavilion .
at the graffiti corner there are not only huge pictures , but also graffiti t-shirts , umbrellas and bags for the visitors .
but in shanghai one hardly gets to see any graffiti .
stan wu works with the " invasion " magazine in hong kong .
he explains why so few walls are painted in shanghai .
" we first had the olympics and now we have the shanghai expo .
so the government and the city are trying to wipe out the whole country .
zero tolerance of ' dirty ' surface , you know .
so there is no chance that you will see a lot of graffiti in the city . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mc wesley from beijing in the ' balancity ' power of graffiti asia 's largest graffiti competition " wall lords finals 2010 " , which was held on sunday at the shanghai expo was also a part of the german hip-hop project .
it was initiated by akim walta from berlin , who has been active in the hip-hop scene there for almost 30 years .
walta talks about a graffiti project by german artists in shanghai .
" our boys also painted something for the residents here .
what was interesting was that they tried to come into contact with the locals .
and suddenly the sad grey street became colorful , with some connection to the locals .
and in the course of time there was some problem and we were asked to remove the graffiti .
but then , little children and families stood up for us and said that we had come from a far away land and the graffiti was a gift for them .
they said it was their picture and they did not want it to be removed . "
walta has been to china many times and has been involved in various graffiti projects .
he hopes that the hip-hop project at the shanghai expo is not the last one .

public prosecutors in stuttgart are investigating too . traders and hedge fund managers hate the weekends because they ca n't take react immediately to corporate announcements until trading floors reopen on monday .
sunday , october 26 , 2008 was a particularly bad day for 35 american hedge funds .
that was the day german sports carmaker porsche announced that it owned 42.6 percent of volkswagen 's common stock and options for another 31.5 percent - bringing its total stake in the company to 74.1 percent .
the announcement then declared porsche was seeking to obtain 75 percent of vw shares - a plan that eventually backfired .
the following morning saw a frenzy of trading activity .
hedge fund managers had long been betting that the price of vw stock would fall .
the financial crisis caused demand for cars to fall in the us , driving down american automakers ' share prices .
they figured it was only a matter of time until german carmakers suffered a similar fate .
as a result , their funds were borrowing vw shares and selling them on in the hope they could buy them back later at a lower price - a speculative strategy known as short selling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us fund managers say wendelin wiedeking misled investors about his plans but porsche 's weekend announcement made it clear that fund managers had sold more than double the number of vw shares actually available on the market .
the news drove vw 's stock price up from 290 euros to 1,005 euros per share , making it the world 's most valuable company for a short period of time .

lawyers representing the hedge funds told a new york court that porsche committed securities fraud by leading investors to believe it was only seeking a 51-percent stake in vw .
porsche 's defense team is due to file a petition to dismiss the lawsuit on wednesday , according to german media .
analysts expect porsche to argue that it was only required to publicly disclose its takeover plans once they were approved by the board - and that that had not been the case prior to october 26 , 2008 .
the hedge funds ' claims may be helped by the fact that german prosecutors in the city of stuttgart are also examining claims that porsche managers manipulated the markets .
investigators are trying to establish whether former porsche chief wendelin wiedeking and his financial director holger haerter influenced stock prices by passing on insider information or misleading investors about the porsche 's plans to increase its stake in vw .
the american plaintiffs will have to be patient if they want to rely on evidence from germany , however .
the stuttgart prosecutors ' preliminary findings are n't due to be released until the end of 2010 or early 2011 .

the pavilion called the " balancity " featured hip-hop during a month long program with graffiti , break-dance and music . hip-hop beats echoing around the area in front of the german pavilion have been attracting scores of young chinese people .
they are excited and sing along loudly with the artists .
" it is different here in comparison to berlin , " says rafael schall from berlin , who is blown away by the response .
" here you can really get the people high on music , dance with them on the stage and really go ballistic .
people really go crazy here . "
schall is one of 50 german hip-hop artists who have come to shangai to perform at the german pavilion .
together with 50 chinese hip-hop artists they have turned it into a laboratory of urban youth culture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanghai singer cha-cha says the project is " quite a cool thing " giving space to young people marion conrady , spokesperson of the german pavilion explains why germany has chosen to present itself at this world fair in this way .
" hip-hop is a youth culture , which can also be seen in cities represented in words through graffiti but also in the form of various performances .
with the help of our ' balancity ' pavilion at the shanghai expo , we are trying to show the versatility of a city .
and in a city , giving space to young people is as important as it is to provide space for high or elite culture . "
graffiti is important for hip-hoppers all over the world .
and one can also see this at the german pavilion .
at the graffiti corner there are not only huge pictures , but also graffiti t-shirts , umbrellas and bags for the visitors .
but in shanghai one hardly gets to see any graffiti .
stan wu works with the " invasion " magazine in hong kong .
he explains why so few walls are painted in shanghai .
" we first had the olympics and now we have the shanghai expo .
so the government and the city are trying to wipe out the whole country .
zero tolerance of ' dirty ' surface , you know .
so there is no chance that you will see a lot of graffiti in the city . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mc wesley from beijing in the ' balancity ' power of graffiti asia 's largest graffiti competition " wall lords finals 2010 " , which was held on sunday at the shanghai expo was also a part of the german hip-hop project .
it was initiated by akim walta from berlin , who has been active in the hip-hop scene there for almost 30 years .
walta talks about a graffiti project by german artists in shanghai .
" our boys also painted something for the residents here .
what was interesting was that they tried to come into contact with the locals .
and suddenly the sad grey street became colorful , with some connection to the locals .
and in the course of time there was some problem and we were asked to remove the graffiti .
but then , little children and families stood up for us and said that we had come from a far away land and the graffiti was a gift for them .
they said it was their picture and they did not want it to be removed . "
walta has been to china many times and has been involved in various graffiti projects .
he hopes that the hip-hop project at the shanghai expo is not the last one .

but it closed this year with a tribute to festival innovator christoph schlingensief and a glimpse of changes to come . the 99th richard wagner festival in bayreuth closed sunday with a performance of wagner 's opera " the mastersingers of nuremberg . " the performance was dedicated to the provocative german film and theater director christoph schlingensief , who staged " parsifal " at the 2004 festival .
his production shocked some fans and was credited with bringing a new impulse to bayreuth .
schlingensief died of lung cancer on august 21 . composer richard wagner founded the bayreuth festival 134 years ago .
since then , his works - 10 operas - have been the sole basis for festival performances .
this fact alone makes it clear how important tradition is in bayreuth . tradition and renewal however , some signs point to change following the era of long-time festival director wolfgang wagner , who died early in 2010 .
his daughters and successors , eva wagner-pasquier and katharina wagner , have exhibited both openness and savvy in taking over direction of the festival . in 2010 , the festival continued its media push by offering public viewings and livestreams of selected performances .
on august 21 , 20,000 viewers came to watch " the valkyrie " transmitted live from the festspielhaus to a big screen at a market square in bayreuth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wager-pasquier assured audiences that wagner 's operas will not be upstaged according to a survey , 70 percent of the guests had never attended a wagner opera .
while visitors ate sausage , beer and pretzels , they could follow the performance featuring close-ups and subtitles .
the opera was also streamed live online and broadcast on japanese television .
the concept will continue next year with german broadcasters presenting " lohengrin " live from the festival . " wagner for kids " has also established itself as part of the event in bayreuth .
in the project 's second year , " tannhaeuser " was performed in a 70 minute kid-friendly version , targeted at six-to-12-year-olds .
the children followed the opera with great interest , and the crowd 's favorite was clearly love goddess venus , who sported a punk outfit and a skateboard . the beginning of the 2010 season also brought the announcement that an independent commission will receive complete access to the wagner house archives in order to examine the role of the festival during the third reich .
but at least one element is not up for discussion . " it 's certain that no other composer will be presented here , " said co-director eva wagner-pasquier .
" we will of course uphold the vision of the foundation and wagner house as well as the festival concept itself . " a shock for conservatives those who want to attend the bayreuth festival generally have to prepare for a long wait .
this year brought 408,000 ticket requests from 80 countries for the just 54,000 available seats .
it 's regarded as a privilege to be in bayreuth , even for the employees , who often had to work for low pay in previous years . changing attitudes toward compensation also mark the beginning of a new era for the festival .
following a salary dispute with stage workers last year , ticket prices had to be raised .
stage workers also succeeded in lobbying for mandatory breaks , which led to a new playing schedule this season .
this time , the four operas in the ring cycle - " the rheingold , " " the valkyrie , " " siegfried , " and " twilight of the gods " - were n't played consecutively .
that may not seem like a monumental change , but it would have been nearly unimaginable under wolfgang wagner 's direction and runs counter to the intentions of festival father richard wagner . many conservative wagnerians belong to the society of friends of bayreuth , an organization founded in 1949 by wolfgang wagner that since its inception has contributed more than 55 million euros -lrb- $ 70 million -rrb- to the festival .
following his death , the organization became a festival shareholder with the right to help make decisions related to the event .

the much-anticipated debuts included jonas kaufmann as lohengrin , james rutherford as hans sachs , johan botha as siegmund and lance ryan as siegfried .
ryan , a tenor from canada , has been hailed as unsurpassed in the role . 2010 was the last year of the " ring " production with director tankred dorst and conductor christian thielemann .
next year , thielemann will not conduct the orchestra but still be heavily involved with the event .
as musical advisor to the festival , he will have a say in who takes the bayreuth stage as a vocalist or conductor . looking ahead the 100th richard wagner festival next year will feature a new production of " tannhaeuser " directed by sebastian baumgarten and with thomas hengelbrock as conductor .
2013 will also bring a new staging of wagner 's masterpiece , " the ring of the nibelung , " to mark the composer 's 200th birthday .
the stage director for that production has yet to be announced , but kirill petrenko of russia is set to conduct the orchestra .
plans are also underway to debut three of wagner 's early operas in bayreuth -lrb- " the fairies , " " the ban on love " and " rienzi " -rrb- , not in the festival hall but in a tent elsewhere in the town . katharina wagner said her aim is to bring bayreuth " eventually to the absolute cutting edge of wagner productions .

online dictionaries have gained so much popularity over their printed counterparts that the next edition of the oxford english dictionary will probably appear only in electronic form , according to its publisher , the oxford university press .
" the print dictionary market is just disappearing , it is falling away by tens of per cent a year , " nigel portwood , the chief executive of the oxford university press , told uk newspaper the sunday times .
he told the uk newspaper he did not think the third edition would be printed .
the second and most recent oed has existed online for more than a decade , where it receives two million hits a month from subscribers who pay an annual fee of almost 300 euros to access it .
a wider trend towards online simon winchester , author of the meaning of everything : the story of the oxford english dictionary , said the oxford university press 's move away from print editions of the dictionary " reflects an inevitability " and is part of a growing trend of readers moving away from printed books toward digital editions and electronic e-readers like the kindle or the ipad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dictionary-users are increasingly turning to the internet for their answers " i think the electronic book is going to achieve ascendancy over the printed book , and i think that the printed book is just starting now to vanish , " winchester said .
though he owns three sets of the printed version of the oxford english dictionary , he said he relies on the digital version .
" on my ipad , i 've used the oed twice if not three times today .
but i never ever go to the hardback version .
it sits there on the shelf gathering dust , looking beautiful , but i never use it . "
online dictionary keeps better pace the move away from printed dictionaries could also be helping to create a more accessible oed , and one that evolves better alongside the language that it documents , said charlotte brewer , professor of english language and literature at oxford university and author of treasure-house of the language : the living oed .
" when the first dictionaries were produced in the victorian period , the edwardian period in the uk , there were all sorts of assumptions about what was proper to go into a dictionary – so words to do with sex , and the body , sometimes did n't get in or sometimes were defined in a way that we would regard as inadequate , " she said .
many of the quotations used in older editions of the oed were drawn from historical and literary sources .
now , brewer said , " the lexicographers can use the web , they can use google , they have access to an enormous variety of language online , they can instantly access a far broader range of sources .
in this way … it 's likely to become more democratic . "

he decided to remain in the job , saying that leaving amounted to ' deserting . '
" i asked myself whether i should resign , kouchner said .

the southern city of thatta has apparently been saved from being inundated , and many citizens who fled earlier are returning there . slowly , the focus is turning to the giant task of rebuilding the devastated areas .
the pakistani ngo akhuwat pakistan has launched an innovative plan to help flood victims in southern punjab stand on their own feet as soon as possible .
under the plan by akhuwat pakistan , flood-affected families are to receive microcredits in order to create employment opportunities for them .
the interest-free loans will come without difficult conditions attached .
the organisation 's executive director amjad saqib explains : " look , whatever is happening right now is relief work .
people need food , shelter , medicine . "
but this relief work will be over in one or two months , he adds . bildunterschrift : a boy receives food at a camp on the outskirt of sukkur in southern pakistan " and then the real challenge will come up - how to rehabilitate all these people !
how can they stand on their own feet again ?
so whereas we from akhuwat have been continuously engaged in relief work in the field , within two months we want to shift our focus on one of the worst-affected areas , rajanpur district .
our preparation , fund raising and resource mobilisation are going well , and god willing we 'll select 10,000 badly affected families and provide them with interest-free loans , thus enabling them to re-start the businesses they 've had to abandon due to this flood . "
rebuilding small businesses the flood victims will get between 10,000 and 30,000 rupees -lrb- between 92 and 276 euros -rrb- per family as an interest-free loan .
no security or documents are required , nor will there be any service charges .
according to izhar hashmi , director of akhuwat pakistan , the recipients will be able to buy seeds or raise goats or cattle with the money .
they might also open a small shop in their village or buy a donkey cart and start a transport business .
with the income generated , they 'll have to repay the loans within 30 months .
the money will then be free to be distributed again to other needy persons .
akhuwat plans to raise 150 million rupees -lrb- almost 1.4 million euros -rrb- in donations from pakistanis for the program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crossing a flooded road in punjab province on monday " we wo n't turn pakistanis into beggars , " says amjad saqib , " but want to harness their potential to work hard for a better future .
they 'll rise up on their own and stand on their own feet again . "
an alternative approach to microcredit akhuwat means " brotherhood " in arabic .
the organisation 's philosophy of providing loan-free microcredit is inspired by islamic teaching which prohibits the charging of interest , but it equally provides loans to non-muslims , such as members of the christian minority , relying on the local mosque and church infrastructure . akhuwat , which has been working in pakistan for more than nine years and claims a recovery rate for its loans of almost 100 per cent , is an interesting exception among the growing number of micro-finance institutions worldwide .
recently , criticism has grown of these microcredit groups , as many have been demanding high interest rates , which can become a problem for those who accept their loans .
some development experts have pointed to the akhuwat model , funded by charitable donations and charging no interest at all , as an alternative way .
for pakistani flood victims , it definitely comes as a welcome support in this time of crisis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de publishing -pipe- 30.08.2010 internet killed the dictionary star großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the market for traditional dictionaries is disappearing , says the oed publisher falling sales and the growing popularity of online dictionaries mean the oxford english dictionary may never be printed again , its publisher says . for over two decades , dozens of writers have been working on a book that will probably never grace a bookshelf .
online dictionaries have gained so much popularity over their printed counterparts that the next edition of the oxford english dictionary will probably appear only in electronic form , according to its publisher , the oxford university press .
" the print dictionary market is just disappearing , it is falling away by tens of per cent a year , " nigel portwood , the chief executive of the oxford university press , told uk newspaper the sunday times .
he told the uk newspaper he did not think the third edition would be printed .
the second and most recent oed has existed online for more than a decade , where it receives two million hits a month from subscribers who pay an annual fee of almost 300 euros to access it .
a wider trend towards online simon winchester , author of the meaning of everything : the story of the oxford english dictionary , said the oxford university press 's move away from print editions of the dictionary " reflects an inevitability " and is part of a growing trend of readers moving away from printed books toward digital editions and electronic e-readers like the kindle or the ipad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dictionary-users are increasingly turning to the internet for their answers " i think the electronic book is going to achieve ascendancy over the printed book , and i think that the printed book is just starting now to vanish , " winchester said .
though he owns three sets of the printed version of the oxford english dictionary , he said he relies on the digital version .
" on my ipad , i 've used the oed twice if not three times today .
but i never ever go to the hardback version .
it sits there on the shelf gathering dust , looking beautiful , but i never use it . "
online dictionary keeps better pace the move away from printed dictionaries could also be helping to create a more accessible oed , and one that evolves better alongside the language that it documents , said charlotte brewer , professor of english language and literature at oxford university and author of treasure-house of the language : the living oed .
" when the first dictionaries were produced in the victorian period , the edwardian period in the uk , there were all sorts of assumptions about what was proper to go into a dictionary – so words to do with sex , and the body , sometimes did n't get in or sometimes were defined in a way that we would regard as inadequate , " she said .
many of the quotations used in older editions of the oed were drawn from historical and literary sources .
now , brewer said , " the lexicographers can use the web , they can use google , they have access to an enormous variety of language online , they can instantly access a far broader range of sources .
in this way … it 's likely to become more democratic . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet offers lexicographers a broader range of sources to draw upon an ' absolutely enormous ' undertaking almost one third of a million entries were contained in the second version of the oed , published in hard copy in 1989 .
since then , a team of 80 lexicographers have been working on the third edition , though they have completed only 28 percent of the dictionary .
" we 're talking about an absolutely enormous amount of data , which in its last printed form occupied 20 volumes , " brewer said .
she said the third edition of the dictionary would likely be even larger .
" i think the point is that the cost of this work would be unbelievable - you know , you have to wonder who could possibly afford to buy it , " brewer said .
with the most recent edition weighing in at a hefty 62.9 kilos , an electronic version of edition three would not only be lighter on the hip pocket – it would also be easier on the back .

the pavilion called the " balancity " featured hip-hop during a month long program with graffiti , break-dance and music . hip-hop beats echoing around the area in front of the german pavilion have been attracting scores of young chinese people .
they are excited and sing along loudly with the artists .
" it is different here in comparison to berlin , " says rafael schall from berlin , who is blown away by the response .
" here you can really get the people high on music , dance with them on the stage and really go ballistic .
people really go crazy here . "
schall is one of 50 german hip-hop artists who have come to shangai to perform at the german pavilion .
together with 50 chinese hip-hop artists they have turned it into a laboratory of urban youth culture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanghai singer cha-cha says the project is " quite a cool thing " giving space to young people marion conrady , spokesperson of the german pavilion explains why germany has chosen to present itself at this world fair in this way .
" hip-hop is a youth culture , which can also be seen in cities represented in words through graffiti but also in the form of various performances .
with the help of our ' balancity ' pavilion at the shanghai expo , we are trying to show the versatility of a city .
and in a city , giving space to young people is as important as it is to provide space for high or elite culture . "
graffiti is important for hip-hoppers all over the world .
and one can also see this at the german pavilion .
at the graffiti corner there are not only huge pictures , but also graffiti t-shirts , umbrellas and bags for the visitors .
but in shanghai one hardly gets to see any graffiti .
stan wu works with the " invasion " magazine in hong kong .
he explains why so few walls are painted in shanghai .
" we first had the olympics and now we have the shanghai expo .
so the government and the city are trying to wipe out the whole country .
zero tolerance of ' dirty ' surface , you know .
so there is no chance that you will see a lot of graffiti in the city . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mc wesley from beijing in the ' balancity ' power of graffiti asia 's largest graffiti competition " wall lords finals 2010 " , which was held on sunday at the shanghai expo was also a part of the german hip-hop project .
it was initiated by akim walta from berlin , who has been active in the hip-hop scene there for almost 30 years .
walta talks about a graffiti project by german artists in shanghai .
" our boys also painted something for the residents here .
what was interesting was that they tried to come into contact with the locals .
and suddenly the sad grey street became colorful , with some connection to the locals .
and in the course of time there was some problem and we were asked to remove the graffiti .
but then , little children and families stood up for us and said that we had come from a far away land and the graffiti was a gift for them .
they said it was their picture and they did not want it to be removed . "
walta has been to china many times and has been involved in various graffiti projects .
he hopes that the hip-hop project at the shanghai expo is not the last one .

the southern city of thatta has apparently been saved from being inundated , and many citizens who fled earlier are returning there . slowly , the focus is turning to the giant task of rebuilding the devastated areas .
the pakistani ngo akhuwat pakistan has launched an innovative plan to help flood victims in southern punjab stand on their own feet as soon as possible .
under the plan by akhuwat pakistan , flood-affected families are to receive microcredits in order to create employment opportunities for them .
the interest-free loans will come without difficult conditions attached .
the organisation 's executive director amjad saqib explains : " look , whatever is happening right now is relief work .
people need food , shelter , medicine . "
but this relief work will be over in one or two months , he adds . bildunterschrift : a boy receives food at a camp on the outskirt of sukkur in southern pakistan " and then the real challenge will come up - how to rehabilitate all these people !
how can they stand on their own feet again ?
so whereas we from akhuwat have been continuously engaged in relief work in the field , within two months we want to shift our focus on one of the worst-affected areas , rajanpur district .
our preparation , fund raising and resource mobilisation are going well , and god willing we 'll select 10,000 badly affected families and provide them with interest-free loans , thus enabling them to re-start the businesses they 've had to abandon due to this flood . "
rebuilding small businesses the flood victims will get between 10,000 and 30,000 rupees -lrb- between 92 and 276 euros -rrb- per family as an interest-free loan .
no security or documents are required , nor will there be any service charges .
according to izhar hashmi , director of akhuwat pakistan , the recipients will be able to buy seeds or raise goats or cattle with the money .
they might also open a small shop in their village or buy a donkey cart and start a transport business .
with the income generated , they 'll have to repay the loans within 30 months .
the money will then be free to be distributed again to other needy persons .
akhuwat plans to raise 150 million rupees -lrb- almost 1.4 million euros -rrb- in donations from pakistanis for the program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crossing a flooded road in punjab province on monday " we wo n't turn pakistanis into beggars , " says amjad saqib , " but want to harness their potential to work hard for a better future .
they 'll rise up on their own and stand on their own feet again . "
an alternative approach to microcredit akhuwat means " brotherhood " in arabic .
the organisation 's philosophy of providing loan-free microcredit is inspired by islamic teaching which prohibits the charging of interest , but it equally provides loans to non-muslims , such as members of the christian minority , relying on the local mosque and church infrastructure . akhuwat , which has been working in pakistan for more than nine years and claims a recovery rate for its loans of almost 100 per cent , is an interesting exception among the growing number of micro-finance institutions worldwide .
recently , criticism has grown of these microcredit groups , as many have been demanding high interest rates , which can become a problem for those who accept their loans .
some development experts have pointed to the akhuwat model , funded by charitable donations and charging no interest at all , as an alternative way .
for pakistani flood victims , it definitely comes as a welcome support in this time of crisis .

but it closed this year with a tribute to festival innovator christoph schlingensief and a glimpse of changes to come . the 99th richard wagner festival in bayreuth closed sunday with a performance of wagner 's opera " the mastersingers of nuremberg . " the performance was dedicated to the provocative german film and theater director christoph schlingensief , who staged " parsifal " at the 2004 festival .
his production shocked some fans and was credited with bringing a new impulse to bayreuth .
schlingensief died of lung cancer on august 21 . composer richard wagner founded the bayreuth festival 134 years ago .
since then , his works - 10 operas - have been the sole basis for festival performances .
this fact alone makes it clear how important tradition is in bayreuth . tradition and renewal however , some signs point to change following the era of long-time festival director wolfgang wagner , who died early in 2010 .
his daughters and successors , eva wagner-pasquier and katharina wagner , have exhibited both openness and savvy in taking over direction of the festival . in 2010 , the festival continued its media push by offering public viewings and livestreams of selected performances .
on august 21 , 20,000 viewers came to watch " the valkyrie " transmitted live from the festspielhaus to a big screen at a market square in bayreuth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wager-pasquier assured audiences that wagner 's operas will not be upstaged according to a survey , 70 percent of the guests had never attended a wagner opera .
while visitors ate sausage , beer and pretzels , they could follow the performance featuring close-ups and subtitles .
the opera was also streamed live online and broadcast on japanese television .
the concept will continue next year with german broadcasters presenting " lohengrin " live from the festival . " wagner for kids " has also established itself as part of the event in bayreuth .
in the project 's second year , " tannhaeuser " was performed in a 70 minute kid-friendly version , targeted at six-to-12-year-olds .
the children followed the opera with great interest , and the crowd 's favorite was clearly love goddess venus , who sported a punk outfit and a skateboard . the beginning of the 2010 season also brought the announcement that an independent commission will receive complete access to the wagner house archives in order to examine the role of the festival during the third reich .
but at least one element is not up for discussion . " it 's certain that no other composer will be presented here , " said co-director eva wagner-pasquier .
" we will of course uphold the vision of the foundation and wagner house as well as the festival concept itself . " a shock for conservatives those who want to attend the bayreuth festival generally have to prepare for a long wait .
this year brought 408,000 ticket requests from 80 countries for the just 54,000 available seats .
it 's regarded as a privilege to be in bayreuth , even for the employees , who often had to work for low pay in previous years . changing attitudes toward compensation also mark the beginning of a new era for the festival .
following a salary dispute with stage workers last year , ticket prices had to be raised .
stage workers also succeeded in lobbying for mandatory breaks , which led to a new playing schedule this season .
this time , the four operas in the ring cycle - " the rheingold , " " the valkyrie , " " siegfried , " and " twilight of the gods " - were n't played consecutively .
that may not seem like a monumental change , but it would have been nearly unimaginable under wolfgang wagner 's direction and runs counter to the intentions of festival father richard wagner . many conservative wagnerians belong to the society of friends of bayreuth , an organization founded in 1949 by wolfgang wagner that since its inception has contributed more than 55 million euros -lrb- $ 70 million -rrb- to the festival .
following his death , the organization became a festival shareholder with the right to help make decisions related to the event .
disagreements and even public disputes have since erupted between the society and the festival leadership , which has strongly backed a newly-founded fundraising organization called the team of active festival supporters . a year of beautiful voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tenor lance ryan garnered praise this year in his bayreuth debut as siegfried in their second year heading the festival , wagner 's great-granddaughters katharina wagner and eva wagner-pasquier were able to fill the operas ' ranks with better singers than in recent decades .
the much-anticipated debuts included jonas kaufmann as lohengrin , james rutherford as hans sachs , johan botha as siegmund and lance ryan as siegfried .
ryan , a tenor from canada , has been hailed as unsurpassed in the role . 2010 was the last year of the " ring " production with director tankred dorst and conductor christian thielemann .
next year , thielemann will not conduct the orchestra but still be heavily involved with the event .
as musical advisor to the festival , he will have a say in who takes the bayreuth stage as a vocalist or conductor . looking ahead the 100th richard wagner festival next year will feature a new production of " tannhaeuser " directed by sebastian baumgarten and with thomas hengelbrock as conductor .
2013 will also bring a new staging of wagner 's masterpiece , " the ring of the nibelung , " to mark the composer 's 200th birthday .
the stage director for that production has yet to be announced , but kirill petrenko of russia is set to conduct the orchestra .
plans are also underway to debut three of wagner 's early operas in bayreuth -lrb- " the fairies , " " the ban on love " and " rienzi " -rrb- , not in the festival hall but in a tent elsewhere in the town . katharina wagner said her aim is to bring bayreuth " eventually to the absolute cutting edge of wagner productions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de publishing -pipe- 30.08.2010 internet killed the dictionary star großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the market for traditional dictionaries is disappearing , says the oed publisher falling sales and the growing popularity of online dictionaries mean the oxford english dictionary may never be printed again , its publisher says . for over two decades , dozens of writers have been working on a book that will probably never grace a bookshelf .
online dictionaries have gained so much popularity over their printed counterparts that the next edition of the oxford english dictionary will probably appear only in electronic form , according to its publisher , the oxford university press .
" the print dictionary market is just disappearing , it is falling away by tens of per cent a year , " nigel portwood , the chief executive of the oxford university press , told uk newspaper the sunday times .
he told the uk newspaper he did not think the third edition would be printed .
the second and most recent oed has existed online for more than a decade , where it receives two million hits a month from subscribers who pay an annual fee of almost 300 euros to access it .
a wider trend towards online simon winchester , author of the meaning of everything : the story of the oxford english dictionary , said the oxford university press 's move away from print editions of the dictionary " reflects an inevitability " and is part of a growing trend of readers moving away from printed books toward digital editions and electronic e-readers like the kindle or the ipad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dictionary-users are increasingly turning to the internet for their answers " i think the electronic book is going to achieve ascendancy over the printed book , and i think that the printed book is just starting now to vanish , " winchester said .
though he owns three sets of the printed version of the oxford english dictionary , he said he relies on the digital version .
" on my ipad , i 've used the oed twice if not three times today .
but i never ever go to the hardback version .
it sits there on the shelf gathering dust , looking beautiful , but i never use it . "
online dictionary keeps better pace the move away from printed dictionaries could also be helping to create a more accessible oed , and one that evolves better alongside the language that it documents , said charlotte brewer , professor of english language and literature at oxford university and author of treasure-house of the language : the living oed .
" when the first dictionaries were produced in the victorian period , the edwardian period in the uk , there were all sorts of assumptions about what was proper to go into a dictionary – so words to do with sex , and the body , sometimes did n't get in or sometimes were defined in a way that we would regard as inadequate , " she said .
many of the quotations used in older editions of the oed were drawn from historical and literary sources .
now , brewer said , " the lexicographers can use the web , they can use google , they have access to an enormous variety of language online , they can instantly access a far broader range of sources .
in this way … it 's likely to become more democratic . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet offers lexicographers a broader range of sources to draw upon an ' absolutely enormous ' undertaking almost one third of a million entries were contained in the second version of the oed , published in hard copy in 1989 .
since then , a team of 80 lexicographers have been working on the third edition , though they have completed only 28 percent of the dictionary .
" we 're talking about an absolutely enormous amount of data , which in its last printed form occupied 20 volumes , " brewer said .
she said the third edition of the dictionary would likely be even larger .
" i think the point is that the cost of this work would be unbelievable - you know , you have to wonder who could possibly afford to buy it , " brewer said .
with the most recent edition weighing in at a hefty 62.9 kilos , an electronic version of edition three would not only be lighter on the hip pocket – it would also be easier on the back .

the southern city of thatta has apparently been saved from being inundated , and many citizens who fled earlier are returning there . slowly , the focus is turning to the giant task of rebuilding the devastated areas .
the pakistani ngo akhuwat pakistan has launched an innovative plan to help flood victims in southern punjab stand on their own feet as soon as possible .
under the plan by akhuwat pakistan , flood-affected families are to receive microcredits in order to create employment opportunities for them .
the interest-free loans will come without difficult conditions attached .
the organisation 's executive director amjad saqib explains : " look , whatever is happening right now is relief work .
people need food , shelter , medicine . "
but this relief work will be over in one or two months , he adds . bildunterschrift : a boy receives food at a camp on the outskirt of sukkur in southern pakistan " and then the real challenge will come up - how to rehabilitate all these people !
how can they stand on their own feet again ?
so whereas we from akhuwat have been continuously engaged in relief work in the field , within two months we want to shift our focus on one of the worst-affected areas , rajanpur district .
our preparation , fund raising and resource mobilisation are going well , and god willing we 'll select 10,000 badly affected families and provide them with interest-free loans , thus enabling them to re-start the businesses they 've had to abandon due to this flood . "
rebuilding small businesses the flood victims will get between 10,000 and 30,000 rupees -lrb- between 92 and 276 euros -rrb- per family as an interest-free loan .
no security or documents are required , nor will there be any service charges .
according to izhar hashmi , director of akhuwat pakistan , the recipients will be able to buy seeds or raise goats or cattle with the money .
they might also open a small shop in their village or buy a donkey cart and start a transport business .
with the income generated , they 'll have to repay the loans within 30 months .
the money will then be free to be distributed again to other needy persons .
akhuwat plans to raise 150 million rupees -lrb- almost 1.4 million euros -rrb- in donations from pakistanis for the program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crossing a flooded road in punjab province on monday " we wo n't turn pakistanis into beggars , " says amjad saqib , " but want to harness their potential to work hard for a better future .
they 'll rise up on their own and stand on their own feet again . "
an alternative approach to microcredit akhuwat means " brotherhood " in arabic .
the organisation 's philosophy of providing loan-free microcredit is inspired by islamic teaching which prohibits the charging of interest , but it equally provides loans to non-muslims , such as members of the christian minority , relying on the local mosque and church infrastructure . akhuwat , which has been working in pakistan for more than nine years and claims a recovery rate for its loans of almost 100 per cent , is an interesting exception among the growing number of micro-finance institutions worldwide .
recently , criticism has grown of these microcredit groups , as many have been demanding high interest rates , which can become a problem for those who accept their loans .
some development experts have pointed to the akhuwat model , funded by charitable donations and charging no interest at all , as an alternative way .
for pakistani flood victims , it definitely comes as a welcome support in this time of crisis .

public prosecutors in stuttgart are investigating too . traders and hedge fund managers hate the weekends because they ca n't take react immediately to corporate announcements until trading floors reopen on monday .
sunday , october 26 , 2008 was a particularly bad day for 35 american hedge funds .
that was the day german sports carmaker porsche announced that it owned 42.6 percent of volkswagen 's common stock and options for another 31.5 percent - bringing its total stake in the company to 74.1 percent .
the announcement then declared porsche was seeking to obtain 75 percent of vw shares - a plan that eventually backfired .
the following morning saw a frenzy of trading activity .
hedge fund managers had long been betting that the price of vw stock would fall .
the financial crisis caused demand for cars to fall in the us , driving down american automakers ' share prices .
they figured it was only a matter of time until german carmakers suffered a similar fate .
as a result , their funds were borrowing vw shares and selling them on in the hope they could buy them back later at a lower price - a speculative strategy known as short selling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us fund managers say wendelin wiedeking misled investors about his plans but porsche 's weekend announcement made it clear that fund managers had sold more than double the number of vw shares actually available on the market .
the news drove vw 's stock price up from 290 euros to 1,005 euros per share , making it the world 's most valuable company for a short period of time .
the financial times estimates that hedge funds lost about 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- in two days of trading as a result .
transatlatic battle now the funds want porsche to pay them more than 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2 billion -rrb- in damages .
lawyers representing the hedge funds told a new york court that porsche committed securities fraud by leading investors to believe it was only seeking a 51-percent stake in vw .
porsche 's defense team is due to file a petition to dismiss the lawsuit on wednesday , according to german media .
analysts expect porsche to argue that it was only required to publicly disclose its takeover plans once they were approved by the board - and that that had not been the case prior to october 26 , 2008 .
the hedge funds ' claims may be helped by the fact that german prosecutors in the city of stuttgart are also examining claims that porsche managers manipulated the markets .
investigators are trying to establish whether former porsche chief wendelin wiedeking and his financial director holger haerter influenced stock prices by passing on insider information or misleading investors about the porsche 's plans to increase its stake in vw .
the american plaintiffs will have to be patient if they want to rely on evidence from germany , however .
the stuttgart prosecutors ' preliminary findings are n't due to be released until the end of 2010 or early 2011 .

public prosecutors in stuttgart are investigating too . traders and hedge fund managers hate the weekends because they ca n't take react immediately to corporate announcements until trading floors reopen on monday .
sunday , october 26 , 2008 was a particularly bad day for 35 american hedge funds .
that was the day german sports carmaker porsche announced that it owned 42.6 percent of volkswagen 's common stock and options for another 31.5 percent - bringing its total stake in the company to 74.1 percent .
the announcement then declared porsche was seeking to obtain 75 percent of vw shares - a plan that eventually backfired .
the following morning saw a frenzy of trading activity .
hedge fund managers had long been betting that the price of vw stock would fall .
the financial crisis caused demand for cars to fall in the us , driving down american automakers ' share prices .
they figured it was only a matter of time until german carmakers suffered a similar fate .
as a result , their funds were borrowing vw shares and selling them on in the hope they could buy them back later at a lower price - a speculative strategy known as short selling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us fund managers say wendelin wiedeking misled investors about his plans but porsche 's weekend announcement made it clear that fund managers had sold more than double the number of vw shares actually available on the market .
the news drove vw 's stock price up from 290 euros to 1,005 euros per share , making it the world 's most valuable company for a short period of time .
the financial times estimates that hedge funds lost about 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- in two days of trading as a result .
transatlatic battle now the funds want porsche to pay them more than 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2 billion -rrb- in damages .
lawyers representing the hedge funds told a new york court that porsche committed securities fraud by leading investors to believe it was only seeking a 51-percent stake in vw .
porsche 's defense team is due to file a petition to dismiss the lawsuit on wednesday , according to german media .
analysts expect porsche to argue that it was only required to publicly disclose its takeover plans once they were approved by the board - and that that had not been the case prior to october 26 , 2008 .
the hedge funds ' claims may be helped by the fact that german prosecutors in the city of stuttgart are also examining claims that porsche managers manipulated the markets .
investigators are trying to establish whether former porsche chief wendelin wiedeking and his financial director holger haerter influenced stock prices by passing on insider information or misleading investors about the porsche 's plans to increase its stake in vw .
the american plaintiffs will have to be patient if they want to rely on evidence from germany , however .
the stuttgart prosecutors ' preliminary findings are n't due to be released until the end of 2010 or early 2011 .

he decided to remain in the job , saying that leaving amounted to ' deserting . '
" i asked myself whether i should resign , kouchner said .
" but what would have that changed ?
no , i was not happy about this policy .
i 've been involved with the roma for 25 years .
and i do n't like making a political issue out of them . "
on friday , in an address to french ambassadors , kouchner still openly supported sarkozy 's policy on the roma deportations .
kouchner is the founder of the renowned medical charity doctors without borders and is a highly respected human rights activist .
observers have generally believed that the former socialist politician would have trouble accommodating himself in sarkozy 's conservative government whose views he does not always share .
in another sign that not everyone is in agreement with sarkozy 's tough anti-crime and immigration policy , france 's defense minister hervé morin of the center-right new center party also broke ranks , criticizing the tough crusade of president sarkozy and the interior minister brice hortefeux .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on average , 1,000 roma gypsies are expelled each month 8,000 roma sent back this year already critics say the recent campaigns are a calculated move to boost sarkozy 's flagging popularity before elections in 2012 and distract attention from unpopular plans to cut public spending and raise the retirement age .
jean-marie le pen , the veteran leader of the extreme-right national front , however , agrees with the deportations .
he added that sarkozy was powerless to do anything fundamental about what he described as " a problem caused by the european union opening the borders between european countries . " roma can legally travel to eu countries , but they must show that they have found a job if they want to stay legally in france for more than three months .
the french government has sent more than 8,000 roma back to bulgaria and romania since the start of the year .
around 1,000 were sent back in the past four weeks .
on tuesday , french officials are due to meet with representatives of the european commission , which is also critical of paris 's crackdown on roma gypsies .
the united nations and the vatican have also condemned the expulsions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de festivals -pipe- 30.08.2010 bayreuth festival closes with tribute to director schlingensief großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the curtain has been drawn on the green hill until next summer the bayreuth festival is bound with tradition and founder richard wagner 's vision for the event .
but it closed this year with a tribute to festival innovator christoph schlingensief and a glimpse of changes to come . the 99th richard wagner festival in bayreuth closed sunday with a performance of wagner 's opera " the mastersingers of nuremberg . " the performance was dedicated to the provocative german film and theater director christoph schlingensief , who staged " parsifal " at the 2004 festival .
his production shocked some fans and was credited with bringing a new impulse to bayreuth .
schlingensief died of lung cancer on august 21 . composer richard wagner founded the bayreuth festival 134 years ago .
since then , his works - 10 operas - have been the sole basis for festival performances .
this fact alone makes it clear how important tradition is in bayreuth . tradition and renewal however , some signs point to change following the era of long-time festival director wolfgang wagner , who died early in 2010 .
his daughters and successors , eva wagner-pasquier and katharina wagner , have exhibited both openness and savvy in taking over direction of the festival . in 2010 , the festival continued its media push by offering public viewings and livestreams of selected performances .
on august 21 , 20,000 viewers came to watch " the valkyrie " transmitted live from the festspielhaus to a big screen at a market square in bayreuth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wager-pasquier assured audiences that wagner 's operas will not be upstaged according to a survey , 70 percent of the guests had never attended a wagner opera .
while visitors ate sausage , beer and pretzels , they could follow the performance featuring close-ups and subtitles .
the opera was also streamed live online and broadcast on japanese television .
the concept will continue next year with german broadcasters presenting " lohengrin " live from the festival . " wagner for kids " has also established itself as part of the event in bayreuth .
in the project 's second year , " tannhaeuser " was performed in a 70 minute kid-friendly version , targeted at six-to-12-year-olds .
the children followed the opera with great interest , and the crowd 's favorite was clearly love goddess venus , who sported a punk outfit and a skateboard . the beginning of the 2010 season also brought the announcement that an independent commission will receive complete access to the wagner house archives in order to examine the role of the festival during the third reich .
but at least one element is not up for discussion . " it 's certain that no other composer will be presented here , " said co-director eva wagner-pasquier .
" we will of course uphold the vision of the foundation and wagner house as well as the festival concept itself . " a shock for conservatives those who want to attend the bayreuth festival generally have to prepare for a long wait .
this year brought 408,000 ticket requests from 80 countries for the just 54,000 available seats .
it 's regarded as a privilege to be in bayreuth , even for the employees , who often had to work for low pay in previous years . changing attitudes toward compensation also mark the beginning of a new era for the festival .
following a salary dispute with stage workers last year , ticket prices had to be raised .
stage workers also succeeded in lobbying for mandatory breaks , which led to a new playing schedule this season .
this time , the four operas in the ring cycle - " the rheingold , " " the valkyrie , " " siegfried , " and " twilight of the gods " - were n't played consecutively .
that may not seem like a monumental change , but it would have been nearly unimaginable under wolfgang wagner 's direction and runs counter to the intentions of festival father richard wagner . many conservative wagnerians belong to the society of friends of bayreuth , an organization founded in 1949 by wolfgang wagner that since its inception has contributed more than 55 million euros -lrb- $ 70 million -rrb- to the festival .
following his death , the organization became a festival shareholder with the right to help make decisions related to the event .
disagreements and even public disputes have since erupted between the society and the festival leadership , which has strongly backed a newly-founded fundraising organization called the team of active festival supporters . a year of beautiful voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tenor lance ryan garnered praise this year in his bayreuth debut as siegfried in their second year heading the festival , wagner 's great-granddaughters katharina wagner and eva wagner-pasquier were able to fill the operas ' ranks with better singers than in recent decades .
the much-anticipated debuts included jonas kaufmann as lohengrin , james rutherford as hans sachs , johan botha as siegmund and lance ryan as siegfried .
ryan , a tenor from canada , has been hailed as unsurpassed in the role . 2010 was the last year of the " ring " production with director tankred dorst and conductor christian thielemann .
next year , thielemann will not conduct the orchestra but still be heavily involved with the event .
as musical advisor to the festival , he will have a say in who takes the bayreuth stage as a vocalist or conductor . looking ahead the 100th richard wagner festival next year will feature a new production of " tannhaeuser " directed by sebastian baumgarten and with thomas hengelbrock as conductor .
2013 will also bring a new staging of wagner 's masterpiece , " the ring of the nibelung , " to mark the composer 's 200th birthday .
the stage director for that production has yet to be announced , but kirill petrenko of russia is set to conduct the orchestra .
plans are also underway to debut three of wagner 's early operas in bayreuth -lrb- " the fairies , " " the ban on love " and " rienzi " -rrb- , not in the festival hall but in a tent elsewhere in the town . katharina wagner said her aim is to bring bayreuth " eventually to the absolute cutting edge of wagner productions .

that was the day german sports carmaker porsche announced that it owned 42.6 percent of volkswagen 's common stock and options for another 31.5 percent - bringing its total stake in the company to 74.1 percent .
the announcement then declared porsche was seeking to obtain 75 percent of vw shares - a plan that eventually backfired .
the following morning saw a frenzy of trading activity .
hedge fund managers had long been betting that the price of vw stock would fall .
the financial crisis caused demand for cars to fall in the us , driving down american automakers ' share prices .
they figured it was only a matter of time until german carmakers suffered a similar fate .
as a result , their funds were borrowing vw shares and selling them on in the hope they could buy them back later at a lower price - a speculative strategy known as short selling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us fund managers say wendelin wiedeking misled investors about his plans but porsche 's weekend announcement made it clear that fund managers had sold more than double the number of vw shares actually available on the market .
the news drove vw 's stock price up from 290 euros to 1,005 euros per share , making it the world 's most valuable company for a short period of time .
the financial times estimates that hedge funds lost about 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- in two days of trading as a result .
transatlatic battle now the funds want porsche to pay them more than 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2 billion -rrb- in damages .
lawyers representing the hedge funds told a new york court that porsche committed securities fraud by leading investors to believe it was only seeking a 51-percent stake in vw .
porsche 's defense team is due to file a petition to dismiss the lawsuit on wednesday , according to german media .
analysts expect porsche to argue that it was only required to publicly disclose its takeover plans once they were approved by the board - and that that had not been the case prior to october 26 , 2008 .
the hedge funds ' claims may be helped by the fact that german prosecutors in the city of stuttgart are also examining claims that porsche managers manipulated the markets .
investigators are trying to establish whether former porsche chief wendelin wiedeking and his financial director holger haerter influenced stock prices by passing on insider information or misleading investors about the porsche 's plans to increase its stake in vw .
the american plaintiffs will have to be patient if they want to rely on evidence from germany , however .
the stuttgart prosecutors ' preliminary findings are n't due to be released until the end of 2010 or early 2011 .

that was the day german sports carmaker porsche announced that it owned 42.6 percent of volkswagen 's common stock and options for another 31.5 percent - bringing its total stake in the company to 74.1 percent .
the announcement then declared porsche was seeking to obtain 75 percent of vw shares - a plan that eventually backfired .
the following morning saw a frenzy of trading activity .
hedge fund managers had long been betting that the price of vw stock would fall .
the financial crisis caused demand for cars to fall in the us , driving down american automakers ' share prices .
they figured it was only a matter of time until german carmakers suffered a similar fate .
as a result , their funds were borrowing vw shares and selling them on in the hope they could buy them back later at a lower price - a speculative strategy known as short selling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us fund managers say wendelin wiedeking misled investors about his plans but porsche 's weekend announcement made it clear that fund managers had sold more than double the number of vw shares actually available on the market .
the news drove vw 's stock price up from 290 euros to 1,005 euros per share , making it the world 's most valuable company for a short period of time .
the financial times estimates that hedge funds lost about 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- in two days of trading as a result .
transatlatic battle now the funds want porsche to pay them more than 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2 billion -rrb- in damages .
lawyers representing the hedge funds told a new york court that porsche committed securities fraud by leading investors to believe it was only seeking a 51-percent stake in vw .
porsche 's defense team is due to file a petition to dismiss the lawsuit on wednesday , according to german media .
analysts expect porsche to argue that it was only required to publicly disclose its takeover plans once they were approved by the board - and that that had not been the case prior to october 26 , 2008 .
the hedge funds ' claims may be helped by the fact that german prosecutors in the city of stuttgart are also examining claims that porsche managers manipulated the markets .
investigators are trying to establish whether former porsche chief wendelin wiedeking and his financial director holger haerter influenced stock prices by passing on insider information or misleading investors about the porsche 's plans to increase its stake in vw .
the american plaintiffs will have to be patient if they want to rely on evidence from germany , however .
the stuttgart prosecutors ' preliminary findings are n't due to be released until the end of 2010 or early 2011 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 30.08.2010 german hip-hop at the shanghai expo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hip-hoppers at the german pavilion in shanghai at the german expo pavilion in shanghai , one could easily see how hip-hop is transcending borders .
the pavilion called the " balancity " featured hip-hop during a month long program with graffiti , break-dance and music . hip-hop beats echoing around the area in front of the german pavilion have been attracting scores of young chinese people .
they are excited and sing along loudly with the artists .
" it is different here in comparison to berlin , " says rafael schall from berlin , who is blown away by the response .
" here you can really get the people high on music , dance with them on the stage and really go ballistic .
people really go crazy here . "
schall is one of 50 german hip-hop artists who have come to shangai to perform at the german pavilion .
together with 50 chinese hip-hop artists they have turned it into a laboratory of urban youth culture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanghai singer cha-cha says the project is " quite a cool thing " giving space to young people marion conrady , spokesperson of the german pavilion explains why germany has chosen to present itself at this world fair in this way .
" hip-hop is a youth culture , which can also be seen in cities represented in words through graffiti but also in the form of various performances .
with the help of our ' balancity ' pavilion at the shanghai expo , we are trying to show the versatility of a city .
and in a city , giving space to young people is as important as it is to provide space for high or elite culture . "
graffiti is important for hip-hoppers all over the world .
and one can also see this at the german pavilion .
at the graffiti corner there are not only huge pictures , but also graffiti t-shirts , umbrellas and bags for the visitors .
but in shanghai one hardly gets to see any graffiti .
stan wu works with the " invasion " magazine in hong kong .
he explains why so few walls are painted in shanghai .
" we first had the olympics and now we have the shanghai expo .
so the government and the city are trying to wipe out the whole country .
zero tolerance of ' dirty ' surface , you know .
so there is no chance that you will see a lot of graffiti in the city . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mc wesley from beijing in the ' balancity ' power of graffiti asia 's largest graffiti competition " wall lords finals 2010 " , which was held on sunday at the shanghai expo was also a part of the german hip-hop project .
it was initiated by akim walta from berlin , who has been active in the hip-hop scene there for almost 30 years .
walta talks about a graffiti project by german artists in shanghai .
" our boys also painted something for the residents here .
what was interesting was that they tried to come into contact with the locals .
and suddenly the sad grey street became colorful , with some connection to the locals .
and in the course of time there was some problem and we were asked to remove the graffiti .
but then , little children and families stood up for us and said that we had come from a far away land and the graffiti was a gift for them .
they said it was their picture and they did not want it to be removed . "
walta has been to china many times and has been involved in various graffiti projects .
he hopes that the hip-hop project at the shanghai expo is not the last one .

online dictionaries have gained so much popularity over their printed counterparts that the next edition of the oxford english dictionary will probably appear only in electronic form , according to its publisher , the oxford university press .
" the print dictionary market is just disappearing , it is falling away by tens of per cent a year , " nigel portwood , the chief executive of the oxford university press , told uk newspaper the sunday times .
he told the uk newspaper he did not think the third edition would be printed .
the second and most recent oed has existed online for more than a decade , where it receives two million hits a month from subscribers who pay an annual fee of almost 300 euros to access it .
a wider trend towards online simon winchester , author of the meaning of everything : the story of the oxford english dictionary , said the oxford university press 's move away from print editions of the dictionary " reflects an inevitability " and is part of a growing trend of readers moving away from printed books toward digital editions and electronic e-readers like the kindle or the ipad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dictionary-users are increasingly turning to the internet for their answers " i think the electronic book is going to achieve ascendancy over the printed book , and i think that the printed book is just starting now to vanish , " winchester said .
though he owns three sets of the printed version of the oxford english dictionary , he said he relies on the digital version .
" on my ipad , i 've used the oed twice if not three times today .
but i never ever go to the hardback version .
it sits there on the shelf gathering dust , looking beautiful , but i never use it . "
online dictionary keeps better pace the move away from printed dictionaries could also be helping to create a more accessible oed , and one that evolves better alongside the language that it documents , said charlotte brewer , professor of english language and literature at oxford university and author of treasure-house of the language : the living oed .
" when the first dictionaries were produced in the victorian period , the edwardian period in the uk , there were all sorts of assumptions about what was proper to go into a dictionary – so words to do with sex , and the body , sometimes did n't get in or sometimes were defined in a way that we would regard as inadequate , " she said .
many of the quotations used in older editions of the oed were drawn from historical and literary sources .
now , brewer said , " the lexicographers can use the web , they can use google , they have access to an enormous variety of language online , they can instantly access a far broader range of sources .
in this way … it 's likely to become more democratic . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet offers lexicographers a broader range of sources to draw upon an ' absolutely enormous ' undertaking almost one third of a million entries were contained in the second version of the oed , published in hard copy in 1989 .
since then , a team of 80 lexicographers have been working on the third edition , though they have completed only 28 percent of the dictionary .
" we 're talking about an absolutely enormous amount of data , which in its last printed form occupied 20 volumes , " brewer said .
she said the third edition of the dictionary would likely be even larger .
" i think the point is that the cost of this work would be unbelievable - you know , you have to wonder who could possibly afford to buy it , " brewer said .
with the most recent edition weighing in at a hefty 62.9 kilos , an electronic version of edition three would not only be lighter on the hip pocket – it would also be easier on the back .

online dictionaries have gained so much popularity over their printed counterparts that the next edition of the oxford english dictionary will probably appear only in electronic form , according to its publisher , the oxford university press .
" the print dictionary market is just disappearing , it is falling away by tens of per cent a year , " nigel portwood , the chief executive of the oxford university press , told uk newspaper the sunday times .
he told the uk newspaper he did not think the third edition would be printed .
the second and most recent oed has existed online for more than a decade , where it receives two million hits a month from subscribers who pay an annual fee of almost 300 euros to access it .
a wider trend towards online simon winchester , author of the meaning of everything : the story of the oxford english dictionary , said the oxford university press 's move away from print editions of the dictionary " reflects an inevitability " and is part of a growing trend of readers moving away from printed books toward digital editions and electronic e-readers like the kindle or the ipad .

" when the first dictionaries were produced in the victorian period , the edwardian period in the uk , there were all sorts of assumptions about what was proper to go into a dictionary – so words to do with sex , and the body , sometimes did n't get in or sometimes were defined in a way that we would regard as inadequate , " she said .
many of the quotations used in older editions of the oed were drawn from historical and literary sources .

the pavilion called the " balancity " featured hip-hop during a month long program with graffiti , break-dance and music . hip-hop beats echoing around the area in front of the german pavilion have been attracting scores of young chinese people .
they are excited and sing along loudly with the artists .
" it is different here in comparison to berlin , " says rafael schall from berlin , who is blown away by the response .
" here you can really get the people high on music , dance with them on the stage and really go ballistic .
people really go crazy here . "
schall is one of 50 german hip-hop artists who have come to shangai to perform at the german pavilion .
together with 50 chinese hip-hop artists they have turned it into a laboratory of urban youth culture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanghai singer cha-cha says the project is " quite a cool thing " giving space to young people marion conrady , spokesperson of the german pavilion explains why germany has chosen to present itself at this world fair in this way .
" hip-hop is a youth culture , which can also be seen in cities represented in words through graffiti but also in the form of various performances .
with the help of our ' balancity ' pavilion at the shanghai expo , we are trying to show the versatility of a city .
and in a city , giving space to young people is as important as it is to provide space for high or elite culture . "
graffiti is important for hip-hoppers all over the world .
and one can also see this at the german pavilion .
at the graffiti corner there are not only huge pictures , but also graffiti t-shirts , umbrellas and bags for the visitors .
but in shanghai one hardly gets to see any graffiti .
stan wu works with the " invasion " magazine in hong kong .
he explains why so few walls are painted in shanghai .
" we first had the olympics and now we have the shanghai expo .
so the government and the city are trying to wipe out the whole country .
zero tolerance of ' dirty ' surface , you know .
so there is no chance that you will see a lot of graffiti in the city . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mc wesley from beijing in the ' balancity ' power of graffiti asia 's largest graffiti competition " wall lords finals 2010 " , which was held on sunday at the shanghai expo was also a part of the german hip-hop project .
it was initiated by akim walta from berlin , who has been active in the hip-hop scene there for almost 30 years .
walta talks about a graffiti project by german artists in shanghai .
" our boys also painted something for the residents here .
what was interesting was that they tried to come into contact with the locals .
and suddenly the sad grey street became colorful , with some connection to the locals .
and in the course of time there was some problem and we were asked to remove the graffiti .
but then , little children and families stood up for us and said that we had come from a far away land and the graffiti was a gift for them .
they said it was their picture and they did not want it to be removed . "
walta has been to china many times and has been involved in various graffiti projects .
he hopes that the hip-hop project at the shanghai expo is not the last one .

he decided to remain in the job , saying that leaving amounted to ' deserting . '
" i asked myself whether i should resign , kouchner said .
" but what would have that changed ?
no , i was not happy about this policy .
i 've been involved with the roma for 25 years .
and i do n't like making a political issue out of them . "
on friday , in an address to french ambassadors , kouchner still openly supported sarkozy 's policy on the roma deportations .
kouchner is the founder of the renowned medical charity doctors without borders and is a highly respected human rights activist .

but it closed this year with a tribute to festival innovator christoph schlingensief and a glimpse of changes to come . the 99th richard wagner festival in bayreuth closed sunday with a performance of wagner 's opera " the mastersingers of nuremberg . " the performance was dedicated to the provocative german film and theater director christoph schlingensief , who staged " parsifal " at the 2004 festival .
his production shocked some fans and was credited with bringing a new impulse to bayreuth .
schlingensief died of lung cancer on august 21 . composer richard wagner founded the bayreuth festival 134 years ago .
since then , his works - 10 operas - have been the sole basis for festival performances .
this fact alone makes it clear how important tradition is in bayreuth . tradition and renewal however , some signs point to change following the era of long-time festival director wolfgang wagner , who died early in 2010 .
his daughters and successors , eva wagner-pasquier and katharina wagner , have exhibited both openness and savvy in taking over direction of the festival . in 2010 , the festival continued its media push by offering public viewings and livestreams of selected performances .
on august 21 , 20,000 viewers came to watch " the valkyrie " transmitted live from the festspielhaus to a big screen at a market square in bayreuth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wager-pasquier assured audiences that wagner 's operas will not be upstaged according to a survey , 70 percent of the guests had never attended a wagner opera .
while visitors ate sausage , beer and pretzels , they could follow the performance featuring close-ups and subtitles .
the opera was also streamed live online and broadcast on japanese television .
the concept will continue next year with german broadcasters presenting " lohengrin " live from the festival . " wagner for kids " has also established itself as part of the event in bayreuth .
in the project 's second year , " tannhaeuser " was performed in a 70 minute kid-friendly version , targeted at six-to-12-year-olds .
the children followed the opera with great interest , and the crowd 's favorite was clearly love goddess venus , who sported a punk outfit and a skateboard . the beginning of the 2010 season also brought the announcement that an independent commission will receive complete access to the wagner house archives in order to examine the role of the festival during the third reich .
but at least one element is not up for discussion . " it 's certain that no other composer will be presented here , " said co-director eva wagner-pasquier .
" we will of course uphold the vision of the foundation and wagner house as well as the festival concept itself . " a shock for conservatives those who want to attend the bayreuth festival generally have to prepare for a long wait .
this year brought 408,000 ticket requests from 80 countries for the just 54,000 available seats .
it 's regarded as a privilege to be in bayreuth , even for the employees , who often had to work for low pay in previous years . changing attitudes toward compensation also mark the beginning of a new era for the festival .
following a salary dispute with stage workers last year , ticket prices had to be raised .
stage workers also succeeded in lobbying for mandatory breaks , which led to a new playing schedule this season .
this time , the four operas in the ring cycle - " the rheingold , " " the valkyrie , " " siegfried , " and " twilight of the gods " - were n't played consecutively .
that may not seem like a monumental change , but it would have been nearly unimaginable under wolfgang wagner 's direction and runs counter to the intentions of festival father richard wagner . many conservative wagnerians belong to the society of friends of bayreuth , an organization founded in 1949 by wolfgang wagner that since its inception has contributed more than 55 million euros -lrb- $ 70 million -rrb- to the festival .
following his death , the organization became a festival shareholder with the right to help make decisions related to the event .
disagreements and even public disputes have since erupted between the society and the festival leadership , which has strongly backed a newly-founded fundraising organization called the team of active festival supporters . a year of beautiful voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tenor lance ryan garnered praise this year in his bayreuth debut as siegfried in their second year heading the festival , wagner 's great-granddaughters katharina wagner and eva wagner-pasquier were able to fill the operas ' ranks with better singers than in recent decades .
the much-anticipated debuts included jonas kaufmann as lohengrin , james rutherford as hans sachs , johan botha as siegmund and lance ryan as siegfried .
ryan , a tenor from canada , has been hailed as unsurpassed in the role . 2010 was the last year of the " ring " production with director tankred dorst and conductor christian thielemann .
next year , thielemann will not conduct the orchestra but still be heavily involved with the event .
as musical advisor to the festival , he will have a say in who takes the bayreuth stage as a vocalist or conductor . looking ahead the 100th richard wagner festival next year will feature a new production of " tannhaeuser " directed by sebastian baumgarten and with thomas hengelbrock as conductor .
2013 will also bring a new staging of wagner 's masterpiece , " the ring of the nibelung , " to mark the composer 's 200th birthday .
the stage director for that production has yet to be announced , but kirill petrenko of russia is set to conduct the orchestra .
plans are also underway to debut three of wagner 's early operas in bayreuth -lrb- " the fairies , " " the ban on love " and " rienzi " -rrb- , not in the festival hall but in a tent elsewhere in the town . katharina wagner said her aim is to bring bayreuth " eventually to the absolute cutting edge of wagner productions .

but it closed this year with a tribute to festival innovator christoph schlingensief and a glimpse of changes to come . the 99th richard wagner festival in bayreuth closed sunday with a performance of wagner 's opera " the mastersingers of nuremberg . " the performance was dedicated to the provocative german film and theater director christoph schlingensief , who staged " parsifal " at the 2004 festival .
his production shocked some fans and was credited with bringing a new impulse to bayreuth .
schlingensief died of lung cancer on august 21 . composer richard wagner founded the bayreuth festival 134 years ago .
since then , his works - 10 operas - have been the sole basis for festival performances .
this fact alone makes it clear how important tradition is in bayreuth . tradition and renewal however , some signs point to change following the era of long-time festival director wolfgang wagner , who died early in 2010 .
his daughters and successors , eva wagner-pasquier and katharina wagner , have exhibited both openness and savvy in taking over direction of the festival . in 2010 , the festival continued its media push by offering public viewings and livestreams of selected performances .
on august 21 , 20,000 viewers came to watch " the valkyrie " transmitted live from the festspielhaus to a big screen at a market square in bayreuth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wager-pasquier assured audiences that wagner 's operas will not be upstaged according to a survey , 70 percent of the guests had never attended a wagner opera .
while visitors ate sausage , beer and pretzels , they could follow the performance featuring close-ups and subtitles .
the opera was also streamed live online and broadcast on japanese television .
the concept will continue next year with german broadcasters presenting " lohengrin " live from the festival . " wagner for kids " has also established itself as part of the event in bayreuth .
in the project 's second year , " tannhaeuser " was performed in a 70 minute kid-friendly version , targeted at six-to-12-year-olds .
the children followed the opera with great interest , and the crowd 's favorite was clearly love goddess venus , who sported a punk outfit and a skateboard . the beginning of the 2010 season also brought the announcement that an independent commission will receive complete access to the wagner house archives in order to examine the role of the festival during the third reich .
but at least one element is not up for discussion . " it 's certain that no other composer will be presented here , " said co-director eva wagner-pasquier .
" we will of course uphold the vision of the foundation and wagner house as well as the festival concept itself . " a shock for conservatives those who want to attend the bayreuth festival generally have to prepare for a long wait .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 30.08.2010 german hip-hop at the shanghai expo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hip-hoppers at the german pavilion in shanghai at the german expo pavilion in shanghai , one could easily see how hip-hop is transcending borders .
the pavilion called the " balancity " featured hip-hop during a month long program with graffiti , break-dance and music . hip-hop beats echoing around the area in front of the german pavilion have been attracting scores of young chinese people .
they are excited and sing along loudly with the artists .
" it is different here in comparison to berlin , " says rafael schall from berlin , who is blown away by the response .
" here you can really get the people high on music , dance with them on the stage and really go ballistic .
people really go crazy here . "
schall is one of 50 german hip-hop artists who have come to shangai to perform at the german pavilion .
together with 50 chinese hip-hop artists they have turned it into a laboratory of urban youth culture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanghai singer cha-cha says the project is " quite a cool thing " giving space to young people marion conrady , spokesperson of the german pavilion explains why germany has chosen to present itself at this world fair in this way .
" hip-hop is a youth culture , which can also be seen in cities represented in words through graffiti but also in the form of various performances .
with the help of our ' balancity ' pavilion at the shanghai expo , we are trying to show the versatility of a city .
and in a city , giving space to young people is as important as it is to provide space for high or elite culture . "
graffiti is important for hip-hoppers all over the world .
and one can also see this at the german pavilion .
at the graffiti corner there are not only huge pictures , but also graffiti t-shirts , umbrellas and bags for the visitors .
but in shanghai one hardly gets to see any graffiti .
stan wu works with the " invasion " magazine in hong kong .
he explains why so few walls are painted in shanghai .
" we first had the olympics and now we have the shanghai expo .
so the government and the city are trying to wipe out the whole country .
zero tolerance of ' dirty ' surface , you know .
so there is no chance that you will see a lot of graffiti in the city . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mc wesley from beijing in the ' balancity ' power of graffiti asia 's largest graffiti competition " wall lords finals 2010 " , which was held on sunday at the shanghai expo was also a part of the german hip-hop project .
it was initiated by akim walta from berlin , who has been active in the hip-hop scene there for almost 30 years .
walta talks about a graffiti project by german artists in shanghai .
" our boys also painted something for the residents here .
what was interesting was that they tried to come into contact with the locals .
and suddenly the sad grey street became colorful , with some connection to the locals .
and in the course of time there was some problem and we were asked to remove the graffiti .
but then , little children and families stood up for us and said that we had come from a far away land and the graffiti was a gift for them .
they said it was their picture and they did not want it to be removed . "
walta has been to china many times and has been involved in various graffiti projects .
he hopes that the hip-hop project at the shanghai expo is not the last one .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 30.08.2010 german hip-hop at the shanghai expo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hip-hoppers at the german pavilion in shanghai at the german expo pavilion in shanghai , one could easily see how hip-hop is transcending borders .
the pavilion called the " balancity " featured hip-hop during a month long program with graffiti , break-dance and music . hip-hop beats echoing around the area in front of the german pavilion have been attracting scores of young chinese people .
they are excited and sing along loudly with the artists .
" it is different here in comparison to berlin , " says rafael schall from berlin , who is blown away by the response .
" here you can really get the people high on music , dance with them on the stage and really go ballistic .
people really go crazy here . "
schall is one of 50 german hip-hop artists who have come to shangai to perform at the german pavilion .
together with 50 chinese hip-hop artists they have turned it into a laboratory of urban youth culture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanghai singer cha-cha says the project is " quite a cool thing " giving space to young people marion conrady , spokesperson of the german pavilion explains why germany has chosen to present itself at this world fair in this way .
" hip-hop is a youth culture , which can also be seen in cities represented in words through graffiti but also in the form of various performances .
with the help of our ' balancity ' pavilion at the shanghai expo , we are trying to show the versatility of a city .
and in a city , giving space to young people is as important as it is to provide space for high or elite culture . "
graffiti is important for hip-hoppers all over the world .
and one can also see this at the german pavilion .
at the graffiti corner there are not only huge pictures , but also graffiti t-shirts , umbrellas and bags for the visitors .
but in shanghai one hardly gets to see any graffiti .
stan wu works with the " invasion " magazine in hong kong .
he explains why so few walls are painted in shanghai .
" we first had the olympics and now we have the shanghai expo .
so the government and the city are trying to wipe out the whole country .
zero tolerance of ' dirty ' surface , you know .
so there is no chance that you will see a lot of graffiti in the city . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mc wesley from beijing in the ' balancity ' power of graffiti asia 's largest graffiti competition " wall lords finals 2010 " , which was held on sunday at the shanghai expo was also a part of the german hip-hop project .
it was initiated by akim walta from berlin , who has been active in the hip-hop scene there for almost 30 years .
walta talks about a graffiti project by german artists in shanghai .
" our boys also painted something for the residents here .
what was interesting was that they tried to come into contact with the locals .
and suddenly the sad grey street became colorful , with some connection to the locals .
and in the course of time there was some problem and we were asked to remove the graffiti .
but then , little children and families stood up for us and said that we had come from a far away land and the graffiti was a gift for them .
they said it was their picture and they did not want it to be removed . "
walta has been to china many times and has been involved in various graffiti projects .
he hopes that the hip-hop project at the shanghai expo is not the last one .

the southern city of thatta has apparently been saved from being inundated , and many citizens who fled earlier are returning there . slowly , the focus is turning to the giant task of rebuilding the devastated areas .
the pakistani ngo akhuwat pakistan has launched an innovative plan to help flood victims in southern punjab stand on their own feet as soon as possible .
under the plan by akhuwat pakistan , flood-affected families are to receive microcredits in order to create employment opportunities for them .
the interest-free loans will come without difficult conditions attached .
the organisation 's executive director amjad saqib explains : " look , whatever is happening right now is relief work .
people need food , shelter , medicine . "
but this relief work will be over in one or two months , he adds . bildunterschrift : a boy receives food at a camp on the outskirt of sukkur in southern pakistan " and then the real challenge will come up - how to rehabilitate all these people !
how can they stand on their own feet again ?
so whereas we from akhuwat have been continuously engaged in relief work in the field , within two months we want to shift our focus on one of the worst-affected areas , rajanpur district .
our preparation , fund raising and resource mobilisation are going well , and god willing we 'll select 10,000 badly affected families and provide them with interest-free loans , thus enabling them to re-start the businesses they 've had to abandon due to this flood . "
rebuilding small businesses the flood victims will get between 10,000 and 30,000 rupees -lrb- between 92 and 276 euros -rrb- per family as an interest-free loan .
no security or documents are required , nor will there be any service charges .
according to izhar hashmi , director of akhuwat pakistan , the recipients will be able to buy seeds or raise goats or cattle with the money .
they might also open a small shop in their village or buy a donkey cart and start a transport business .
with the income generated , they 'll have to repay the loans within 30 months .
the money will then be free to be distributed again to other needy persons .
akhuwat plans to raise 150 million rupees -lrb- almost 1.4 million euros -rrb- in donations from pakistanis for the program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crossing a flooded road in punjab province on monday " we wo n't turn pakistanis into beggars , " says amjad saqib , " but want to harness their potential to work hard for a better future .
they 'll rise up on their own and stand on their own feet again . "
an alternative approach to microcredit akhuwat means " brotherhood " in arabic .
the organisation 's philosophy of providing loan-free microcredit is inspired by islamic teaching which prohibits the charging of interest , but it equally provides loans to non-muslims , such as members of the christian minority , relying on the local mosque and church infrastructure . akhuwat , which has been working in pakistan for more than nine years and claims a recovery rate for its loans of almost 100 per cent , is an interesting exception among the growing number of micro-finance institutions worldwide .
recently , criticism has grown of these microcredit groups , as many have been demanding high interest rates , which can become a problem for those who accept their loans .
some development experts have pointed to the akhuwat model , funded by charitable donations and charging no interest at all , as an alternative way .
for pakistani flood victims , it definitely comes as a welcome support in this time of crisis .

the southern city of thatta has apparently been saved from being inundated , and many citizens who fled earlier are returning there . slowly , the focus is turning to the giant task of rebuilding the devastated areas .
the pakistani ngo akhuwat pakistan has launched an innovative plan to help flood victims in southern punjab stand on their own feet as soon as possible .
under the plan by akhuwat pakistan , flood-affected families are to receive microcredits in order to create employment opportunities for them .
the interest-free loans will come without difficult conditions attached .
the organisation 's executive director amjad saqib explains : " look , whatever is happening right now is relief work .
people need food , shelter , medicine . "
but this relief work will be over in one or two months , he adds . bildunterschrift : a boy receives food at a camp on the outskirt of sukkur in southern pakistan " and then the real challenge will come up - how to rehabilitate all these people !
how can they stand on their own feet again ?
so whereas we from akhuwat have been continuously engaged in relief work in the field , within two months we want to shift our focus on one of the worst-affected areas , rajanpur district .
our preparation , fund raising and resource mobilisation are going well , and god willing we 'll select 10,000 badly affected families and provide them with interest-free loans , thus enabling them to re-start the businesses they 've had to abandon due to this flood . "
rebuilding small businesses the flood victims will get between 10,000 and 30,000 rupees -lrb- between 92 and 276 euros -rrb- per family as an interest-free loan .
no security or documents are required , nor will there be any service charges .
according to izhar hashmi , director of akhuwat pakistan , the recipients will be able to buy seeds or raise goats or cattle with the money .
they might also open a small shop in their village or buy a donkey cart and start a transport business .
with the income generated , they 'll have to repay the loans within 30 months .
the money will then be free to be distributed again to other needy persons .
akhuwat plans to raise 150 million rupees -lrb- almost 1.4 million euros -rrb- in donations from pakistanis for the program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crossing a flooded road in punjab province on monday " we wo n't turn pakistanis into beggars , " says amjad saqib , " but want to harness their potential to work hard for a better future .
they 'll rise up on their own and stand on their own feet again . "
an alternative approach to microcredit akhuwat means " brotherhood " in arabic .
the organisation 's philosophy of providing loan-free microcredit is inspired by islamic teaching which prohibits the charging of interest , but it equally provides loans to non-muslims , such as members of the christian minority , relying on the local mosque and church infrastructure . akhuwat , which has been working in pakistan for more than nine years and claims a recovery rate for its loans of almost 100 per cent , is an interesting exception among the growing number of micro-finance institutions worldwide .
recently , criticism has grown of these microcredit groups , as many have been demanding high interest rates , which can become a problem for those who accept their loans .
some development experts have pointed to the akhuwat model , funded by charitable donations and charging no interest at all , as an alternative way .
for pakistani flood victims , it definitely comes as a welcome support in this time of crisis .

the southern city of thatta has apparently been saved from being inundated , and many citizens who fled earlier are returning there . slowly , the focus is turning to the giant task of rebuilding the devastated areas .
the pakistani ngo akhuwat pakistan has launched an innovative plan to help flood victims in southern punjab stand on their own feet as soon as possible .
under the plan by akhuwat pakistan , flood-affected families are to receive microcredits in order to create employment opportunities for them .
the interest-free loans will come without difficult conditions attached .
the organisation 's executive director amjad saqib explains : " look , whatever is happening right now is relief work .
people need food , shelter , medicine . "
but this relief work will be over in one or two months , he adds . bildunterschrift : a boy receives food at a camp on the outskirt of sukkur in southern pakistan " and then the real challenge will come up - how to rehabilitate all these people !
how can they stand on their own feet again ?
so whereas we from akhuwat have been continuously engaged in relief work in the field , within two months we want to shift our focus on one of the worst-affected areas , rajanpur district .
our preparation , fund raising and resource mobilisation are going well , and god willing we 'll select 10,000 badly affected families and provide them with interest-free loans , thus enabling them to re-start the businesses they 've had to abandon due to this flood . "
rebuilding small businesses the flood victims will get between 10,000 and 30,000 rupees -lrb- between 92 and 276 euros -rrb- per family as an interest-free loan .
no security or documents are required , nor will there be any service charges .
according to izhar hashmi , director of akhuwat pakistan , the recipients will be able to buy seeds or raise goats or cattle with the money .
they might also open a small shop in their village or buy a donkey cart and start a transport business .
with the income generated , they 'll have to repay the loans within 30 months .
the money will then be free to be distributed again to other needy persons .
akhuwat plans to raise 150 million rupees -lrb- almost 1.4 million euros -rrb- in donations from pakistanis for the program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crossing a flooded road in punjab province on monday " we wo n't turn pakistanis into beggars , " says amjad saqib , " but want to harness their potential to work hard for a better future .
they 'll rise up on their own and stand on their own feet again . "
an alternative approach to microcredit akhuwat means " brotherhood " in arabic .
the organisation 's philosophy of providing loan-free microcredit is inspired by islamic teaching which prohibits the charging of interest , but it equally provides loans to non-muslims , such as members of the christian minority , relying on the local mosque and church infrastructure . akhuwat , which has been working in pakistan for more than nine years and claims a recovery rate for its loans of almost 100 per cent , is an interesting exception among the growing number of micro-finance institutions worldwide .
recently , criticism has grown of these microcredit groups , as many have been demanding high interest rates , which can become a problem for those who accept their loans .
some development experts have pointed to the akhuwat model , funded by charitable donations and charging no interest at all , as an alternative way .
for pakistani flood victims , it definitely comes as a welcome support in this time of crisis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 30.08.2010 us hedge funds sue porsche großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche 's attempt to acquire vw is still under investigation us hedge funds are taking legal action against porsche in a new york court for allegedly manipulating stock prices during its 2008 takeover tangle with volkswagen .
public prosecutors in stuttgart are investigating too . traders and hedge fund managers hate the weekends because they ca n't take react immediately to corporate announcements until trading floors reopen on monday .
sunday , october 26 , 2008 was a particularly bad day for 35 american hedge funds .
that was the day german sports carmaker porsche announced that it owned 42.6 percent of volkswagen 's common stock and options for another 31.5 percent - bringing its total stake in the company to 74.1 percent .
the announcement then declared porsche was seeking to obtain 75 percent of vw shares - a plan that eventually backfired .
the following morning saw a frenzy of trading activity .
hedge fund managers had long been betting that the price of vw stock would fall .
the financial crisis caused demand for cars to fall in the us , driving down american automakers ' share prices .
they figured it was only a matter of time until german carmakers suffered a similar fate .
as a result , their funds were borrowing vw shares and selling them on in the hope they could buy them back later at a lower price - a speculative strategy known as short selling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us fund managers say wendelin wiedeking misled investors about his plans but porsche 's weekend announcement made it clear that fund managers had sold more than double the number of vw shares actually available on the market .
the news drove vw 's stock price up from 290 euros to 1,005 euros per share , making it the world 's most valuable company for a short period of time .
the financial times estimates that hedge funds lost about 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- in two days of trading as a result .
transatlatic battle now the funds want porsche to pay them more than 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2 billion -rrb- in damages .
lawyers representing the hedge funds told a new york court that porsche committed securities fraud by leading investors to believe it was only seeking a 51-percent stake in vw .
porsche 's defense team is due to file a petition to dismiss the lawsuit on wednesday , according to german media .
analysts expect porsche to argue that it was only required to publicly disclose its takeover plans once they were approved by the board - and that that had not been the case prior to october 26 , 2008 .
the hedge funds ' claims may be helped by the fact that german prosecutors in the city of stuttgart are also examining claims that porsche managers manipulated the markets .
investigators are trying to establish whether former porsche chief wendelin wiedeking and his financial director holger haerter influenced stock prices by passing on insider information or misleading investors about the porsche 's plans to increase its stake in vw .
the american plaintiffs will have to be patient if they want to rely on evidence from germany , however .
the stuttgart prosecutors ' preliminary findings are n't due to be released until the end of 2010 or early 2011 .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel paid a visit to several power plants over the last week ensuring energy supplies the chancellor , citing an independent consultants ' report published this week , said such a time frame would ensure germany 's energy needs are met as the country transitions to renewable energy sources .
energy prices would remain under control and goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions would be reached with an extra 10 to 15 years of nuclear power , merkel added . " i have to consider , as head of government , how we integrate safety as the overriding principle of nuclear energy , " she said . sigmar gabriel , head of the opposition social democratic party , criticized merkel 's decision . " the chancellor 's statement shows that the decision is n't based on a sustainable energy plan but the hard-nosed lobbying work done by nuclear power companies , " he told reporters on sunday . clean energy groups agree with the opposition and point out that using nuclear and renewable energy sources in tandem is not efficient . " renewable energies are feeding into the system in a flexible way , depending on weather conditions for example , " bjoern klusmann , director of germany 's renewable energy association told deutsche welle . " because of the priority given to renewables in the german grid , the conventional power stations , so coal and nuclear and other fossil power stations , have to react in a flexible way to the production from renewables .
nuclear energy is not as flexible as is needed for this future concept of renewable energy being the dominant part in our grid , " he explained . in a statement on friday , merkel said renewable energies should supply half of all energy needs by 2050 and that nuclear and coal power would continue until supplies could be met entirely by clean energy , a strategy that clean energy experts like klusmann say is a false economy . " eighty percent of german power supply is in the hands of four big companies ... what we need is more competition in the field of energy and we get that if we phase out nuclear and allow investors to install new production capacity , " klusmann said . as long as nuclear power is granted such a high standing in the market , he argues , investment in renewables will be low , especially since the government has announced funding cuts in some types of renewables . legal question the debate over extending the running time of germany 's nuclear plants has sparked a deep debate in the german parliament .
merkel said any extension would come in a form that circumvents germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat . however , doubts have been raised by the interior and justice ministries that an extension of more than 10 years could be illegal if it were not approved by the bundesrat , which is made up of the governments of germany 's 16 states . germany has 17 nuclear power plants , but it is not certain how many would be given extensions if one is granted . a poll published on friday found that 56 percent of germans are against keeping nuclear power plants beyond 2021 . author : matt zuvela , nicole goebel -lrb- reuters / dpa / afp -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle spoke with coach marco kurz about the embattled club 's change of fortune . when marco kurz took over kaiserslautern in summer 2009 , the red devils ' situation was truly diabolical .
the former league champions had been reduced to battling against relegation from the second division - a consequence of poor investments and financial difficulties in the early years of the millennium . the club was also running through coaches at the rate of one roughly every 12 months . fast forward a little over a year to the second round of the 2010-11 season , and kaiserslautern are not just back in the top flight , but have beaten bayern munich . lautern 's 2-0 win over the reigning champs on friday was more about perspiration than inspiration .
the red devils stymied bayern with tight defending in midfield , and their thrusts forward were incisive enough to exploit lapses in concentration by munich . " we knew that this was a good time to play bayern munich , " kurz told deutsche welle after the victory .
" our opponents had a lot of national team players in their ranks who had n't yet gotten into the rhythm of practices .
we hoped that would give us a physical advantage . " kaiserslautern played physically against the champions , without a doubt .
but there was more to their game than just kicking their opponents ' shins . and while kurz remains modest , a lot of credit for their performance has to go to their coach . stay cool and read the rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mood has n't been this good at lautern since the 1990s in his playing career as a defender , kurz had the opportunity to work with and learn from some excellent coaches .
in 1994-5 , he was part of the borussia dortmund side that won the bundesliga under coach ottmar hitzfeld .
and two years later , he won the uefa cup with schalke under coach huub stevens . both hitzfeld and stevens are coaches who stress tactical discipline , and that quality seems to have rubbed off on kurz . " i had coaches with whom we trained really hard and i noticed , ' wow , physical fitness is definitely the basis for successful football , " ' kurz said .

the eu is preparing a strategy paper to secure a long-term supply of the increasingly necessary materials . it 's a little known fact that in order to stay in the technology manufacturing game , europe has to import some 40 rare metals and minerals .
it 's also a worrying fact because many of the materials used in the production of objects like cell phones and energy efficient lamps are either in limited supply or kept at artificially low levels by china . according to the eu commission , 14 of these rare earths , as they are called , are particularly scarce and are either only available in china or are mined for unrealistic prices elsewhere . while china is key to these materials finding their way to the world market , gwenole cozigou , the commission 's director for chemical , metals , forest-based and textile industries , is worried about the length of beijing 's arm . he said although negotiations with the chinese government over commodity trade are ongoing , foreign buyers are being forced to process rare earths into half-finished products on chinese soil . " china wants to build an industry and that is a perfectly acceptable goal , but if it violates trade regulations we will take action , " cozigou said .
in this case , that means teaming up with the united states and mexico to contact a world trade organization arbitration tribunal . taking on china hubertus bardt , raw materials expert from the institute for economic research in cologne , told deutsche welle it 's up to the eu to make sure china does not exploit its monopoly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tantal is used in micro-processors " one could threaten to impose import restrictions on chinese products , but nobody wants that and ultimately it would harm us , too , " he said .
" but there are always new trade talks and political discussions , and it 's important to use them to prioritize this problem . " it 's a problem which he said he believes will only get worse as fast-growing , emerging nations become ever more dependent upon technology . " there are a number of indications to suggest an increase in demand for these raw materials , " he said .
" firstly there is growth in china , then growth in india and brazil and then technical developments such as electromobility , solar panels and energy efficient lamps . " the role of developing countries besides entering into trade talks and exerting political pressure to secure itself a supply of rare earths , the eu is also keen to work in close cooperation with other developing countries known to have reserves of the raw materials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the democratic republic of congo has deposits of coltan the bloc has already begun negotiations with the african union , but is not , cozigou stressed , offering development aid in return for rare earths . " african countries have to realize that the extraction of raw materials at a fair price is advantageous for their own advancement , " he said , adding that it was the only way to attract potential european investors . but bardt said there is a place for development aid if it helps countries with reserves to establish the kind of market systems and institutions which would ultimately be of benefit to europe . time to recycle according to the eu 's observations , beijing secures entry to the coveted raw materials through the aggressive acquisition of foreign mining companies and land and by making donations to the relevant regimes .
experts say it is a problem , not least because there are very few rare earth mining companies left around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old phones should be recycled to recover reusable materials - not binned that being the case , the european union is supporting scientists looking for rare earths and is pushing for more recycling of raw materials from old mobile phones , televisions and cars . " we have our own mines in our cities across europe , " cozigou said , adding that the eu is currently working towards tightening regulations governing the export of electronic scrap and car wrecks .
" the eu wants what has previously been considered electronic garbage to be deemed valuable raw materials . " autor : bernd riegert / tkw editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i had coaches with whom we trained really hard and i noticed , ' wow , physical fitness is definitely the basis for successful football , " ' kurz said .
" we had unbelievable discipline under huub stevens , especially in his treatment of the team .
i learned that footballers need that .
footballers need hard and fast rules . " those rules are not just about behavior , but what players do on the pitch . " the players have clear instructions in matches how they are to play their positions , " kurz said .
" the individual parts of the team - defense , midfield and attack - receive clear instructions , and you hope they work as a collective .
there 's no one on the pitch without instructions and a plan . " but the skill has to be there for players to execute the coach 's plan .
and this kaiserslautern squad features a very particular collection of skills . bildunterschrift : striker srdjan lakic is one of lautern 's new , inexpensive stars the cast-off crew kaiserslautern used to be a breeding ground for german talent - club alumni include andy brehme , miroslav klose and michael ballack .
those days are long gone .
of the current starting 11 , only goalkeeper tobias sippel is a homegrown product . instead , kaiserslautern have built their squad around eastern european players and underrated castoffs from other clubs .
lautern 's offensive duo srdan lakic and ivo ilicevic came for cheap from hertha berlin and bochum respectively . those two clubs now play in division two , while lakic and ilicevic scored five goals between them in the first pair of matches in the top flight . martin amedick and rodnei , the heart of the defense , were also picked up for a song from bigger clubs where they failed to make their mark . " in terms of the makeup of the squad , we chose players who have reason to be hungry , who have to show they 're good enough for division one , " kurz said .
" we did without established veterans , because we wanted to say , ' look , the guys who got us promoted have the necessary quality . " ' bildunterschrift : the red devils are once again inspiring fear in foes kaiserslautern 's career revivalists have also reanimated crowds . with a home city of only around 100,000 inhabitants , kaiserslautern inhabit one of the smallest markets in the bundesliga .
the football club play an especially important role in local culture , and in the team 's heyday , opponents used to hate playing in fritz walter stadium in front of especially passionate fans . that twelfth-man spirit is now back . " you could see how everyone was drinking in the first division , " kurz said .
" everyone was slavering for it , and now it 's here , and we have a duty to show we 're up to the top flight . with a perfect record , three points earned against germany 's top team and a restored relationship with their supporters , marco kurz 's kaiserslautern are well on their way to proving precisely that . marco kurz was interviewed by kamilla jarzina for dw-tv 's bundesliga kick-off , which is broadcast every monday / tuesday .

the eu is preparing a strategy paper to secure a long-term supply of the increasingly necessary materials . it 's a little known fact that in order to stay in the technology manufacturing game , europe has to import some 40 rare metals and minerals .
it 's also a worrying fact because many of the materials used in the production of objects like cell phones and energy efficient lamps are either in limited supply or kept at artificially low levels by china . according to the eu commission , 14 of these rare earths , as they are called , are particularly scarce and are either only available in china or are mined for unrealistic prices elsewhere . while china is key to these materials finding their way to the world market , gwenole cozigou , the commission 's director for chemical , metals , forest-based and textile industries , is worried about the length of beijing 's arm . he said although negotiations with the chinese government over commodity trade are ongoing , foreign buyers are being forced to process rare earths into half-finished products on chinese soil .

deutsche welle spoke with coach marco kurz about the embattled club 's change of fortune . when marco kurz took over kaiserslautern in summer 2009 , the red devils ' situation was truly diabolical .
the former league champions had been reduced to battling against relegation from the second division - a consequence of poor investments and financial difficulties in the early years of the millennium . the club was also running through coaches at the rate of one roughly every 12 months . fast forward a little over a year to the second round of the 2010-11 season , and kaiserslautern are not just back in the top flight , but have beaten bayern munich . lautern 's 2-0 win over the reigning champs on friday was more about perspiration than inspiration .
the red devils stymied bayern with tight defending in midfield , and their thrusts forward were incisive enough to exploit lapses in concentration by munich . " we knew that this was a good time to play bayern munich , " kurz told deutsche welle after the victory .
" our opponents had a lot of national team players in their ranks who had n't yet gotten into the rhythm of practices .
we hoped that would give us a physical advantage . " kaiserslautern played physically against the champions , without a doubt .

in 1994-5 , he was part of the borussia dortmund side that won the bundesliga under coach ottmar hitzfeld .
and two years later , he won the uefa cup with schalke under coach huub stevens . both hitzfeld and stevens are coaches who stress tactical discipline , and that quality seems to have rubbed off on kurz . " i had coaches with whom we trained really hard and i noticed , ' wow , physical fitness is definitely the basis for successful football , " ' kurz said .
" we had unbelievable discipline under huub stevens , especially in his treatment of the team .
i learned that footballers need that .
footballers need hard and fast rules . " those rules are not just about behavior , but what players do on the pitch . " the players have clear instructions in matches how they are to play their positions , " kurz said .
" the individual parts of the team - defense , midfield and attack - receive clear instructions , and you hope they work as a collective .
there 's no one on the pitch without instructions and a plan . " but the skill has to be there for players to execute the coach 's plan .
and this kaiserslautern squad features a very particular collection of skills . bildunterschrift : striker srdjan lakic is one of lautern 's new , inexpensive stars the cast-off crew kaiserslautern used to be a breeding ground for german talent - club alumni include andy brehme , miroslav klose and michael ballack .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 30.08.2010 coach marco kurz and new-look kaiserslautern are turning heads großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marco kurz - disciplined and passionate few predicted newly promoted kasierslautern would win their first two matches , especially as one of their foes was bayern munich .
deutsche welle spoke with coach marco kurz about the embattled club 's change of fortune . when marco kurz took over kaiserslautern in summer 2009 , the red devils ' situation was truly diabolical .
the former league champions had been reduced to battling against relegation from the second division - a consequence of poor investments and financial difficulties in the early years of the millennium . the club was also running through coaches at the rate of one roughly every 12 months . fast forward a little over a year to the second round of the 2010-11 season , and kaiserslautern are not just back in the top flight , but have beaten bayern munich . lautern 's 2-0 win over the reigning champs on friday was more about perspiration than inspiration .
the red devils stymied bayern with tight defending in midfield , and their thrusts forward were incisive enough to exploit lapses in concentration by munich . " we knew that this was a good time to play bayern munich , " kurz told deutsche welle after the victory .
" our opponents had a lot of national team players in their ranks who had n't yet gotten into the rhythm of practices .
we hoped that would give us a physical advantage . " kaiserslautern played physically against the champions , without a doubt .
but there was more to their game than just kicking their opponents ' shins . and while kurz remains modest , a lot of credit for their performance has to go to their coach . stay cool and read the rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mood has n't been this good at lautern since the 1990s in his playing career as a defender , kurz had the opportunity to work with and learn from some excellent coaches .
in 1994-5 , he was part of the borussia dortmund side that won the bundesliga under coach ottmar hitzfeld .
and two years later , he won the uefa cup with schalke under coach huub stevens . both hitzfeld and stevens are coaches who stress tactical discipline , and that quality seems to have rubbed off on kurz . " i had coaches with whom we trained really hard and i noticed , ' wow , physical fitness is definitely the basis for successful football , " ' kurz said .
" we had unbelievable discipline under huub stevens , especially in his treatment of the team .
i learned that footballers need that .
footballers need hard and fast rules . " those rules are not just about behavior , but what players do on the pitch . " the players have clear instructions in matches how they are to play their positions , " kurz said .
" the individual parts of the team - defense , midfield and attack - receive clear instructions , and you hope they work as a collective .
there 's no one on the pitch without instructions and a plan . " but the skill has to be there for players to execute the coach 's plan .
and this kaiserslautern squad features a very particular collection of skills . bildunterschrift : striker srdjan lakic is one of lautern 's new , inexpensive stars the cast-off crew kaiserslautern used to be a breeding ground for german talent - club alumni include andy brehme , miroslav klose and michael ballack .
those days are long gone .
of the current starting 11 , only goalkeeper tobias sippel is a homegrown product . instead , kaiserslautern have built their squad around eastern european players and underrated castoffs from other clubs .
lautern 's offensive duo srdan lakic and ivo ilicevic came for cheap from hertha berlin and bochum respectively . those two clubs now play in division two , while lakic and ilicevic scored five goals between them in the first pair of matches in the top flight . martin amedick and rodnei , the heart of the defense , were also picked up for a song from bigger clubs where they failed to make their mark . " in terms of the makeup of the squad , we chose players who have reason to be hungry , who have to show they 're good enough for division one , " kurz said .
" we did without established veterans , because we wanted to say , ' look , the guys who got us promoted have the necessary quality . " ' bildunterschrift : the red devils are once again inspiring fear in foes kaiserslautern 's career revivalists have also reanimated crowds . with a home city of only around 100,000 inhabitants , kaiserslautern inhabit one of the smallest markets in the bundesliga .
the football club play an especially important role in local culture , and in the team 's heyday , opponents used to hate playing in fritz walter stadium in front of especially passionate fans . that twelfth-man spirit is now back . " you could see how everyone was drinking in the first division , " kurz said .
" everyone was slavering for it , and now it 's here , and we have a duty to show we 're up to the top flight . with a perfect record , three points earned against germany 's top team and a restored relationship with their supporters , marco kurz 's kaiserslautern are well on their way to proving precisely that . marco kurz was interviewed by kamilla jarzina for dw-tv 's bundesliga kick-off , which is broadcast every monday / tuesday .

the eu is preparing a strategy paper to secure a long-term supply of the increasingly necessary materials . it 's a little known fact that in order to stay in the technology manufacturing game , europe has to import some 40 rare metals and minerals .
it 's also a worrying fact because many of the materials used in the production of objects like cell phones and energy efficient lamps are either in limited supply or kept at artificially low levels by china . according to the eu commission , 14 of these rare earths , as they are called , are particularly scarce and are either only available in china or are mined for unrealistic prices elsewhere . while china is key to these materials finding their way to the world market , gwenole cozigou , the commission 's director for chemical , metals , forest-based and textile industries , is worried about the length of beijing 's arm . he said although negotiations with the chinese government over commodity trade are ongoing , foreign buyers are being forced to process rare earths into half-finished products on chinese soil . " china wants to build an industry and that is a perfectly acceptable goal , but if it violates trade regulations we will take action , " cozigou said .
in this case , that means teaming up with the united states and mexico to contact a world trade organization arbitration tribunal . taking on china hubertus bardt , raw materials expert from the institute for economic research in cologne , told deutsche welle it 's up to the eu to make sure china does not exploit its monopoly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tantal is used in micro-processors " one could threaten to impose import restrictions on chinese products , but nobody wants that and ultimately it would harm us , too , " he said .
" but there are always new trade talks and political discussions , and it 's important to use them to prioritize this problem . " it 's a problem which he said he believes will only get worse as fast-growing , emerging nations become ever more dependent upon technology . " there are a number of indications to suggest an increase in demand for these raw materials , " he said .
" firstly there is growth in china , then growth in india and brazil and then technical developments such as electromobility , solar panels and energy efficient lamps . " the role of developing countries besides entering into trade talks and exerting political pressure to secure itself a supply of rare earths , the eu is also keen to work in close cooperation with other developing countries known to have reserves of the raw materials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the democratic republic of congo has deposits of coltan the bloc has already begun negotiations with the african union , but is not , cozigou stressed , offering development aid in return for rare earths . " african countries have to realize that the extraction of raw materials at a fair price is advantageous for their own advancement , " he said , adding that it was the only way to attract potential european investors . but bardt said there is a place for development aid if it helps countries with reserves to establish the kind of market systems and institutions which would ultimately be of benefit to europe . time to recycle according to the eu 's observations , beijing secures entry to the coveted raw materials through the aggressive acquisition of foreign mining companies and land and by making donations to the relevant regimes .
experts say it is a problem , not least because there are very few rare earth mining companies left around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old phones should be recycled to recover reusable materials - not binned that being the case , the european union is supporting scientists looking for rare earths and is pushing for more recycling of raw materials from old mobile phones , televisions and cars . " we have our own mines in our cities across europe , " cozigou said , adding that the eu is currently working towards tightening regulations governing the export of electronic scrap and car wrecks .

the president had hoped to focus on economic issues . in an interview with deutsche welle and other german media ahead of his visit to berlin on monday , ukrainian president viktor yanukovych said he hopes to focus on economic issues when he meets german chancellor angela merkel .
however , it appears that concerns about freedom of the press threaten to overshadow the visit .
the role of valeriy khoroshkovskyi , who is both the head of ukraine 's security intelligence service and a media entrepreneur , also came under focus .
what expectation do you have of this trip to germany ?
what do you hope for from this visit ?
viktor yanukovych : i hope this visit will open up a new chapter in relations between ukraine and germany .
the main aim of our foreign policy is that we fulfill our obligations .
we are involved in pursuing these commitments .
an important issue that we are paying special attention to is making the economy more important in our foreign policy .
in practice , that means the reform plan that i announced recently should serve to create new possibilities for foreign investors .
we are trying to overcome a lot of bureaucratic hurdles that stand in the way of investors .
the system of permits and licenses in place until now has placed a considerable burden on the economy .
we have already halved the number of licenses and different permits .
this system will conform to european standards .
for that reason , i expect only positive outcomes from this visit to germany .

initially it was said that there had been a misunderstanding .
then there was talk of interference in internal affairs .
what was that about ?
every security service has its job to do .
information gets shared .
conflicts that arise are resolved through negotiations between both sides .
i gave my personal instructions to the chief of staff of the security service and also to the foreign minister .
we were able to resolve this very quickly with germany and therefore the case for us is settled .
we hear that you lightly admonished intelligence chief valeriy khoroshkovskyi after this incident , to put it mildly .
is that true ?
when conflicts arise , one must be careful .
there is no doubt , a warning had to be given .
and that 's what i did .
one subject that is also closely watched in germany is the issue of press freedom .
journalists report growing political pressure and in some cases , abuse .
in court , there is a case being contested about whether two tv stations should be allowed to keep their licenses .
several days ago , a journalist in the east of the country disappeared .
how do you assess these developments ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : press freedom is an issue of growing concern in ukraine i am of the view that all conflicts must be solved through the courts .
i can not imagine that in these cases pressure would be put on the court and that courts would make biased decisions .
every court decision is binding for the executive and also must be observed by the mass media . ´ i have had many meetings and encounters concerning freedom of expression and i sometimes ask journalists to tell me or give me proper examples where there is obstruction of freedom of expression .
for me it is important to have concrete , named cases and until i have them , it would not be right to pass judgment .
i have two cases .
first , the director of the television channel tvi claims he was shadowed by people from the secret service .
secondly , i heard from my own contact here in the ukraine that she was summoned to have conversations with people from the intelligence service and asked about my work .
i consider that to be an attempt to intimidate my contact .
are these cases known to you , and how would you categorize them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : questions were raised about intelligence boss valeriy khoroshkovskyi well , this is the first time i have heard that there are such cases .
when there really are such cases then you need to report them officially .
where the first issue is concerned , it hardly seems realistic to me that journalists would be monitored in this way .
i do n't believe that .
anyway , there has been no case that i have been informed about .
as far as journalists being summoned to have conversations with the intelligence service is concerned , i am also hearing that for the first time .
i really would ask you to tell me specifically which journalist was summoned , when , and where to .
i have already submitted these cases officially to the intelligence service a couple of weeks ago .
apparently it has not been forwarded .
so , i would pose the question : do you believe , after so many incidents , that your secret services chief is still the right man to be in this position ?
i ask this in consideration of his connected interests as intelligence chief , media entrepreneur and member of the highest council of justice .
i would say the security chief performs his job in a quite normal manner .
this work has no connection at all with the activities of the mass media .
regarding his assets , he has handed over their administration of his assets to relatives .
we have many officials who also have had assets and , according to the law , the management of these assets have been handed over to trustees .
as far as i know , that happens not only in the ukraine , but also all over the world .

" i have to consider , as head of government , how we integrate safety as the overriding principle of nuclear energy , " she said . sigmar gabriel , head of the opposition social democratic party , criticized merkel 's decision .

nuclear energy is not as flexible as is needed for this future concept of renewable energy being the dominant part in our grid , " he explained . in a statement on friday , merkel said renewable energies should supply half of all energy needs by 2050 and that nuclear and coal power would continue until supplies could be met entirely by clean energy , a strategy that clean energy experts like klusmann say is a false economy . " eighty percent of german power supply is in the hands of four big companies ... what we need is more competition in the field of energy and we get that if we phase out nuclear and allow investors to install new production capacity , " klusmann said . as long as nuclear power is granted such a high standing in the market , he argues , investment in renewables will be low , especially since the government has announced funding cuts in some types of renewables . legal question the debate over extending the running time of germany 's nuclear plants has sparked a deep debate in the german parliament .
merkel said any extension would come in a form that circumvents germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat . however , doubts have been raised by the interior and justice ministries that an extension of more than 10 years could be illegal if it were not approved by the bundesrat , which is made up of the governments of germany 's 16 states . germany has 17 nuclear power plants , but it is not certain how many would be given extensions if one is granted . a poll published on friday found that 56 percent of germans are against keeping nuclear power plants beyond 2021 . author : matt zuvela , nicole goebel -lrb- reuters / dpa / afp -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

socialist leader elio di rupo has offered to step down , saying he could not reconcile deep political differences . belgium 's french-speaking socialist party leader elio di rupo has been told he must press ahead with talks to form a new government , 10 weeks after parliamentary elections failed to produce a clear winner .
di rupo visited the palace of monarch king albert ii on sunday to offer his resignation after failing to build a working coalition government .
the pair were in discussion for three hours , a palace statement said .
" the king refused and asked him -lsb- di rupo -rsb- to pursue his mission , " the statement read , and di rupo had " accepted " the task .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the dispute is over funding to brussels a marathon 10 hours of crisis talks broke up without a deal earlier on sunday , with di rupo telling reporters there was no agreement between his party and two flemish parties - the nationalist n-va and the center-right christian democrats .
di rupo added that the sides were " incompatible . "
linguistic and economic divide parliamentary elections in june led to the deadlock , with neither the parties from dutch-speaking flanders nor center-left parties from french-speaking wallonia winning an outright majority .
di rupo has been tasked with balancing flemish demands for more powers for flanders and the concerns of french speakers , who worry that their less-prosperous region will lose out in any devolution process .
another major point of division between the two sides is over government finances for the officially-bilingual capital of brussels .
the failure to establish a government is widely viewed as an embarrassment for belgium , which currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de tourism -pipe- 30.08.2010 star ratings under pressure as hotels struggle to fill rooms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurter hof is holding on to its five star rating as hotels grapple with dwindling bookings and increasingly thrifty customers , some major chains have started dropping star ratings in an effort to attract more guests , especially business travelers . hotel managers worldwide are under pressure to come up with new ways to lure guests into their often pricey hotel rooms , especially since the industry took a hit during the global economic crisis .
hotel occupancy levels in germany dropped 5.8 percent in 2009 while prices fell 4.3 percent , according to the german association of hotels and restaurants -lrb- dehoga -rrb- .
five stars ?
no thanks big chains in urban areas are keen to attract as many business travelers as possible , but companies ' budgets are tight and some chains find that a five star rating puts customers off .
" we 've seen a change over the last one and a half years ; that customers are being criticized by their company when booking accommodation , and obviously in the five star area , were encouraged not to book there anymore , " robert van der ham , general manager at the intercontinental hotel in cologne told deutsche welle .
" we in the five star segment have lost quite a bit of business compared to hotels with three and four stars , " he explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the intercontinental in cologne used to be a five star plus hotel the intercontinental in cologne , which used to be a five star plus hotel , is not the only example .
the traditional dom-hotel , near cologne 's famous cathedral , has also decided to relinquish its star rating , as has the entire marriott chain .
other groups , like the intercontinental , hilton hotels and germany 's steigenberger chain , have decided to mix and match official star ratings with their own systems .
" it is the decision of the individual hotel .
it depends on what 's going on in their market and their destination and whether it makes sense to be classified because competitors are classified , for example , " angelika heyer , spokesperson for steigenberger hotels said .
no international standards steigenberger 's flagship , the frankfurter hof in the heart of germany 's financial capital , has a five star rating , but heyer says the lack of internationally recognized star standards means hotels nowadays often rely on a strong brand image instead .
" we have our own classification ...
we have comfort , first class and deluxe , and this is understood worldwide .
the brand and the price is what counts today for the traveler , " heyer explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van der ham says business has picked up since he gave up the star rating van der ham from the intercontinental in cologne could not agree more .
" for us , it 's important to see that guests still want service and quality , but at a lesser price and that is a challenge nowadays , " he said .
defending the stars prior to 1996 there were no binding rules for hotel stars in germany or elsewhere , so hotels would simply devise their own system and award themselves stars .
now , there are standard criteria for each star category , with test and awards carried out by dehoga , which represents the hotel industry in germany .
now a five star-rated hotel needs to provide , amongst other things , a 24-hour reception with multilingual staff , a one hour ironing service and every guest has to be met in person with fresh flowers or an equivalent in every room .
dehoga is in the process of harmonizing standards for star ratings across europe .
the association insists that stars are of particular importance to smaller , independent hotels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hotel star ratings in germany are valid for three years so far , germany , sweden , the netherlands , austria , hungary , switzerland and the czech republic have joined the scheme .
" if you do n't have a brand , the message is clear from our point of view .
you should ask for voluntary stars .
it gives a clear message to the consumer , " dehoga general manager markus luthe told deutsche welle .
of the roughly 22,000 hotels in germany , 8,000 are star-rated .
most of them are hotels that are not part of a well-known chain and thus do not have a strong brand image .
impact of social media one of the factors driving hotels away from star ratings is the growing popularity of review websites , where guests are free to leave comments and rate hotels according to their own experience .
" at this moment , i think social media is taking a far more prominent position than dehoga -lrb- and its star ratings system -rrb- , van der ham said .
" if we go to the various platforms there are for customers to go and have a look , it 's quite amazing what is out there , " he said , adding that the chain has a team that regularly scours review sites for comments to use on hotel-specific websites .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social media can help hotels assess how guests rate their service staff but dehoga thinks social media and star ratings do not have to be mutually exclusive and can , in fact , complement each other .
" we can not check adequately , for instance , the friendliness of the staff , but the reviews -lrb- on the web -rrb- can give an additional image of the hotel and then you have the complete picture , " luthe said .
dehoga even wants to go a step further and base star ratings partly on review comments by , for example , boosting a four star rating to a four star plus rating , which is between four and five stars , according to customers ' evaluations .
whichever system guests choose to rely on , service and price is at the heart of every hotel 's business , especially in times of economic hardship .

hotel occupancy levels in germany dropped 5.8 percent in 2009 while prices fell 4.3 percent , according to the german association of hotels and restaurants -lrb- dehoga -rrb- .
five stars ?
no thanks big chains in urban areas are keen to attract as many business travelers as possible , but companies ' budgets are tight and some chains find that a five star rating puts customers off .
" we 've seen a change over the last one and a half years ; that customers are being criticized by their company when booking accommodation , and obviously in the five star area , were encouraged not to book there anymore , " robert van der ham , general manager at the intercontinental hotel in cologne told deutsche welle .
" we in the five star segment have lost quite a bit of business compared to hotels with three and four stars , " he explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the intercontinental in cologne used to be a five star plus hotel the intercontinental in cologne , which used to be a five star plus hotel , is not the only example .
the traditional dom-hotel , near cologne 's famous cathedral , has also decided to relinquish its star rating , as has the entire marriott chain .
other groups , like the intercontinental , hilton hotels and germany 's steigenberger chain , have decided to mix and match official star ratings with their own systems .
" it is the decision of the individual hotel .
it depends on what 's going on in their market and their destination and whether it makes sense to be classified because competitors are classified , for example , " angelika heyer , spokesperson for steigenberger hotels said .
no international standards steigenberger 's flagship , the frankfurter hof in the heart of germany 's financial capital , has a five star rating , but heyer says the lack of internationally recognized star standards means hotels nowadays often rely on a strong brand image instead .
" we have our own classification ...
we have comfort , first class and deluxe , and this is understood worldwide .
the brand and the price is what counts today for the traveler , " heyer explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van der ham says business has picked up since he gave up the star rating van der ham from the intercontinental in cologne could not agree more .
" for us , it 's important to see that guests still want service and quality , but at a lesser price and that is a challenge nowadays , " he said .
defending the stars prior to 1996 there were no binding rules for hotel stars in germany or elsewhere , so hotels would simply devise their own system and award themselves stars .
now , there are standard criteria for each star category , with test and awards carried out by dehoga , which represents the hotel industry in germany .
now a five star-rated hotel needs to provide , amongst other things , a 24-hour reception with multilingual staff , a one hour ironing service and every guest has to be met in person with fresh flowers or an equivalent in every room .
dehoga is in the process of harmonizing standards for star ratings across europe .
the association insists that stars are of particular importance to smaller , independent hotels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hotel star ratings in germany are valid for three years so far , germany , sweden , the netherlands , austria , hungary , switzerland and the czech republic have joined the scheme .
" if you do n't have a brand , the message is clear from our point of view .
you should ask for voluntary stars .
it gives a clear message to the consumer , " dehoga general manager markus luthe told deutsche welle .
of the roughly 22,000 hotels in germany , 8,000 are star-rated .
most of them are hotels that are not part of a well-known chain and thus do not have a strong brand image .
impact of social media one of the factors driving hotels away from star ratings is the growing popularity of review websites , where guests are free to leave comments and rate hotels according to their own experience .
" at this moment , i think social media is taking a far more prominent position than dehoga -lrb- and its star ratings system -rrb- , van der ham said .
" if we go to the various platforms there are for customers to go and have a look , it 's quite amazing what is out there , " he said , adding that the chain has a team that regularly scours review sites for comments to use on hotel-specific websites .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social media can help hotels assess how guests rate their service staff but dehoga thinks social media and star ratings do not have to be mutually exclusive and can , in fact , complement each other .
" we can not check adequately , for instance , the friendliness of the staff , but the reviews -lrb- on the web -rrb- can give an additional image of the hotel and then you have the complete picture , " luthe said .
dehoga even wants to go a step further and base star ratings partly on review comments by , for example , boosting a four star rating to a four star plus rating , which is between four and five stars , according to customers ' evaluations .
whichever system guests choose to rely on , service and price is at the heart of every hotel 's business , especially in times of economic hardship .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 30.08.2010 rare earths keep technology moving in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rare earths are essential ingredients for technological advances as the world becomes more dependent on technology , it also becomes more reliant upon rare metals and minerals .
the eu is preparing a strategy paper to secure a long-term supply of the increasingly necessary materials . it 's a little known fact that in order to stay in the technology manufacturing game , europe has to import some 40 rare metals and minerals .
it 's also a worrying fact because many of the materials used in the production of objects like cell phones and energy efficient lamps are either in limited supply or kept at artificially low levels by china . according to the eu commission , 14 of these rare earths , as they are called , are particularly scarce and are either only available in china or are mined for unrealistic prices elsewhere . while china is key to these materials finding their way to the world market , gwenole cozigou , the commission 's director for chemical , metals , forest-based and textile industries , is worried about the length of beijing 's arm . he said although negotiations with the chinese government over commodity trade are ongoing , foreign buyers are being forced to process rare earths into half-finished products on chinese soil . " china wants to build an industry and that is a perfectly acceptable goal , but if it violates trade regulations we will take action , " cozigou said .
in this case , that means teaming up with the united states and mexico to contact a world trade organization arbitration tribunal . taking on china hubertus bardt , raw materials expert from the institute for economic research in cologne , told deutsche welle it 's up to the eu to make sure china does not exploit its monopoly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tantal is used in micro-processors " one could threaten to impose import restrictions on chinese products , but nobody wants that and ultimately it would harm us , too , " he said .
" but there are always new trade talks and political discussions , and it 's important to use them to prioritize this problem . " it 's a problem which he said he believes will only get worse as fast-growing , emerging nations become ever more dependent upon technology . " there are a number of indications to suggest an increase in demand for these raw materials , " he said .
" firstly there is growth in china , then growth in india and brazil and then technical developments such as electromobility , solar panels and energy efficient lamps . " the role of developing countries besides entering into trade talks and exerting political pressure to secure itself a supply of rare earths , the eu is also keen to work in close cooperation with other developing countries known to have reserves of the raw materials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the democratic republic of congo has deposits of coltan the bloc has already begun negotiations with the african union , but is not , cozigou stressed , offering development aid in return for rare earths . " african countries have to realize that the extraction of raw materials at a fair price is advantageous for their own advancement , " he said , adding that it was the only way to attract potential european investors . but bardt said there is a place for development aid if it helps countries with reserves to establish the kind of market systems and institutions which would ultimately be of benefit to europe . time to recycle according to the eu 's observations , beijing secures entry to the coveted raw materials through the aggressive acquisition of foreign mining companies and land and by making donations to the relevant regimes .
experts say it is a problem , not least because there are very few rare earth mining companies left around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old phones should be recycled to recover reusable materials - not binned that being the case , the european union is supporting scientists looking for rare earths and is pushing for more recycling of raw materials from old mobile phones , televisions and cars . " we have our own mines in our cities across europe , " cozigou said , adding that the eu is currently working towards tightening regulations governing the export of electronic scrap and car wrecks .
" the eu wants what has previously been considered electronic garbage to be deemed valuable raw materials . " autor : bernd riegert / tkw editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de tourism -pipe- 30.08.2010 star ratings under pressure as hotels struggle to fill rooms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurter hof is holding on to its five star rating as hotels grapple with dwindling bookings and increasingly thrifty customers , some major chains have started dropping star ratings in an effort to attract more guests , especially business travelers . hotel managers worldwide are under pressure to come up with new ways to lure guests into their often pricey hotel rooms , especially since the industry took a hit during the global economic crisis .
hotel occupancy levels in germany dropped 5.8 percent in 2009 while prices fell 4.3 percent , according to the german association of hotels and restaurants -lrb- dehoga -rrb- .
five stars ?
no thanks big chains in urban areas are keen to attract as many business travelers as possible , but companies ' budgets are tight and some chains find that a five star rating puts customers off .
" we 've seen a change over the last one and a half years ; that customers are being criticized by their company when booking accommodation , and obviously in the five star area , were encouraged not to book there anymore , " robert van der ham , general manager at the intercontinental hotel in cologne told deutsche welle .
" we in the five star segment have lost quite a bit of business compared to hotels with three and four stars , " he explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the intercontinental in cologne used to be a five star plus hotel the intercontinental in cologne , which used to be a five star plus hotel , is not the only example .
the traditional dom-hotel , near cologne 's famous cathedral , has also decided to relinquish its star rating , as has the entire marriott chain .
other groups , like the intercontinental , hilton hotels and germany 's steigenberger chain , have decided to mix and match official star ratings with their own systems .
" it is the decision of the individual hotel .
it depends on what 's going on in their market and their destination and whether it makes sense to be classified because competitors are classified , for example , " angelika heyer , spokesperson for steigenberger hotels said .

hotel occupancy levels in germany dropped 5.8 percent in 2009 while prices fell 4.3 percent , according to the german association of hotels and restaurants -lrb- dehoga -rrb- .
five stars ?
no thanks big chains in urban areas are keen to attract as many business travelers as possible , but companies ' budgets are tight and some chains find that a five star rating puts customers off .
" we 've seen a change over the last one and a half years ; that customers are being criticized by their company when booking accommodation , and obviously in the five star area , were encouraged not to book there anymore , " robert van der ham , general manager at the intercontinental hotel in cologne told deutsche welle .
" we in the five star segment have lost quite a bit of business compared to hotels with three and four stars , " he explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the intercontinental in cologne used to be a five star plus hotel the intercontinental in cologne , which used to be a five star plus hotel , is not the only example .
the traditional dom-hotel , near cologne 's famous cathedral , has also decided to relinquish its star rating , as has the entire marriott chain .
other groups , like the intercontinental , hilton hotels and germany 's steigenberger chain , have decided to mix and match official star ratings with their own systems .
" it is the decision of the individual hotel .
it depends on what 's going on in their market and their destination and whether it makes sense to be classified because competitors are classified , for example , " angelika heyer , spokesperson for steigenberger hotels said .
no international standards steigenberger 's flagship , the frankfurter hof in the heart of germany 's financial capital , has a five star rating , but heyer says the lack of internationally recognized star standards means hotels nowadays often rely on a strong brand image instead .
" we have our own classification ...
we have comfort , first class and deluxe , and this is understood worldwide .
the brand and the price is what counts today for the traveler , " heyer explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van der ham says business has picked up since he gave up the star rating van der ham from the intercontinental in cologne could not agree more .
" for us , it 's important to see that guests still want service and quality , but at a lesser price and that is a challenge nowadays , " he said .
defending the stars prior to 1996 there were no binding rules for hotel stars in germany or elsewhere , so hotels would simply devise their own system and award themselves stars .
now , there are standard criteria for each star category , with test and awards carried out by dehoga , which represents the hotel industry in germany .
now a five star-rated hotel needs to provide , amongst other things , a 24-hour reception with multilingual staff , a one hour ironing service and every guest has to be met in person with fresh flowers or an equivalent in every room .
dehoga is in the process of harmonizing standards for star ratings across europe .
the association insists that stars are of particular importance to smaller , independent hotels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hotel star ratings in germany are valid for three years so far , germany , sweden , the netherlands , austria , hungary , switzerland and the czech republic have joined the scheme .
" if you do n't have a brand , the message is clear from our point of view .
you should ask for voluntary stars .
it gives a clear message to the consumer , " dehoga general manager markus luthe told deutsche welle .
of the roughly 22,000 hotels in germany , 8,000 are star-rated .
most of them are hotels that are not part of a well-known chain and thus do not have a strong brand image .
impact of social media one of the factors driving hotels away from star ratings is the growing popularity of review websites , where guests are free to leave comments and rate hotels according to their own experience .
" at this moment , i think social media is taking a far more prominent position than dehoga -lrb- and its star ratings system -rrb- , van der ham said .
" if we go to the various platforms there are for customers to go and have a look , it 's quite amazing what is out there , " he said , adding that the chain has a team that regularly scours review sites for comments to use on hotel-specific websites .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social media can help hotels assess how guests rate their service staff but dehoga thinks social media and star ratings do not have to be mutually exclusive and can , in fact , complement each other .
" we can not check adequately , for instance , the friendliness of the staff , but the reviews -lrb- on the web -rrb- can give an additional image of the hotel and then you have the complete picture , " luthe said .
dehoga even wants to go a step further and base star ratings partly on review comments by , for example , boosting a four star rating to a four star plus rating , which is between four and five stars , according to customers ' evaluations .
whichever system guests choose to rely on , service and price is at the heart of every hotel 's business , especially in times of economic hardship .

the southern city of thatta has apparently been saved from being inundated , and many citizens who fled earlier are returning there . slowly , the focus is turning to the giant task of rebuilding the devastated areas .
the pakistani ngo akhuwat pakistan has launched an innovative plan to help flood victims in southern punjab stand on their own feet as soon as possible .
under the plan by akhuwat pakistan , flood-affected families are to receive microcredits in order to create employment opportunities for them .
the interest-free loans will come without difficult conditions attached .
the organisation 's executive director amjad saqib explains : " look , whatever is happening right now is relief work .
people need food , shelter , medicine . "
but this relief work will be over in one or two months , he adds . bildunterschrift : a boy receives food at a camp on the outskirt of sukkur in southern pakistan " and then the real challenge will come up - how to rehabilitate all these people !
how can they stand on their own feet again ?
so whereas we from akhuwat have been continuously engaged in relief work in the field , within two months we want to shift our focus on one of the worst-affected areas , rajanpur district .
our preparation , fund raising and resource mobilisation are going well , and god willing we 'll select 10,000 badly affected families and provide them with interest-free loans , thus enabling them to re-start the businesses they 've had to abandon due to this flood . "
rebuilding small businesses the flood victims will get between 10,000 and 30,000 rupees -lrb- between 92 and 276 euros -rrb- per family as an interest-free loan .
no security or documents are required , nor will there be any service charges .
according to izhar hashmi , director of akhuwat pakistan , the recipients will be able to buy seeds or raise goats or cattle with the money .
they might also open a small shop in their village or buy a donkey cart and start a transport business .
with the income generated , they 'll have to repay the loans within 30 months .
the money will then be free to be distributed again to other needy persons .
akhuwat plans to raise 150 million rupees -lrb- almost 1.4 million euros -rrb- in donations from pakistanis for the program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crossing a flooded road in punjab province on monday " we wo n't turn pakistanis into beggars , " says amjad saqib , " but want to harness their potential to work hard for a better future .
they 'll rise up on their own and stand on their own feet again . "
an alternative approach to microcredit akhuwat means " brotherhood " in arabic .
the organisation 's philosophy of providing loan-free microcredit is inspired by islamic teaching which prohibits the charging of interest , but it equally provides loans to non-muslims , such as members of the christian minority , relying on the local mosque and church infrastructure . akhuwat , which has been working in pakistan for more than nine years and claims a recovery rate for its loans of almost 100 per cent , is an interesting exception among the growing number of micro-finance institutions worldwide .
recently , criticism has grown of these microcredit groups , as many have been demanding high interest rates , which can become a problem for those who accept their loans .
some development experts have pointed to the akhuwat model , funded by charitable donations and charging no interest at all , as an alternative way .
for pakistani flood victims , it definitely comes as a welcome support in this time of crisis .

public prosecutors in stuttgart are investigating too . traders and hedge fund managers hate the weekends because they ca n't take react immediately to corporate announcements until trading floors reopen on monday .
sunday , october 26 , 2008 was a particularly bad day for 35 american hedge funds .
that was the day german sports carmaker porsche announced that it owned 42.6 percent of volkswagen 's common stock and options for another 31.5 percent - bringing its total stake in the company to 74.1 percent .
the announcement then declared porsche was seeking to obtain 75 percent of vw shares - a plan that eventually backfired .
the following morning saw a frenzy of trading activity .
hedge fund managers had long been betting that the price of vw stock would fall .
the financial crisis caused demand for cars to fall in the us , driving down american automakers ' share prices .
they figured it was only a matter of time until german carmakers suffered a similar fate .
as a result , their funds were borrowing vw shares and selling them on in the hope they could buy them back later at a lower price - a speculative strategy known as short selling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us fund managers say wendelin wiedeking misled investors about his plans but porsche 's weekend announcement made it clear that fund managers had sold more than double the number of vw shares actually available on the market .
the news drove vw 's stock price up from 290 euros to 1,005 euros per share , making it the world 's most valuable company for a short period of time .
the financial times estimates that hedge funds lost about 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- in two days of trading as a result .
transatlatic battle now the funds want porsche to pay them more than 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2 billion -rrb- in damages .
lawyers representing the hedge funds told a new york court that porsche committed securities fraud by leading investors to believe it was only seeking a 51-percent stake in vw .
porsche 's defense team is due to file a petition to dismiss the lawsuit on wednesday , according to german media .
analysts expect porsche to argue that it was only required to publicly disclose its takeover plans once they were approved by the board - and that that had not been the case prior to october 26 , 2008 .
the hedge funds ' claims may be helped by the fact that german prosecutors in the city of stuttgart are also examining claims that porsche managers manipulated the markets .
investigators are trying to establish whether former porsche chief wendelin wiedeking and his financial director holger haerter influenced stock prices by passing on insider information or misleading investors about the porsche 's plans to increase its stake in vw .
the american plaintiffs will have to be patient if they want to rely on evidence from germany , however .
the stuttgart prosecutors ' preliminary findings are n't due to be released until the end of 2010 or early 2011 .

hedge fund managers had long been betting that the price of vw stock would fall .
the financial crisis caused demand for cars to fall in the us , driving down american automakers ' share prices .
they figured it was only a matter of time until german carmakers suffered a similar fate .
as a result , their funds were borrowing vw shares and selling them on in the hope they could buy them back later at a lower price - a speculative strategy known as short selling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us fund managers say wendelin wiedeking misled investors about his plans but porsche 's weekend announcement made it clear that fund managers had sold more than double the number of vw shares actually available on the market .
the news drove vw 's stock price up from 290 euros to 1,005 euros per share , making it the world 's most valuable company for a short period of time .
the financial times estimates that hedge funds lost about 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- in two days of trading as a result .
transatlatic battle now the funds want porsche to pay them more than 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2 billion -rrb- in damages .
lawyers representing the hedge funds told a new york court that porsche committed securities fraud by leading investors to believe it was only seeking a 51-percent stake in vw .
porsche 's defense team is due to file a petition to dismiss the lawsuit on wednesday , according to german media .
analysts expect porsche to argue that it was only required to publicly disclose its takeover plans once they were approved by the board - and that that had not been the case prior to october 26 , 2008 .
the hedge funds ' claims may be helped by the fact that german prosecutors in the city of stuttgart are also examining claims that porsche managers manipulated the markets .
investigators are trying to establish whether former porsche chief wendelin wiedeking and his financial director holger haerter influenced stock prices by passing on insider information or misleading investors about the porsche 's plans to increase its stake in vw .
the american plaintiffs will have to be patient if they want to rely on evidence from germany , however .
the stuttgart prosecutors ' preliminary findings are n't due to be released until the end of 2010 or early 2011 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 30.08.2010 german hip-hop at the shanghai expo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hip-hoppers at the german pavilion in shanghai at the german expo pavilion in shanghai , one could easily see how hip-hop is transcending borders .
the pavilion called the " balancity " featured hip-hop during a month long program with graffiti , break-dance and music . hip-hop beats echoing around the area in front of the german pavilion have been attracting scores of young chinese people .
they are excited and sing along loudly with the artists .
" it is different here in comparison to berlin , " says rafael schall from berlin , who is blown away by the response .
" here you can really get the people high on music , dance with them on the stage and really go ballistic .
people really go crazy here . "
schall is one of 50 german hip-hop artists who have come to shangai to perform at the german pavilion .
together with 50 chinese hip-hop artists they have turned it into a laboratory of urban youth culture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanghai singer cha-cha says the project is " quite a cool thing " giving space to young people marion conrady , spokesperson of the german pavilion explains why germany has chosen to present itself at this world fair in this way .
" hip-hop is a youth culture , which can also be seen in cities represented in words through graffiti but also in the form of various performances .
with the help of our ' balancity ' pavilion at the shanghai expo , we are trying to show the versatility of a city .
and in a city , giving space to young people is as important as it is to provide space for high or elite culture . "
graffiti is important for hip-hoppers all over the world .
and one can also see this at the german pavilion .
at the graffiti corner there are not only huge pictures , but also graffiti t-shirts , umbrellas and bags for the visitors .
but in shanghai one hardly gets to see any graffiti .
stan wu works with the " invasion " magazine in hong kong .
he explains why so few walls are painted in shanghai .
" we first had the olympics and now we have the shanghai expo .
so the government and the city are trying to wipe out the whole country .
zero tolerance of ' dirty ' surface , you know .
so there is no chance that you will see a lot of graffiti in the city . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mc wesley from beijing in the ' balancity ' power of graffiti asia 's largest graffiti competition " wall lords finals 2010 " , which was held on sunday at the shanghai expo was also a part of the german hip-hop project .
it was initiated by akim walta from berlin , who has been active in the hip-hop scene there for almost 30 years .
walta talks about a graffiti project by german artists in shanghai .
" our boys also painted something for the residents here .
what was interesting was that they tried to come into contact with the locals .
and suddenly the sad grey street became colorful , with some connection to the locals .
and in the course of time there was some problem and we were asked to remove the graffiti .
but then , little children and families stood up for us and said that we had come from a far away land and the graffiti was a gift for them .
they said it was their picture and they did not want it to be removed . "
walta has been to china many times and has been involved in various graffiti projects .
he hopes that the hip-hop project at the shanghai expo is not the last one .

online dictionaries have gained so much popularity over their printed counterparts that the next edition of the oxford english dictionary will probably appear only in electronic form , according to its publisher , the oxford university press .
" the print dictionary market is just disappearing , it is falling away by tens of per cent a year , " nigel portwood , the chief executive of the oxford university press , told uk newspaper the sunday times .
he told the uk newspaper he did not think the third edition would be printed .
the second and most recent oed has existed online for more than a decade , where it receives two million hits a month from subscribers who pay an annual fee of almost 300 euros to access it .
a wider trend towards online simon winchester , author of the meaning of everything : the story of the oxford english dictionary , said the oxford university press 's move away from print editions of the dictionary " reflects an inevitability " and is part of a growing trend of readers moving away from printed books toward digital editions and electronic e-readers like the kindle or the ipad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dictionary-users are increasingly turning to the internet for their answers " i think the electronic book is going to achieve ascendancy over the printed book , and i think that the printed book is just starting now to vanish , " winchester said .
though he owns three sets of the printed version of the oxford english dictionary , he said he relies on the digital version .
" on my ipad , i 've used the oed twice if not three times today .
but i never ever go to the hardback version .
it sits there on the shelf gathering dust , looking beautiful , but i never use it . "
online dictionary keeps better pace the move away from printed dictionaries could also be helping to create a more accessible oed , and one that evolves better alongside the language that it documents , said charlotte brewer , professor of english language and literature at oxford university and author of treasure-house of the language : the living oed .
" when the first dictionaries were produced in the victorian period , the edwardian period in the uk , there were all sorts of assumptions about what was proper to go into a dictionary – so words to do with sex , and the body , sometimes did n't get in or sometimes were defined in a way that we would regard as inadequate , " she said .
many of the quotations used in older editions of the oed were drawn from historical and literary sources .
now , brewer said , " the lexicographers can use the web , they can use google , they have access to an enormous variety of language online , they can instantly access a far broader range of sources .
in this way … it 's likely to become more democratic . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet offers lexicographers a broader range of sources to draw upon an ' absolutely enormous ' undertaking almost one third of a million entries were contained in the second version of the oed , published in hard copy in 1989 .
since then , a team of 80 lexicographers have been working on the third edition , though they have completed only 28 percent of the dictionary .
" we 're talking about an absolutely enormous amount of data , which in its last printed form occupied 20 volumes , " brewer said .
she said the third edition of the dictionary would likely be even larger .
" i think the point is that the cost of this work would be unbelievable - you know , you have to wonder who could possibly afford to buy it , " brewer said .
with the most recent edition weighing in at a hefty 62.9 kilos , an electronic version of edition three would not only be lighter on the hip pocket – it would also be easier on the back .

" we 're talking about an absolutely enormous amount of data , which in its last printed form occupied 20 volumes , " brewer said .

online dictionaries have gained so much popularity over their printed counterparts that the next edition of the oxford english dictionary will probably appear only in electronic form , according to its publisher , the oxford university press .
" the print dictionary market is just disappearing , it is falling away by tens of per cent a year , " nigel portwood , the chief executive of the oxford university press , told uk newspaper the sunday times .
he told the uk newspaper he did not think the third edition would be printed .
the second and most recent oed has existed online for more than a decade , where it receives two million hits a month from subscribers who pay an annual fee of almost 300 euros to access it .
a wider trend towards online simon winchester , author of the meaning of everything : the story of the oxford english dictionary , said the oxford university press 's move away from print editions of the dictionary " reflects an inevitability " and is part of a growing trend of readers moving away from printed books toward digital editions and electronic e-readers like the kindle or the ipad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dictionary-users are increasingly turning to the internet for their answers " i think the electronic book is going to achieve ascendancy over the printed book , and i think that the printed book is just starting now to vanish , " winchester said .
though he owns three sets of the printed version of the oxford english dictionary , he said he relies on the digital version .
" on my ipad , i 've used the oed twice if not three times today .
but i never ever go to the hardback version .
it sits there on the shelf gathering dust , looking beautiful , but i never use it . "
online dictionary keeps better pace the move away from printed dictionaries could also be helping to create a more accessible oed , and one that evolves better alongside the language that it documents , said charlotte brewer , professor of english language and literature at oxford university and author of treasure-house of the language : the living oed .
" when the first dictionaries were produced in the victorian period , the edwardian period in the uk , there were all sorts of assumptions about what was proper to go into a dictionary – so words to do with sex , and the body , sometimes did n't get in or sometimes were defined in a way that we would regard as inadequate , " she said .
many of the quotations used in older editions of the oed were drawn from historical and literary sources .
now , brewer said , " the lexicographers can use the web , they can use google , they have access to an enormous variety of language online , they can instantly access a far broader range of sources .
in this way … it 's likely to become more democratic . "

the southern city of thatta has apparently been saved from being inundated , and many citizens who fled earlier are returning there . slowly , the focus is turning to the giant task of rebuilding the devastated areas .
the pakistani ngo akhuwat pakistan has launched an innovative plan to help flood victims in southern punjab stand on their own feet as soon as possible .
under the plan by akhuwat pakistan , flood-affected families are to receive microcredits in order to create employment opportunities for them .
the interest-free loans will come without difficult conditions attached .
the organisation 's executive director amjad saqib explains : " look , whatever is happening right now is relief work .
people need food , shelter , medicine . "
but this relief work will be over in one or two months , he adds . bildunterschrift : a boy receives food at a camp on the outskirt of sukkur in southern pakistan " and then the real challenge will come up - how to rehabilitate all these people !
how can they stand on their own feet again ?
so whereas we from akhuwat have been continuously engaged in relief work in the field , within two months we want to shift our focus on one of the worst-affected areas , rajanpur district .
our preparation , fund raising and resource mobilisation are going well , and god willing we 'll select 10,000 badly affected families and provide them with interest-free loans , thus enabling them to re-start the businesses they 've had to abandon due to this flood . "
rebuilding small businesses the flood victims will get between 10,000 and 30,000 rupees -lrb- between 92 and 276 euros -rrb- per family as an interest-free loan .
no security or documents are required , nor will there be any service charges .
according to izhar hashmi , director of akhuwat pakistan , the recipients will be able to buy seeds or raise goats or cattle with the money .
they might also open a small shop in their village or buy a donkey cart and start a transport business .
with the income generated , they 'll have to repay the loans within 30 months .
the money will then be free to be distributed again to other needy persons .
akhuwat plans to raise 150 million rupees -lrb- almost 1.4 million euros -rrb- in donations from pakistanis for the program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crossing a flooded road in punjab province on monday " we wo n't turn pakistanis into beggars , " says amjad saqib , " but want to harness their potential to work hard for a better future .
they 'll rise up on their own and stand on their own feet again . "
an alternative approach to microcredit akhuwat means " brotherhood " in arabic .
the organisation 's philosophy of providing loan-free microcredit is inspired by islamic teaching which prohibits the charging of interest , but it equally provides loans to non-muslims , such as members of the christian minority , relying on the local mosque and church infrastructure . akhuwat , which has been working in pakistan for more than nine years and claims a recovery rate for its loans of almost 100 per cent , is an interesting exception among the growing number of micro-finance institutions worldwide .
recently , criticism has grown of these microcredit groups , as many have been demanding high interest rates , which can become a problem for those who accept their loans .
some development experts have pointed to the akhuwat model , funded by charitable donations and charging no interest at all , as an alternative way .
for pakistani flood victims , it definitely comes as a welcome support in this time of crisis .

the southern city of thatta has apparently been saved from being inundated , and many citizens who fled earlier are returning there . slowly , the focus is turning to the giant task of rebuilding the devastated areas .
the pakistani ngo akhuwat pakistan has launched an innovative plan to help flood victims in southern punjab stand on their own feet as soon as possible .
under the plan by akhuwat pakistan , flood-affected families are to receive microcredits in order to create employment opportunities for them .
the interest-free loans will come without difficult conditions attached .
the organisation 's executive director amjad saqib explains : " look , whatever is happening right now is relief work .
people need food , shelter , medicine . "
but this relief work will be over in one or two months , he adds . bildunterschrift : a boy receives food at a camp on the outskirt of sukkur in southern pakistan " and then the real challenge will come up - how to rehabilitate all these people !
how can they stand on their own feet again ?
so whereas we from akhuwat have been continuously engaged in relief work in the field , within two months we want to shift our focus on one of the worst-affected areas , rajanpur district .
our preparation , fund raising and resource mobilisation are going well , and god willing we 'll select 10,000 badly affected families and provide them with interest-free loans , thus enabling them to re-start the businesses they 've had to abandon due to this flood . "
rebuilding small businesses the flood victims will get between 10,000 and 30,000 rupees -lrb- between 92 and 276 euros -rrb- per family as an interest-free loan .
no security or documents are required , nor will there be any service charges .
according to izhar hashmi , director of akhuwat pakistan , the recipients will be able to buy seeds or raise goats or cattle with the money .
they might also open a small shop in their village or buy a donkey cart and start a transport business .
with the income generated , they 'll have to repay the loans within 30 months .
the money will then be free to be distributed again to other needy persons .
akhuwat plans to raise 150 million rupees -lrb- almost 1.4 million euros -rrb- in donations from pakistanis for the program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crossing a flooded road in punjab province on monday " we wo n't turn pakistanis into beggars , " says amjad saqib , " but want to harness their potential to work hard for a better future .
they 'll rise up on their own and stand on their own feet again . "
an alternative approach to microcredit akhuwat means " brotherhood " in arabic .
the organisation 's philosophy of providing loan-free microcredit is inspired by islamic teaching which prohibits the charging of interest , but it equally provides loans to non-muslims , such as members of the christian minority , relying on the local mosque and church infrastructure . akhuwat , which has been working in pakistan for more than nine years and claims a recovery rate for its loans of almost 100 per cent , is an interesting exception among the growing number of micro-finance institutions worldwide .
recently , criticism has grown of these microcredit groups , as many have been demanding high interest rates , which can become a problem for those who accept their loans .
some development experts have pointed to the akhuwat model , funded by charitable donations and charging no interest at all , as an alternative way .
for pakistani flood victims , it definitely comes as a welcome support in this time of crisis .

he decided to remain in the job , saying that leaving amounted to ' deserting . '
" i asked myself whether i should resign , kouchner said .
" but what would have that changed ?
no , i was not happy about this policy .
i 've been involved with the roma for 25 years .
and i do n't like making a political issue out of them . "
on friday , in an address to french ambassadors , kouchner still openly supported sarkozy 's policy on the roma deportations .
kouchner is the founder of the renowned medical charity doctors without borders and is a highly respected human rights activist .
observers have generally believed that the former socialist politician would have trouble accommodating himself in sarkozy 's conservative government whose views he does not always share .
in another sign that not everyone is in agreement with sarkozy 's tough anti-crime and immigration policy , france 's defense minister hervé morin of the center-right new center party also broke ranks , criticizing the tough crusade of president sarkozy and the interior minister brice hortefeux .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on average , 1,000 roma gypsies are expelled each month 8,000 roma sent back this year already critics say the recent campaigns are a calculated move to boost sarkozy 's flagging popularity before elections in 2012 and distract attention from unpopular plans to cut public spending and raise the retirement age .
jean-marie le pen , the veteran leader of the extreme-right national front , however , agrees with the deportations .
he added that sarkozy was powerless to do anything fundamental about what he described as " a problem caused by the european union opening the borders between european countries . " roma can legally travel to eu countries , but they must show that they have found a job if they want to stay legally in france for more than three months .
the french government has sent more than 8,000 roma back to bulgaria and romania since the start of the year .
around 1,000 were sent back in the past four weeks .
on tuesday , french officials are due to meet with representatives of the european commission , which is also critical of paris 's crackdown on roma gypsies .
the united nations and the vatican have also condemned the expulsions .

he decided to remain in the job , saying that leaving amounted to ' deserting . '
" i asked myself whether i should resign , kouchner said .
" but what would have that changed ?
no , i was not happy about this policy .
i 've been involved with the roma for 25 years .

on friday , in an address to french ambassadors , kouchner still openly supported sarkozy 's policy on the roma deportations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de tourism -pipe- 30.08.2010 star ratings under pressure as hotels struggle to fill rooms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurter hof is holding on to its five star rating as hotels grapple with dwindling bookings and increasingly thrifty customers , some major chains have started dropping star ratings in an effort to attract more guests , especially business travelers . hotel managers worldwide are under pressure to come up with new ways to lure guests into their often pricey hotel rooms , especially since the industry took a hit during the global economic crisis .
hotel occupancy levels in germany dropped 5.8 percent in 2009 while prices fell 4.3 percent , according to the german association of hotels and restaurants -lrb- dehoga -rrb- .
five stars ?
no thanks big chains in urban areas are keen to attract as many business travelers as possible , but companies ' budgets are tight and some chains find that a five star rating puts customers off .
" we 've seen a change over the last one and a half years ; that customers are being criticized by their company when booking accommodation , and obviously in the five star area , were encouraged not to book there anymore , " robert van der ham , general manager at the intercontinental hotel in cologne told deutsche welle .
" we in the five star segment have lost quite a bit of business compared to hotels with three and four stars , " he explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the intercontinental in cologne used to be a five star plus hotel the intercontinental in cologne , which used to be a five star plus hotel , is not the only example .
the traditional dom-hotel , near cologne 's famous cathedral , has also decided to relinquish its star rating , as has the entire marriott chain .
other groups , like the intercontinental , hilton hotels and germany 's steigenberger chain , have decided to mix and match official star ratings with their own systems .
" it is the decision of the individual hotel .
it depends on what 's going on in their market and their destination and whether it makes sense to be classified because competitors are classified , for example , " angelika heyer , spokesperson for steigenberger hotels said .
no international standards steigenberger 's flagship , the frankfurter hof in the heart of germany 's financial capital , has a five star rating , but heyer says the lack of internationally recognized star standards means hotels nowadays often rely on a strong brand image instead .
" we have our own classification ...
we have comfort , first class and deluxe , and this is understood worldwide .
the brand and the price is what counts today for the traveler , " heyer explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van der ham says business has picked up since he gave up the star rating van der ham from the intercontinental in cologne could not agree more .
" for us , it 's important to see that guests still want service and quality , but at a lesser price and that is a challenge nowadays , " he said .
defending the stars prior to 1996 there were no binding rules for hotel stars in germany or elsewhere , so hotels would simply devise their own system and award themselves stars .
now , there are standard criteria for each star category , with test and awards carried out by dehoga , which represents the hotel industry in germany .
now a five star-rated hotel needs to provide , amongst other things , a 24-hour reception with multilingual staff , a one hour ironing service and every guest has to be met in person with fresh flowers or an equivalent in every room .
dehoga is in the process of harmonizing standards for star ratings across europe .
the association insists that stars are of particular importance to smaller , independent hotels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hotel star ratings in germany are valid for three years so far , germany , sweden , the netherlands , austria , hungary , switzerland and the czech republic have joined the scheme .
" if you do n't have a brand , the message is clear from our point of view .
you should ask for voluntary stars .
it gives a clear message to the consumer , " dehoga general manager markus luthe told deutsche welle .
of the roughly 22,000 hotels in germany , 8,000 are star-rated .
most of them are hotels that are not part of a well-known chain and thus do not have a strong brand image .
impact of social media one of the factors driving hotels away from star ratings is the growing popularity of review websites , where guests are free to leave comments and rate hotels according to their own experience .
" at this moment , i think social media is taking a far more prominent position than dehoga -lrb- and its star ratings system -rrb- , van der ham said .
" if we go to the various platforms there are for customers to go and have a look , it 's quite amazing what is out there , " he said , adding that the chain has a team that regularly scours review sites for comments to use on hotel-specific websites .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social media can help hotels assess how guests rate their service staff but dehoga thinks social media and star ratings do not have to be mutually exclusive and can , in fact , complement each other .
" we can not check adequately , for instance , the friendliness of the staff , but the reviews -lrb- on the web -rrb- can give an additional image of the hotel and then you have the complete picture , " luthe said .
dehoga even wants to go a step further and base star ratings partly on review comments by , for example , boosting a four star rating to a four star plus rating , which is between four and five stars , according to customers ' evaluations .
whichever system guests choose to rely on , service and price is at the heart of every hotel 's business , especially in times of economic hardship .

hotel occupancy levels in germany dropped 5.8 percent in 2009 while prices fell 4.3 percent , according to the german association of hotels and restaurants -lrb- dehoga -rrb- .
five stars ?
no thanks big chains in urban areas are keen to attract as many business travelers as possible , but companies ' budgets are tight and some chains find that a five star rating puts customers off .
" we 've seen a change over the last one and a half years ; that customers are being criticized by their company when booking accommodation , and obviously in the five star area , were encouraged not to book there anymore , " robert van der ham , general manager at the intercontinental hotel in cologne told deutsche welle .
" we in the five star segment have lost quite a bit of business compared to hotels with three and four stars , " he explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the intercontinental in cologne used to be a five star plus hotel the intercontinental in cologne , which used to be a five star plus hotel , is not the only example .
the traditional dom-hotel , near cologne 's famous cathedral , has also decided to relinquish its star rating , as has the entire marriott chain .
other groups , like the intercontinental , hilton hotels and germany 's steigenberger chain , have decided to mix and match official star ratings with their own systems .
" it is the decision of the individual hotel .
it depends on what 's going on in their market and their destination and whether it makes sense to be classified because competitors are classified , for example , " angelika heyer , spokesperson for steigenberger hotels said .
no international standards steigenberger 's flagship , the frankfurter hof in the heart of germany 's financial capital , has a five star rating , but heyer says the lack of internationally recognized star standards means hotels nowadays often rely on a strong brand image instead .
" we have our own classification ...
we have comfort , first class and deluxe , and this is understood worldwide .
the brand and the price is what counts today for the traveler , " heyer explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van der ham says business has picked up since he gave up the star rating van der ham from the intercontinental in cologne could not agree more .
" for us , it 's important to see that guests still want service and quality , but at a lesser price and that is a challenge nowadays , " he said .
defending the stars prior to 1996 there were no binding rules for hotel stars in germany or elsewhere , so hotels would simply devise their own system and award themselves stars .
now , there are standard criteria for each star category , with test and awards carried out by dehoga , which represents the hotel industry in germany .
now a five star-rated hotel needs to provide , amongst other things , a 24-hour reception with multilingual staff , a one hour ironing service and every guest has to be met in person with fresh flowers or an equivalent in every room .
dehoga is in the process of harmonizing standards for star ratings across europe .
the association insists that stars are of particular importance to smaller , independent hotels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hotel star ratings in germany are valid for three years so far , germany , sweden , the netherlands , austria , hungary , switzerland and the czech republic have joined the scheme .
" if you do n't have a brand , the message is clear from our point of view .
you should ask for voluntary stars .
it gives a clear message to the consumer , " dehoga general manager markus luthe told deutsche welle .
of the roughly 22,000 hotels in germany , 8,000 are star-rated .
most of them are hotels that are not part of a well-known chain and thus do not have a strong brand image .
impact of social media one of the factors driving hotels away from star ratings is the growing popularity of review websites , where guests are free to leave comments and rate hotels according to their own experience .
" at this moment , i think social media is taking a far more prominent position than dehoga -lrb- and its star ratings system -rrb- , van der ham said .
" if we go to the various platforms there are for customers to go and have a look , it 's quite amazing what is out there , " he said , adding that the chain has a team that regularly scours review sites for comments to use on hotel-specific websites .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social media can help hotels assess how guests rate their service staff but dehoga thinks social media and star ratings do not have to be mutually exclusive and can , in fact , complement each other .
" we can not check adequately , for instance , the friendliness of the staff , but the reviews -lrb- on the web -rrb- can give an additional image of the hotel and then you have the complete picture , " luthe said .
dehoga even wants to go a step further and base star ratings partly on review comments by , for example , boosting a four star rating to a four star plus rating , which is between four and five stars , according to customers ' evaluations .
whichever system guests choose to rely on , service and price is at the heart of every hotel 's business , especially in times of economic hardship .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : floods in pakistan very little support for flood victims in punjab german red cross brings clean water to pakistan pakistani volunteers bring relief to flood victims pakistani islamist groups very visible in the flood-affected regions finance -pipe- 30.08.2010 microcredit to support reconstruction after floods großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pakistani flood survivor rebuilds his house in nowshera there has been a slight improvement in the flood situation in pakistan .
the southern city of thatta has apparently been saved from being inundated , and many citizens who fled earlier are returning there . slowly , the focus is turning to the giant task of rebuilding the devastated areas .
the pakistani ngo akhuwat pakistan has launched an innovative plan to help flood victims in southern punjab stand on their own feet as soon as possible .
under the plan by akhuwat pakistan , flood-affected families are to receive microcredits in order to create employment opportunities for them .
the interest-free loans will come without difficult conditions attached .
the organisation 's executive director amjad saqib explains : " look , whatever is happening right now is relief work .
people need food , shelter , medicine . "
but this relief work will be over in one or two months , he adds . bildunterschrift : a boy receives food at a camp on the outskirt of sukkur in southern pakistan " and then the real challenge will come up - how to rehabilitate all these people !
how can they stand on their own feet again ?
so whereas we from akhuwat have been continuously engaged in relief work in the field , within two months we want to shift our focus on one of the worst-affected areas , rajanpur district .
our preparation , fund raising and resource mobilisation are going well , and god willing we 'll select 10,000 badly affected families and provide them with interest-free loans , thus enabling them to re-start the businesses they 've had to abandon due to this flood . "
rebuilding small businesses the flood victims will get between 10,000 and 30,000 rupees -lrb- between 92 and 276 euros -rrb- per family as an interest-free loan .
no security or documents are required , nor will there be any service charges .
according to izhar hashmi , director of akhuwat pakistan , the recipients will be able to buy seeds or raise goats or cattle with the money .
they might also open a small shop in their village or buy a donkey cart and start a transport business .
with the income generated , they 'll have to repay the loans within 30 months .
the money will then be free to be distributed again to other needy persons .
akhuwat plans to raise 150 million rupees -lrb- almost 1.4 million euros -rrb- in donations from pakistanis for the program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crossing a flooded road in punjab province on monday " we wo n't turn pakistanis into beggars , " says amjad saqib , " but want to harness their potential to work hard for a better future .
they 'll rise up on their own and stand on their own feet again . "
an alternative approach to microcredit akhuwat means " brotherhood " in arabic .
the organisation 's philosophy of providing loan-free microcredit is inspired by islamic teaching which prohibits the charging of interest , but it equally provides loans to non-muslims , such as members of the christian minority , relying on the local mosque and church infrastructure . akhuwat , which has been working in pakistan for more than nine years and claims a recovery rate for its loans of almost 100 per cent , is an interesting exception among the growing number of micro-finance institutions worldwide .
recently , criticism has grown of these microcredit groups , as many have been demanding high interest rates , which can become a problem for those who accept their loans .
some development experts have pointed to the akhuwat model , funded by charitable donations and charging no interest at all , as an alternative way .
for pakistani flood victims , it definitely comes as a welcome support in this time of crisis .

nuclear energy is not as flexible as is needed for this future concept of renewable energy being the dominant part in our grid , " he explained . in a statement on friday , merkel said renewable energies should supply half of all energy needs by 2050 and that nuclear and coal power would continue until supplies could be met entirely by clean energy , a strategy that clean energy experts like klusmann say is a false economy . " eighty percent of german power supply is in the hands of four big companies ... what we need is more competition in the field of energy and we get that if we phase out nuclear and allow investors to install new production capacity , " klusmann said . as long as nuclear power is granted such a high standing in the market , he argues , investment in renewables will be low , especially since the government has announced funding cuts in some types of renewables . legal question the debate over extending the running time of germany 's nuclear plants has sparked a deep debate in the german parliament .
merkel said any extension would come in a form that circumvents germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat . however , doubts have been raised by the interior and justice ministries that an extension of more than 10 years could be illegal if it were not approved by the bundesrat , which is made up of the governments of germany 's 16 states . germany has 17 nuclear power plants , but it is not certain how many would be given extensions if one is granted . a poll published on friday found that 56 percent of germans are against keeping nuclear power plants beyond 2021 . author : matt zuvela , nicole goebel -lrb- reuters / dpa / afp -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the president had hoped to focus on economic issues . in an interview with deutsche welle and other german media ahead of his visit to berlin on monday , ukrainian president viktor yanukovych said he hopes to focus on economic issues when he meets german chancellor angela merkel .
however , it appears that concerns about freedom of the press threaten to overshadow the visit .
the role of valeriy khoroshkovskyi , who is both the head of ukraine 's security intelligence service and a media entrepreneur , also came under focus .
what expectation do you have of this trip to germany ?
what do you hope for from this visit ?
viktor yanukovych : i hope this visit will open up a new chapter in relations between ukraine and germany .
the main aim of our foreign policy is that we fulfill our obligations .
we are involved in pursuing these commitments .
an important issue that we are paying special attention to is making the economy more important in our foreign policy .
in practice , that means the reform plan that i announced recently should serve to create new possibilities for foreign investors .
we are trying to overcome a lot of bureaucratic hurdles that stand in the way of investors .
the system of permits and licenses in place until now has placed a considerable burden on the economy .
we have already halved the number of licenses and different permits .
this system will conform to european standards .
for that reason , i expect only positive outcomes from this visit to germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's questions may extend to the case of nico lang it is expected that the german chancellor will address the case of nico lang .
the ukrainan director of the konrad-adenauer political foundation was denied entry to ukraine and detained at kiev airport -lsb- the matter was settled after intervention from the german embassy -rsb- .
initially it was said that there had been a misunderstanding .
then there was talk of interference in internal affairs .
what was that about ?
every security service has its job to do .
information gets shared .
conflicts that arise are resolved through negotiations between both sides .
i gave my personal instructions to the chief of staff of the security service and also to the foreign minister .
we were able to resolve this very quickly with germany and therefore the case for us is settled .
we hear that you lightly admonished intelligence chief valeriy khoroshkovskyi after this incident , to put it mildly .
is that true ?
when conflicts arise , one must be careful .
there is no doubt , a warning had to be given .
and that 's what i did .
one subject that is also closely watched in germany is the issue of press freedom .
journalists report growing political pressure and in some cases , abuse .
in court , there is a case being contested about whether two tv stations should be allowed to keep their licenses .
several days ago , a journalist in the east of the country disappeared .
how do you assess these developments ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : press freedom is an issue of growing concern in ukraine i am of the view that all conflicts must be solved through the courts .
i can not imagine that in these cases pressure would be put on the court and that courts would make biased decisions .
every court decision is binding for the executive and also must be observed by the mass media . ´ i have had many meetings and encounters concerning freedom of expression and i sometimes ask journalists to tell me or give me proper examples where there is obstruction of freedom of expression .
for me it is important to have concrete , named cases and until i have them , it would not be right to pass judgment .
i have two cases .
first , the director of the television channel tvi claims he was shadowed by people from the secret service .
secondly , i heard from my own contact here in the ukraine that she was summoned to have conversations with people from the intelligence service and asked about my work .
i consider that to be an attempt to intimidate my contact .
are these cases known to you , and how would you categorize them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : questions were raised about intelligence boss valeriy khoroshkovskyi well , this is the first time i have heard that there are such cases .
when there really are such cases then you need to report them officially .
where the first issue is concerned , it hardly seems realistic to me that journalists would be monitored in this way .
i do n't believe that .
anyway , there has been no case that i have been informed about .
as far as journalists being summoned to have conversations with the intelligence service is concerned , i am also hearing that for the first time .
i really would ask you to tell me specifically which journalist was summoned , when , and where to .
i have already submitted these cases officially to the intelligence service a couple of weeks ago .
apparently it has not been forwarded .
so , i would pose the question : do you believe , after so many incidents , that your secret services chief is still the right man to be in this position ?
i ask this in consideration of his connected interests as intelligence chief , media entrepreneur and member of the highest council of justice .
i would say the security chief performs his job in a quite normal manner .
this work has no connection at all with the activities of the mass media .
regarding his assets , he has handed over their administration of his assets to relatives .
we have many officials who also have had assets and , according to the law , the management of these assets have been handed over to trustees .
as far as i know , that happens not only in the ukraine , but also all over the world .

but it closed this year with a tribute to festival innovator christoph schlingensief and a glimpse of changes to come . the 99th richard wagner festival in bayreuth closed sunday with a performance of wagner 's opera " the mastersingers of nuremberg . " the performance was dedicated to the provocative german film and theater director christoph schlingensief , who staged " parsifal " at the 2004 festival .
his production shocked some fans and was credited with bringing a new impulse to bayreuth .
schlingensief died of lung cancer on august 21 . composer richard wagner founded the bayreuth festival 134 years ago .
since then , his works - 10 operas - have been the sole basis for festival performances .
this fact alone makes it clear how important tradition is in bayreuth . tradition and renewal however , some signs point to change following the era of long-time festival director wolfgang wagner , who died early in 2010 .
his daughters and successors , eva wagner-pasquier and katharina wagner , have exhibited both openness and savvy in taking over direction of the festival . in 2010 , the festival continued its media push by offering public viewings and livestreams of selected performances .
on august 21 , 20,000 viewers came to watch " the valkyrie " transmitted live from the festspielhaus to a big screen at a market square in bayreuth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wager-pasquier assured audiences that wagner 's operas will not be upstaged according to a survey , 70 percent of the guests had never attended a wagner opera .
while visitors ate sausage , beer and pretzels , they could follow the performance featuring close-ups and subtitles .
the opera was also streamed live online and broadcast on japanese television .
the concept will continue next year with german broadcasters presenting " lohengrin " live from the festival . " wagner for kids " has also established itself as part of the event in bayreuth .
in the project 's second year , " tannhaeuser " was performed in a 70 minute kid-friendly version , targeted at six-to-12-year-olds .
the children followed the opera with great interest , and the crowd 's favorite was clearly love goddess venus , who sported a punk outfit and a skateboard . the beginning of the 2010 season also brought the announcement that an independent commission will receive complete access to the wagner house archives in order to examine the role of the festival during the third reich .
but at least one element is not up for discussion . " it 's certain that no other composer will be presented here , " said co-director eva wagner-pasquier .
" we will of course uphold the vision of the foundation and wagner house as well as the festival concept itself . " a shock for conservatives those who want to attend the bayreuth festival generally have to prepare for a long wait .
this year brought 408,000 ticket requests from 80 countries for the just 54,000 available seats .
it 's regarded as a privilege to be in bayreuth , even for the employees , who often had to work for low pay in previous years . changing attitudes toward compensation also mark the beginning of a new era for the festival .
following a salary dispute with stage workers last year , ticket prices had to be raised .
stage workers also succeeded in lobbying for mandatory breaks , which led to a new playing schedule this season .
this time , the four operas in the ring cycle - " the rheingold , " " the valkyrie , " " siegfried , " and " twilight of the gods " - were n't played consecutively .
that may not seem like a monumental change , but it would have been nearly unimaginable under wolfgang wagner 's direction and runs counter to the intentions of festival father richard wagner . many conservative wagnerians belong to the society of friends of bayreuth , an organization founded in 1949 by wolfgang wagner that since its inception has contributed more than 55 million euros -lrb- $ 70 million -rrb- to the festival .
following his death , the organization became a festival shareholder with the right to help make decisions related to the event .
disagreements and even public disputes have since erupted between the society and the festival leadership , which has strongly backed a newly-founded fundraising organization called the team of active festival supporters . a year of beautiful voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tenor lance ryan garnered praise this year in his bayreuth debut as siegfried in their second year heading the festival , wagner 's great-granddaughters katharina wagner and eva wagner-pasquier were able to fill the operas ' ranks with better singers than in recent decades .
the much-anticipated debuts included jonas kaufmann as lohengrin , james rutherford as hans sachs , johan botha as siegmund and lance ryan as siegfried .
ryan , a tenor from canada , has been hailed as unsurpassed in the role . 2010 was the last year of the " ring " production with director tankred dorst and conductor christian thielemann .
next year , thielemann will not conduct the orchestra but still be heavily involved with the event .
as musical advisor to the festival , he will have a say in who takes the bayreuth stage as a vocalist or conductor . looking ahead the 100th richard wagner festival next year will feature a new production of " tannhaeuser " directed by sebastian baumgarten and with thomas hengelbrock as conductor .
2013 will also bring a new staging of wagner 's masterpiece , " the ring of the nibelung , " to mark the composer 's 200th birthday .
the stage director for that production has yet to be announced , but kirill petrenko of russia is set to conduct the orchestra .
plans are also underway to debut three of wagner 's early operas in bayreuth -lrb- " the fairies , " " the ban on love " and " rienzi " -rrb- , not in the festival hall but in a tent elsewhere in the town . katharina wagner said her aim is to bring bayreuth " eventually to the absolute cutting edge of wagner productions .

but it closed this year with a tribute to festival innovator christoph schlingensief and a glimpse of changes to come . the 99th richard wagner festival in bayreuth closed sunday with a performance of wagner 's opera " the mastersingers of nuremberg . " the performance was dedicated to the provocative german film and theater director christoph schlingensief , who staged " parsifal " at the 2004 festival .
his production shocked some fans and was credited with bringing a new impulse to bayreuth .
schlingensief died of lung cancer on august 21 . composer richard wagner founded the bayreuth festival 134 years ago .
since then , his works - 10 operas - have been the sole basis for festival performances .
this fact alone makes it clear how important tradition is in bayreuth . tradition and renewal however , some signs point to change following the era of long-time festival director wolfgang wagner , who died early in 2010 .
his daughters and successors , eva wagner-pasquier and katharina wagner , have exhibited both openness and savvy in taking over direction of the festival . in 2010 , the festival continued its media push by offering public viewings and livestreams of selected performances .
on august 21 , 20,000 viewers came to watch " the valkyrie " transmitted live from the festspielhaus to a big screen at a market square in bayreuth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wager-pasquier assured audiences that wagner 's operas will not be upstaged according to a survey , 70 percent of the guests had never attended a wagner opera .
while visitors ate sausage , beer and pretzels , they could follow the performance featuring close-ups and subtitles .
the opera was also streamed live online and broadcast on japanese television .
the concept will continue next year with german broadcasters presenting " lohengrin " live from the festival . " wagner for kids " has also established itself as part of the event in bayreuth .
in the project 's second year , " tannhaeuser " was performed in a 70 minute kid-friendly version , targeted at six-to-12-year-olds .
the children followed the opera with great interest , and the crowd 's favorite was clearly love goddess venus , who sported a punk outfit and a skateboard . the beginning of the 2010 season also brought the announcement that an independent commission will receive complete access to the wagner house archives in order to examine the role of the festival during the third reich .
but at least one element is not up for discussion . " it 's certain that no other composer will be presented here , " said co-director eva wagner-pasquier .
" we will of course uphold the vision of the foundation and wagner house as well as the festival concept itself . " a shock for conservatives those who want to attend the bayreuth festival generally have to prepare for a long wait .
this year brought 408,000 ticket requests from 80 countries for the just 54,000 available seats .
it 's regarded as a privilege to be in bayreuth , even for the employees , who often had to work for low pay in previous years . changing attitudes toward compensation also mark the beginning of a new era for the festival .
following a salary dispute with stage workers last year , ticket prices had to be raised .
stage workers also succeeded in lobbying for mandatory breaks , which led to a new playing schedule this season .
this time , the four operas in the ring cycle - " the rheingold , " " the valkyrie , " " siegfried , " and " twilight of the gods " - were n't played consecutively .
that may not seem like a monumental change , but it would have been nearly unimaginable under wolfgang wagner 's direction and runs counter to the intentions of festival father richard wagner . many conservative wagnerians belong to the society of friends of bayreuth , an organization founded in 1949 by wolfgang wagner that since its inception has contributed more than 55 million euros -lrb- $ 70 million -rrb- to the festival .
following his death , the organization became a festival shareholder with the right to help make decisions related to the event .
disagreements and even public disputes have since erupted between the society and the festival leadership , which has strongly backed a newly-founded fundraising organization called the team of active festival supporters . a year of beautiful voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tenor lance ryan garnered praise this year in his bayreuth debut as siegfried in their second year heading the festival , wagner 's great-granddaughters katharina wagner and eva wagner-pasquier were able to fill the operas ' ranks with better singers than in recent decades .
the much-anticipated debuts included jonas kaufmann as lohengrin , james rutherford as hans sachs , johan botha as siegmund and lance ryan as siegfried .
ryan , a tenor from canada , has been hailed as unsurpassed in the role . 2010 was the last year of the " ring " production with director tankred dorst and conductor christian thielemann .
next year , thielemann will not conduct the orchestra but still be heavily involved with the event .
as musical advisor to the festival , he will have a say in who takes the bayreuth stage as a vocalist or conductor . looking ahead the 100th richard wagner festival next year will feature a new production of " tannhaeuser " directed by sebastian baumgarten and with thomas hengelbrock as conductor .
2013 will also bring a new staging of wagner 's masterpiece , " the ring of the nibelung , " to mark the composer 's 200th birthday .
the stage director for that production has yet to be announced , but kirill petrenko of russia is set to conduct the orchestra .
plans are also underway to debut three of wagner 's early operas in bayreuth -lrb- " the fairies , " " the ban on love " and " rienzi " -rrb- , not in the festival hall but in a tent elsewhere in the town . katharina wagner said her aim is to bring bayreuth " eventually to the absolute cutting edge of wagner productions .

the eu is preparing a strategy paper to secure a long-term supply of the increasingly necessary materials . it 's a little known fact that in order to stay in the technology manufacturing game , europe has to import some 40 rare metals and minerals .
it 's also a worrying fact because many of the materials used in the production of objects like cell phones and energy efficient lamps are either in limited supply or kept at artificially low levels by china . according to the eu commission , 14 of these rare earths , as they are called , are particularly scarce and are either only available in china or are mined for unrealistic prices elsewhere . while china is key to these materials finding their way to the world market , gwenole cozigou , the commission 's director for chemical , metals , forest-based and textile industries , is worried about the length of beijing 's arm . he said although negotiations with the chinese government over commodity trade are ongoing , foreign buyers are being forced to process rare earths into half-finished products on chinese soil . " china wants to build an industry and that is a perfectly acceptable goal , but if it violates trade regulations we will take action , " cozigou said .
in this case , that means teaming up with the united states and mexico to contact a world trade organization arbitration tribunal . taking on china hubertus bardt , raw materials expert from the institute for economic research in cologne , told deutsche welle it 's up to the eu to make sure china does not exploit its monopoly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tantal is used in micro-processors " one could threaten to impose import restrictions on chinese products , but nobody wants that and ultimately it would harm us , too , " he said .
" but there are always new trade talks and political discussions , and it 's important to use them to prioritize this problem . " it 's a problem which he said he believes will only get worse as fast-growing , emerging nations become ever more dependent upon technology . " there are a number of indications to suggest an increase in demand for these raw materials , " he said .
" firstly there is growth in china , then growth in india and brazil and then technical developments such as electromobility , solar panels and energy efficient lamps . " the role of developing countries besides entering into trade talks and exerting political pressure to secure itself a supply of rare earths , the eu is also keen to work in close cooperation with other developing countries known to have reserves of the raw materials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the democratic republic of congo has deposits of coltan the bloc has already begun negotiations with the african union , but is not , cozigou stressed , offering development aid in return for rare earths . " african countries have to realize that the extraction of raw materials at a fair price is advantageous for their own advancement , " he said , adding that it was the only way to attract potential european investors . but bardt said there is a place for development aid if it helps countries with reserves to establish the kind of market systems and institutions which would ultimately be of benefit to europe . time to recycle according to the eu 's observations , beijing secures entry to the coveted raw materials through the aggressive acquisition of foreign mining companies and land and by making donations to the relevant regimes .
experts say it is a problem , not least because there are very few rare earth mining companies left around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old phones should be recycled to recover reusable materials - not binned that being the case , the european union is supporting scientists looking for rare earths and is pushing for more recycling of raw materials from old mobile phones , televisions and cars . " we have our own mines in our cities across europe , " cozigou said , adding that the eu is currently working towards tightening regulations governing the export of electronic scrap and car wrecks .
" the eu wants what has previously been considered electronic garbage to be deemed valuable raw materials . " autor : bernd riegert / tkw editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the president had hoped to focus on economic issues . in an interview with deutsche welle and other german media ahead of his visit to berlin on monday , ukrainian president viktor yanukovych said he hopes to focus on economic issues when he meets german chancellor angela merkel .
however , it appears that concerns about freedom of the press threaten to overshadow the visit .
the role of valeriy khoroshkovskyi , who is both the head of ukraine 's security intelligence service and a media entrepreneur , also came under focus .
what expectation do you have of this trip to germany ?
what do you hope for from this visit ?
viktor yanukovych : i hope this visit will open up a new chapter in relations between ukraine and germany .
the main aim of our foreign policy is that we fulfill our obligations .
we are involved in pursuing these commitments .
an important issue that we are paying special attention to is making the economy more important in our foreign policy .
in practice , that means the reform plan that i announced recently should serve to create new possibilities for foreign investors .
we are trying to overcome a lot of bureaucratic hurdles that stand in the way of investors .
the system of permits and licenses in place until now has placed a considerable burden on the economy .
we have already halved the number of licenses and different permits .
this system will conform to european standards .
for that reason , i expect only positive outcomes from this visit to germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's questions may extend to the case of nico lang it is expected that the german chancellor will address the case of nico lang .
the ukrainan director of the konrad-adenauer political foundation was denied entry to ukraine and detained at kiev airport -lsb- the matter was settled after intervention from the german embassy -rsb- .
initially it was said that there had been a misunderstanding .
then there was talk of interference in internal affairs .
what was that about ?
every security service has its job to do .
information gets shared .
conflicts that arise are resolved through negotiations between both sides .
i gave my personal instructions to the chief of staff of the security service and also to the foreign minister .
we were able to resolve this very quickly with germany and therefore the case for us is settled .
we hear that you lightly admonished intelligence chief valeriy khoroshkovskyi after this incident , to put it mildly .
is that true ?
when conflicts arise , one must be careful .
there is no doubt , a warning had to be given .
and that 's what i did .
one subject that is also closely watched in germany is the issue of press freedom .
journalists report growing political pressure and in some cases , abuse .
in court , there is a case being contested about whether two tv stations should be allowed to keep their licenses .
several days ago , a journalist in the east of the country disappeared .
how do you assess these developments ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : press freedom is an issue of growing concern in ukraine i am of the view that all conflicts must be solved through the courts .
i can not imagine that in these cases pressure would be put on the court and that courts would make biased decisions .
every court decision is binding for the executive and also must be observed by the mass media . ´ i have had many meetings and encounters concerning freedom of expression and i sometimes ask journalists to tell me or give me proper examples where there is obstruction of freedom of expression .
for me it is important to have concrete , named cases and until i have them , it would not be right to pass judgment .
i have two cases .
first , the director of the television channel tvi claims he was shadowed by people from the secret service .
secondly , i heard from my own contact here in the ukraine that she was summoned to have conversations with people from the intelligence service and asked about my work .
i consider that to be an attempt to intimidate my contact .
are these cases known to you , and how would you categorize them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : questions were raised about intelligence boss valeriy khoroshkovskyi well , this is the first time i have heard that there are such cases .
when there really are such cases then you need to report them officially .
where the first issue is concerned , it hardly seems realistic to me that journalists would be monitored in this way .
i do n't believe that .
anyway , there has been no case that i have been informed about .
as far as journalists being summoned to have conversations with the intelligence service is concerned , i am also hearing that for the first time .
i really would ask you to tell me specifically which journalist was summoned , when , and where to .
i have already submitted these cases officially to the intelligence service a couple of weeks ago .
apparently it has not been forwarded .
so , i would pose the question : do you believe , after so many incidents , that your secret services chief is still the right man to be in this position ?
i ask this in consideration of his connected interests as intelligence chief , media entrepreneur and member of the highest council of justice .
i would say the security chief performs his job in a quite normal manner .
this work has no connection at all with the activities of the mass media .
regarding his assets , he has handed over their administration of his assets to relatives .
we have many officials who also have had assets and , according to the law , the management of these assets have been handed over to trustees .
as far as i know , that happens not only in the ukraine , but also all over the world .

the southern city of thatta has apparently been saved from being inundated , and many citizens who fled earlier are returning there . slowly , the focus is turning to the giant task of rebuilding the devastated areas .
the pakistani ngo akhuwat pakistan has launched an innovative plan to help flood victims in southern punjab stand on their own feet as soon as possible .
under the plan by akhuwat pakistan , flood-affected families are to receive microcredits in order to create employment opportunities for them .
the interest-free loans will come without difficult conditions attached .
the organisation 's executive director amjad saqib explains : " look , whatever is happening right now is relief work .
people need food , shelter , medicine . "
but this relief work will be over in one or two months , he adds . bildunterschrift : a boy receives food at a camp on the outskirt of sukkur in southern pakistan " and then the real challenge will come up - how to rehabilitate all these people !
how can they stand on their own feet again ?
so whereas we from akhuwat have been continuously engaged in relief work in the field , within two months we want to shift our focus on one of the worst-affected areas , rajanpur district .
our preparation , fund raising and resource mobilisation are going well , and god willing we 'll select 10,000 badly affected families and provide them with interest-free loans , thus enabling them to re-start the businesses they 've had to abandon due to this flood . "
rebuilding small businesses the flood victims will get between 10,000 and 30,000 rupees -lrb- between 92 and 276 euros -rrb- per family as an interest-free loan .
no security or documents are required , nor will there be any service charges .
according to izhar hashmi , director of akhuwat pakistan , the recipients will be able to buy seeds or raise goats or cattle with the money .
they might also open a small shop in their village or buy a donkey cart and start a transport business .
with the income generated , they 'll have to repay the loans within 30 months .
the money will then be free to be distributed again to other needy persons .
akhuwat plans to raise 150 million rupees -lrb- almost 1.4 million euros -rrb- in donations from pakistanis for the program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crossing a flooded road in punjab province on monday " we wo n't turn pakistanis into beggars , " says amjad saqib , " but want to harness their potential to work hard for a better future .
they 'll rise up on their own and stand on their own feet again . "
an alternative approach to microcredit akhuwat means " brotherhood " in arabic .
the organisation 's philosophy of providing loan-free microcredit is inspired by islamic teaching which prohibits the charging of interest , but it equally provides loans to non-muslims , such as members of the christian minority , relying on the local mosque and church infrastructure . akhuwat , which has been working in pakistan for more than nine years and claims a recovery rate for its loans of almost 100 per cent , is an interesting exception among the growing number of micro-finance institutions worldwide .
recently , criticism has grown of these microcredit groups , as many have been demanding high interest rates , which can become a problem for those who accept their loans .
some development experts have pointed to the akhuwat model , funded by charitable donations and charging no interest at all , as an alternative way .
for pakistani flood victims , it definitely comes as a welcome support in this time of crisis .

five stars ?
no thanks big chains in urban areas are keen to attract as many business travelers as possible , but companies ' budgets are tight and some chains find that a five star rating puts customers off .
" we 've seen a change over the last one and a half years ; that customers are being criticized by their company when booking accommodation , and obviously in the five star area , were encouraged not to book there anymore , " robert van der ham , general manager at the intercontinental hotel in cologne told deutsche welle .
" we in the five star segment have lost quite a bit of business compared to hotels with three and four stars , " he explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the intercontinental in cologne used to be a five star plus hotel the intercontinental in cologne , which used to be a five star plus hotel , is not the only example .
the traditional dom-hotel , near cologne 's famous cathedral , has also decided to relinquish its star rating , as has the entire marriott chain .
other groups , like the intercontinental , hilton hotels and germany 's steigenberger chain , have decided to mix and match official star ratings with their own systems .
" it is the decision of the individual hotel .
it depends on what 's going on in their market and their destination and whether it makes sense to be classified because competitors are classified , for example , " angelika heyer , spokesperson for steigenberger hotels said .
no international standards steigenberger 's flagship , the frankfurter hof in the heart of germany 's financial capital , has a five star rating , but heyer says the lack of internationally recognized star standards means hotels nowadays often rely on a strong brand image instead .
" we have our own classification ...
we have comfort , first class and deluxe , and this is understood worldwide .
the brand and the price is what counts today for the traveler , " heyer explained .

" for us , it 's important to see that guests still want service and quality , but at a lesser price and that is a challenge nowadays , " he said .
defending the stars prior to 1996 there were no binding rules for hotel stars in germany or elsewhere , so hotels would simply devise their own system and award themselves stars .
now , there are standard criteria for each star category , with test and awards carried out by dehoga , which represents the hotel industry in germany .
now a five star-rated hotel needs to provide , amongst other things , a 24-hour reception with multilingual staff , a one hour ironing service and every guest has to be met in person with fresh flowers or an equivalent in every room .
dehoga is in the process of harmonizing standards for star ratings across europe .
the association insists that stars are of particular importance to smaller , independent hotels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hotel star ratings in germany are valid for three years so far , germany , sweden , the netherlands , austria , hungary , switzerland and the czech republic have joined the scheme .

you should ask for voluntary stars .
it gives a clear message to the consumer , " dehoga general manager markus luthe told deutsche welle .
of the roughly 22,000 hotels in germany , 8,000 are star-rated .
most of them are hotels that are not part of a well-known chain and thus do not have a strong brand image .
impact of social media one of the factors driving hotels away from star ratings is the growing popularity of review websites , where guests are free to leave comments and rate hotels according to their own experience .
" at this moment , i think social media is taking a far more prominent position than dehoga -lrb- and its star ratings system -rrb- , van der ham said .
" if we go to the various platforms there are for customers to go and have a look , it 's quite amazing what is out there , " he said , adding that the chain has a team that regularly scours review sites for comments to use on hotel-specific websites .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social media can help hotels assess how guests rate their service staff but dehoga thinks social media and star ratings do not have to be mutually exclusive and can , in fact , complement each other .
" we can not check adequately , for instance , the friendliness of the staff , but the reviews -lrb- on the web -rrb- can give an additional image of the hotel and then you have the complete picture , " luthe said .
dehoga even wants to go a step further and base star ratings partly on review comments by , for example , boosting a four star rating to a four star plus rating , which is between four and five stars , according to customers ' evaluations .
whichever system guests choose to rely on , service and price is at the heart of every hotel 's business , especially in times of economic hardship .

no thanks big chains in urban areas are keen to attract as many business travelers as possible , but companies ' budgets are tight and some chains find that a five star rating puts customers off .
" we 've seen a change over the last one and a half years ; that customers are being criticized by their company when booking accommodation , and obviously in the five star area , were encouraged not to book there anymore , " robert van der ham , general manager at the intercontinental hotel in cologne told deutsche welle .

defending the stars prior to 1996 there were no binding rules for hotel stars in germany or elsewhere , so hotels would simply devise their own system and award themselves stars .

" the performance was dedicated to the provocative german film and theater director christoph schlingensief , who staged " parsifal " at the 2004 festival .
his production shocked some fans and was credited with bringing a new impulse to bayreuth .
schlingensief died of lung cancer on august 21 . composer richard wagner founded the bayreuth festival 134 years ago .
since then , his works - 10 operas - have been the sole basis for festival performances .
this fact alone makes it clear how important tradition is in bayreuth . tradition and renewal however , some signs point to change following the era of long-time festival director wolfgang wagner , who died early in 2010 .
his daughters and successors , eva wagner-pasquier and katharina wagner , have exhibited both openness and savvy in taking over direction of the festival . in 2010 , the festival continued its media push by offering public viewings and livestreams of selected performances .
on august 21 , 20,000 viewers came to watch " the valkyrie " transmitted live from the festspielhaus to a big screen at a market square in bayreuth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wager-pasquier assured audiences that wagner 's operas will not be upstaged according to a survey , 70 percent of the guests had never attended a wagner opera .
while visitors ate sausage , beer and pretzels , they could follow the performance featuring close-ups and subtitles .
the opera was also streamed live online and broadcast on japanese television .
the concept will continue next year with german broadcasters presenting " lohengrin " live from the festival . " wagner for kids " has also established itself as part of the event in bayreuth .
in the project 's second year , " tannhaeuser " was performed in a 70 minute kid-friendly version , targeted at six-to-12-year-olds .
the children followed the opera with great interest , and the crowd 's favorite was clearly love goddess venus , who sported a punk outfit and a skateboard . the beginning of the 2010 season also brought the announcement that an independent commission will receive complete access to the wagner house archives in order to examine the role of the festival during the third reich .
but at least one element is not up for discussion . " it 's certain that no other composer will be presented here , " said co-director eva wagner-pasquier .
" we will of course uphold the vision of the foundation and wagner house as well as the festival concept itself . " a shock for conservatives those who want to attend the bayreuth festival generally have to prepare for a long wait .
this year brought 408,000 ticket requests from 80 countries for the just 54,000 available seats .
it 's regarded as a privilege to be in bayreuth , even for the employees , who often had to work for low pay in previous years . changing attitudes toward compensation also mark the beginning of a new era for the festival .
following a salary dispute with stage workers last year , ticket prices had to be raised .
stage workers also succeeded in lobbying for mandatory breaks , which led to a new playing schedule this season .
this time , the four operas in the ring cycle - " the rheingold , " " the valkyrie , " " siegfried , " and " twilight of the gods " - were n't played consecutively .
that may not seem like a monumental change , but it would have been nearly unimaginable under wolfgang wagner 's direction and runs counter to the intentions of festival father richard wagner . many conservative wagnerians belong to the society of friends of bayreuth , an organization founded in 1949 by wolfgang wagner that since its inception has contributed more than 55 million euros -lrb- $ 70 million -rrb- to the festival .
following his death , the organization became a festival shareholder with the right to help make decisions related to the event .
disagreements and even public disputes have since erupted between the society and the festival leadership , which has strongly backed a newly-founded fundraising organization called the team of active festival supporters . a year of beautiful voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tenor lance ryan garnered praise this year in his bayreuth debut as siegfried in their second year heading the festival , wagner 's great-granddaughters katharina wagner and eva wagner-pasquier were able to fill the operas ' ranks with better singers than in recent decades .
the much-anticipated debuts included jonas kaufmann as lohengrin , james rutherford as hans sachs , johan botha as siegmund and lance ryan as siegfried .
ryan , a tenor from canada , has been hailed as unsurpassed in the role . 2010 was the last year of the " ring " production with director tankred dorst and conductor christian thielemann .
next year , thielemann will not conduct the orchestra but still be heavily involved with the event .
as musical advisor to the festival , he will have a say in who takes the bayreuth stage as a vocalist or conductor . looking ahead the 100th richard wagner festival next year will feature a new production of " tannhaeuser " directed by sebastian baumgarten and with thomas hengelbrock as conductor .
2013 will also bring a new staging of wagner 's masterpiece , " the ring of the nibelung , " to mark the composer 's 200th birthday .
the stage director for that production has yet to be announced , but kirill petrenko of russia is set to conduct the orchestra .
plans are also underway to debut three of wagner 's early operas in bayreuth -lrb- " the fairies , " " the ban on love " and " rienzi " -rrb- , not in the festival hall but in a tent elsewhere in the town . katharina wagner said her aim is to bring bayreuth " eventually to the absolute cutting edge of wagner productions .

this time , the four operas in the ring cycle - " the rheingold , " " the valkyrie , " " siegfried , " and " twilight of the gods " - were n't played consecutively .
that may not seem like a monumental change , but it would have been nearly unimaginable under wolfgang wagner 's direction and runs counter to the intentions of festival father richard wagner . many conservative wagnerians belong to the society of friends of bayreuth , an organization founded in 1949 by wolfgang wagner that since its inception has contributed more than 55 million euros -lrb- $ 70 million -rrb- to the festival .
following his death , the organization became a festival shareholder with the right to help make decisions related to the event .
disagreements and even public disputes have since erupted between the society and the festival leadership , which has strongly backed a newly-founded fundraising organization called the team of active festival supporters . a year of beautiful voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tenor lance ryan garnered praise this year in his bayreuth debut as siegfried in their second year heading the festival , wagner 's great-granddaughters katharina wagner and eva wagner-pasquier were able to fill the operas ' ranks with better singers than in recent decades .
the much-anticipated debuts included jonas kaufmann as lohengrin , james rutherford as hans sachs , johan botha as siegmund and lance ryan as siegfried .
ryan , a tenor from canada , has been hailed as unsurpassed in the role . 2010 was the last year of the " ring " production with director tankred dorst and conductor christian thielemann .
next year , thielemann will not conduct the orchestra but still be heavily involved with the event .
as musical advisor to the festival , he will have a say in who takes the bayreuth stage as a vocalist or conductor . looking ahead the 100th richard wagner festival next year will feature a new production of " tannhaeuser " directed by sebastian baumgarten and with thomas hengelbrock as conductor .
2013 will also bring a new staging of wagner 's masterpiece , " the ring of the nibelung , " to mark the composer 's 200th birthday .
the stage director for that production has yet to be announced , but kirill petrenko of russia is set to conduct the orchestra .
plans are also underway to debut three of wagner 's early operas in bayreuth -lrb- " the fairies , " " the ban on love " and " rienzi " -rrb- , not in the festival hall but in a tent elsewhere in the town . katharina wagner said her aim is to bring bayreuth " eventually to the absolute cutting edge of wagner productions .

the president had hoped to focus on economic issues . in an interview with deutsche welle and other german media ahead of his visit to berlin on monday , ukrainian president viktor yanukovych said he hopes to focus on economic issues when he meets german chancellor angela merkel .
however , it appears that concerns about freedom of the press threaten to overshadow the visit .
the role of valeriy khoroshkovskyi , who is both the head of ukraine 's security intelligence service and a media entrepreneur , also came under focus .
what expectation do you have of this trip to germany ?
what do you hope for from this visit ?
viktor yanukovych : i hope this visit will open up a new chapter in relations between ukraine and germany .
the main aim of our foreign policy is that we fulfill our obligations .
we are involved in pursuing these commitments .
an important issue that we are paying special attention to is making the economy more important in our foreign policy .
in practice , that means the reform plan that i announced recently should serve to create new possibilities for foreign investors .
we are trying to overcome a lot of bureaucratic hurdles that stand in the way of investors .
the system of permits and licenses in place until now has placed a considerable burden on the economy .
we have already halved the number of licenses and different permits .
this system will conform to european standards .
for that reason , i expect only positive outcomes from this visit to germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's questions may extend to the case of nico lang it is expected that the german chancellor will address the case of nico lang .
the ukrainan director of the konrad-adenauer political foundation was denied entry to ukraine and detained at kiev airport -lsb- the matter was settled after intervention from the german embassy -rsb- .
initially it was said that there had been a misunderstanding .
then there was talk of interference in internal affairs .
what was that about ?
every security service has its job to do .
information gets shared .
conflicts that arise are resolved through negotiations between both sides .
i gave my personal instructions to the chief of staff of the security service and also to the foreign minister .
we were able to resolve this very quickly with germany and therefore the case for us is settled .
we hear that you lightly admonished intelligence chief valeriy khoroshkovskyi after this incident , to put it mildly .
is that true ?
when conflicts arise , one must be careful .
there is no doubt , a warning had to be given .
and that 's what i did .
one subject that is also closely watched in germany is the issue of press freedom .
journalists report growing political pressure and in some cases , abuse .
in court , there is a case being contested about whether two tv stations should be allowed to keep their licenses .
several days ago , a journalist in the east of the country disappeared .
how do you assess these developments ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : press freedom is an issue of growing concern in ukraine i am of the view that all conflicts must be solved through the courts .
i can not imagine that in these cases pressure would be put on the court and that courts would make biased decisions .
every court decision is binding for the executive and also must be observed by the mass media . ´ i have had many meetings and encounters concerning freedom of expression and i sometimes ask journalists to tell me or give me proper examples where there is obstruction of freedom of expression .
for me it is important to have concrete , named cases and until i have them , it would not be right to pass judgment .
i have two cases .
first , the director of the television channel tvi claims he was shadowed by people from the secret service .
secondly , i heard from my own contact here in the ukraine that she was summoned to have conversations with people from the intelligence service and asked about my work .
i consider that to be an attempt to intimidate my contact .
are these cases known to you , and how would you categorize them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : questions were raised about intelligence boss valeriy khoroshkovskyi well , this is the first time i have heard that there are such cases .
when there really are such cases then you need to report them officially .
where the first issue is concerned , it hardly seems realistic to me that journalists would be monitored in this way .
i do n't believe that .
anyway , there has been no case that i have been informed about .
as far as journalists being summoned to have conversations with the intelligence service is concerned , i am also hearing that for the first time .
i really would ask you to tell me specifically which journalist was summoned , when , and where to .
i have already submitted these cases officially to the intelligence service a couple of weeks ago .
apparently it has not been forwarded .
so , i would pose the question : do you believe , after so many incidents , that your secret services chief is still the right man to be in this position ?
i ask this in consideration of his connected interests as intelligence chief , media entrepreneur and member of the highest council of justice .
i would say the security chief performs his job in a quite normal manner .
this work has no connection at all with the activities of the mass media .
regarding his assets , he has handed over their administration of his assets to relatives .
we have many officials who also have had assets and , according to the law , the management of these assets have been handed over to trustees .
as far as i know , that happens not only in the ukraine , but also all over the world .

the president had hoped to focus on economic issues . in an interview with deutsche welle and other german media ahead of his visit to berlin on monday , ukrainian president viktor yanukovych said he hopes to focus on economic issues when he meets german chancellor angela merkel .
however , it appears that concerns about freedom of the press threaten to overshadow the visit .
the role of valeriy khoroshkovskyi , who is both the head of ukraine 's security intelligence service and a media entrepreneur , also came under focus .
what expectation do you have of this trip to germany ?
what do you hope for from this visit ?
viktor yanukovych : i hope this visit will open up a new chapter in relations between ukraine and germany .
the main aim of our foreign policy is that we fulfill our obligations .
we are involved in pursuing these commitments .
an important issue that we are paying special attention to is making the economy more important in our foreign policy .
in practice , that means the reform plan that i announced recently should serve to create new possibilities for foreign investors .
we are trying to overcome a lot of bureaucratic hurdles that stand in the way of investors .
the system of permits and licenses in place until now has placed a considerable burden on the economy .
we have already halved the number of licenses and different permits .
this system will conform to european standards .
for that reason , i expect only positive outcomes from this visit to germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's questions may extend to the case of nico lang it is expected that the german chancellor will address the case of nico lang .
the ukrainan director of the konrad-adenauer political foundation was denied entry to ukraine and detained at kiev airport -lsb- the matter was settled after intervention from the german embassy -rsb- .
initially it was said that there had been a misunderstanding .
then there was talk of interference in internal affairs .
what was that about ?
every security service has its job to do .
information gets shared .
conflicts that arise are resolved through negotiations between both sides .
i gave my personal instructions to the chief of staff of the security service and also to the foreign minister .
we were able to resolve this very quickly with germany and therefore the case for us is settled .
we hear that you lightly admonished intelligence chief valeriy khoroshkovskyi after this incident , to put it mildly .
is that true ?
when conflicts arise , one must be careful .
there is no doubt , a warning had to be given .
and that 's what i did .
one subject that is also closely watched in germany is the issue of press freedom .
journalists report growing political pressure and in some cases , abuse .
in court , there is a case being contested about whether two tv stations should be allowed to keep their licenses .
several days ago , a journalist in the east of the country disappeared .
how do you assess these developments ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : press freedom is an issue of growing concern in ukraine i am of the view that all conflicts must be solved through the courts .
i can not imagine that in these cases pressure would be put on the court and that courts would make biased decisions .
every court decision is binding for the executive and also must be observed by the mass media . ´ i have had many meetings and encounters concerning freedom of expression and i sometimes ask journalists to tell me or give me proper examples where there is obstruction of freedom of expression .
for me it is important to have concrete , named cases and until i have them , it would not be right to pass judgment .
i have two cases .
first , the director of the television channel tvi claims he was shadowed by people from the secret service .
secondly , i heard from my own contact here in the ukraine that she was summoned to have conversations with people from the intelligence service and asked about my work .
i consider that to be an attempt to intimidate my contact .
are these cases known to you , and how would you categorize them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : questions were raised about intelligence boss valeriy khoroshkovskyi well , this is the first time i have heard that there are such cases .
when there really are such cases then you need to report them officially .
where the first issue is concerned , it hardly seems realistic to me that journalists would be monitored in this way .
i do n't believe that .
anyway , there has been no case that i have been informed about .
as far as journalists being summoned to have conversations with the intelligence service is concerned , i am also hearing that for the first time .
i really would ask you to tell me specifically which journalist was summoned , when , and where to .
i have already submitted these cases officially to the intelligence service a couple of weeks ago .
apparently it has not been forwarded .
so , i would pose the question : do you believe , after so many incidents , that your secret services chief is still the right man to be in this position ?
i ask this in consideration of his connected interests as intelligence chief , media entrepreneur and member of the highest council of justice .
i would say the security chief performs his job in a quite normal manner .
this work has no connection at all with the activities of the mass media .
regarding his assets , he has handed over their administration of his assets to relatives .
we have many officials who also have had assets and , according to the law , the management of these assets have been handed over to trustees .
as far as i know , that happens not only in the ukraine , but also all over the world .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : questions were raised about intelligence boss valeriy khoroshkovskyi well , this is the first time i have heard that there are such cases .
when there really are such cases then you need to report them officially .
where the first issue is concerned , it hardly seems realistic to me that journalists would be monitored in this way .
i do n't believe that .
anyway , there has been no case that i have been informed about .
as far as journalists being summoned to have conversations with the intelligence service is concerned , i am also hearing that for the first time .
i really would ask you to tell me specifically which journalist was summoned , when , and where to .
i have already submitted these cases officially to the intelligence service a couple of weeks ago .
apparently it has not been forwarded .
so , i would pose the question : do you believe , after so many incidents , that your secret services chief is still the right man to be in this position ?
i ask this in consideration of his connected interests as intelligence chief , media entrepreneur and member of the highest council of justice .
i would say the security chief performs his job in a quite normal manner .
this work has no connection at all with the activities of the mass media .
regarding his assets , he has handed over their administration of his assets to relatives .
we have many officials who also have had assets and , according to the law , the management of these assets have been handed over to trustees .
as far as i know , that happens not only in the ukraine , but also all over the world .

socialist leader elio di rupo has offered to step down , saying he could not reconcile deep political differences . belgium 's french-speaking socialist party leader elio di rupo has been told he must press ahead with talks to form a new government , 10 weeks after parliamentary elections failed to produce a clear winner .
di rupo visited the palace of monarch king albert ii on sunday to offer his resignation after failing to build a working coalition government .
the pair were in discussion for three hours , a palace statement said .
" the king refused and asked him -lsb- di rupo -rsb- to pursue his mission , " the statement read , and di rupo had " accepted " the task .

di rupo added that the sides were " incompatible . "
linguistic and economic divide parliamentary elections in june led to the deadlock , with neither the parties from dutch-speaking flanders nor center-left parties from french-speaking wallonia winning an outright majority .
di rupo has been tasked with balancing flemish demands for more powers for flanders and the concerns of french speakers , who worry that their less-prosperous region will lose out in any devolution process .
another major point of division between the two sides is over government finances for the officially-bilingual capital of brussels .
the failure to establish a government is widely viewed as an embarrassment for belgium , which currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu .

hotel occupancy levels in germany dropped 5.8 percent in 2009 while prices fell 4.3 percent , according to the german association of hotels and restaurants -lrb- dehoga -rrb- .
five stars ?
no thanks big chains in urban areas are keen to attract as many business travelers as possible , but companies ' budgets are tight and some chains find that a five star rating puts customers off .
" we 've seen a change over the last one and a half years ; that customers are being criticized by their company when booking accommodation , and obviously in the five star area , were encouraged not to book there anymore , " robert van der ham , general manager at the intercontinental hotel in cologne told deutsche welle .
" we in the five star segment have lost quite a bit of business compared to hotels with three and four stars , " he explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the intercontinental in cologne used to be a five star plus hotel the intercontinental in cologne , which used to be a five star plus hotel , is not the only example .
the traditional dom-hotel , near cologne 's famous cathedral , has also decided to relinquish its star rating , as has the entire marriott chain .
other groups , like the intercontinental , hilton hotels and germany 's steigenberger chain , have decided to mix and match official star ratings with their own systems .
" it is the decision of the individual hotel .
it depends on what 's going on in their market and their destination and whether it makes sense to be classified because competitors are classified , for example , " angelika heyer , spokesperson for steigenberger hotels said .
no international standards steigenberger 's flagship , the frankfurter hof in the heart of germany 's financial capital , has a five star rating , but heyer says the lack of internationally recognized star standards means hotels nowadays often rely on a strong brand image instead .
" we have our own classification ...
we have comfort , first class and deluxe , and this is understood worldwide .
the brand and the price is what counts today for the traveler , " heyer explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van der ham says business has picked up since he gave up the star rating van der ham from the intercontinental in cologne could not agree more .
" for us , it 's important to see that guests still want service and quality , but at a lesser price and that is a challenge nowadays , " he said .
defending the stars prior to 1996 there were no binding rules for hotel stars in germany or elsewhere , so hotels would simply devise their own system and award themselves stars .
now , there are standard criteria for each star category , with test and awards carried out by dehoga , which represents the hotel industry in germany .
now a five star-rated hotel needs to provide , amongst other things , a 24-hour reception with multilingual staff , a one hour ironing service and every guest has to be met in person with fresh flowers or an equivalent in every room .
dehoga is in the process of harmonizing standards for star ratings across europe .
the association insists that stars are of particular importance to smaller , independent hotels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hotel star ratings in germany are valid for three years so far , germany , sweden , the netherlands , austria , hungary , switzerland and the czech republic have joined the scheme .
" if you do n't have a brand , the message is clear from our point of view .
you should ask for voluntary stars .
it gives a clear message to the consumer , " dehoga general manager markus luthe told deutsche welle .
of the roughly 22,000 hotels in germany , 8,000 are star-rated .
most of them are hotels that are not part of a well-known chain and thus do not have a strong brand image .
impact of social media one of the factors driving hotels away from star ratings is the growing popularity of review websites , where guests are free to leave comments and rate hotels according to their own experience .
" at this moment , i think social media is taking a far more prominent position than dehoga -lrb- and its star ratings system -rrb- , van der ham said .
" if we go to the various platforms there are for customers to go and have a look , it 's quite amazing what is out there , " he said , adding that the chain has a team that regularly scours review sites for comments to use on hotel-specific websites .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social media can help hotels assess how guests rate their service staff but dehoga thinks social media and star ratings do not have to be mutually exclusive and can , in fact , complement each other .
" we can not check adequately , for instance , the friendliness of the staff , but the reviews -lrb- on the web -rrb- can give an additional image of the hotel and then you have the complete picture , " luthe said .
dehoga even wants to go a step further and base star ratings partly on review comments by , for example , boosting a four star rating to a four star plus rating , which is between four and five stars , according to customers ' evaluations .
whichever system guests choose to rely on , service and price is at the heart of every hotel 's business , especially in times of economic hardship .

hotel occupancy levels in germany dropped 5.8 percent in 2009 while prices fell 4.3 percent , according to the german association of hotels and restaurants -lrb- dehoga -rrb- .
five stars ?
no thanks big chains in urban areas are keen to attract as many business travelers as possible , but companies ' budgets are tight and some chains find that a five star rating puts customers off .
" we 've seen a change over the last one and a half years ; that customers are being criticized by their company when booking accommodation , and obviously in the five star area , were encouraged not to book there anymore , " robert van der ham , general manager at the intercontinental hotel in cologne told deutsche welle .
" we in the five star segment have lost quite a bit of business compared to hotels with three and four stars , " he explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the intercontinental in cologne used to be a five star plus hotel the intercontinental in cologne , which used to be a five star plus hotel , is not the only example .
the traditional dom-hotel , near cologne 's famous cathedral , has also decided to relinquish its star rating , as has the entire marriott chain .
other groups , like the intercontinental , hilton hotels and germany 's steigenberger chain , have decided to mix and match official star ratings with their own systems .
" it is the decision of the individual hotel .
it depends on what 's going on in their market and their destination and whether it makes sense to be classified because competitors are classified , for example , " angelika heyer , spokesperson for steigenberger hotels said .
no international standards steigenberger 's flagship , the frankfurter hof in the heart of germany 's financial capital , has a five star rating , but heyer says the lack of internationally recognized star standards means hotels nowadays often rely on a strong brand image instead .
" we have our own classification ...
we have comfort , first class and deluxe , and this is understood worldwide .
the brand and the price is what counts today for the traveler , " heyer explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van der ham says business has picked up since he gave up the star rating van der ham from the intercontinental in cologne could not agree more .
" for us , it 's important to see that guests still want service and quality , but at a lesser price and that is a challenge nowadays , " he said .
defending the stars prior to 1996 there were no binding rules for hotel stars in germany or elsewhere , so hotels would simply devise their own system and award themselves stars .
now , there are standard criteria for each star category , with test and awards carried out by dehoga , which represents the hotel industry in germany .
now a five star-rated hotel needs to provide , amongst other things , a 24-hour reception with multilingual staff , a one hour ironing service and every guest has to be met in person with fresh flowers or an equivalent in every room .
dehoga is in the process of harmonizing standards for star ratings across europe .
the association insists that stars are of particular importance to smaller , independent hotels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hotel star ratings in germany are valid for three years so far , germany , sweden , the netherlands , austria , hungary , switzerland and the czech republic have joined the scheme .
" if you do n't have a brand , the message is clear from our point of view .
you should ask for voluntary stars .
it gives a clear message to the consumer , " dehoga general manager markus luthe told deutsche welle .
of the roughly 22,000 hotels in germany , 8,000 are star-rated .
most of them are hotels that are not part of a well-known chain and thus do not have a strong brand image .
impact of social media one of the factors driving hotels away from star ratings is the growing popularity of review websites , where guests are free to leave comments and rate hotels according to their own experience .
" at this moment , i think social media is taking a far more prominent position than dehoga -lrb- and its star ratings system -rrb- , van der ham said .
" if we go to the various platforms there are for customers to go and have a look , it 's quite amazing what is out there , " he said , adding that the chain has a team that regularly scours review sites for comments to use on hotel-specific websites .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social media can help hotels assess how guests rate their service staff but dehoga thinks social media and star ratings do not have to be mutually exclusive and can , in fact , complement each other .
" we can not check adequately , for instance , the friendliness of the staff , but the reviews -lrb- on the web -rrb- can give an additional image of the hotel and then you have the complete picture , " luthe said .
dehoga even wants to go a step further and base star ratings partly on review comments by , for example , boosting a four star rating to a four star plus rating , which is between four and five stars , according to customers ' evaluations .
whichever system guests choose to rely on , service and price is at the heart of every hotel 's business , especially in times of economic hardship .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 30.08.2010 rare earths keep technology moving in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rare earths are essential ingredients for technological advances as the world becomes more dependent on technology , it also becomes more reliant upon rare metals and minerals .
the eu is preparing a strategy paper to secure a long-term supply of the increasingly necessary materials . it 's a little known fact that in order to stay in the technology manufacturing game , europe has to import some 40 rare metals and minerals .
it 's also a worrying fact because many of the materials used in the production of objects like cell phones and energy efficient lamps are either in limited supply or kept at artificially low levels by china . according to the eu commission , 14 of these rare earths , as they are called , are particularly scarce and are either only available in china or are mined for unrealistic prices elsewhere . while china is key to these materials finding their way to the world market , gwenole cozigou , the commission 's director for chemical , metals , forest-based and textile industries , is worried about the length of beijing 's arm . he said although negotiations with the chinese government over commodity trade are ongoing , foreign buyers are being forced to process rare earths into half-finished products on chinese soil . " china wants to build an industry and that is a perfectly acceptable goal , but if it violates trade regulations we will take action , " cozigou said .
in this case , that means teaming up with the united states and mexico to contact a world trade organization arbitration tribunal . taking on china hubertus bardt , raw materials expert from the institute for economic research in cologne , told deutsche welle it 's up to the eu to make sure china does not exploit its monopoly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tantal is used in micro-processors " one could threaten to impose import restrictions on chinese products , but nobody wants that and ultimately it would harm us , too , " he said .
" but there are always new trade talks and political discussions , and it 's important to use them to prioritize this problem . " it 's a problem which he said he believes will only get worse as fast-growing , emerging nations become ever more dependent upon technology . " there are a number of indications to suggest an increase in demand for these raw materials , " he said .
" firstly there is growth in china , then growth in india and brazil and then technical developments such as electromobility , solar panels and energy efficient lamps . " the role of developing countries besides entering into trade talks and exerting political pressure to secure itself a supply of rare earths , the eu is also keen to work in close cooperation with other developing countries known to have reserves of the raw materials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the democratic republic of congo has deposits of coltan the bloc has already begun negotiations with the african union , but is not , cozigou stressed , offering development aid in return for rare earths . " african countries have to realize that the extraction of raw materials at a fair price is advantageous for their own advancement , " he said , adding that it was the only way to attract potential european investors . but bardt said there is a place for development aid if it helps countries with reserves to establish the kind of market systems and institutions which would ultimately be of benefit to europe . time to recycle according to the eu 's observations , beijing secures entry to the coveted raw materials through the aggressive acquisition of foreign mining companies and land and by making donations to the relevant regimes .
experts say it is a problem , not least because there are very few rare earth mining companies left around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old phones should be recycled to recover reusable materials - not binned that being the case , the european union is supporting scientists looking for rare earths and is pushing for more recycling of raw materials from old mobile phones , televisions and cars . " we have our own mines in our cities across europe , " cozigou said , adding that the eu is currently working towards tightening regulations governing the export of electronic scrap and car wrecks .
" the eu wants what has previously been considered electronic garbage to be deemed valuable raw materials . " autor : bernd riegert / tkw editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the southern city of thatta has apparently been saved from being inundated , and many citizens who fled earlier are returning there . slowly , the focus is turning to the giant task of rebuilding the devastated areas .
the pakistani ngo akhuwat pakistan has launched an innovative plan to help flood victims in southern punjab stand on their own feet as soon as possible .
under the plan by akhuwat pakistan , flood-affected families are to receive microcredits in order to create employment opportunities for them .
the interest-free loans will come without difficult conditions attached .
the organisation 's executive director amjad saqib explains : " look , whatever is happening right now is relief work .
people need food , shelter , medicine . "
but this relief work will be over in one or two months , he adds . bildunterschrift : a boy receives food at a camp on the outskirt of sukkur in southern pakistan " and then the real challenge will come up - how to rehabilitate all these people !
how can they stand on their own feet again ?
so whereas we from akhuwat have been continuously engaged in relief work in the field , within two months we want to shift our focus on one of the worst-affected areas , rajanpur district .
our preparation , fund raising and resource mobilisation are going well , and god willing we 'll select 10,000 badly affected families and provide them with interest-free loans , thus enabling them to re-start the businesses they 've had to abandon due to this flood . "
rebuilding small businesses the flood victims will get between 10,000 and 30,000 rupees -lrb- between 92 and 276 euros -rrb- per family as an interest-free loan .
no security or documents are required , nor will there be any service charges .
according to izhar hashmi , director of akhuwat pakistan , the recipients will be able to buy seeds or raise goats or cattle with the money .
they might also open a small shop in their village or buy a donkey cart and start a transport business .
with the income generated , they 'll have to repay the loans within 30 months .
the money will then be free to be distributed again to other needy persons .
akhuwat plans to raise 150 million rupees -lrb- almost 1.4 million euros -rrb- in donations from pakistanis for the program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crossing a flooded road in punjab province on monday " we wo n't turn pakistanis into beggars , " says amjad saqib , " but want to harness their potential to work hard for a better future .
they 'll rise up on their own and stand on their own feet again . "
an alternative approach to microcredit akhuwat means " brotherhood " in arabic .
the organisation 's philosophy of providing loan-free microcredit is inspired by islamic teaching which prohibits the charging of interest , but it equally provides loans to non-muslims , such as members of the christian minority , relying on the local mosque and church infrastructure . akhuwat , which has been working in pakistan for more than nine years and claims a recovery rate for its loans of almost 100 per cent , is an interesting exception among the growing number of micro-finance institutions worldwide .
recently , criticism has grown of these microcredit groups , as many have been demanding high interest rates , which can become a problem for those who accept their loans .
some development experts have pointed to the akhuwat model , funded by charitable donations and charging no interest at all , as an alternative way .
for pakistani flood victims , it definitely comes as a welcome support in this time of crisis .

he decided to remain in the job , saying that leaving amounted to ' deserting . '
" i asked myself whether i should resign , kouchner said .
" but what would have that changed ?
no , i was not happy about this policy .
i 've been involved with the roma for 25 years .
and i do n't like making a political issue out of them . "
on friday , in an address to french ambassadors , kouchner still openly supported sarkozy 's policy on the roma deportations .
kouchner is the founder of the renowned medical charity doctors without borders and is a highly respected human rights activist .
observers have generally believed that the former socialist politician would have trouble accommodating himself in sarkozy 's conservative government whose views he does not always share .
in another sign that not everyone is in agreement with sarkozy 's tough anti-crime and immigration policy , france 's defense minister hervé morin of the center-right new center party also broke ranks , criticizing the tough crusade of president sarkozy and the interior minister brice hortefeux .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on average , 1,000 roma gypsies are expelled each month 8,000 roma sent back this year already critics say the recent campaigns are a calculated move to boost sarkozy 's flagging popularity before elections in 2012 and distract attention from unpopular plans to cut public spending and raise the retirement age .
jean-marie le pen , the veteran leader of the extreme-right national front , however , agrees with the deportations .
he added that sarkozy was powerless to do anything fundamental about what he described as " a problem caused by the european union opening the borders between european countries . " roma can legally travel to eu countries , but they must show that they have found a job if they want to stay legally in france for more than three months .
the french government has sent more than 8,000 roma back to bulgaria and romania since the start of the year .
around 1,000 were sent back in the past four weeks .

he decided to remain in the job , saying that leaving amounted to ' deserting . '
" i asked myself whether i should resign , kouchner said .
" but what would have that changed ?
no , i was not happy about this policy .
i 've been involved with the roma for 25 years .
and i do n't like making a political issue out of them . "
on friday , in an address to french ambassadors , kouchner still openly supported sarkozy 's policy on the roma deportations .
kouchner is the founder of the renowned medical charity doctors without borders and is a highly respected human rights activist .
observers have generally believed that the former socialist politician would have trouble accommodating himself in sarkozy 's conservative government whose views he does not always share .
in another sign that not everyone is in agreement with sarkozy 's tough anti-crime and immigration policy , france 's defense minister hervé morin of the center-right new center party also broke ranks , criticizing the tough crusade of president sarkozy and the interior minister brice hortefeux .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on average , 1,000 roma gypsies are expelled each month 8,000 roma sent back this year already critics say the recent campaigns are a calculated move to boost sarkozy 's flagging popularity before elections in 2012 and distract attention from unpopular plans to cut public spending and raise the retirement age .
jean-marie le pen , the veteran leader of the extreme-right national front , however , agrees with the deportations .
he added that sarkozy was powerless to do anything fundamental about what he described as " a problem caused by the european union opening the borders between european countries . " roma can legally travel to eu countries , but they must show that they have found a job if they want to stay legally in france for more than three months .
the french government has sent more than 8,000 roma back to bulgaria and romania since the start of the year .
around 1,000 were sent back in the past four weeks .
on tuesday , french officials are due to meet with representatives of the european commission , which is also critical of paris 's crackdown on roma gypsies .
the united nations and the vatican have also condemned the expulsions .

the southern city of thatta has apparently been saved from being inundated , and many citizens who fled earlier are returning there . slowly , the focus is turning to the giant task of rebuilding the devastated areas .
the pakistani ngo akhuwat pakistan has launched an innovative plan to help flood victims in southern punjab stand on their own feet as soon as possible .
under the plan by akhuwat pakistan , flood-affected families are to receive microcredits in order to create employment opportunities for them .
the interest-free loans will come without difficult conditions attached .
the organisation 's executive director amjad saqib explains : " look , whatever is happening right now is relief work .
people need food , shelter , medicine . "
but this relief work will be over in one or two months , he adds . bildunterschrift : a boy receives food at a camp on the outskirt of sukkur in southern pakistan " and then the real challenge will come up - how to rehabilitate all these people !
how can they stand on their own feet again ?
so whereas we from akhuwat have been continuously engaged in relief work in the field , within two months we want to shift our focus on one of the worst-affected areas , rajanpur district .
our preparation , fund raising and resource mobilisation are going well , and god willing we 'll select 10,000 badly affected families and provide them with interest-free loans , thus enabling them to re-start the businesses they 've had to abandon due to this flood . "
rebuilding small businesses the flood victims will get between 10,000 and 30,000 rupees -lrb- between 92 and 276 euros -rrb- per family as an interest-free loan .
no security or documents are required , nor will there be any service charges .
according to izhar hashmi , director of akhuwat pakistan , the recipients will be able to buy seeds or raise goats or cattle with the money .
they might also open a small shop in their village or buy a donkey cart and start a transport business .
with the income generated , they 'll have to repay the loans within 30 months .
the money will then be free to be distributed again to other needy persons .
akhuwat plans to raise 150 million rupees -lrb- almost 1.4 million euros -rrb- in donations from pakistanis for the program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crossing a flooded road in punjab province on monday " we wo n't turn pakistanis into beggars , " says amjad saqib , " but want to harness their potential to work hard for a better future .
they 'll rise up on their own and stand on their own feet again . "
an alternative approach to microcredit akhuwat means " brotherhood " in arabic .
the organisation 's philosophy of providing loan-free microcredit is inspired by islamic teaching which prohibits the charging of interest , but it equally provides loans to non-muslims , such as members of the christian minority , relying on the local mosque and church infrastructure . akhuwat , which has been working in pakistan for more than nine years and claims a recovery rate for its loans of almost 100 per cent , is an interesting exception among the growing number of micro-finance institutions worldwide .
recently , criticism has grown of these microcredit groups , as many have been demanding high interest rates , which can become a problem for those who accept their loans .
some development experts have pointed to the akhuwat model , funded by charitable donations and charging no interest at all , as an alternative way .
for pakistani flood victims , it definitely comes as a welcome support in this time of crisis .

so whereas we from akhuwat have been continuously engaged in relief work in the field , within two months we want to shift our focus on one of the worst-affected areas , rajanpur district .
our preparation , fund raising and resource mobilisation are going well , and god willing we 'll select 10,000 badly affected families and provide them with interest-free loans , thus enabling them to re-start the businesses they 've had to abandon due to this flood . "
rebuilding small businesses the flood victims will get between 10,000 and 30,000 rupees -lrb- between 92 and 276 euros -rrb- per family as an interest-free loan .
no security or documents are required , nor will there be any service charges .
according to izhar hashmi , director of akhuwat pakistan , the recipients will be able to buy seeds or raise goats or cattle with the money .
they might also open a small shop in their village or buy a donkey cart and start a transport business .
with the income generated , they 'll have to repay the loans within 30 months .
the money will then be free to be distributed again to other needy persons .
akhuwat plans to raise 150 million rupees -lrb- almost 1.4 million euros -rrb- in donations from pakistanis for the program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crossing a flooded road in punjab province on monday " we wo n't turn pakistanis into beggars , " says amjad saqib , " but want to harness their potential to work hard for a better future .
they 'll rise up on their own and stand on their own feet again . "
an alternative approach to microcredit akhuwat means " brotherhood " in arabic .
the organisation 's philosophy of providing loan-free microcredit is inspired by islamic teaching which prohibits the charging of interest , but it equally provides loans to non-muslims , such as members of the christian minority , relying on the local mosque and church infrastructure . akhuwat , which has been working in pakistan for more than nine years and claims a recovery rate for its loans of almost 100 per cent , is an interesting exception among the growing number of micro-finance institutions worldwide .
recently , criticism has grown of these microcredit groups , as many have been demanding high interest rates , which can become a problem for those who accept their loans .
some development experts have pointed to the akhuwat model , funded by charitable donations and charging no interest at all , as an alternative way .
for pakistani flood victims , it definitely comes as a welcome support in this time of crisis .

public prosecutors in stuttgart are investigating too . traders and hedge fund managers hate the weekends because they ca n't take react immediately to corporate announcements until trading floors reopen on monday .
sunday , october 26 , 2008 was a particularly bad day for 35 american hedge funds .
that was the day german sports carmaker porsche announced that it owned 42.6 percent of volkswagen 's common stock and options for another 31.5 percent - bringing its total stake in the company to 74.1 percent .
the announcement then declared porsche was seeking to obtain 75 percent of vw shares - a plan that eventually backfired .
the following morning saw a frenzy of trading activity .
hedge fund managers had long been betting that the price of vw stock would fall .
the financial crisis caused demand for cars to fall in the us , driving down american automakers ' share prices .
they figured it was only a matter of time until german carmakers suffered a similar fate .
as a result , their funds were borrowing vw shares and selling them on in the hope they could buy them back later at a lower price - a speculative strategy known as short selling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us fund managers say wendelin wiedeking misled investors about his plans but porsche 's weekend announcement made it clear that fund managers had sold more than double the number of vw shares actually available on the market .
the news drove vw 's stock price up from 290 euros to 1,005 euros per share , making it the world 's most valuable company for a short period of time .
the financial times estimates that hedge funds lost about 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- in two days of trading as a result .
transatlatic battle now the funds want porsche to pay them more than 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2 billion -rrb- in damages .
lawyers representing the hedge funds told a new york court that porsche committed securities fraud by leading investors to believe it was only seeking a 51-percent stake in vw .
porsche 's defense team is due to file a petition to dismiss the lawsuit on wednesday , according to german media .
analysts expect porsche to argue that it was only required to publicly disclose its takeover plans once they were approved by the board - and that that had not been the case prior to october 26 , 2008 .
the hedge funds ' claims may be helped by the fact that german prosecutors in the city of stuttgart are also examining claims that porsche managers manipulated the markets .
investigators are trying to establish whether former porsche chief wendelin wiedeking and his financial director holger haerter influenced stock prices by passing on insider information or misleading investors about the porsche 's plans to increase its stake in vw .
the american plaintiffs will have to be patient if they want to rely on evidence from germany , however .
the stuttgart prosecutors ' preliminary findings are n't due to be released until the end of 2010 or early 2011 .

the pavilion called the " balancity " featured hip-hop during a month long program with graffiti , break-dance and music . hip-hop beats echoing around the area in front of the german pavilion have been attracting scores of young chinese people .
they are excited and sing along loudly with the artists .
" it is different here in comparison to berlin , " says rafael schall from berlin , who is blown away by the response .
" here you can really get the people high on music , dance with them on the stage and really go ballistic .
people really go crazy here . "
schall is one of 50 german hip-hop artists who have come to shangai to perform at the german pavilion .
together with 50 chinese hip-hop artists they have turned it into a laboratory of urban youth culture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanghai singer cha-cha says the project is " quite a cool thing " giving space to young people marion conrady , spokesperson of the german pavilion explains why germany has chosen to present itself at this world fair in this way .
" hip-hop is a youth culture , which can also be seen in cities represented in words through graffiti but also in the form of various performances .
with the help of our ' balancity ' pavilion at the shanghai expo , we are trying to show the versatility of a city .
and in a city , giving space to young people is as important as it is to provide space for high or elite culture . "
graffiti is important for hip-hoppers all over the world .
and one can also see this at the german pavilion .
at the graffiti corner there are not only huge pictures , but also graffiti t-shirts , umbrellas and bags for the visitors .
but in shanghai one hardly gets to see any graffiti .
stan wu works with the " invasion " magazine in hong kong .
he explains why so few walls are painted in shanghai .
" we first had the olympics and now we have the shanghai expo .
so the government and the city are trying to wipe out the whole country .
zero tolerance of ' dirty ' surface , you know .
so there is no chance that you will see a lot of graffiti in the city . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mc wesley from beijing in the ' balancity ' power of graffiti asia 's largest graffiti competition " wall lords finals 2010 " , which was held on sunday at the shanghai expo was also a part of the german hip-hop project .
it was initiated by akim walta from berlin , who has been active in the hip-hop scene there for almost 30 years .
walta talks about a graffiti project by german artists in shanghai .
" our boys also painted something for the residents here .
what was interesting was that they tried to come into contact with the locals .
and suddenly the sad grey street became colorful , with some connection to the locals .
and in the course of time there was some problem and we were asked to remove the graffiti .
but then , little children and families stood up for us and said that we had come from a far away land and the graffiti was a gift for them .
they said it was their picture and they did not want it to be removed . "
walta has been to china many times and has been involved in various graffiti projects .
he hopes that the hip-hop project at the shanghai expo is not the last one .

the pavilion called the " balancity " featured hip-hop during a month long program with graffiti , break-dance and music . hip-hop beats echoing around the area in front of the german pavilion have been attracting scores of young chinese people .
they are excited and sing along loudly with the artists .
" it is different here in comparison to berlin , " says rafael schall from berlin , who is blown away by the response .
" here you can really get the people high on music , dance with them on the stage and really go ballistic .
people really go crazy here . "
schall is one of 50 german hip-hop artists who have come to shangai to perform at the german pavilion .
together with 50 chinese hip-hop artists they have turned it into a laboratory of urban youth culture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanghai singer cha-cha says the project is " quite a cool thing " giving space to young people marion conrady , spokesperson of the german pavilion explains why germany has chosen to present itself at this world fair in this way .
" hip-hop is a youth culture , which can also be seen in cities represented in words through graffiti but also in the form of various performances .
with the help of our ' balancity ' pavilion at the shanghai expo , we are trying to show the versatility of a city .
and in a city , giving space to young people is as important as it is to provide space for high or elite culture . "
graffiti is important for hip-hoppers all over the world .
and one can also see this at the german pavilion .
at the graffiti corner there are not only huge pictures , but also graffiti t-shirts , umbrellas and bags for the visitors .
but in shanghai one hardly gets to see any graffiti .
stan wu works with the " invasion " magazine in hong kong .
he explains why so few walls are painted in shanghai .
" we first had the olympics and now we have the shanghai expo .
so the government and the city are trying to wipe out the whole country .
zero tolerance of ' dirty ' surface , you know .
so there is no chance that you will see a lot of graffiti in the city . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mc wesley from beijing in the ' balancity ' power of graffiti asia 's largest graffiti competition " wall lords finals 2010 " , which was held on sunday at the shanghai expo was also a part of the german hip-hop project .
it was initiated by akim walta from berlin , who has been active in the hip-hop scene there for almost 30 years .
walta talks about a graffiti project by german artists in shanghai .
" our boys also painted something for the residents here .
what was interesting was that they tried to come into contact with the locals .
and suddenly the sad grey street became colorful , with some connection to the locals .
and in the course of time there was some problem and we were asked to remove the graffiti .
but then , little children and families stood up for us and said that we had come from a far away land and the graffiti was a gift for them .
they said it was their picture and they did not want it to be removed . "
walta has been to china many times and has been involved in various graffiti projects .
he hopes that the hip-hop project at the shanghai expo is not the last one .

public prosecutors in stuttgart are investigating too . traders and hedge fund managers hate the weekends because they ca n't take react immediately to corporate announcements until trading floors reopen on monday .
sunday , october 26 , 2008 was a particularly bad day for 35 american hedge funds .
that was the day german sports carmaker porsche announced that it owned 42.6 percent of volkswagen 's common stock and options for another 31.5 percent - bringing its total stake in the company to 74.1 percent .
the announcement then declared porsche was seeking to obtain 75 percent of vw shares - a plan that eventually backfired .
the following morning saw a frenzy of trading activity .
hedge fund managers had long been betting that the price of vw stock would fall .
the financial crisis caused demand for cars to fall in the us , driving down american automakers ' share prices .
they figured it was only a matter of time until german carmakers suffered a similar fate .
as a result , their funds were borrowing vw shares and selling them on in the hope they could buy them back later at a lower price - a speculative strategy known as short selling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us fund managers say wendelin wiedeking misled investors about his plans but porsche 's weekend announcement made it clear that fund managers had sold more than double the number of vw shares actually available on the market .
the news drove vw 's stock price up from 290 euros to 1,005 euros per share , making it the world 's most valuable company for a short period of time .
the financial times estimates that hedge funds lost about 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- in two days of trading as a result .
transatlatic battle now the funds want porsche to pay them more than 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2 billion -rrb- in damages .
lawyers representing the hedge funds told a new york court that porsche committed securities fraud by leading investors to believe it was only seeking a 51-percent stake in vw .
porsche 's defense team is due to file a petition to dismiss the lawsuit on wednesday , according to german media .
analysts expect porsche to argue that it was only required to publicly disclose its takeover plans once they were approved by the board - and that that had not been the case prior to october 26 , 2008 .
the hedge funds ' claims may be helped by the fact that german prosecutors in the city of stuttgart are also examining claims that porsche managers manipulated the markets .
investigators are trying to establish whether former porsche chief wendelin wiedeking and his financial director holger haerter influenced stock prices by passing on insider information or misleading investors about the porsche 's plans to increase its stake in vw .
the american plaintiffs will have to be patient if they want to rely on evidence from germany , however .
the stuttgart prosecutors ' preliminary findings are n't due to be released until the end of 2010 or early 2011 .

deutsche welle spoke with coach marco kurz about the embattled club 's change of fortune . when marco kurz took over kaiserslautern in summer 2009 , the red devils ' situation was truly diabolical .
the former league champions had been reduced to battling against relegation from the second division - a consequence of poor investments and financial difficulties in the early years of the millennium . the club was also running through coaches at the rate of one roughly every 12 months . fast forward a little over a year to the second round of the 2010-11 season , and kaiserslautern are not just back in the top flight , but have beaten bayern munich . lautern 's 2-0 win over the reigning champs on friday was more about perspiration than inspiration .
the red devils stymied bayern with tight defending in midfield , and their thrusts forward were incisive enough to exploit lapses in concentration by munich . " we knew that this was a good time to play bayern munich , " kurz told deutsche welle after the victory .
" our opponents had a lot of national team players in their ranks who had n't yet gotten into the rhythm of practices .
we hoped that would give us a physical advantage . " kaiserslautern played physically against the champions , without a doubt .
but there was more to their game than just kicking their opponents ' shins . and while kurz remains modest , a lot of credit for their performance has to go to their coach . stay cool and read the rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mood has n't been this good at lautern since the 1990s in his playing career as a defender , kurz had the opportunity to work with and learn from some excellent coaches .
in 1994-5 , he was part of the borussia dortmund side that won the bundesliga under coach ottmar hitzfeld .
and two years later , he won the uefa cup with schalke under coach huub stevens . both hitzfeld and stevens are coaches who stress tactical discipline , and that quality seems to have rubbed off on kurz . " i had coaches with whom we trained really hard and i noticed , ' wow , physical fitness is definitely the basis for successful football , " ' kurz said .
" we had unbelievable discipline under huub stevens , especially in his treatment of the team .
i learned that footballers need that .
footballers need hard and fast rules . " those rules are not just about behavior , but what players do on the pitch . " the players have clear instructions in matches how they are to play their positions , " kurz said .
" the individual parts of the team - defense , midfield and attack - receive clear instructions , and you hope they work as a collective .
there 's no one on the pitch without instructions and a plan . " but the skill has to be there for players to execute the coach 's plan .
and this kaiserslautern squad features a very particular collection of skills . bildunterschrift : striker srdjan lakic is one of lautern 's new , inexpensive stars the cast-off crew kaiserslautern used to be a breeding ground for german talent - club alumni include andy brehme , miroslav klose and michael ballack .
those days are long gone .
of the current starting 11 , only goalkeeper tobias sippel is a homegrown product . instead , kaiserslautern have built their squad around eastern european players and underrated castoffs from other clubs .
lautern 's offensive duo srdan lakic and ivo ilicevic came for cheap from hertha berlin and bochum respectively . those two clubs now play in division two , while lakic and ilicevic scored five goals between them in the first pair of matches in the top flight . martin amedick and rodnei , the heart of the defense , were also picked up for a song from bigger clubs where they failed to make their mark . " in terms of the makeup of the squad , we chose players who have reason to be hungry , who have to show they 're good enough for division one , " kurz said .
" we did without established veterans , because we wanted to say , ' look , the guys who got us promoted have the necessary quality . " ' bildunterschrift : the red devils are once again inspiring fear in foes kaiserslautern 's career revivalists have also reanimated crowds . with a home city of only around 100,000 inhabitants , kaiserslautern inhabit one of the smallest markets in the bundesliga .
the football club play an especially important role in local culture , and in the team 's heyday , opponents used to hate playing in fritz walter stadium in front of especially passionate fans . that twelfth-man spirit is now back . " you could see how everyone was drinking in the first division , " kurz said .
" everyone was slavering for it , and now it 's here , and we have a duty to show we 're up to the top flight . with a perfect record , three points earned against germany 's top team and a restored relationship with their supporters , marco kurz 's kaiserslautern are well on their way to proving precisely that . marco kurz was interviewed by kamilla jarzina for dw-tv 's bundesliga kick-off , which is broadcast every monday / tuesday .

" the individual parts of the team - defense , midfield and attack - receive clear instructions , and you hope they work as a collective .
there 's no one on the pitch without instructions and a plan . " but the skill has to be there for players to execute the coach 's plan .
and this kaiserslautern squad features a very particular collection of skills . bildunterschrift : striker srdjan lakic is one of lautern 's new , inexpensive stars the cast-off crew kaiserslautern used to be a breeding ground for german talent - club alumni include andy brehme , miroslav klose and michael ballack .
those days are long gone .
of the current starting 11 , only goalkeeper tobias sippel is a homegrown product . instead , kaiserslautern have built their squad around eastern european players and underrated castoffs from other clubs .
lautern 's offensive duo srdan lakic and ivo ilicevic came for cheap from hertha berlin and bochum respectively . those two clubs now play in division two , while lakic and ilicevic scored five goals between them in the first pair of matches in the top flight . martin amedick and rodnei , the heart of the defense , were also picked up for a song from bigger clubs where they failed to make their mark . " in terms of the makeup of the squad , we chose players who have reason to be hungry , who have to show they 're good enough for division one , " kurz said .
" we did without established veterans , because we wanted to say , ' look , the guys who got us promoted have the necessary quality . " ' bildunterschrift : the red devils are once again inspiring fear in foes kaiserslautern 's career revivalists have also reanimated crowds . with a home city of only around 100,000 inhabitants , kaiserslautern inhabit one of the smallest markets in the bundesliga .
the football club play an especially important role in local culture , and in the team 's heyday , opponents used to hate playing in fritz walter stadium in front of especially passionate fans . that twelfth-man spirit is now back . " you could see how everyone was drinking in the first division , " kurz said .
" everyone was slavering for it , and now it 's here , and we have a duty to show we 're up to the top flight . with a perfect record , three points earned against germany 's top team and a restored relationship with their supporters , marco kurz 's kaiserslautern are well on their way to proving precisely that . marco kurz was interviewed by kamilla jarzina for dw-tv 's bundesliga kick-off , which is broadcast every monday / tuesday .

public prosecutors in stuttgart are investigating too . traders and hedge fund managers hate the weekends because they ca n't take react immediately to corporate announcements until trading floors reopen on monday .
sunday , october 26 , 2008 was a particularly bad day for 35 american hedge funds .
that was the day german sports carmaker porsche announced that it owned 42.6 percent of volkswagen 's common stock and options for another 31.5 percent - bringing its total stake in the company to 74.1 percent .
the announcement then declared porsche was seeking to obtain 75 percent of vw shares - a plan that eventually backfired .
the following morning saw a frenzy of trading activity .
hedge fund managers had long been betting that the price of vw stock would fall .
the financial crisis caused demand for cars to fall in the us , driving down american automakers ' share prices .
they figured it was only a matter of time until german carmakers suffered a similar fate .
as a result , their funds were borrowing vw shares and selling them on in the hope they could buy them back later at a lower price - a speculative strategy known as short selling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us fund managers say wendelin wiedeking misled investors about his plans but porsche 's weekend announcement made it clear that fund managers had sold more than double the number of vw shares actually available on the market .
the news drove vw 's stock price up from 290 euros to 1,005 euros per share , making it the world 's most valuable company for a short period of time .
the financial times estimates that hedge funds lost about 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- in two days of trading as a result .
transatlatic battle now the funds want porsche to pay them more than 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2 billion -rrb- in damages .
lawyers representing the hedge funds told a new york court that porsche committed securities fraud by leading investors to believe it was only seeking a 51-percent stake in vw .
porsche 's defense team is due to file a petition to dismiss the lawsuit on wednesday , according to german media .
analysts expect porsche to argue that it was only required to publicly disclose its takeover plans once they were approved by the board - and that that had not been the case prior to october 26 , 2008 .
the hedge funds ' claims may be helped by the fact that german prosecutors in the city of stuttgart are also examining claims that porsche managers manipulated the markets .
investigators are trying to establish whether former porsche chief wendelin wiedeking and his financial director holger haerter influenced stock prices by passing on insider information or misleading investors about the porsche 's plans to increase its stake in vw .
the american plaintiffs will have to be patient if they want to rely on evidence from germany , however .
the stuttgart prosecutors ' preliminary findings are n't due to be released until the end of 2010 or early 2011 .

but it closed this year with a tribute to festival innovator christoph schlingensief and a glimpse of changes to come . the 99th richard wagner festival in bayreuth closed sunday with a performance of wagner 's opera " the mastersingers of nuremberg . " the performance was dedicated to the provocative german film and theater director christoph schlingensief , who staged " parsifal " at the 2004 festival .
his production shocked some fans and was credited with bringing a new impulse to bayreuth .
schlingensief died of lung cancer on august 21 . composer richard wagner founded the bayreuth festival 134 years ago .
since then , his works - 10 operas - have been the sole basis for festival performances .
this fact alone makes it clear how important tradition is in bayreuth . tradition and renewal however , some signs point to change following the era of long-time festival director wolfgang wagner , who died early in 2010 .
his daughters and successors , eva wagner-pasquier and katharina wagner , have exhibited both openness and savvy in taking over direction of the festival . in 2010 , the festival continued its media push by offering public viewings and livestreams of selected performances .
on august 21 , 20,000 viewers came to watch " the valkyrie " transmitted live from the festspielhaus to a big screen at a market square in bayreuth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wager-pasquier assured audiences that wagner 's operas will not be upstaged according to a survey , 70 percent of the guests had never attended a wagner opera .
while visitors ate sausage , beer and pretzels , they could follow the performance featuring close-ups and subtitles .
the opera was also streamed live online and broadcast on japanese television .
the concept will continue next year with german broadcasters presenting " lohengrin " live from the festival . " wagner for kids " has also established itself as part of the event in bayreuth .
in the project 's second year , " tannhaeuser " was performed in a 70 minute kid-friendly version , targeted at six-to-12-year-olds .
the children followed the opera with great interest , and the crowd 's favorite was clearly love goddess venus , who sported a punk outfit and a skateboard . the beginning of the 2010 season also brought the announcement that an independent commission will receive complete access to the wagner house archives in order to examine the role of the festival during the third reich .
but at least one element is not up for discussion . " it 's certain that no other composer will be presented here , " said co-director eva wagner-pasquier .
" we will of course uphold the vision of the foundation and wagner house as well as the festival concept itself . " a shock for conservatives those who want to attend the bayreuth festival generally have to prepare for a long wait .
this year brought 408,000 ticket requests from 80 countries for the just 54,000 available seats .
it 's regarded as a privilege to be in bayreuth , even for the employees , who often had to work for low pay in previous years . changing attitudes toward compensation also mark the beginning of a new era for the festival .
following a salary dispute with stage workers last year , ticket prices had to be raised .
stage workers also succeeded in lobbying for mandatory breaks , which led to a new playing schedule this season .
this time , the four operas in the ring cycle - " the rheingold , " " the valkyrie , " " siegfried , " and " twilight of the gods " - were n't played consecutively .
that may not seem like a monumental change , but it would have been nearly unimaginable under wolfgang wagner 's direction and runs counter to the intentions of festival father richard wagner . many conservative wagnerians belong to the society of friends of bayreuth , an organization founded in 1949 by wolfgang wagner that since its inception has contributed more than 55 million euros -lrb- $ 70 million -rrb- to the festival .
following his death , the organization became a festival shareholder with the right to help make decisions related to the event .
disagreements and even public disputes have since erupted between the society and the festival leadership , which has strongly backed a newly-founded fundraising organization called the team of active festival supporters . a year of beautiful voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tenor lance ryan garnered praise this year in his bayreuth debut as siegfried in their second year heading the festival , wagner 's great-granddaughters katharina wagner and eva wagner-pasquier were able to fill the operas ' ranks with better singers than in recent decades .
the much-anticipated debuts included jonas kaufmann as lohengrin , james rutherford as hans sachs , johan botha as siegmund and lance ryan as siegfried .
ryan , a tenor from canada , has been hailed as unsurpassed in the role . 2010 was the last year of the " ring " production with director tankred dorst and conductor christian thielemann .
next year , thielemann will not conduct the orchestra but still be heavily involved with the event .
as musical advisor to the festival , he will have a say in who takes the bayreuth stage as a vocalist or conductor . looking ahead the 100th richard wagner festival next year will feature a new production of " tannhaeuser " directed by sebastian baumgarten and with thomas hengelbrock as conductor .
2013 will also bring a new staging of wagner 's masterpiece , " the ring of the nibelung , " to mark the composer 's 200th birthday .
the stage director for that production has yet to be announced , but kirill petrenko of russia is set to conduct the orchestra .
plans are also underway to debut three of wagner 's early operas in bayreuth -lrb- " the fairies , " " the ban on love " and " rienzi " -rrb- , not in the festival hall but in a tent elsewhere in the town . katharina wagner said her aim is to bring bayreuth " eventually to the absolute cutting edge of wagner productions .

this fact alone makes it clear how important tradition is in bayreuth . tradition and renewal however , some signs point to change following the era of long-time festival director wolfgang wagner , who died early in 2010 .
his daughters and successors , eva wagner-pasquier and katharina wagner , have exhibited both openness and savvy in taking over direction of the festival . in 2010 , the festival continued its media push by offering public viewings and livestreams of selected performances .
on august 21 , 20,000 viewers came to watch " the valkyrie " transmitted live from the festspielhaus to a big screen at a market square in bayreuth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wager-pasquier assured audiences that wagner 's operas will not be upstaged according to a survey , 70 percent of the guests had never attended a wagner opera .
while visitors ate sausage , beer and pretzels , they could follow the performance featuring close-ups and subtitles .
the opera was also streamed live online and broadcast on japanese television .
the concept will continue next year with german broadcasters presenting " lohengrin " live from the festival . " wagner for kids " has also established itself as part of the event in bayreuth .
in the project 's second year , " tannhaeuser " was performed in a 70 minute kid-friendly version , targeted at six-to-12-year-olds .
the children followed the opera with great interest , and the crowd 's favorite was clearly love goddess venus , who sported a punk outfit and a skateboard . the beginning of the 2010 season also brought the announcement that an independent commission will receive complete access to the wagner house archives in order to examine the role of the festival during the third reich .
but at least one element is not up for discussion . " it 's certain that no other composer will be presented here , " said co-director eva wagner-pasquier .
" we will of course uphold the vision of the foundation and wagner house as well as the festival concept itself . " a shock for conservatives those who want to attend the bayreuth festival generally have to prepare for a long wait .
this year brought 408,000 ticket requests from 80 countries for the just 54,000 available seats .
it 's regarded as a privilege to be in bayreuth , even for the employees , who often had to work for low pay in previous years . changing attitudes toward compensation also mark the beginning of a new era for the festival .
following a salary dispute with stage workers last year , ticket prices had to be raised .
stage workers also succeeded in lobbying for mandatory breaks , which led to a new playing schedule this season .
this time , the four operas in the ring cycle - " the rheingold , " " the valkyrie , " " siegfried , " and " twilight of the gods " - were n't played consecutively .
that may not seem like a monumental change , but it would have been nearly unimaginable under wolfgang wagner 's direction and runs counter to the intentions of festival father richard wagner . many conservative wagnerians belong to the society of friends of bayreuth , an organization founded in 1949 by wolfgang wagner that since its inception has contributed more than 55 million euros -lrb- $ 70 million -rrb- to the festival .
following his death , the organization became a festival shareholder with the right to help make decisions related to the event .
disagreements and even public disputes have since erupted between the society and the festival leadership , which has strongly backed a newly-founded fundraising organization called the team of active festival supporters . a year of beautiful voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tenor lance ryan garnered praise this year in his bayreuth debut as siegfried in their second year heading the festival , wagner 's great-granddaughters katharina wagner and eva wagner-pasquier were able to fill the operas ' ranks with better singers than in recent decades .
the much-anticipated debuts included jonas kaufmann as lohengrin , james rutherford as hans sachs , johan botha as siegmund and lance ryan as siegfried .
ryan , a tenor from canada , has been hailed as unsurpassed in the role . 2010 was the last year of the " ring " production with director tankred dorst and conductor christian thielemann .
next year , thielemann will not conduct the orchestra but still be heavily involved with the event .
as musical advisor to the festival , he will have a say in who takes the bayreuth stage as a vocalist or conductor . looking ahead the 100th richard wagner festival next year will feature a new production of " tannhaeuser " directed by sebastian baumgarten and with thomas hengelbrock as conductor .
2013 will also bring a new staging of wagner 's masterpiece , " the ring of the nibelung , " to mark the composer 's 200th birthday .
the stage director for that production has yet to be announced , but kirill petrenko of russia is set to conduct the orchestra .
plans are also underway to debut three of wagner 's early operas in bayreuth -lrb- " the fairies , " " the ban on love " and " rienzi " -rrb- , not in the festival hall but in a tent elsewhere in the town . katharina wagner said her aim is to bring bayreuth " eventually to the absolute cutting edge of wagner productions .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel paid a visit to several power plants over the last week ensuring energy supplies the chancellor , citing an independent consultants ' report published this week , said such a time frame would ensure germany 's energy needs are met as the country transitions to renewable energy sources .
energy prices would remain under control and goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions would be reached with an extra 10 to 15 years of nuclear power , merkel added . " i have to consider , as head of government , how we integrate safety as the overriding principle of nuclear energy , " she said . sigmar gabriel , head of the opposition social democratic party , criticized merkel 's decision . " the chancellor 's statement shows that the decision is n't based on a sustainable energy plan but the hard-nosed lobbying work done by nuclear power companies , " he told reporters on sunday . clean energy groups agree with the opposition and point out that using nuclear and renewable energy sources in tandem is not efficient . " renewable energies are feeding into the system in a flexible way , depending on weather conditions for example , " bjoern klusmann , director of germany 's renewable energy association told deutsche welle . " because of the priority given to renewables in the german grid , the conventional power stations , so coal and nuclear and other fossil power stations , have to react in a flexible way to the production from renewables .
nuclear energy is not as flexible as is needed for this future concept of renewable energy being the dominant part in our grid , " he explained . in a statement on friday , merkel said renewable energies should supply half of all energy needs by 2050 and that nuclear and coal power would continue until supplies could be met entirely by clean energy , a strategy that clean energy experts like klusmann say is a false economy .

socialist leader elio di rupo has offered to step down , saying he could not reconcile deep political differences . belgium 's french-speaking socialist party leader elio di rupo has been told he must press ahead with talks to form a new government , 10 weeks after parliamentary elections failed to produce a clear winner .
di rupo visited the palace of monarch king albert ii on sunday to offer his resignation after failing to build a working coalition government .
the pair were in discussion for three hours , a palace statement said .
" the king refused and asked him -lsb- di rupo -rsb- to pursue his mission , " the statement read , and di rupo had " accepted " the task .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the dispute is over funding to brussels a marathon 10 hours of crisis talks broke up without a deal earlier on sunday , with di rupo telling reporters there was no agreement between his party and two flemish parties - the nationalist n-va and the center-right christian democrats .
di rupo added that the sides were " incompatible . "
linguistic and economic divide parliamentary elections in june led to the deadlock , with neither the parties from dutch-speaking flanders nor center-left parties from french-speaking wallonia winning an outright majority .
di rupo has been tasked with balancing flemish demands for more powers for flanders and the concerns of french speakers , who worry that their less-prosperous region will lose out in any devolution process .
another major point of division between the two sides is over government finances for the officially-bilingual capital of brussels .
the failure to establish a government is widely viewed as an embarrassment for belgium , which currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu .

the eu is preparing a strategy paper to secure a long-term supply of the increasingly necessary materials . it 's a little known fact that in order to stay in the technology manufacturing game , europe has to import some 40 rare metals and minerals .
it 's also a worrying fact because many of the materials used in the production of objects like cell phones and energy efficient lamps are either in limited supply or kept at artificially low levels by china . according to the eu commission , 14 of these rare earths , as they are called , are particularly scarce and are either only available in china or are mined for unrealistic prices elsewhere . while china is key to these materials finding their way to the world market , gwenole cozigou , the commission 's director for chemical , metals , forest-based and textile industries , is worried about the length of beijing 's arm . he said although negotiations with the chinese government over commodity trade are ongoing , foreign buyers are being forced to process rare earths into half-finished products on chinese soil . " china wants to build an industry and that is a perfectly acceptable goal , but if it violates trade regulations we will take action , " cozigou said .
in this case , that means teaming up with the united states and mexico to contact a world trade organization arbitration tribunal . taking on china hubertus bardt , raw materials expert from the institute for economic research in cologne , told deutsche welle it 's up to the eu to make sure china does not exploit its monopoly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tantal is used in micro-processors " one could threaten to impose import restrictions on chinese products , but nobody wants that and ultimately it would harm us , too , " he said .
" but there are always new trade talks and political discussions , and it 's important to use them to prioritize this problem . " it 's a problem which he said he believes will only get worse as fast-growing , emerging nations become ever more dependent upon technology . " there are a number of indications to suggest an increase in demand for these raw materials , " he said .
" firstly there is growth in china , then growth in india and brazil and then technical developments such as electromobility , solar panels and energy efficient lamps . " the role of developing countries besides entering into trade talks and exerting political pressure to secure itself a supply of rare earths , the eu is also keen to work in close cooperation with other developing countries known to have reserves of the raw materials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the democratic republic of congo has deposits of coltan the bloc has already begun negotiations with the african union , but is not , cozigou stressed , offering development aid in return for rare earths . " african countries have to realize that the extraction of raw materials at a fair price is advantageous for their own advancement , " he said , adding that it was the only way to attract potential european investors . but bardt said there is a place for development aid if it helps countries with reserves to establish the kind of market systems and institutions which would ultimately be of benefit to europe . time to recycle according to the eu 's observations , beijing secures entry to the coveted raw materials through the aggressive acquisition of foreign mining companies and land and by making donations to the relevant regimes .
experts say it is a problem , not least because there are very few rare earth mining companies left around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old phones should be recycled to recover reusable materials - not binned that being the case , the european union is supporting scientists looking for rare earths and is pushing for more recycling of raw materials from old mobile phones , televisions and cars . " we have our own mines in our cities across europe , " cozigou said , adding that the eu is currently working towards tightening regulations governing the export of electronic scrap and car wrecks .

online dictionaries have gained so much popularity over their printed counterparts that the next edition of the oxford english dictionary will probably appear only in electronic form , according to its publisher , the oxford university press .
" the print dictionary market is just disappearing , it is falling away by tens of per cent a year , " nigel portwood , the chief executive of the oxford university press , told uk newspaper the sunday times .
he told the uk newspaper he did not think the third edition would be printed .
the second and most recent oed has existed online for more than a decade , where it receives two million hits a month from subscribers who pay an annual fee of almost 300 euros to access it .
a wider trend towards online simon winchester , author of the meaning of everything : the story of the oxford english dictionary , said the oxford university press 's move away from print editions of the dictionary " reflects an inevitability " and is part of a growing trend of readers moving away from printed books toward digital editions and electronic e-readers like the kindle or the ipad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dictionary-users are increasingly turning to the internet for their answers " i think the electronic book is going to achieve ascendancy over the printed book , and i think that the printed book is just starting now to vanish , " winchester said .
though he owns three sets of the printed version of the oxford english dictionary , he said he relies on the digital version .
" on my ipad , i 've used the oed twice if not three times today .
but i never ever go to the hardback version .
it sits there on the shelf gathering dust , looking beautiful , but i never use it . "
online dictionary keeps better pace the move away from printed dictionaries could also be helping to create a more accessible oed , and one that evolves better alongside the language that it documents , said charlotte brewer , professor of english language and literature at oxford university and author of treasure-house of the language : the living oed .
" when the first dictionaries were produced in the victorian period , the edwardian period in the uk , there were all sorts of assumptions about what was proper to go into a dictionary – so words to do with sex , and the body , sometimes did n't get in or sometimes were defined in a way that we would regard as inadequate , " she said .
many of the quotations used in older editions of the oed were drawn from historical and literary sources .
now , brewer said , " the lexicographers can use the web , they can use google , they have access to an enormous variety of language online , they can instantly access a far broader range of sources .
in this way … it 's likely to become more democratic . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet offers lexicographers a broader range of sources to draw upon an ' absolutely enormous ' undertaking almost one third of a million entries were contained in the second version of the oed , published in hard copy in 1989 .
since then , a team of 80 lexicographers have been working on the third edition , though they have completed only 28 percent of the dictionary .
" we 're talking about an absolutely enormous amount of data , which in its last printed form occupied 20 volumes , " brewer said .
she said the third edition of the dictionary would likely be even larger .
" i think the point is that the cost of this work would be unbelievable - you know , you have to wonder who could possibly afford to buy it , " brewer said .
with the most recent edition weighing in at a hefty 62.9 kilos , an electronic version of edition three would not only be lighter on the hip pocket – it would also be easier on the back .

it sits there on the shelf gathering dust , looking beautiful , but i never use it . "
online dictionary keeps better pace the move away from printed dictionaries could also be helping to create a more accessible oed , and one that evolves better alongside the language that it documents , said charlotte brewer , professor of english language and literature at oxford university and author of treasure-house of the language : the living oed .
" when the first dictionaries were produced in the victorian period , the edwardian period in the uk , there were all sorts of assumptions about what was proper to go into a dictionary – so words to do with sex , and the body , sometimes did n't get in or sometimes were defined in a way that we would regard as inadequate , " she said .
many of the quotations used in older editions of the oed were drawn from historical and literary sources .
now , brewer said , " the lexicographers can use the web , they can use google , they have access to an enormous variety of language online , they can instantly access a far broader range of sources .
in this way … it 's likely to become more democratic . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet offers lexicographers a broader range of sources to draw upon an ' absolutely enormous ' undertaking almost one third of a million entries were contained in the second version of the oed , published in hard copy in 1989 .
since then , a team of 80 lexicographers have been working on the third edition , though they have completed only 28 percent of the dictionary .
" we 're talking about an absolutely enormous amount of data , which in its last printed form occupied 20 volumes , " brewer said .
she said the third edition of the dictionary would likely be even larger .
" i think the point is that the cost of this work would be unbelievable - you know , you have to wonder who could possibly afford to buy it , " brewer said .
with the most recent edition weighing in at a hefty 62.9 kilos , an electronic version of edition three would not only be lighter on the hip pocket – it would also be easier on the back .

the eu is preparing a strategy paper to secure a long-term supply of the increasingly necessary materials . it 's a little known fact that in order to stay in the technology manufacturing game , europe has to import some 40 rare metals and minerals .
it 's also a worrying fact because many of the materials used in the production of objects like cell phones and energy efficient lamps are either in limited supply or kept at artificially low levels by china . according to the eu commission , 14 of these rare earths , as they are called , are particularly scarce and are either only available in china or are mined for unrealistic prices elsewhere . while china is key to these materials finding their way to the world market , gwenole cozigou , the commission 's director for chemical , metals , forest-based and textile industries , is worried about the length of beijing 's arm . he said although negotiations with the chinese government over commodity trade are ongoing , foreign buyers are being forced to process rare earths into half-finished products on chinese soil . " china wants to build an industry and that is a perfectly acceptable goal , but if it violates trade regulations we will take action , " cozigou said .

" it 's a problem which he said he believes will only get worse as fast-growing , emerging nations become ever more dependent upon technology .

five stars ?
no thanks big chains in urban areas are keen to attract as many business travelers as possible , but companies ' budgets are tight and some chains find that a five star rating puts customers off .
" we 've seen a change over the last one and a half years ; that customers are being criticized by their company when booking accommodation , and obviously in the five star area , were encouraged not to book there anymore , " robert van der ham , general manager at the intercontinental hotel in cologne told deutsche welle .
" we in the five star segment have lost quite a bit of business compared to hotels with three and four stars , " he explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the intercontinental in cologne used to be a five star plus hotel the intercontinental in cologne , which used to be a five star plus hotel , is not the only example .
the traditional dom-hotel , near cologne 's famous cathedral , has also decided to relinquish its star rating , as has the entire marriott chain .
other groups , like the intercontinental , hilton hotels and germany 's steigenberger chain , have decided to mix and match official star ratings with their own systems .
" it is the decision of the individual hotel .
it depends on what 's going on in their market and their destination and whether it makes sense to be classified because competitors are classified , for example , " angelika heyer , spokesperson for steigenberger hotels said .
no international standards steigenberger 's flagship , the frankfurter hof in the heart of germany 's financial capital , has a five star rating , but heyer says the lack of internationally recognized star standards means hotels nowadays often rely on a strong brand image instead .
" we have our own classification ...
we have comfort , first class and deluxe , and this is understood worldwide .
the brand and the price is what counts today for the traveler , " heyer explained .

" for us , it 's important to see that guests still want service and quality , but at a lesser price and that is a challenge nowadays , " he said .
defending the stars prior to 1996 there were no binding rules for hotel stars in germany or elsewhere , so hotels would simply devise their own system and award themselves stars .
now , there are standard criteria for each star category , with test and awards carried out by dehoga , which represents the hotel industry in germany .
now a five star-rated hotel needs to provide , amongst other things , a 24-hour reception with multilingual staff , a one hour ironing service and every guest has to be met in person with fresh flowers or an equivalent in every room .
dehoga is in the process of harmonizing standards for star ratings across europe .
the association insists that stars are of particular importance to smaller , independent hotels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hotel star ratings in germany are valid for three years so far , germany , sweden , the netherlands , austria , hungary , switzerland and the czech republic have joined the scheme .
" if you do n't have a brand , the message is clear from our point of view .
you should ask for voluntary stars .
it gives a clear message to the consumer , " dehoga general manager markus luthe told deutsche welle .
of the roughly 22,000 hotels in germany , 8,000 are star-rated .
most of them are hotels that are not part of a well-known chain and thus do not have a strong brand image .
impact of social media one of the factors driving hotels away from star ratings is the growing popularity of review websites , where guests are free to leave comments and rate hotels according to their own experience .
" at this moment , i think social media is taking a far more prominent position than dehoga -lrb- and its star ratings system -rrb- , van der ham said .
" if we go to the various platforms there are for customers to go and have a look , it 's quite amazing what is out there , " he said , adding that the chain has a team that regularly scours review sites for comments to use on hotel-specific websites .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social media can help hotels assess how guests rate their service staff but dehoga thinks social media and star ratings do not have to be mutually exclusive and can , in fact , complement each other .
" we can not check adequately , for instance , the friendliness of the staff , but the reviews -lrb- on the web -rrb- can give an additional image of the hotel and then you have the complete picture , " luthe said .
dehoga even wants to go a step further and base star ratings partly on review comments by , for example , boosting a four star rating to a four star plus rating , which is between four and five stars , according to customers ' evaluations .
whichever system guests choose to rely on , service and price is at the heart of every hotel 's business , especially in times of economic hardship .

hotel occupancy levels in germany dropped 5.8 percent in 2009 while prices fell 4.3 percent , according to the german association of hotels and restaurants -lrb- dehoga -rrb- .
five stars ?
no thanks big chains in urban areas are keen to attract as many business travelers as possible , but companies ' budgets are tight and some chains find that a five star rating puts customers off .
" we 've seen a change over the last one and a half years ; that customers are being criticized by their company when booking accommodation , and obviously in the five star area , were encouraged not to book there anymore , " robert van der ham , general manager at the intercontinental hotel in cologne told deutsche welle .
" we in the five star segment have lost quite a bit of business compared to hotels with three and four stars , " he explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the intercontinental in cologne used to be a five star plus hotel the intercontinental in cologne , which used to be a five star plus hotel , is not the only example .
the traditional dom-hotel , near cologne 's famous cathedral , has also decided to relinquish its star rating , as has the entire marriott chain .
other groups , like the intercontinental , hilton hotels and germany 's steigenberger chain , have decided to mix and match official star ratings with their own systems .
" it is the decision of the individual hotel .
it depends on what 's going on in their market and their destination and whether it makes sense to be classified because competitors are classified , for example , " angelika heyer , spokesperson for steigenberger hotels said .
no international standards steigenberger 's flagship , the frankfurter hof in the heart of germany 's financial capital , has a five star rating , but heyer says the lack of internationally recognized star standards means hotels nowadays often rely on a strong brand image instead .
" we have our own classification ...
we have comfort , first class and deluxe , and this is understood worldwide .
the brand and the price is what counts today for the traveler , " heyer explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van der ham says business has picked up since he gave up the star rating van der ham from the intercontinental in cologne could not agree more .
" for us , it 's important to see that guests still want service and quality , but at a lesser price and that is a challenge nowadays , " he said .
defending the stars prior to 1996 there were no binding rules for hotel stars in germany or elsewhere , so hotels would simply devise their own system and award themselves stars .
now , there are standard criteria for each star category , with test and awards carried out by dehoga , which represents the hotel industry in germany .
now a five star-rated hotel needs to provide , amongst other things , a 24-hour reception with multilingual staff , a one hour ironing service and every guest has to be met in person with fresh flowers or an equivalent in every room .
dehoga is in the process of harmonizing standards for star ratings across europe .
the association insists that stars are of particular importance to smaller , independent hotels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hotel star ratings in germany are valid for three years so far , germany , sweden , the netherlands , austria , hungary , switzerland and the czech republic have joined the scheme .
" if you do n't have a brand , the message is clear from our point of view .
you should ask for voluntary stars .
it gives a clear message to the consumer , " dehoga general manager markus luthe told deutsche welle .
of the roughly 22,000 hotels in germany , 8,000 are star-rated .
most of them are hotels that are not part of a well-known chain and thus do not have a strong brand image .
impact of social media one of the factors driving hotels away from star ratings is the growing popularity of review websites , where guests are free to leave comments and rate hotels according to their own experience .
" at this moment , i think social media is taking a far more prominent position than dehoga -lrb- and its star ratings system -rrb- , van der ham said .
" if we go to the various platforms there are for customers to go and have a look , it 's quite amazing what is out there , " he said , adding that the chain has a team that regularly scours review sites for comments to use on hotel-specific websites .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social media can help hotels assess how guests rate their service staff but dehoga thinks social media and star ratings do not have to be mutually exclusive and can , in fact , complement each other .
" we can not check adequately , for instance , the friendliness of the staff , but the reviews -lrb- on the web -rrb- can give an additional image of the hotel and then you have the complete picture , " luthe said .
dehoga even wants to go a step further and base star ratings partly on review comments by , for example , boosting a four star rating to a four star plus rating , which is between four and five stars , according to customers ' evaluations .
whichever system guests choose to rely on , service and price is at the heart of every hotel 's business , especially in times of economic hardship .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : floods in pakistan very little support for flood victims in punjab german red cross brings clean water to pakistan pakistani volunteers bring relief to flood victims pakistani islamist groups very visible in the flood-affected regions finance -pipe- 30.08.2010 microcredit to support reconstruction after floods großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pakistani flood survivor rebuilds his house in nowshera there has been a slight improvement in the flood situation in pakistan .
the southern city of thatta has apparently been saved from being inundated , and many citizens who fled earlier are returning there . slowly , the focus is turning to the giant task of rebuilding the devastated areas .
the pakistani ngo akhuwat pakistan has launched an innovative plan to help flood victims in southern punjab stand on their own feet as soon as possible .
under the plan by akhuwat pakistan , flood-affected families are to receive microcredits in order to create employment opportunities for them .
the interest-free loans will come without difficult conditions attached .
the organisation 's executive director amjad saqib explains : " look , whatever is happening right now is relief work .
people need food , shelter , medicine . "
but this relief work will be over in one or two months , he adds . bildunterschrift : a boy receives food at a camp on the outskirt of sukkur in southern pakistan " and then the real challenge will come up - how to rehabilitate all these people !
how can they stand on their own feet again ?
so whereas we from akhuwat have been continuously engaged in relief work in the field , within two months we want to shift our focus on one of the worst-affected areas , rajanpur district .
our preparation , fund raising and resource mobilisation are going well , and god willing we 'll select 10,000 badly affected families and provide them with interest-free loans , thus enabling them to re-start the businesses they 've had to abandon due to this flood . "
rebuilding small businesses the flood victims will get between 10,000 and 30,000 rupees -lrb- between 92 and 276 euros -rrb- per family as an interest-free loan .
no security or documents are required , nor will there be any service charges .
according to izhar hashmi , director of akhuwat pakistan , the recipients will be able to buy seeds or raise goats or cattle with the money .
they might also open a small shop in their village or buy a donkey cart and start a transport business .
with the income generated , they 'll have to repay the loans within 30 months .
the money will then be free to be distributed again to other needy persons .
akhuwat plans to raise 150 million rupees -lrb- almost 1.4 million euros -rrb- in donations from pakistanis for the program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crossing a flooded road in punjab province on monday " we wo n't turn pakistanis into beggars , " says amjad saqib , " but want to harness their potential to work hard for a better future .
they 'll rise up on their own and stand on their own feet again . "
an alternative approach to microcredit akhuwat means " brotherhood " in arabic .
the organisation 's philosophy of providing loan-free microcredit is inspired by islamic teaching which prohibits the charging of interest , but it equally provides loans to non-muslims , such as members of the christian minority , relying on the local mosque and church infrastructure . akhuwat , which has been working in pakistan for more than nine years and claims a recovery rate for its loans of almost 100 per cent , is an interesting exception among the growing number of micro-finance institutions worldwide .
recently , criticism has grown of these microcredit groups , as many have been demanding high interest rates , which can become a problem for those who accept their loans .
some development experts have pointed to the akhuwat model , funded by charitable donations and charging no interest at all , as an alternative way .
for pakistani flood victims , it definitely comes as a welcome support in this time of crisis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 30.08.2010 rare earths keep technology moving in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rare earths are essential ingredients for technological advances as the world becomes more dependent on technology , it also becomes more reliant upon rare metals and minerals .
the eu is preparing a strategy paper to secure a long-term supply of the increasingly necessary materials . it 's a little known fact that in order to stay in the technology manufacturing game , europe has to import some 40 rare metals and minerals .
it 's also a worrying fact because many of the materials used in the production of objects like cell phones and energy efficient lamps are either in limited supply or kept at artificially low levels by china . according to the eu commission , 14 of these rare earths , as they are called , are particularly scarce and are either only available in china or are mined for unrealistic prices elsewhere . while china is key to these materials finding their way to the world market , gwenole cozigou , the commission 's director for chemical , metals , forest-based and textile industries , is worried about the length of beijing 's arm . he said although negotiations with the chinese government over commodity trade are ongoing , foreign buyers are being forced to process rare earths into half-finished products on chinese soil . " china wants to build an industry and that is a perfectly acceptable goal , but if it violates trade regulations we will take action , " cozigou said .
in this case , that means teaming up with the united states and mexico to contact a world trade organization arbitration tribunal . taking on china hubertus bardt , raw materials expert from the institute for economic research in cologne , told deutsche welle it 's up to the eu to make sure china does not exploit its monopoly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tantal is used in micro-processors " one could threaten to impose import restrictions on chinese products , but nobody wants that and ultimately it would harm us , too , " he said .
" but there are always new trade talks and political discussions , and it 's important to use them to prioritize this problem . " it 's a problem which he said he believes will only get worse as fast-growing , emerging nations become ever more dependent upon technology . " there are a number of indications to suggest an increase in demand for these raw materials , " he said .
" firstly there is growth in china , then growth in india and brazil and then technical developments such as electromobility , solar panels and energy efficient lamps . " the role of developing countries besides entering into trade talks and exerting political pressure to secure itself a supply of rare earths , the eu is also keen to work in close cooperation with other developing countries known to have reserves of the raw materials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the democratic republic of congo has deposits of coltan the bloc has already begun negotiations with the african union , but is not , cozigou stressed , offering development aid in return for rare earths . " african countries have to realize that the extraction of raw materials at a fair price is advantageous for their own advancement , " he said , adding that it was the only way to attract potential european investors . but bardt said there is a place for development aid if it helps countries with reserves to establish the kind of market systems and institutions which would ultimately be of benefit to europe . time to recycle according to the eu 's observations , beijing secures entry to the coveted raw materials through the aggressive acquisition of foreign mining companies and land and by making donations to the relevant regimes .
experts say it is a problem , not least because there are very few rare earth mining companies left around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old phones should be recycled to recover reusable materials - not binned that being the case , the european union is supporting scientists looking for rare earths and is pushing for more recycling of raw materials from old mobile phones , televisions and cars . " we have our own mines in our cities across europe , " cozigou said , adding that the eu is currently working towards tightening regulations governing the export of electronic scrap and car wrecks .
" the eu wants what has previously been considered electronic garbage to be deemed valuable raw materials . " autor : bernd riegert / tkw editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it closed this year with a tribute to festival innovator christoph schlingensief and a glimpse of changes to come . the 99th richard wagner festival in bayreuth closed sunday with a performance of wagner 's opera " the mastersingers of nuremberg . " the performance was dedicated to the provocative german film and theater director christoph schlingensief , who staged " parsifal " at the 2004 festival .
his production shocked some fans and was credited with bringing a new impulse to bayreuth .
schlingensief died of lung cancer on august 21 . composer richard wagner founded the bayreuth festival 134 years ago .
since then , his works - 10 operas - have been the sole basis for festival performances .
this fact alone makes it clear how important tradition is in bayreuth . tradition and renewal however , some signs point to change following the era of long-time festival director wolfgang wagner , who died early in 2010 .
his daughters and successors , eva wagner-pasquier and katharina wagner , have exhibited both openness and savvy in taking over direction of the festival . in 2010 , the festival continued its media push by offering public viewings and livestreams of selected performances .
on august 21 , 20,000 viewers came to watch " the valkyrie " transmitted live from the festspielhaus to a big screen at a market square in bayreuth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wager-pasquier assured audiences that wagner 's operas will not be upstaged according to a survey , 70 percent of the guests had never attended a wagner opera .
while visitors ate sausage , beer and pretzels , they could follow the performance featuring close-ups and subtitles .
the opera was also streamed live online and broadcast on japanese television .
the concept will continue next year with german broadcasters presenting " lohengrin " live from the festival . " wagner for kids " has also established itself as part of the event in bayreuth .
in the project 's second year , " tannhaeuser " was performed in a 70 minute kid-friendly version , targeted at six-to-12-year-olds .
the children followed the opera with great interest , and the crowd 's favorite was clearly love goddess venus , who sported a punk outfit and a skateboard . the beginning of the 2010 season also brought the announcement that an independent commission will receive complete access to the wagner house archives in order to examine the role of the festival during the third reich .
but at least one element is not up for discussion . " it 's certain that no other composer will be presented here , " said co-director eva wagner-pasquier .
" we will of course uphold the vision of the foundation and wagner house as well as the festival concept itself . " a shock for conservatives those who want to attend the bayreuth festival generally have to prepare for a long wait .
this year brought 408,000 ticket requests from 80 countries for the just 54,000 available seats .
it 's regarded as a privilege to be in bayreuth , even for the employees , who often had to work for low pay in previous years . changing attitudes toward compensation also mark the beginning of a new era for the festival .
following a salary dispute with stage workers last year , ticket prices had to be raised .
stage workers also succeeded in lobbying for mandatory breaks , which led to a new playing schedule this season .
this time , the four operas in the ring cycle - " the rheingold , " " the valkyrie , " " siegfried , " and " twilight of the gods " - were n't played consecutively .
that may not seem like a monumental change , but it would have been nearly unimaginable under wolfgang wagner 's direction and runs counter to the intentions of festival father richard wagner . many conservative wagnerians belong to the society of friends of bayreuth , an organization founded in 1949 by wolfgang wagner that since its inception has contributed more than 55 million euros -lrb- $ 70 million -rrb- to the festival .
following his death , the organization became a festival shareholder with the right to help make decisions related to the event .
disagreements and even public disputes have since erupted between the society and the festival leadership , which has strongly backed a newly-founded fundraising organization called the team of active festival supporters . a year of beautiful voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tenor lance ryan garnered praise this year in his bayreuth debut as siegfried in their second year heading the festival , wagner 's great-granddaughters katharina wagner and eva wagner-pasquier were able to fill the operas ' ranks with better singers than in recent decades .
the much-anticipated debuts included jonas kaufmann as lohengrin , james rutherford as hans sachs , johan botha as siegmund and lance ryan as siegfried .
ryan , a tenor from canada , has been hailed as unsurpassed in the role . 2010 was the last year of the " ring " production with director tankred dorst and conductor christian thielemann .
next year , thielemann will not conduct the orchestra but still be heavily involved with the event .
as musical advisor to the festival , he will have a say in who takes the bayreuth stage as a vocalist or conductor . looking ahead the 100th richard wagner festival next year will feature a new production of " tannhaeuser " directed by sebastian baumgarten and with thomas hengelbrock as conductor .
2013 will also bring a new staging of wagner 's masterpiece , " the ring of the nibelung , " to mark the composer 's 200th birthday .
the stage director for that production has yet to be announced , but kirill petrenko of russia is set to conduct the orchestra .
plans are also underway to debut three of wagner 's early operas in bayreuth -lrb- " the fairies , " " the ban on love " and " rienzi " -rrb- , not in the festival hall but in a tent elsewhere in the town . katharina wagner said her aim is to bring bayreuth " eventually to the absolute cutting edge of wagner productions .

the southern city of thatta has apparently been saved from being inundated , and many citizens who fled earlier are returning there . slowly , the focus is turning to the giant task of rebuilding the devastated areas .
the pakistani ngo akhuwat pakistan has launched an innovative plan to help flood victims in southern punjab stand on their own feet as soon as possible .
under the plan by akhuwat pakistan , flood-affected families are to receive microcredits in order to create employment opportunities for them .
the interest-free loans will come without difficult conditions attached .
the organisation 's executive director amjad saqib explains : " look , whatever is happening right now is relief work .
people need food , shelter , medicine . "
but this relief work will be over in one or two months , he adds . bildunterschrift : a boy receives food at a camp on the outskirt of sukkur in southern pakistan " and then the real challenge will come up - how to rehabilitate all these people !
how can they stand on their own feet again ?
so whereas we from akhuwat have been continuously engaged in relief work in the field , within two months we want to shift our focus on one of the worst-affected areas , rajanpur district .
our preparation , fund raising and resource mobilisation are going well , and god willing we 'll select 10,000 badly affected families and provide them with interest-free loans , thus enabling them to re-start the businesses they 've had to abandon due to this flood . "
rebuilding small businesses the flood victims will get between 10,000 and 30,000 rupees -lrb- between 92 and 276 euros -rrb- per family as an interest-free loan .
no security or documents are required , nor will there be any service charges .
according to izhar hashmi , director of akhuwat pakistan , the recipients will be able to buy seeds or raise goats or cattle with the money .
they might also open a small shop in their village or buy a donkey cart and start a transport business .
with the income generated , they 'll have to repay the loans within 30 months .
the money will then be free to be distributed again to other needy persons .
akhuwat plans to raise 150 million rupees -lrb- almost 1.4 million euros -rrb- in donations from pakistanis for the program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crossing a flooded road in punjab province on monday " we wo n't turn pakistanis into beggars , " says amjad saqib , " but want to harness their potential to work hard for a better future .

the southern city of thatta has apparently been saved from being inundated , and many citizens who fled earlier are returning there . slowly , the focus is turning to the giant task of rebuilding the devastated areas .
the pakistani ngo akhuwat pakistan has launched an innovative plan to help flood victims in southern punjab stand on their own feet as soon as possible .
under the plan by akhuwat pakistan , flood-affected families are to receive microcredits in order to create employment opportunities for them .
the interest-free loans will come without difficult conditions attached .
the organisation 's executive director amjad saqib explains : " look , whatever is happening right now is relief work .
people need food , shelter , medicine . "
but this relief work will be over in one or two months , he adds . bildunterschrift : a boy receives food at a camp on the outskirt of sukkur in southern pakistan " and then the real challenge will come up - how to rehabilitate all these people !
how can they stand on their own feet again ?
so whereas we from akhuwat have been continuously engaged in relief work in the field , within two months we want to shift our focus on one of the worst-affected areas , rajanpur district .
our preparation , fund raising and resource mobilisation are going well , and god willing we 'll select 10,000 badly affected families and provide them with interest-free loans , thus enabling them to re-start the businesses they 've had to abandon due to this flood . "
rebuilding small businesses the flood victims will get between 10,000 and 30,000 rupees -lrb- between 92 and 276 euros -rrb- per family as an interest-free loan .
no security or documents are required , nor will there be any service charges .
according to izhar hashmi , director of akhuwat pakistan , the recipients will be able to buy seeds or raise goats or cattle with the money .
they might also open a small shop in their village or buy a donkey cart and start a transport business .
with the income generated , they 'll have to repay the loans within 30 months .
the money will then be free to be distributed again to other needy persons .
akhuwat plans to raise 150 million rupees -lrb- almost 1.4 million euros -rrb- in donations from pakistanis for the program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crossing a flooded road in punjab province on monday " we wo n't turn pakistanis into beggars , " says amjad saqib , " but want to harness their potential to work hard for a better future .

deutsche welle spoke with coach marco kurz about the embattled club 's change of fortune . when marco kurz took over kaiserslautern in summer 2009 , the red devils ' situation was truly diabolical .
the former league champions had been reduced to battling against relegation from the second division - a consequence of poor investments and financial difficulties in the early years of the millennium . the club was also running through coaches at the rate of one roughly every 12 months . fast forward a little over a year to the second round of the 2010-11 season , and kaiserslautern are not just back in the top flight , but have beaten bayern munich . lautern 's 2-0 win over the reigning champs on friday was more about perspiration than inspiration .
the red devils stymied bayern with tight defending in midfield , and their thrusts forward were incisive enough to exploit lapses in concentration by munich . " we knew that this was a good time to play bayern munich , " kurz told deutsche welle after the victory .
" our opponents had a lot of national team players in their ranks who had n't yet gotten into the rhythm of practices .
we hoped that would give us a physical advantage . " kaiserslautern played physically against the champions , without a doubt .
but there was more to their game than just kicking their opponents ' shins . and while kurz remains modest , a lot of credit for their performance has to go to their coach . stay cool and read the rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mood has n't been this good at lautern since the 1990s in his playing career as a defender , kurz had the opportunity to work with and learn from some excellent coaches .
in 1994-5 , he was part of the borussia dortmund side that won the bundesliga under coach ottmar hitzfeld .
and two years later , he won the uefa cup with schalke under coach huub stevens . both hitzfeld and stevens are coaches who stress tactical discipline , and that quality seems to have rubbed off on kurz . " i had coaches with whom we trained really hard and i noticed , ' wow , physical fitness is definitely the basis for successful football , " ' kurz said .
" we had unbelievable discipline under huub stevens , especially in his treatment of the team .
i learned that footballers need that .
footballers need hard and fast rules . " those rules are not just about behavior , but what players do on the pitch . " the players have clear instructions in matches how they are to play their positions , " kurz said .
" the individual parts of the team - defense , midfield and attack - receive clear instructions , and you hope they work as a collective .
there 's no one on the pitch without instructions and a plan . " but the skill has to be there for players to execute the coach 's plan .
and this kaiserslautern squad features a very particular collection of skills . bildunterschrift : striker srdjan lakic is one of lautern 's new , inexpensive stars the cast-off crew kaiserslautern used to be a breeding ground for german talent - club alumni include andy brehme , miroslav klose and michael ballack .
those days are long gone .
of the current starting 11 , only goalkeeper tobias sippel is a homegrown product . instead , kaiserslautern have built their squad around eastern european players and underrated castoffs from other clubs .
lautern 's offensive duo srdan lakic and ivo ilicevic came for cheap from hertha berlin and bochum respectively . those two clubs now play in division two , while lakic and ilicevic scored five goals between them in the first pair of matches in the top flight . martin amedick and rodnei , the heart of the defense , were also picked up for a song from bigger clubs where they failed to make their mark . " in terms of the makeup of the squad , we chose players who have reason to be hungry , who have to show they 're good enough for division one , " kurz said .

online dictionaries have gained so much popularity over their printed counterparts that the next edition of the oxford english dictionary will probably appear only in electronic form , according to its publisher , the oxford university press .
" the print dictionary market is just disappearing , it is falling away by tens of per cent a year , " nigel portwood , the chief executive of the oxford university press , told uk newspaper the sunday times .
he told the uk newspaper he did not think the third edition would be printed .
the second and most recent oed has existed online for more than a decade , where it receives two million hits a month from subscribers who pay an annual fee of almost 300 euros to access it .
a wider trend towards online simon winchester , author of the meaning of everything : the story of the oxford english dictionary , said the oxford university press 's move away from print editions of the dictionary " reflects an inevitability " and is part of a growing trend of readers moving away from printed books toward digital editions and electronic e-readers like the kindle or the ipad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dictionary-users are increasingly turning to the internet for their answers " i think the electronic book is going to achieve ascendancy over the printed book , and i think that the printed book is just starting now to vanish , " winchester said .
though he owns three sets of the printed version of the oxford english dictionary , he said he relies on the digital version .
" on my ipad , i 've used the oed twice if not three times today .
but i never ever go to the hardback version .
it sits there on the shelf gathering dust , looking beautiful , but i never use it . "
online dictionary keeps better pace the move away from printed dictionaries could also be helping to create a more accessible oed , and one that evolves better alongside the language that it documents , said charlotte brewer , professor of english language and literature at oxford university and author of treasure-house of the language : the living oed .
" when the first dictionaries were produced in the victorian period , the edwardian period in the uk , there were all sorts of assumptions about what was proper to go into a dictionary – so words to do with sex , and the body , sometimes did n't get in or sometimes were defined in a way that we would regard as inadequate , " she said .
many of the quotations used in older editions of the oed were drawn from historical and literary sources .
now , brewer said , " the lexicographers can use the web , they can use google , they have access to an enormous variety of language online , they can instantly access a far broader range of sources .
in this way … it 's likely to become more democratic . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet offers lexicographers a broader range of sources to draw upon an ' absolutely enormous ' undertaking almost one third of a million entries were contained in the second version of the oed , published in hard copy in 1989 .
since then , a team of 80 lexicographers have been working on the third edition , though they have completed only 28 percent of the dictionary .
" we 're talking about an absolutely enormous amount of data , which in its last printed form occupied 20 volumes , " brewer said .
she said the third edition of the dictionary would likely be even larger .
" i think the point is that the cost of this work would be unbelievable - you know , you have to wonder who could possibly afford to buy it , " brewer said .
with the most recent edition weighing in at a hefty 62.9 kilos , an electronic version of edition three would not only be lighter on the hip pocket – it would also be easier on the back .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de publishing -pipe- 30.08.2010 internet killed the dictionary star großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the market for traditional dictionaries is disappearing , says the oed publisher falling sales and the growing popularity of online dictionaries mean the oxford english dictionary may never be printed again , its publisher says . for over two decades , dozens of writers have been working on a book that will probably never grace a bookshelf .
online dictionaries have gained so much popularity over their printed counterparts that the next edition of the oxford english dictionary will probably appear only in electronic form , according to its publisher , the oxford university press .
" the print dictionary market is just disappearing , it is falling away by tens of per cent a year , " nigel portwood , the chief executive of the oxford university press , told uk newspaper the sunday times .
he told the uk newspaper he did not think the third edition would be printed .
the second and most recent oed has existed online for more than a decade , where it receives two million hits a month from subscribers who pay an annual fee of almost 300 euros to access it .
a wider trend towards online simon winchester , author of the meaning of everything : the story of the oxford english dictionary , said the oxford university press 's move away from print editions of the dictionary " reflects an inevitability " and is part of a growing trend of readers moving away from printed books toward digital editions and electronic e-readers like the kindle or the ipad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dictionary-users are increasingly turning to the internet for their answers " i think the electronic book is going to achieve ascendancy over the printed book , and i think that the printed book is just starting now to vanish , " winchester said .
though he owns three sets of the printed version of the oxford english dictionary , he said he relies on the digital version .
" on my ipad , i 've used the oed twice if not three times today .
but i never ever go to the hardback version .
it sits there on the shelf gathering dust , looking beautiful , but i never use it . "
online dictionary keeps better pace the move away from printed dictionaries could also be helping to create a more accessible oed , and one that evolves better alongside the language that it documents , said charlotte brewer , professor of english language and literature at oxford university and author of treasure-house of the language : the living oed .
" when the first dictionaries were produced in the victorian period , the edwardian period in the uk , there were all sorts of assumptions about what was proper to go into a dictionary – so words to do with sex , and the body , sometimes did n't get in or sometimes were defined in a way that we would regard as inadequate , " she said .
many of the quotations used in older editions of the oed were drawn from historical and literary sources .
now , brewer said , " the lexicographers can use the web , they can use google , they have access to an enormous variety of language online , they can instantly access a far broader range of sources .
in this way … it 's likely to become more democratic . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet offers lexicographers a broader range of sources to draw upon an ' absolutely enormous ' undertaking almost one third of a million entries were contained in the second version of the oed , published in hard copy in 1989 .
since then , a team of 80 lexicographers have been working on the third edition , though they have completed only 28 percent of the dictionary .
" we 're talking about an absolutely enormous amount of data , which in its last printed form occupied 20 volumes , " brewer said .
she said the third edition of the dictionary would likely be even larger .
" i think the point is that the cost of this work would be unbelievable - you know , you have to wonder who could possibly afford to buy it , " brewer said .
with the most recent edition weighing in at a hefty 62.9 kilos , an electronic version of edition three would not only be lighter on the hip pocket – it would also be easier on the back .

the southern city of thatta has apparently been saved from being inundated , and many citizens who fled earlier are returning there . slowly , the focus is turning to the giant task of rebuilding the devastated areas .
the pakistani ngo akhuwat pakistan has launched an innovative plan to help flood victims in southern punjab stand on their own feet as soon as possible .
under the plan by akhuwat pakistan , flood-affected families are to receive microcredits in order to create employment opportunities for them .
the interest-free loans will come without difficult conditions attached .
the organisation 's executive director amjad saqib explains : " look , whatever is happening right now is relief work .
people need food , shelter , medicine . "
but this relief work will be over in one or two months , he adds . bildunterschrift : a boy receives food at a camp on the outskirt of sukkur in southern pakistan " and then the real challenge will come up - how to rehabilitate all these people !
how can they stand on their own feet again ?
so whereas we from akhuwat have been continuously engaged in relief work in the field , within two months we want to shift our focus on one of the worst-affected areas , rajanpur district .
our preparation , fund raising and resource mobilisation are going well , and god willing we 'll select 10,000 badly affected families and provide them with interest-free loans , thus enabling them to re-start the businesses they 've had to abandon due to this flood . "
rebuilding small businesses the flood victims will get between 10,000 and 30,000 rupees -lrb- between 92 and 276 euros -rrb- per family as an interest-free loan .
no security or documents are required , nor will there be any service charges .
according to izhar hashmi , director of akhuwat pakistan , the recipients will be able to buy seeds or raise goats or cattle with the money .
they might also open a small shop in their village or buy a donkey cart and start a transport business .
with the income generated , they 'll have to repay the loans within 30 months .
the money will then be free to be distributed again to other needy persons .

the organisation 's philosophy of providing loan-free microcredit is inspired by islamic teaching which prohibits the charging of interest , but it equally provides loans to non-muslims , such as members of the christian minority , relying on the local mosque and church infrastructure . akhuwat , which has been working in pakistan for more than nine years and claims a recovery rate for its loans of almost 100 per cent , is an interesting exception among the growing number of micro-finance institutions worldwide .
recently , criticism has grown of these microcredit groups , as many have been demanding high interest rates , which can become a problem for those who accept their loans .
some development experts have pointed to the akhuwat model , funded by charitable donations and charging no interest at all , as an alternative way .
for pakistani flood victims , it definitely comes as a welcome support in this time of crisis .

the eu is preparing a strategy paper to secure a long-term supply of the increasingly necessary materials . it 's a little known fact that in order to stay in the technology manufacturing game , europe has to import some 40 rare metals and minerals .
it 's also a worrying fact because many of the materials used in the production of objects like cell phones and energy efficient lamps are either in limited supply or kept at artificially low levels by china . according to the eu commission , 14 of these rare earths , as they are called , are particularly scarce and are either only available in china or are mined for unrealistic prices elsewhere . while china is key to these materials finding their way to the world market , gwenole cozigou , the commission 's director for chemical , metals , forest-based and textile industries , is worried about the length of beijing 's arm . he said although negotiations with the chinese government over commodity trade are ongoing , foreign buyers are being forced to process rare earths into half-finished products on chinese soil . " china wants to build an industry and that is a perfectly acceptable goal , but if it violates trade regulations we will take action , " cozigou said .
in this case , that means teaming up with the united states and mexico to contact a world trade organization arbitration tribunal . taking on china hubertus bardt , raw materials expert from the institute for economic research in cologne , told deutsche welle it 's up to the eu to make sure china does not exploit its monopoly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tantal is used in micro-processors " one could threaten to impose import restrictions on chinese products , but nobody wants that and ultimately it would harm us , too , " he said .
" but there are always new trade talks and political discussions , and it 's important to use them to prioritize this problem . " it 's a problem which he said he believes will only get worse as fast-growing , emerging nations become ever more dependent upon technology . " there are a number of indications to suggest an increase in demand for these raw materials , " he said .
" firstly there is growth in china , then growth in india and brazil and then technical developments such as electromobility , solar panels and energy efficient lamps . " the role of developing countries besides entering into trade talks and exerting political pressure to secure itself a supply of rare earths , the eu is also keen to work in close cooperation with other developing countries known to have reserves of the raw materials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the democratic republic of congo has deposits of coltan the bloc has already begun negotiations with the african union , but is not , cozigou stressed , offering development aid in return for rare earths . " african countries have to realize that the extraction of raw materials at a fair price is advantageous for their own advancement , " he said , adding that it was the only way to attract potential european investors . but bardt said there is a place for development aid if it helps countries with reserves to establish the kind of market systems and institutions which would ultimately be of benefit to europe . time to recycle according to the eu 's observations , beijing secures entry to the coveted raw materials through the aggressive acquisition of foreign mining companies and land and by making donations to the relevant regimes .
experts say it is a problem , not least because there are very few rare earth mining companies left around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old phones should be recycled to recover reusable materials - not binned that being the case , the european union is supporting scientists looking for rare earths and is pushing for more recycling of raw materials from old mobile phones , televisions and cars . " we have our own mines in our cities across europe , " cozigou said , adding that the eu is currently working towards tightening regulations governing the export of electronic scrap and car wrecks .
" the eu wants what has previously been considered electronic garbage to be deemed valuable raw materials . " autor : bernd riegert / tkw editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the southern city of thatta has apparently been saved from being inundated , and many citizens who fled earlier are returning there . slowly , the focus is turning to the giant task of rebuilding the devastated areas .
the pakistani ngo akhuwat pakistan has launched an innovative plan to help flood victims in southern punjab stand on their own feet as soon as possible .
under the plan by akhuwat pakistan , flood-affected families are to receive microcredits in order to create employment opportunities for them .
the interest-free loans will come without difficult conditions attached .
the organisation 's executive director amjad saqib explains : " look , whatever is happening right now is relief work .
people need food , shelter , medicine . "
but this relief work will be over in one or two months , he adds . bildunterschrift : a boy receives food at a camp on the outskirt of sukkur in southern pakistan " and then the real challenge will come up - how to rehabilitate all these people !
how can they stand on their own feet again ?
so whereas we from akhuwat have been continuously engaged in relief work in the field , within two months we want to shift our focus on one of the worst-affected areas , rajanpur district .
our preparation , fund raising and resource mobilisation are going well , and god willing we 'll select 10,000 badly affected families and provide them with interest-free loans , thus enabling them to re-start the businesses they 've had to abandon due to this flood . "
rebuilding small businesses the flood victims will get between 10,000 and 30,000 rupees -lrb- between 92 and 276 euros -rrb- per family as an interest-free loan .
no security or documents are required , nor will there be any service charges .
according to izhar hashmi , director of akhuwat pakistan , the recipients will be able to buy seeds or raise goats or cattle with the money .
they might also open a small shop in their village or buy a donkey cart and start a transport business .
with the income generated , they 'll have to repay the loans within 30 months .
the money will then be free to be distributed again to other needy persons .
akhuwat plans to raise 150 million rupees -lrb- almost 1.4 million euros -rrb- in donations from pakistanis for the program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crossing a flooded road in punjab province on monday " we wo n't turn pakistanis into beggars , " says amjad saqib , " but want to harness their potential to work hard for a better future .
they 'll rise up on their own and stand on their own feet again . "
an alternative approach to microcredit akhuwat means " brotherhood " in arabic .
the organisation 's philosophy of providing loan-free microcredit is inspired by islamic teaching which prohibits the charging of interest , but it equally provides loans to non-muslims , such as members of the christian minority , relying on the local mosque and church infrastructure . akhuwat , which has been working in pakistan for more than nine years and claims a recovery rate for its loans of almost 100 per cent , is an interesting exception among the growing number of micro-finance institutions worldwide .
recently , criticism has grown of these microcredit groups , as many have been demanding high interest rates , which can become a problem for those who accept their loans .
some development experts have pointed to the akhuwat model , funded by charitable donations and charging no interest at all , as an alternative way .
for pakistani flood victims , it definitely comes as a welcome support in this time of crisis .

he decided to remain in the job , saying that leaving amounted to ' deserting . '
" i asked myself whether i should resign , kouchner said .
" but what would have that changed ?
no , i was not happy about this policy .
i 've been involved with the roma for 25 years .
and i do n't like making a political issue out of them . "
on friday , in an address to french ambassadors , kouchner still openly supported sarkozy 's policy on the roma deportations .
kouchner is the founder of the renowned medical charity doctors without borders and is a highly respected human rights activist .
observers have generally believed that the former socialist politician would have trouble accommodating himself in sarkozy 's conservative government whose views he does not always share .
in another sign that not everyone is in agreement with sarkozy 's tough anti-crime and immigration policy , france 's defense minister hervé morin of the center-right new center party also broke ranks , criticizing the tough crusade of president sarkozy and the interior minister brice hortefeux .

jean-marie le pen , the veteran leader of the extreme-right national front , however , agrees with the deportations .
he added that sarkozy was powerless to do anything fundamental about what he described as " a problem caused by the european union opening the borders between european countries . " roma can legally travel to eu countries , but they must show that they have found a job if they want to stay legally in france for more than three months .

he decided to remain in the job , saying that leaving amounted to ' deserting . '
" i asked myself whether i should resign , kouchner said .
" but what would have that changed ?
no , i was not happy about this policy .
i 've been involved with the roma for 25 years .
and i do n't like making a political issue out of them . "
on friday , in an address to french ambassadors , kouchner still openly supported sarkozy 's policy on the roma deportations .
kouchner is the founder of the renowned medical charity doctors without borders and is a highly respected human rights activist .
observers have generally believed that the former socialist politician would have trouble accommodating himself in sarkozy 's conservative government whose views he does not always share .
in another sign that not everyone is in agreement with sarkozy 's tough anti-crime and immigration policy , france 's defense minister hervé morin of the center-right new center party also broke ranks , criticizing the tough crusade of president sarkozy and the interior minister brice hortefeux .

jean-marie le pen , the veteran leader of the extreme-right national front , however , agrees with the deportations .
he added that sarkozy was powerless to do anything fundamental about what he described as " a problem caused by the european union opening the borders between european countries . " roma can legally travel to eu countries , but they must show that they have found a job if they want to stay legally in france for more than three months .
the french government has sent more than 8,000 roma back to bulgaria and romania since the start of the year .
around 1,000 were sent back in the past four weeks .
on tuesday , french officials are due to meet with representatives of the european commission , which is also critical of paris 's crackdown on roma gypsies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 30.08.2010 german hip-hop at the shanghai expo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hip-hoppers at the german pavilion in shanghai at the german expo pavilion in shanghai , one could easily see how hip-hop is transcending borders .
the pavilion called the " balancity " featured hip-hop during a month long program with graffiti , break-dance and music . hip-hop beats echoing around the area in front of the german pavilion have been attracting scores of young chinese people .
they are excited and sing along loudly with the artists .
" it is different here in comparison to berlin , " says rafael schall from berlin , who is blown away by the response .
" here you can really get the people high on music , dance with them on the stage and really go ballistic .
people really go crazy here . "
schall is one of 50 german hip-hop artists who have come to shangai to perform at the german pavilion .
together with 50 chinese hip-hop artists they have turned it into a laboratory of urban youth culture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanghai singer cha-cha says the project is " quite a cool thing " giving space to young people marion conrady , spokesperson of the german pavilion explains why germany has chosen to present itself at this world fair in this way .
" hip-hop is a youth culture , which can also be seen in cities represented in words through graffiti but also in the form of various performances .
with the help of our ' balancity ' pavilion at the shanghai expo , we are trying to show the versatility of a city .
and in a city , giving space to young people is as important as it is to provide space for high or elite culture . "
graffiti is important for hip-hoppers all over the world .
and one can also see this at the german pavilion .
at the graffiti corner there are not only huge pictures , but also graffiti t-shirts , umbrellas and bags for the visitors .
but in shanghai one hardly gets to see any graffiti .
stan wu works with the " invasion " magazine in hong kong .
he explains why so few walls are painted in shanghai .
" we first had the olympics and now we have the shanghai expo .
so the government and the city are trying to wipe out the whole country .
zero tolerance of ' dirty ' surface , you know .
so there is no chance that you will see a lot of graffiti in the city . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mc wesley from beijing in the ' balancity ' power of graffiti asia 's largest graffiti competition " wall lords finals 2010 " , which was held on sunday at the shanghai expo was also a part of the german hip-hop project .
it was initiated by akim walta from berlin , who has been active in the hip-hop scene there for almost 30 years .
walta talks about a graffiti project by german artists in shanghai .
" our boys also painted something for the residents here .
what was interesting was that they tried to come into contact with the locals .
and suddenly the sad grey street became colorful , with some connection to the locals .
and in the course of time there was some problem and we were asked to remove the graffiti .
but then , little children and families stood up for us and said that we had come from a far away land and the graffiti was a gift for them .
they said it was their picture and they did not want it to be removed . "
walta has been to china many times and has been involved in various graffiti projects .
he hopes that the hip-hop project at the shanghai expo is not the last one .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de publishing -pipe- 30.08.2010 internet killed the dictionary star großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the market for traditional dictionaries is disappearing , says the oed publisher falling sales and the growing popularity of online dictionaries mean the oxford english dictionary may never be printed again , its publisher says . for over two decades , dozens of writers have been working on a book that will probably never grace a bookshelf .
online dictionaries have gained so much popularity over their printed counterparts that the next edition of the oxford english dictionary will probably appear only in electronic form , according to its publisher , the oxford university press .
" the print dictionary market is just disappearing , it is falling away by tens of per cent a year , " nigel portwood , the chief executive of the oxford university press , told uk newspaper the sunday times .
he told the uk newspaper he did not think the third edition would be printed .
the second and most recent oed has existed online for more than a decade , where it receives two million hits a month from subscribers who pay an annual fee of almost 300 euros to access it .
a wider trend towards online simon winchester , author of the meaning of everything : the story of the oxford english dictionary , said the oxford university press 's move away from print editions of the dictionary " reflects an inevitability " and is part of a growing trend of readers moving away from printed books toward digital editions and electronic e-readers like the kindle or the ipad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dictionary-users are increasingly turning to the internet for their answers " i think the electronic book is going to achieve ascendancy over the printed book , and i think that the printed book is just starting now to vanish , " winchester said .
though he owns three sets of the printed version of the oxford english dictionary , he said he relies on the digital version .
" on my ipad , i 've used the oed twice if not three times today .
but i never ever go to the hardback version .
it sits there on the shelf gathering dust , looking beautiful , but i never use it . "
online dictionary keeps better pace the move away from printed dictionaries could also be helping to create a more accessible oed , and one that evolves better alongside the language that it documents , said charlotte brewer , professor of english language and literature at oxford university and author of treasure-house of the language : the living oed .
" when the first dictionaries were produced in the victorian period , the edwardian period in the uk , there were all sorts of assumptions about what was proper to go into a dictionary – so words to do with sex , and the body , sometimes did n't get in or sometimes were defined in a way that we would regard as inadequate , " she said .
many of the quotations used in older editions of the oed were drawn from historical and literary sources .
now , brewer said , " the lexicographers can use the web , they can use google , they have access to an enormous variety of language online , they can instantly access a far broader range of sources .
in this way … it 's likely to become more democratic . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet offers lexicographers a broader range of sources to draw upon an ' absolutely enormous ' undertaking almost one third of a million entries were contained in the second version of the oed , published in hard copy in 1989 .
since then , a team of 80 lexicographers have been working on the third edition , though they have completed only 28 percent of the dictionary .
" we 're talking about an absolutely enormous amount of data , which in its last printed form occupied 20 volumes , " brewer said .
she said the third edition of the dictionary would likely be even larger .
" i think the point is that the cost of this work would be unbelievable - you know , you have to wonder who could possibly afford to buy it , " brewer said .
with the most recent edition weighing in at a hefty 62.9 kilos , an electronic version of edition three would not only be lighter on the hip pocket – it would also be easier on the back .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de festivals -pipe- 30.08.2010 bayreuth festival closes with tribute to director schlingensief großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the curtain has been drawn on the green hill until next summer the bayreuth festival is bound with tradition and founder richard wagner 's vision for the event .
but it closed this year with a tribute to festival innovator christoph schlingensief and a glimpse of changes to come . the 99th richard wagner festival in bayreuth closed sunday with a performance of wagner 's opera " the mastersingers of nuremberg . " the performance was dedicated to the provocative german film and theater director christoph schlingensief , who staged " parsifal " at the 2004 festival .
his production shocked some fans and was credited with bringing a new impulse to bayreuth .
schlingensief died of lung cancer on august 21 . composer richard wagner founded the bayreuth festival 134 years ago .
since then , his works - 10 operas - have been the sole basis for festival performances .
this fact alone makes it clear how important tradition is in bayreuth . tradition and renewal however , some signs point to change following the era of long-time festival director wolfgang wagner , who died early in 2010 .
his daughters and successors , eva wagner-pasquier and katharina wagner , have exhibited both openness and savvy in taking over direction of the festival . in 2010 , the festival continued its media push by offering public viewings and livestreams of selected performances .
on august 21 , 20,000 viewers came to watch " the valkyrie " transmitted live from the festspielhaus to a big screen at a market square in bayreuth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wager-pasquier assured audiences that wagner 's operas will not be upstaged according to a survey , 70 percent of the guests had never attended a wagner opera .
while visitors ate sausage , beer and pretzels , they could follow the performance featuring close-ups and subtitles .
the opera was also streamed live online and broadcast on japanese television .
the concept will continue next year with german broadcasters presenting " lohengrin " live from the festival . " wagner for kids " has also established itself as part of the event in bayreuth .
in the project 's second year , " tannhaeuser " was performed in a 70 minute kid-friendly version , targeted at six-to-12-year-olds .
the children followed the opera with great interest , and the crowd 's favorite was clearly love goddess venus , who sported a punk outfit and a skateboard . the beginning of the 2010 season also brought the announcement that an independent commission will receive complete access to the wagner house archives in order to examine the role of the festival during the third reich .
but at least one element is not up for discussion . " it 's certain that no other composer will be presented here , " said co-director eva wagner-pasquier .
" we will of course uphold the vision of the foundation and wagner house as well as the festival concept itself . " a shock for conservatives those who want to attend the bayreuth festival generally have to prepare for a long wait .
this year brought 408,000 ticket requests from 80 countries for the just 54,000 available seats .
it 's regarded as a privilege to be in bayreuth , even for the employees , who often had to work for low pay in previous years . changing attitudes toward compensation also mark the beginning of a new era for the festival .
following a salary dispute with stage workers last year , ticket prices had to be raised .
stage workers also succeeded in lobbying for mandatory breaks , which led to a new playing schedule this season .
this time , the four operas in the ring cycle - " the rheingold , " " the valkyrie , " " siegfried , " and " twilight of the gods " - were n't played consecutively .
that may not seem like a monumental change , but it would have been nearly unimaginable under wolfgang wagner 's direction and runs counter to the intentions of festival father richard wagner . many conservative wagnerians belong to the society of friends of bayreuth , an organization founded in 1949 by wolfgang wagner that since its inception has contributed more than 55 million euros -lrb- $ 70 million -rrb- to the festival .
following his death , the organization became a festival shareholder with the right to help make decisions related to the event .
disagreements and even public disputes have since erupted between the society and the festival leadership , which has strongly backed a newly-founded fundraising organization called the team of active festival supporters . a year of beautiful voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tenor lance ryan garnered praise this year in his bayreuth debut as siegfried in their second year heading the festival , wagner 's great-granddaughters katharina wagner and eva wagner-pasquier were able to fill the operas ' ranks with better singers than in recent decades .
the much-anticipated debuts included jonas kaufmann as lohengrin , james rutherford as hans sachs , johan botha as siegmund and lance ryan as siegfried .

but it closed this year with a tribute to festival innovator christoph schlingensief and a glimpse of changes to come . the 99th richard wagner festival in bayreuth closed sunday with a performance of wagner 's opera " the mastersingers of nuremberg . " the performance was dedicated to the provocative german film and theater director christoph schlingensief , who staged " parsifal " at the 2004 festival .
his production shocked some fans and was credited with bringing a new impulse to bayreuth .
schlingensief died of lung cancer on august 21 . composer richard wagner founded the bayreuth festival 134 years ago .
since then , his works - 10 operas - have been the sole basis for festival performances .
this fact alone makes it clear how important tradition is in bayreuth . tradition and renewal however , some signs point to change following the era of long-time festival director wolfgang wagner , who died early in 2010 .
his daughters and successors , eva wagner-pasquier and katharina wagner , have exhibited both openness and savvy in taking over direction of the festival . in 2010 , the festival continued its media push by offering public viewings and livestreams of selected performances .
on august 21 , 20,000 viewers came to watch " the valkyrie " transmitted live from the festspielhaus to a big screen at a market square in bayreuth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wager-pasquier assured audiences that wagner 's operas will not be upstaged according to a survey , 70 percent of the guests had never attended a wagner opera .
while visitors ate sausage , beer and pretzels , they could follow the performance featuring close-ups and subtitles .
the opera was also streamed live online and broadcast on japanese television .
the concept will continue next year with german broadcasters presenting " lohengrin " live from the festival . " wagner for kids " has also established itself as part of the event in bayreuth .
in the project 's second year , " tannhaeuser " was performed in a 70 minute kid-friendly version , targeted at six-to-12-year-olds .
the children followed the opera with great interest , and the crowd 's favorite was clearly love goddess venus , who sported a punk outfit and a skateboard . the beginning of the 2010 season also brought the announcement that an independent commission will receive complete access to the wagner house archives in order to examine the role of the festival during the third reich .
but at least one element is not up for discussion . " it 's certain that no other composer will be presented here , " said co-director eva wagner-pasquier .
" we will of course uphold the vision of the foundation and wagner house as well as the festival concept itself . " a shock for conservatives those who want to attend the bayreuth festival generally have to prepare for a long wait .
this year brought 408,000 ticket requests from 80 countries for the just 54,000 available seats .
it 's regarded as a privilege to be in bayreuth , even for the employees , who often had to work for low pay in previous years . changing attitudes toward compensation also mark the beginning of a new era for the festival .
following a salary dispute with stage workers last year , ticket prices had to be raised .
stage workers also succeeded in lobbying for mandatory breaks , which led to a new playing schedule this season .
this time , the four operas in the ring cycle - " the rheingold , " " the valkyrie , " " siegfried , " and " twilight of the gods " - were n't played consecutively .
that may not seem like a monumental change , but it would have been nearly unimaginable under wolfgang wagner 's direction and runs counter to the intentions of festival father richard wagner . many conservative wagnerians belong to the society of friends of bayreuth , an organization founded in 1949 by wolfgang wagner that since its inception has contributed more than 55 million euros -lrb- $ 70 million -rrb- to the festival .
following his death , the organization became a festival shareholder with the right to help make decisions related to the event .
disagreements and even public disputes have since erupted between the society and the festival leadership , which has strongly backed a newly-founded fundraising organization called the team of active festival supporters . a year of beautiful voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tenor lance ryan garnered praise this year in his bayreuth debut as siegfried in their second year heading the festival , wagner 's great-granddaughters katharina wagner and eva wagner-pasquier were able to fill the operas ' ranks with better singers than in recent decades .
the much-anticipated debuts included jonas kaufmann as lohengrin , james rutherford as hans sachs , johan botha as siegmund and lance ryan as siegfried .

but it closed this year with a tribute to festival innovator christoph schlingensief and a glimpse of changes to come . the 99th richard wagner festival in bayreuth closed sunday with a performance of wagner 's opera " the mastersingers of nuremberg . " the performance was dedicated to the provocative german film and theater director christoph schlingensief , who staged " parsifal " at the 2004 festival .
his production shocked some fans and was credited with bringing a new impulse to bayreuth .
schlingensief died of lung cancer on august 21 . composer richard wagner founded the bayreuth festival 134 years ago .
since then , his works - 10 operas - have been the sole basis for festival performances .
this fact alone makes it clear how important tradition is in bayreuth . tradition and renewal however , some signs point to change following the era of long-time festival director wolfgang wagner , who died early in 2010 .
his daughters and successors , eva wagner-pasquier and katharina wagner , have exhibited both openness and savvy in taking over direction of the festival . in 2010 , the festival continued its media push by offering public viewings and livestreams of selected performances .
on august 21 , 20,000 viewers came to watch " the valkyrie " transmitted live from the festspielhaus to a big screen at a market square in bayreuth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wager-pasquier assured audiences that wagner 's operas will not be upstaged according to a survey , 70 percent of the guests had never attended a wagner opera .

he decided to remain in the job , saying that leaving amounted to ' deserting . '
" i asked myself whether i should resign , kouchner said .
" but what would have that changed ?
no , i was not happy about this policy .
i 've been involved with the roma for 25 years .
and i do n't like making a political issue out of them . "
on friday , in an address to french ambassadors , kouchner still openly supported sarkozy 's policy on the roma deportations .
kouchner is the founder of the renowned medical charity doctors without borders and is a highly respected human rights activist .
observers have generally believed that the former socialist politician would have trouble accommodating himself in sarkozy 's conservative government whose views he does not always share .
in another sign that not everyone is in agreement with sarkozy 's tough anti-crime and immigration policy , france 's defense minister hervé morin of the center-right new center party also broke ranks , criticizing the tough crusade of president sarkozy and the interior minister brice hortefeux .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on average , 1,000 roma gypsies are expelled each month 8,000 roma sent back this year already critics say the recent campaigns are a calculated move to boost sarkozy 's flagging popularity before elections in 2012 and distract attention from unpopular plans to cut public spending and raise the retirement age .
jean-marie le pen , the veteran leader of the extreme-right national front , however , agrees with the deportations .
he added that sarkozy was powerless to do anything fundamental about what he described as " a problem caused by the european union opening the borders between european countries . " roma can legally travel to eu countries , but they must show that they have found a job if they want to stay legally in france for more than three months .
the french government has sent more than 8,000 roma back to bulgaria and romania since the start of the year .
around 1,000 were sent back in the past four weeks .
on tuesday , french officials are due to meet with representatives of the european commission , which is also critical of paris 's crackdown on roma gypsies .
the united nations and the vatican have also condemned the expulsions .

online dictionaries have gained so much popularity over their printed counterparts that the next edition of the oxford english dictionary will probably appear only in electronic form , according to its publisher , the oxford university press .

the president had hoped to focus on economic issues . in an interview with deutsche welle and other german media ahead of his visit to berlin on monday , ukrainian president viktor yanukovych said he hopes to focus on economic issues when he meets german chancellor angela merkel .
however , it appears that concerns about freedom of the press threaten to overshadow the visit .
the role of valeriy khoroshkovskyi , who is both the head of ukraine 's security intelligence service and a media entrepreneur , also came under focus .
what expectation do you have of this trip to germany ?
what do you hope for from this visit ?
viktor yanukovych : i hope this visit will open up a new chapter in relations between ukraine and germany .
the main aim of our foreign policy is that we fulfill our obligations .
we are involved in pursuing these commitments .
an important issue that we are paying special attention to is making the economy more important in our foreign policy .
in practice , that means the reform plan that i announced recently should serve to create new possibilities for foreign investors .
we are trying to overcome a lot of bureaucratic hurdles that stand in the way of investors .
the system of permits and licenses in place until now has placed a considerable burden on the economy .
we have already halved the number of licenses and different permits .
this system will conform to european standards .
for that reason , i expect only positive outcomes from this visit to germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's questions may extend to the case of nico lang it is expected that the german chancellor will address the case of nico lang .
the ukrainan director of the konrad-adenauer political foundation was denied entry to ukraine and detained at kiev airport -lsb- the matter was settled after intervention from the german embassy -rsb- .
initially it was said that there had been a misunderstanding .
then there was talk of interference in internal affairs .
what was that about ?
every security service has its job to do .
information gets shared .
conflicts that arise are resolved through negotiations between both sides .
i gave my personal instructions to the chief of staff of the security service and also to the foreign minister .
we were able to resolve this very quickly with germany and therefore the case for us is settled .
we hear that you lightly admonished intelligence chief valeriy khoroshkovskyi after this incident , to put it mildly .
is that true ?
when conflicts arise , one must be careful .
there is no doubt , a warning had to be given .
and that 's what i did .
one subject that is also closely watched in germany is the issue of press freedom .
journalists report growing political pressure and in some cases , abuse .
in court , there is a case being contested about whether two tv stations should be allowed to keep their licenses .
several days ago , a journalist in the east of the country disappeared .
how do you assess these developments ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : press freedom is an issue of growing concern in ukraine i am of the view that all conflicts must be solved through the courts .
i can not imagine that in these cases pressure would be put on the court and that courts would make biased decisions .
every court decision is binding for the executive and also must be observed by the mass media . ´ i have had many meetings and encounters concerning freedom of expression and i sometimes ask journalists to tell me or give me proper examples where there is obstruction of freedom of expression .
for me it is important to have concrete , named cases and until i have them , it would not be right to pass judgment .
i have two cases .
first , the director of the television channel tvi claims he was shadowed by people from the secret service .
secondly , i heard from my own contact here in the ukraine that she was summoned to have conversations with people from the intelligence service and asked about my work .
i consider that to be an attempt to intimidate my contact .
are these cases known to you , and how would you categorize them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : questions were raised about intelligence boss valeriy khoroshkovskyi well , this is the first time i have heard that there are such cases .
when there really are such cases then you need to report them officially .
where the first issue is concerned , it hardly seems realistic to me that journalists would be monitored in this way .
i do n't believe that .
anyway , there has been no case that i have been informed about .
as far as journalists being summoned to have conversations with the intelligence service is concerned , i am also hearing that for the first time .
i really would ask you to tell me specifically which journalist was summoned , when , and where to .
i have already submitted these cases officially to the intelligence service a couple of weeks ago .
apparently it has not been forwarded .
so , i would pose the question : do you believe , after so many incidents , that your secret services chief is still the right man to be in this position ?
i ask this in consideration of his connected interests as intelligence chief , media entrepreneur and member of the highest council of justice .
i would say the security chief performs his job in a quite normal manner .
this work has no connection at all with the activities of the mass media .
regarding his assets , he has handed over their administration of his assets to relatives .
we have many officials who also have had assets and , according to the law , the management of these assets have been handed over to trustees .
as far as i know , that happens not only in the ukraine , but also all over the world .

i have two cases .
first , the director of the television channel tvi claims he was shadowed by people from the secret service .

the president had hoped to focus on economic issues . in an interview with deutsche welle and other german media ahead of his visit to berlin on monday , ukrainian president viktor yanukovych said he hopes to focus on economic issues when he meets german chancellor angela merkel .
however , it appears that concerns about freedom of the press threaten to overshadow the visit .
the role of valeriy khoroshkovskyi , who is both the head of ukraine 's security intelligence service and a media entrepreneur , also came under focus .
what expectation do you have of this trip to germany ?
what do you hope for from this visit ?
viktor yanukovych : i hope this visit will open up a new chapter in relations between ukraine and germany .
the main aim of our foreign policy is that we fulfill our obligations .
we are involved in pursuing these commitments .
an important issue that we are paying special attention to is making the economy more important in our foreign policy .
in practice , that means the reform plan that i announced recently should serve to create new possibilities for foreign investors .
we are trying to overcome a lot of bureaucratic hurdles that stand in the way of investors .
the system of permits and licenses in place until now has placed a considerable burden on the economy .
we have already halved the number of licenses and different permits .
this system will conform to european standards .
for that reason , i expect only positive outcomes from this visit to germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's questions may extend to the case of nico lang it is expected that the german chancellor will address the case of nico lang .
the ukrainan director of the konrad-adenauer political foundation was denied entry to ukraine and detained at kiev airport -lsb- the matter was settled after intervention from the german embassy -rsb- .
initially it was said that there had been a misunderstanding .
then there was talk of interference in internal affairs .
what was that about ?
every security service has its job to do .
information gets shared .
conflicts that arise are resolved through negotiations between both sides .
i gave my personal instructions to the chief of staff of the security service and also to the foreign minister .
we were able to resolve this very quickly with germany and therefore the case for us is settled .
we hear that you lightly admonished intelligence chief valeriy khoroshkovskyi after this incident , to put it mildly .
is that true ?
when conflicts arise , one must be careful .
there is no doubt , a warning had to be given .
and that 's what i did .
one subject that is also closely watched in germany is the issue of press freedom .
journalists report growing political pressure and in some cases , abuse .
in court , there is a case being contested about whether two tv stations should be allowed to keep their licenses .
several days ago , a journalist in the east of the country disappeared .
how do you assess these developments ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : press freedom is an issue of growing concern in ukraine i am of the view that all conflicts must be solved through the courts .
i can not imagine that in these cases pressure would be put on the court and that courts would make biased decisions .

the pavilion called the " balancity " featured hip-hop during a month long program with graffiti , break-dance and music . hip-hop beats echoing around the area in front of the german pavilion have been attracting scores of young chinese people .
they are excited and sing along loudly with the artists .
" it is different here in comparison to berlin , " says rafael schall from berlin , who is blown away by the response .
" here you can really get the people high on music , dance with them on the stage and really go ballistic .
people really go crazy here . "
schall is one of 50 german hip-hop artists who have come to shangai to perform at the german pavilion .
together with 50 chinese hip-hop artists they have turned it into a laboratory of urban youth culture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanghai singer cha-cha says the project is " quite a cool thing " giving space to young people marion conrady , spokesperson of the german pavilion explains why germany has chosen to present itself at this world fair in this way .
" hip-hop is a youth culture , which can also be seen in cities represented in words through graffiti but also in the form of various performances .
with the help of our ' balancity ' pavilion at the shanghai expo , we are trying to show the versatility of a city .
and in a city , giving space to young people is as important as it is to provide space for high or elite culture . "
graffiti is important for hip-hoppers all over the world .
and one can also see this at the german pavilion .
at the graffiti corner there are not only huge pictures , but also graffiti t-shirts , umbrellas and bags for the visitors .
but in shanghai one hardly gets to see any graffiti .

he explains why so few walls are painted in shanghai .
" we first had the olympics and now we have the shanghai expo .
so the government and the city are trying to wipe out the whole country .

so there is no chance that you will see a lot of graffiti in the city . "

it was initiated by akim walta from berlin , who has been active in the hip-hop scene there for almost 30 years .
walta talks about a graffiti project by german artists in shanghai .
" our boys also painted something for the residents here .
what was interesting was that they tried to come into contact with the locals .
and suddenly the sad grey street became colorful , with some connection to the locals .
and in the course of time there was some problem and we were asked to remove the graffiti .
but then , little children and families stood up for us and said that we had come from a far away land and the graffiti was a gift for them .
they said it was their picture and they did not want it to be removed . "
walta has been to china many times and has been involved in various graffiti projects .
he hopes that the hip-hop project at the shanghai expo is not the last one .

public prosecutors in stuttgart are investigating too . traders and hedge fund managers hate the weekends because they ca n't take react immediately to corporate announcements until trading floors reopen on monday .
sunday , october 26 , 2008 was a particularly bad day for 35 american hedge funds .
that was the day german sports carmaker porsche announced that it owned 42.6 percent of volkswagen 's common stock and options for another 31.5 percent - bringing its total stake in the company to 74.1 percent .
the announcement then declared porsche was seeking to obtain 75 percent of vw shares - a plan that eventually backfired .
the following morning saw a frenzy of trading activity .
hedge fund managers had long been betting that the price of vw stock would fall .
the financial crisis caused demand for cars to fall in the us , driving down american automakers ' share prices .
they figured it was only a matter of time until german carmakers suffered a similar fate .
as a result , their funds were borrowing vw shares and selling them on in the hope they could buy them back later at a lower price - a speculative strategy known as short selling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us fund managers say wendelin wiedeking misled investors about his plans but porsche 's weekend announcement made it clear that fund managers had sold more than double the number of vw shares actually available on the market .
the news drove vw 's stock price up from 290 euros to 1,005 euros per share , making it the world 's most valuable company for a short period of time .
the financial times estimates that hedge funds lost about 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- in two days of trading as a result .
transatlatic battle now the funds want porsche to pay them more than 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2 billion -rrb- in damages .
lawyers representing the hedge funds told a new york court that porsche committed securities fraud by leading investors to believe it was only seeking a 51-percent stake in vw .
porsche 's defense team is due to file a petition to dismiss the lawsuit on wednesday , according to german media .
analysts expect porsche to argue that it was only required to publicly disclose its takeover plans once they were approved by the board - and that that had not been the case prior to october 26 , 2008 .
the hedge funds ' claims may be helped by the fact that german prosecutors in the city of stuttgart are also examining claims that porsche managers manipulated the markets .
investigators are trying to establish whether former porsche chief wendelin wiedeking and his financial director holger haerter influenced stock prices by passing on insider information or misleading investors about the porsche 's plans to increase its stake in vw .
the american plaintiffs will have to be patient if they want to rely on evidence from germany , however .

public prosecutors in stuttgart are investigating too . traders and hedge fund managers hate the weekends because they ca n't take react immediately to corporate announcements until trading floors reopen on monday .
sunday , october 26 , 2008 was a particularly bad day for 35 american hedge funds .
that was the day german sports carmaker porsche announced that it owned 42.6 percent of volkswagen 's common stock and options for another 31.5 percent - bringing its total stake in the company to 74.1 percent .
the announcement then declared porsche was seeking to obtain 75 percent of vw shares - a plan that eventually backfired .
the following morning saw a frenzy of trading activity .
hedge fund managers had long been betting that the price of vw stock would fall .
the financial crisis caused demand for cars to fall in the us , driving down american automakers ' share prices .
they figured it was only a matter of time until german carmakers suffered a similar fate .
as a result , their funds were borrowing vw shares and selling them on in the hope they could buy them back later at a lower price - a speculative strategy known as short selling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us fund managers say wendelin wiedeking misled investors about his plans but porsche 's weekend announcement made it clear that fund managers had sold more than double the number of vw shares actually available on the market .
the news drove vw 's stock price up from 290 euros to 1,005 euros per share , making it the world 's most valuable company for a short period of time .
the financial times estimates that hedge funds lost about 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- in two days of trading as a result .
transatlatic battle now the funds want porsche to pay them more than 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2 billion -rrb- in damages .
lawyers representing the hedge funds told a new york court that porsche committed securities fraud by leading investors to believe it was only seeking a 51-percent stake in vw .
porsche 's defense team is due to file a petition to dismiss the lawsuit on wednesday , according to german media .
analysts expect porsche to argue that it was only required to publicly disclose its takeover plans once they were approved by the board - and that that had not been the case prior to october 26 , 2008 .
the hedge funds ' claims may be helped by the fact that german prosecutors in the city of stuttgart are also examining claims that porsche managers manipulated the markets .
investigators are trying to establish whether former porsche chief wendelin wiedeking and his financial director holger haerter influenced stock prices by passing on insider information or misleading investors about the porsche 's plans to increase its stake in vw .
the american plaintiffs will have to be patient if they want to rely on evidence from germany , however .
the stuttgart prosecutors ' preliminary findings are n't due to be released until the end of 2010 or early 2011 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 30.08.2010 german hip-hop at the shanghai expo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hip-hoppers at the german pavilion in shanghai at the german expo pavilion in shanghai , one could easily see how hip-hop is transcending borders .
the pavilion called the " balancity " featured hip-hop during a month long program with graffiti , break-dance and music . hip-hop beats echoing around the area in front of the german pavilion have been attracting scores of young chinese people .
they are excited and sing along loudly with the artists .
" it is different here in comparison to berlin , " says rafael schall from berlin , who is blown away by the response .
" here you can really get the people high on music , dance with them on the stage and really go ballistic .
people really go crazy here . "
schall is one of 50 german hip-hop artists who have come to shangai to perform at the german pavilion .
together with 50 chinese hip-hop artists they have turned it into a laboratory of urban youth culture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanghai singer cha-cha says the project is " quite a cool thing " giving space to young people marion conrady , spokesperson of the german pavilion explains why germany has chosen to present itself at this world fair in this way .
" hip-hop is a youth culture , which can also be seen in cities represented in words through graffiti but also in the form of various performances .
with the help of our ' balancity ' pavilion at the shanghai expo , we are trying to show the versatility of a city .
and in a city , giving space to young people is as important as it is to provide space for high or elite culture . "
graffiti is important for hip-hoppers all over the world .
and one can also see this at the german pavilion .
at the graffiti corner there are not only huge pictures , but also graffiti t-shirts , umbrellas and bags for the visitors .
but in shanghai one hardly gets to see any graffiti .
stan wu works with the " invasion " magazine in hong kong .
he explains why so few walls are painted in shanghai .
" we first had the olympics and now we have the shanghai expo .
so the government and the city are trying to wipe out the whole country .
zero tolerance of ' dirty ' surface , you know .
so there is no chance that you will see a lot of graffiti in the city . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mc wesley from beijing in the ' balancity ' power of graffiti asia 's largest graffiti competition " wall lords finals 2010 " , which was held on sunday at the shanghai expo was also a part of the german hip-hop project .
it was initiated by akim walta from berlin , who has been active in the hip-hop scene there for almost 30 years .
walta talks about a graffiti project by german artists in shanghai .
" our boys also painted something for the residents here .
what was interesting was that they tried to come into contact with the locals .
and suddenly the sad grey street became colorful , with some connection to the locals .
and in the course of time there was some problem and we were asked to remove the graffiti .
but then , little children and families stood up for us and said that we had come from a far away land and the graffiti was a gift for them .
they said it was their picture and they did not want it to be removed . "
walta has been to china many times and has been involved in various graffiti projects .
he hopes that the hip-hop project at the shanghai expo is not the last one .

the eu is preparing a strategy paper to secure a long-term supply of the increasingly necessary materials . it 's a little known fact that in order to stay in the technology manufacturing game , europe has to import some 40 rare metals and minerals .
it 's also a worrying fact because many of the materials used in the production of objects like cell phones and energy efficient lamps are either in limited supply or kept at artificially low levels by china . according to the eu commission , 14 of these rare earths , as they are called , are particularly scarce and are either only available in china or are mined for unrealistic prices elsewhere . while china is key to these materials finding their way to the world market , gwenole cozigou , the commission 's director for chemical , metals , forest-based and textile industries , is worried about the length of beijing 's arm . he said although negotiations with the chinese government over commodity trade are ongoing , foreign buyers are being forced to process rare earths into half-finished products on chinese soil . " china wants to build an industry and that is a perfectly acceptable goal , but if it violates trade regulations we will take action , " cozigou said .

" china wants to build an industry and that is a perfectly acceptable goal , but if it violates trade regulations we will take action , " cozigou said .
in this case , that means teaming up with the united states and mexico to contact a world trade organization arbitration tribunal . taking on china hubertus bardt , raw materials expert from the institute for economic research in cologne , told deutsche welle it 's up to the eu to make sure china does not exploit its monopoly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tantal is used in micro-processors " one could threaten to impose import restrictions on chinese products , but nobody wants that and ultimately it would harm us , too , " he said .
" but there are always new trade talks and political discussions , and it 's important to use them to prioritize this problem . " it 's a problem which he said he believes will only get worse as fast-growing , emerging nations become ever more dependent upon technology . " there are a number of indications to suggest an increase in demand for these raw materials , " he said .
" firstly there is growth in china , then growth in india and brazil and then technical developments such as electromobility , solar panels and energy efficient lamps . " the role of developing countries besides entering into trade talks and exerting political pressure to secure itself a supply of rare earths , the eu is also keen to work in close cooperation with other developing countries known to have reserves of the raw materials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the democratic republic of congo has deposits of coltan the bloc has already begun negotiations with the african union , but is not , cozigou stressed , offering development aid in return for rare earths . " african countries have to realize that the extraction of raw materials at a fair price is advantageous for their own advancement , " he said , adding that it was the only way to attract potential european investors . but bardt said there is a place for development aid if it helps countries with reserves to establish the kind of market systems and institutions which would ultimately be of benefit to europe . time to recycle according to the eu 's observations , beijing secures entry to the coveted raw materials through the aggressive acquisition of foreign mining companies and land and by making donations to the relevant regimes .
experts say it is a problem , not least because there are very few rare earth mining companies left around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old phones should be recycled to recover reusable materials - not binned that being the case , the european union is supporting scientists looking for rare earths and is pushing for more recycling of raw materials from old mobile phones , televisions and cars . " we have our own mines in our cities across europe , " cozigou said , adding that the eu is currently working towards tightening regulations governing the export of electronic scrap and car wrecks .
" the eu wants what has previously been considered electronic garbage to be deemed valuable raw materials . " autor : bernd riegert / tkw editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 30.08.2010 german hip-hop at the shanghai expo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hip-hoppers at the german pavilion in shanghai at the german expo pavilion in shanghai , one could easily see how hip-hop is transcending borders .
the pavilion called the " balancity " featured hip-hop during a month long program with graffiti , break-dance and music . hip-hop beats echoing around the area in front of the german pavilion have been attracting scores of young chinese people .
they are excited and sing along loudly with the artists .
" it is different here in comparison to berlin , " says rafael schall from berlin , who is blown away by the response .
" here you can really get the people high on music , dance with them on the stage and really go ballistic .
people really go crazy here . "
schall is one of 50 german hip-hop artists who have come to shangai to perform at the german pavilion .
together with 50 chinese hip-hop artists they have turned it into a laboratory of urban youth culture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanghai singer cha-cha says the project is " quite a cool thing " giving space to young people marion conrady , spokesperson of the german pavilion explains why germany has chosen to present itself at this world fair in this way .
" hip-hop is a youth culture , which can also be seen in cities represented in words through graffiti but also in the form of various performances .
with the help of our ' balancity ' pavilion at the shanghai expo , we are trying to show the versatility of a city .
and in a city , giving space to young people is as important as it is to provide space for high or elite culture . "
graffiti is important for hip-hoppers all over the world .
and one can also see this at the german pavilion .
at the graffiti corner there are not only huge pictures , but also graffiti t-shirts , umbrellas and bags for the visitors .
but in shanghai one hardly gets to see any graffiti .
stan wu works with the " invasion " magazine in hong kong .
he explains why so few walls are painted in shanghai .
" we first had the olympics and now we have the shanghai expo .
so the government and the city are trying to wipe out the whole country .
zero tolerance of ' dirty ' surface , you know .
so there is no chance that you will see a lot of graffiti in the city . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mc wesley from beijing in the ' balancity ' power of graffiti asia 's largest graffiti competition " wall lords finals 2010 " , which was held on sunday at the shanghai expo was also a part of the german hip-hop project .
it was initiated by akim walta from berlin , who has been active in the hip-hop scene there for almost 30 years .
walta talks about a graffiti project by german artists in shanghai .
" our boys also painted something for the residents here .
what was interesting was that they tried to come into contact with the locals .
and suddenly the sad grey street became colorful , with some connection to the locals .
and in the course of time there was some problem and we were asked to remove the graffiti .
but then , little children and families stood up for us and said that we had come from a far away land and the graffiti was a gift for them .
they said it was their picture and they did not want it to be removed . "
walta has been to china many times and has been involved in various graffiti projects .
he hopes that the hip-hop project at the shanghai expo is not the last one .

the southern city of thatta has apparently been saved from being inundated , and many citizens who fled earlier are returning there . slowly , the focus is turning to the giant task of rebuilding the devastated areas .
the pakistani ngo akhuwat pakistan has launched an innovative plan to help flood victims in southern punjab stand on their own feet as soon as possible .
under the plan by akhuwat pakistan , flood-affected families are to receive microcredits in order to create employment opportunities for them .
the interest-free loans will come without difficult conditions attached .
the organisation 's executive director amjad saqib explains : " look , whatever is happening right now is relief work .
people need food , shelter , medicine . "
but this relief work will be over in one or two months , he adds . bildunterschrift : a boy receives food at a camp on the outskirt of sukkur in southern pakistan " and then the real challenge will come up - how to rehabilitate all these people !
how can they stand on their own feet again ?
so whereas we from akhuwat have been continuously engaged in relief work in the field , within two months we want to shift our focus on one of the worst-affected areas , rajanpur district .
our preparation , fund raising and resource mobilisation are going well , and god willing we 'll select 10,000 badly affected families and provide them with interest-free loans , thus enabling them to re-start the businesses they 've had to abandon due to this flood . "
rebuilding small businesses the flood victims will get between 10,000 and 30,000 rupees -lrb- between 92 and 276 euros -rrb- per family as an interest-free loan .
no security or documents are required , nor will there be any service charges .
according to izhar hashmi , director of akhuwat pakistan , the recipients will be able to buy seeds or raise goats or cattle with the money .
they might also open a small shop in their village or buy a donkey cart and start a transport business .
with the income generated , they 'll have to repay the loans within 30 months .
the money will then be free to be distributed again to other needy persons .
akhuwat plans to raise 150 million rupees -lrb- almost 1.4 million euros -rrb- in donations from pakistanis for the program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crossing a flooded road in punjab province on monday " we wo n't turn pakistanis into beggars , " says amjad saqib , " but want to harness their potential to work hard for a better future .
they 'll rise up on their own and stand on their own feet again . "
an alternative approach to microcredit akhuwat means " brotherhood " in arabic .
the organisation 's philosophy of providing loan-free microcredit is inspired by islamic teaching which prohibits the charging of interest , but it equally provides loans to non-muslims , such as members of the christian minority , relying on the local mosque and church infrastructure . akhuwat , which has been working in pakistan for more than nine years and claims a recovery rate for its loans of almost 100 per cent , is an interesting exception among the growing number of micro-finance institutions worldwide .
recently , criticism has grown of these microcredit groups , as many have been demanding high interest rates , which can become a problem for those who accept their loans .
some development experts have pointed to the akhuwat model , funded by charitable donations and charging no interest at all , as an alternative way .
for pakistani flood victims , it definitely comes as a welcome support in this time of crisis .
