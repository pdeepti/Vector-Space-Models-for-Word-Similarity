the two-day regional elections , which started on sunday , march 28 , are no different . the leader is down in the polls and the votes garnered by his people 's freedom party will partly be viewed as reflecting confidence – or lack thereof – in the prime minister . but berlusconi 's power has long hinged on forming pacts with other parties .
myrta merlino , who hosts a financial program on television called the domino effect , said the elections will also be pivotal for the far-right northern league party , known as the lega in italian . " for the first time , two major regions are likely to go to the lega , " merlino said .
" and if they win , the weight of the lega in the central government will be very , very big .
the northern region will ask to have more money for the efficient regions and less for the south .
and so also for the unity of the country , these elections are important . " resentment against south bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents have accused berlusconi of changing laws for his own benefit the northern league is fiscally conservative , and has long expressed resentment toward southern italy 's dependency on government jobs to keep its population employed .
the lega also has the sympathy of berlusconi 's most powerful minister - finance minister giulio tremonti . the elections are also seen as a test for the left .
years of infighting , ineffective leadership and a series of its own scandals have kept italians from considering the center-left democratic party as a real option . antonio polito , editor of il riformista magazine and a former senator in the southern region of campania , said the regional elections are a chance for the italian left to get the new start it 's looking for . " at the moment , the opposition is unelectable , " polito said .
" if we had general elections now , the center-left would lose .
so the regional elections are an important step to rebuild credibility in the country . " changes in perception and if the left does gain what it 's seeking - more votes and a shift in perception that they could lead italy - it does n't necessarily spell the end of berlusconi . milano finanza magazine editor pierluigi magnaschi said it 's unlikely berlusconi will be going anywhere before the end of his term as prime minister . " i think the end of berlusconi is not near , " said magnaschi .
" he will finish in three years .
after that , the political games are open . " author : megan williams / svs editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 28.03.2010 german school 's board members step down amid sex abuse scandal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-students have demanded a purge at odenwald five out of seven board members of the prestigious odenwald private boarding school have resigned amid revelations that several of its teachers sexually abused pupils more than two decades ago . the revelations of past abuse at the non-religious boarding school near the southern town of heppenheim in the state of hesse come at a time when catholic institutions in germany and elsewhere are facing similar allegations .
only the school principal margarita kaufmann and general manager meto salijevic remain in office following the meeting on saturday , march 27 .
the school says 33 ex-pupils have reported they were sexually abused in the period from 1966 to 1991 .
philipp sturz , one of the school 's 30 trustees , declined to confirm a report in the news magazine " der spiegel " that 40 ex-pupils had lodged complaints and more ex-teachers had been named in the scandal .
abuse allegations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did the pope turn a blind eye to abuse allegations ?
most of the sex abuse scandals which have come to light recently in germany have focused on the catholic church , and the employment of a convicted pedophile priest in 1980 in the city of munich when joseph ratzinger – now pope benedict xvi – served his term as archbishop .
some have questioned whether the pope played a role in the alleged cover-up of some abuse cases .
meanwhile , secular and protestant groups have admitted they also failed in that era to adequately police pedophile attacks on children in care .
last week , germany appointed a special ombudsman to receive and investigate allegations of sex molestation dating from the 1950s in catholic and other private schools .

abuse allegations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did the pope turn a blind eye to abuse allegations ?
most of the sex abuse scandals which have come to light recently in germany have focused on the catholic church , and the employment of a convicted pedophile priest in 1980 in the city of munich when joseph ratzinger – now pope benedict xvi – served his term as archbishop .
some have questioned whether the pope played a role in the alleged cover-up of some abuse cases .
meanwhile , secular and protestant groups have admitted they also failed in that era to adequately police pedophile attacks on children in care .

the move came after spain , which holds the eu presidency , said the names of libyans had been removed from a swiss-instigated visa blacklist . spain 's foreign ministry announced in a statement on saturday that the visa blacklist against 188 libyans had been torn up and expressed regret as part of a diplomatic drive by european union leaders .
the foreign ministry in madrid expressed said it " deplored " the problems that the ban had caused to libyans .
the ban was imposed on the initiative of switzerland , which has been embroiled in a long-standing diplomatic row with libya .
tripoli responded in kind by putting out a communiqué .
" in the interests of strengthening its cooperation with the european union , libya lifts the restrictions it earlier imposed on the citizens of the schengen zone , " the libyan foreign ministry said in a statement published by the state news agency jana , referring to the 25-nation visa-free zone in europe .
switzerland is part of the schengen zone but not a member of the 27-nation eu .
libya had insisted on the eu apologizing for the row , something that spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos had agreed to during a recent visit to tripoli , according to the libyan ambassador to spain .
last week , switzerland said that it was prepared to lift the ban it had imposed in january on libyan officials , including leader moamer gaddafi , for entry into the schengen zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gaddafi had called for a jihad against switzerland after the swiss ban on minarets strife escalates the spat between libya and switzerland dates back to 2008 , when gaddafi 's son , hannibal , was arrested in geneva , allegedly for mistreating his domestic help .
the charges were later dropped but tripoli retaliated by arresting two swiss men on visa charges .
the crisis assumed an eu-wide dimension earlier this year , with the swiss travel ban and a tit-for-tat prohibition by libya , which said it would stop issuing visas to citizens from all schengen-area countries .
the swiss move not only infuriated libya , but also schengen states which saw it as an unjustified escalation of a bilateral row .
the schengen area is a grouping of all eu countries except britain , ireland , cyprus , bulgaria and romania , plus non-eu members switzerland , norway and iceland .
the diplomatic feud between switzerland and libya also escalated following a swiss referendum decision in november last year to ban the construction of minarets in the country . in february , gaddafi had condemned the minaret ban and called for a " jihad " or holy war against switzerland. rb / afp / reuters / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move comes as some other european nations have already opened their doors to former prisoners . according to an interior ministry spokesman , berlin is talking to washington about relocating suitable detainees after they get released from the us-owned guantanamo bay prison in cuba . an unnamed interior ministry official said on saturday , march 27 , that his ministry had " opened talks anew with the united states on this matter . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some prisoners , going home is not an option the discussions were taking place with the approval of the foreign ministry and chancellor angela merkel 's office " on a case-by-case basis , " the official added . meanwhile , the german news magazine " der spiegel " reported that a delegation from berlin recently visited guantanamo to meet with several inmates , including a palestinian , a jordanian and a syrian who are likely candidates for resettlement . spiegel said the delegation , including police and immigration officials , had interviewed the men to assess their suitability and any potential risks if they were to be taken in . risk assessment last year , germany had considered accepting prisoners but later backed off amid concerns that the men could prove dangerous . the interior ministry said on saturday that berlin supported washington 's efforts to close the prison camp and that this had been consistent german policy . spiegel said us special envoy daniel fried had had months of confidential talks last year with the interior ministry , culminating in the handing over of a list of nine candidates .
some of them have since found homes in other nations . the newspaper said the remaining candidates for resettlement included a palestinian from the west bank who was part of a conservative group of imams and had been arrested in pakistan . a jordanian who traveled to afghanistan in the summer of 2001 was also on the list as was a syrian , who had been treated at a kabul hospital at the end of 2001 , and was arrested shortly after his discharge .
the united states wants to release all three men . bildunterschrift : prisoners who are no longer regarded as enemy combatants are eligible for release missed deadline president barack obama 's administration has been reluctant to send some guantanamo prisoners back to their home countries because they might suffer reprisal after being held in us custody . obama had pledged to close down the guantanamo camp by january this year , but some 200 detainees continue to be held there as finding them new homes is proving difficult . european countries are divided over whether to accept freed guantanamo detainees : while most appear reluctant , some have openly expressed support . last week , two chinese uighur men who were released from the detention camp in cuba arrived in switzerland .
in february , the first of five inmates slated to be accepted by spain arrived in madrid . rb / dpa / ap editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 25-year-old graduate of oxford university and the hertie school of governance in berlin was watching a bunch of youngsters enjoying a game of basketball in a break between morning classes .
terwitte is one of 66 high-achieving college graduates who were sent to problem schools in september 2009 under a program run by teach first germany - a not-for-profit charity founded four years ago .
" this brings you to a new level . it 's like a consulting job that requires 70- or 80-hour work weeks , " he said .
' he 's one of us ' during the break , a 14-year-old student of german-turkish origin asks terwitte politely if he can go to the school 's office to check on his next classes .
this kind of discipline and good manners was n't always the norm at the ernst-schering school , where students have earned a reputation for violent behavior , absenteeism and under-achieving .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence was a problem at ernst-schering school the school is situated in a section of berlin dominated by poor immigrant families .
some 85 percent of the school 's children are on free meals , and their parents are often dependent on social welfare .
in spite of his elite academic pedigree , terwitte managed to win the respect of the school 's students . many have even grown fond of him in the seven months he 's spent at the school .
" his music classes are really varied , and always a lot of fun , " said ahed , an 8th grade student .
he also said that terwitte was not just " focused on grades " and listens to the " student 's needs . "
" you can also always approach him with personal things , " said bethlehem , a student from ethiopia .
" he 's one of us because he understands us , " ahed concluded .
but terwitte is not only popular among the school 's students .
the teachers like him too , and do n't regret their decision to apply for a teach first fellow .
" he 's building bridges between the students and the regular teachers , " said marion buerck , a biology and chemistry teacher . buerck called teach first " a wonderful program that should definitely be enlarged . "
' perfect mixture of mind and heart ' under the german teach first program , fellows like terwitte are given two-year contracts that earn them about 1,700 euros -lrb- $ 2,268 -rrb- per month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fellows face a rigid selection process before they are sent to the schools the first 66 fellows were sent to the schools in september 2009 .
they were selected from more than 700 graduates who had initially applied .
" we are looking for the perfect mixture of mind and heart , " said kaija landsberg , the founder of teach first germany .
a graduate of the hertie school of governance in berlin , landsberg wrote her master 's thesis on the problems of integration .
during her studies she came across teach first in britain and teach for america in the united states .
" academic excellence is not enough , " landsberg said .
" what we also need is a high degree of involvement in fields such as social work , cultural initiatives or sports .
applicants must prove they are willing to take leadership positions . "
struggling against the odds landsberg said most of the graduates that apply to teach first were driven by the desire " to give something back to society " after they had received " the privilege of first-class education . "
" what unites us all is the shared belief that more must be done in the education system to serve those who have n't been served so far , " she said .
but teach first has received a lot of criticism from the german teacher 's trade union , which accuses the program of aiming to " de-professionalize " the teaching profession .

as more nations lobby to have their say in world affairs , the g-8 faces a future of reduced influence and relevance . foreign ministers from the group of eight -lrb- g-8 -rrb- major countries gather in the resort city of gatineau in quebec , canada on march 29-30 to lay the groundwork for the g-8 summit meeting to be held in muskoka , ontario , in june .
during the two-day talks , the ministers from britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states will discuss a number of issues , including nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament , how to ensure peace and stability on the volatile afghanistan-pakistan border , and the consequences of terrorism and how to support nations with security vulnerabilities .
the g-8 summit in ontario on june 25-26 is shaping up to be a particularly important one , and not just because of the fluid nature of the global challenges the organization is currently facing .
while matters such as the nuclear ambitions of iran and north korea , the instability in the afghan-pakistan border regions and the threat of international terrorism are undoubtedly more pressing now than they were at the last annual summit in l 'aquila , italy in 2009 , the ontario summit could be a historic one in itself .
some observers have suggested it may be the g-8 's last .
driven by its role in addressing the impact of the global economic crisis , the g-20 organization - finance ministers and central bank governors from the world 's top 20 economies - is being viewed by some as the dominant power bloc in a new era of global governance .
the g-8 has served in various forms as the world 's leading economic forum since 1975 but at its summit in pittsburgh in september 2009 , the g-20 announced that its leaders had " endorsed the g-20 as the premier forum for their international economic cooperation . "
financial crisis exposed g-8 's limitations bildunterschrift : the g-20 's global inclusiveness in addressing the economic crisis showed up the g-8 's limitations while the g-8 focuses more on issues such as security and climate change and leaves its economic and financial policy to the g-7 - essentially the finance ministers of the g-8 minus russia - the rise of the g-20 and the expansion of its powers has some experts wondering how long the g-8 and g-7 can survive in the face of an increasingly influential , more inclusive global decision-making body . " the g-8 - if it survives at all - will be a much less powerful gathering and for a very good reason , " dr. henning meyer , head of the european programme at the global policy institute in london , told deutsche welle . " in the wake of the financial crisis everybody could witness the level of interdependence in the world .
and it became clear that a political structure that excludes important rising countries such as india , china and brazil simply does not have the scope to deal with those global issues . " " as with other institutions of global governance , like the united nations , it became clear that the structure of the g-8 does not reflect global realities enough , " he added . " if global problems of the magnitude of the financial crisis persist , which is very likely , then the real power of the g-8 will permanently shift to the g-20 or some other form of broader political structure .

" on certain areas of finance , development , energy and climate change , both organizations have played a role but economic and financial issues will be taken up more and more by the g-20 , " she told deutsche welle . it is also likely that the g-20 wo n't limit its growing influence to purely economic matters , which could marginalise the g-8 even more .
the g-20 has recently expanded its reach into financing development projects - prompted by the earthquake in haiti - and has started to play a larger role on issues such as energy and climate change , and in particular climate financing . g-8 likely to remain influential on climate , development bildunterschrift : the g-8 will still take the lead on climate change and development policy but will need the g-20 's help guebert believes that while the g-20 's influence will continue to grow in areas which are traditionally within the remit of the g-8 , the group of eight will maintain a strong role in climate policy making and establishing development mechanisms while accepting that the g-20 's involvement is necessary . " on the issue of climate change , the g-8 has long realized that there are key countries , who are members of the g-20 , that need to be included in the debate , " she said .
" however , the g-8 will likely continue to discuss the topic as well and make commitments on issues where the g-8 can come to consensus . " " development issues including global health , food security , water and sanitation and development assistance will continue to play an important role on the g-8 agenda . " group of eight will still lead on security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-8 will still handle security but it is still not the best option the g-8 is also likely to continue to take the lead on issues which fit better on its agenda , such as political security issues including counter-terrorism , nuclear non-proliferation , and the promotion of democracy and good governance .
the fact that not all members of the g-20 are democratic or have the capability or will to provide assistance to other countries makes these issues difficult to discuss in the broader g-20 . however , henning meyer believes that neither the g-8 or the g-20 are equipped to tackle security issues . " the most important aspect of multilateral-governance structures is that all or most relevant players are included in the same process , " he said . " neither the g-8 nor the g-20 in my view are suited to deal with security issues or non-proliferation .
this is the job of the un .
the g-8 or g-20 in effect are just formalized regular meetings where governments consult .
none of the outcomes of these meetings are directly binding because the ' agreements in principle ' have to be implemented nationally .
the un has more tools at its disposal . " despite this , the g-8 appears to be safe as long as its involvement in certain areas where the g-20 is too unwieldy to be effective continues and support remains among its members and those external powers that rely on its influence , such as african nations who fear that needed development assistance might disappear without the g-8 . however , a shift toward the g-20 's brand of global governance seems unstoppable with many of the world 's emerging markets , as well as the developed countries like australia who are not members of the g-8 , pushing for full inclusion in the global decision-making process . the g-8 may not be about to disband but it certainly appears to be on the verge of having to accept a new reality where its powers are curbed and where it has to concede influence to a larger forum . author : nick amies editor : rob mudge back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move came after spain , which holds the eu presidency , said the names of libyans had been removed from a swiss-instigated visa blacklist . spain 's foreign ministry announced in a statement on saturday that the visa blacklist against 188 libyans had been torn up and expressed regret as part of a diplomatic drive by european union leaders .
the foreign ministry in madrid expressed said it " deplored " the problems that the ban had caused to libyans .
the ban was imposed on the initiative of switzerland , which has been embroiled in a long-standing diplomatic row with libya .
tripoli responded in kind by putting out a communiqué .
" in the interests of strengthening its cooperation with the european union , libya lifts the restrictions it earlier imposed on the citizens of the schengen zone , " the libyan foreign ministry said in a statement published by the state news agency jana , referring to the 25-nation visa-free zone in europe .
switzerland is part of the schengen zone but not a member of the 27-nation eu .
libya had insisted on the eu apologizing for the row , something that spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos had agreed to during a recent visit to tripoli , according to the libyan ambassador to spain .
last week , switzerland said that it was prepared to lift the ban it had imposed in january on libyan officials , including leader moamer gaddafi , for entry into the schengen zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gaddafi had called for a jihad against switzerland after the swiss ban on minarets strife escalates the spat between libya and switzerland dates back to 2008 , when gaddafi 's son , hannibal , was arrested in geneva , allegedly for mistreating his domestic help .
the charges were later dropped but tripoli retaliated by arresting two swiss men on visa charges .
the crisis assumed an eu-wide dimension earlier this year , with the swiss travel ban and a tit-for-tat prohibition by libya , which said it would stop issuing visas to citizens from all schengen-area countries .
the swiss move not only infuriated libya , but also schengen states which saw it as an unjustified escalation of a bilateral row .
the schengen area is a grouping of all eu countries except britain , ireland , cyprus , bulgaria and romania , plus non-eu members switzerland , norway and iceland .
the diplomatic feud between switzerland and libya also escalated following a swiss referendum decision in november last year to ban the construction of minarets in the country . in february , gaddafi had condemned the minaret ban and called for a " jihad " or holy war against switzerland. rb / afp / reuters / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

only the school principal margarita kaufmann and general manager meto salijevic remain in office following the meeting on saturday , march 27 .
the school says 33 ex-pupils have reported they were sexually abused in the period from 1966 to 1991 .
philipp sturz , one of the school 's 30 trustees , declined to confirm a report in the news magazine " der spiegel " that 40 ex-pupils had lodged complaints and more ex-teachers had been named in the scandal .
abuse allegations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did the pope turn a blind eye to abuse allegations ?
most of the sex abuse scandals which have come to light recently in germany have focused on the catholic church , and the employment of a convicted pedophile priest in 1980 in the city of munich when joseph ratzinger – now pope benedict xvi – served his term as archbishop .
some have questioned whether the pope played a role in the alleged cover-up of some abuse cases .
meanwhile , secular and protestant groups have admitted they also failed in that era to adequately police pedophile attacks on children in care .
last week , germany appointed a special ombudsman to receive and investigate allegations of sex molestation dating from the 1950s in catholic and other private schools .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 28.03.2010 teach first makes the grade in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teach first fellows are eager to leave mark at problem schools modeled on similar programs in britain and the us , teach first germany attracts high-achieving graduates to challenged schools , aiming to change attitudes and improve society . on a cold thursday morning in march , johannes terwitte is in charge of ensuring schoolyard discipline at the ernst-schering school in berlin 's wedding district .
the 25-year-old graduate of oxford university and the hertie school of governance in berlin was watching a bunch of youngsters enjoying a game of basketball in a break between morning classes .
terwitte is one of 66 high-achieving college graduates who were sent to problem schools in september 2009 under a program run by teach first germany - a not-for-profit charity founded four years ago .
" this brings you to a new level . it 's like a consulting job that requires 70- or 80-hour work weeks , " he said .
' he 's one of us ' during the break , a 14-year-old student of german-turkish origin asks terwitte politely if he can go to the school 's office to check on his next classes .
this kind of discipline and good manners was n't always the norm at the ernst-schering school , where students have earned a reputation for violent behavior , absenteeism and under-achieving .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence was a problem at ernst-schering school the school is situated in a section of berlin dominated by poor immigrant families .
some 85 percent of the school 's children are on free meals , and their parents are often dependent on social welfare .
in spite of his elite academic pedigree , terwitte managed to win the respect of the school 's students . many have even grown fond of him in the seven months he 's spent at the school .
" his music classes are really varied , and always a lot of fun , " said ahed , an 8th grade student .
he also said that terwitte was not just " focused on grades " and listens to the " student 's needs . "
" you can also always approach him with personal things , " said bethlehem , a student from ethiopia .
" he 's one of us because he understands us , " ahed concluded .
but terwitte is not only popular among the school 's students .
the teachers like him too , and do n't regret their decision to apply for a teach first fellow .
" he 's building bridges between the students and the regular teachers , " said marion buerck , a biology and chemistry teacher . buerck called teach first " a wonderful program that should definitely be enlarged . "
' perfect mixture of mind and heart ' under the german teach first program , fellows like terwitte are given two-year contracts that earn them about 1,700 euros -lrb- $ 2,268 -rrb- per month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fellows face a rigid selection process before they are sent to the schools the first 66 fellows were sent to the schools in september 2009 .
they were selected from more than 700 graduates who had initially applied .
" we are looking for the perfect mixture of mind and heart , " said kaija landsberg , the founder of teach first germany .
a graduate of the hertie school of governance in berlin , landsberg wrote her master 's thesis on the problems of integration .
during her studies she came across teach first in britain and teach for america in the united states .
" academic excellence is not enough , " landsberg said .
" what we also need is a high degree of involvement in fields such as social work , cultural initiatives or sports .
applicants must prove they are willing to take leadership positions . "
struggling against the odds landsberg said most of the graduates that apply to teach first were driven by the desire " to give something back to society " after they had received " the privilege of first-class education . "
" what unites us all is the shared belief that more must be done in the education system to serve those who have n't been served so far , " she said .
but teach first has received a lot of criticism from the german teacher 's trade union , which accuses the program of aiming to " de-professionalize " the teaching profession .
the union also questioned the " philanthropic motives " of the graduates .
" we are not lowering any bars , " landsberg says .
" the fellows do n't do the jobs of regular teachers .
it 's just a new way for them to discover the teaching profession , for which they would need additional qualifications anyway . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teach first fellows are used to a different world a different type of leader but turning high-achieving college graduates into teachers is n't the focus of teach first . landsberg says the goal is to make the fellows take what they experienced in the schools " to the next level " of their careers .
" we really need people who have been on the ground and know what it 's about , so they will be to change policies , change companies and change society , " she said .
terwitte said his new job at the ernst-schering school required " a degree of energy unparalleled in his previous life . " he called his endeavor both " taxing and rewarding . "
" sometimes i catch myself thinking : gosh , am i taking more out of this than i 'm able to give to the kids ?
because in many ways i 'm growing , " he said , before adding , " teach first fellows are pre-destined to carry on this work , wherever they go in their future lives . "

this kind of discipline and good manners was n't always the norm at the ernst-schering school , where students have earned a reputation for violent behavior , absenteeism and under-achieving .

germany has been charged with the task since 2002 . thomas de maiziere 's trip to kabul is the first visit to afghanistan by a german interior minister in six years .
germany has been tasked with training afghan police forces since 2002 , and de maiziere is in afghanistan to discuss the slow progress of the mission .
" it 's no success story , but things are improving " said de maiziere .
" the new strategy will hopefully start working , but we can not set the bar too high . "
the german government has outlined a new afghanistan strategy which foresees a new emphasis on training afghan security forces and boosting the number of german instructors to do the job .
on sunday , de maiziere met with his afghan counterpart mohammad hanif atmar and general stanley mcchrystal , the american commander of nato troops in afghanistan .
representatives from the european union police force eupol were also in attendance .
redoubled efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more german police experts are expected this year in afghanistan currently , there are 190 german police experts in afghanistan helping to train afghan police .
this number is scheduled to increase to 260 in 2010 .
by 2014 , 134,000 afghan police are hoped to be in service .
at the moment , there are just under 100,000 .
speaking through a military spokesman , de maiziere said he was optimistic that " success can still be achieved in afghanistan . "
however , recruiting trainees for the afghan police force has its share of difficulties .
an estimated 1,400 afghan police officers were killed last year alone during operations against the taliban . the afghan interior ministry is also investigating how many of the afghan police signed up on the force are actually serving .
drug addiction , illiteracy and corruption are common problems among the officers .
surprise visit from obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai , left , hosted obama at the presidential palace in kabul as de maiziere conducted his meetings in kabul , us president barack obama was en route to the afghan capital for a surprise meeting with afghan president hamid karzai .
the two leaders discussed making progress on good governance , rule of law , and anti-corruption efforts underway in afghanistan . later , obama visited the american airfield bagram in parvan province , where he addressed american troops stationed there . the trip to afghanistan is obama 's first as the commander in chief of the american military forces. mz / dpa / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move came after spain , which holds the eu presidency , said the names of libyans had been removed from a swiss-instigated visa blacklist . spain 's foreign ministry announced in a statement on saturday that the visa blacklist against 188 libyans had been torn up and expressed regret as part of a diplomatic drive by european union leaders .
the foreign ministry in madrid expressed said it " deplored " the problems that the ban had caused to libyans .
the ban was imposed on the initiative of switzerland , which has been embroiled in a long-standing diplomatic row with libya .
tripoli responded in kind by putting out a communiqué .
" in the interests of strengthening its cooperation with the european union , libya lifts the restrictions it earlier imposed on the citizens of the schengen zone , " the libyan foreign ministry said in a statement published by the state news agency jana , referring to the 25-nation visa-free zone in europe .
switzerland is part of the schengen zone but not a member of the 27-nation eu .
libya had insisted on the eu apologizing for the row , something that spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos had agreed to during a recent visit to tripoli , according to the libyan ambassador to spain .
last week , switzerland said that it was prepared to lift the ban it had imposed in january on libyan officials , including leader moamer gaddafi , for entry into the schengen zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gaddafi had called for a jihad against switzerland after the swiss ban on minarets strife escalates the spat between libya and switzerland dates back to 2008 , when gaddafi 's son , hannibal , was arrested in geneva , allegedly for mistreating his domestic help .
the charges were later dropped but tripoli retaliated by arresting two swiss men on visa charges .
the crisis assumed an eu-wide dimension earlier this year , with the swiss travel ban and a tit-for-tat prohibition by libya , which said it would stop issuing visas to citizens from all schengen-area countries .
the swiss move not only infuriated libya , but also schengen states which saw it as an unjustified escalation of a bilateral row .
the schengen area is a grouping of all eu countries except britain , ireland , cyprus , bulgaria and romania , plus non-eu members switzerland , norway and iceland .
the diplomatic feud between switzerland and libya also escalated following a swiss referendum decision in november last year to ban the construction of minarets in the country . in february , gaddafi had condemned the minaret ban and called for a " jihad " or holy war against switzerland. rb / afp / reuters / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany has been charged with the task since 2002 . thomas de maiziere 's trip to kabul is the first visit to afghanistan by a german interior minister in six years .
germany has been tasked with training afghan police forces since 2002 , and de maiziere is in afghanistan to discuss the slow progress of the mission .
" it 's no success story , but things are improving " said de maiziere .
" the new strategy will hopefully start working , but we can not set the bar too high . "
the german government has outlined a new afghanistan strategy which foresees a new emphasis on training afghan security forces and boosting the number of german instructors to do the job .
on sunday , de maiziere met with his afghan counterpart mohammad hanif atmar and general stanley mcchrystal , the american commander of nato troops in afghanistan .
representatives from the european union police force eupol were also in attendance .
redoubled efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more german police experts are expected this year in afghanistan currently , there are 190 german police experts in afghanistan helping to train afghan police .
this number is scheduled to increase to 260 in 2010 .
by 2014 , 134,000 afghan police are hoped to be in service .
at the moment , there are just under 100,000 .
speaking through a military spokesman , de maiziere said he was optimistic that " success can still be achieved in afghanistan . "
however , recruiting trainees for the afghan police force has its share of difficulties .
an estimated 1,400 afghan police officers were killed last year alone during operations against the taliban . the afghan interior ministry is also investigating how many of the afghan police signed up on the force are actually serving .
drug addiction , illiteracy and corruption are common problems among the officers .

as more nations lobby to have their say in world affairs , the g-8 faces a future of reduced influence and relevance . foreign ministers from the group of eight -lrb- g-8 -rrb- major countries gather in the resort city of gatineau in quebec , canada on march 29-30 to lay the groundwork for the g-8 summit meeting to be held in muskoka , ontario , in june .
during the two-day talks , the ministers from britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states will discuss a number of issues , including nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament , how to ensure peace and stability on the volatile afghanistan-pakistan border , and the consequences of terrorism and how to support nations with security vulnerabilities .
the g-8 summit in ontario on june 25-26 is shaping up to be a particularly important one , and not just because of the fluid nature of the global challenges the organization is currently facing .
while matters such as the nuclear ambitions of iran and north korea , the instability in the afghan-pakistan border regions and the threat of international terrorism are undoubtedly more pressing now than they were at the last annual summit in l 'aquila , italy in 2009 , the ontario summit could be a historic one in itself .
some observers have suggested it may be the g-8 's last .
driven by its role in addressing the impact of the global economic crisis , the g-20 organization - finance ministers and central bank governors from the world 's top 20 economies - is being viewed by some as the dominant power bloc in a new era of global governance .
the g-8 has served in various forms as the world 's leading economic forum since 1975 but at its summit in pittsburgh in september 2009 , the g-20 announced that its leaders had " endorsed the g-20 as the premier forum for their international economic cooperation . "
financial crisis exposed g-8 's limitations bildunterschrift : the g-20 's global inclusiveness in addressing the economic crisis showed up the g-8 's limitations while the g-8 focuses more on issues such as security and climate change and leaves its economic and financial policy to the g-7 - essentially the finance ministers of the g-8 minus russia - the rise of the g-20 and the expansion of its powers has some experts wondering how long the g-8 and g-7 can survive in the face of an increasingly influential , more inclusive global decision-making body . " the g-8 - if it survives at all - will be a much less powerful gathering and for a very good reason , " dr. henning meyer , head of the european programme at the global policy institute in london , told deutsche welle . " in the wake of the financial crisis everybody could witness the level of interdependence in the world .
and it became clear that a political structure that excludes important rising countries such as india , china and brazil simply does not have the scope to deal with those global issues . " " as with other institutions of global governance , like the united nations , it became clear that the structure of the g-8 does not reflect global realities enough , " he added . " if global problems of the magnitude of the financial crisis persist , which is very likely , then the real power of the g-8 will permanently shift to the g-20 or some other form of broader political structure .

the 25-year-old graduate of oxford university and the hertie school of governance in berlin was watching a bunch of youngsters enjoying a game of basketball in a break between morning classes .
terwitte is one of 66 high-achieving college graduates who were sent to problem schools in september 2009 under a program run by teach first germany - a not-for-profit charity founded four years ago .
" this brings you to a new level . it 's like a consulting job that requires 70- or 80-hour work weeks , " he said .
' he 's one of us ' during the break , a 14-year-old student of german-turkish origin asks terwitte politely if he can go to the school 's office to check on his next classes .
this kind of discipline and good manners was n't always the norm at the ernst-schering school , where students have earned a reputation for violent behavior , absenteeism and under-achieving .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence was a problem at ernst-schering school the school is situated in a section of berlin dominated by poor immigrant families .
some 85 percent of the school 's children are on free meals , and their parents are often dependent on social welfare .
in spite of his elite academic pedigree , terwitte managed to win the respect of the school 's students . many have even grown fond of him in the seven months he 's spent at the school .
" his music classes are really varied , and always a lot of fun , " said ahed , an 8th grade student .
he also said that terwitte was not just " focused on grades " and listens to the " student 's needs . "
" you can also always approach him with personal things , " said bethlehem , a student from ethiopia .
" he 's one of us because he understands us , " ahed concluded .
but terwitte is not only popular among the school 's students .
the teachers like him too , and do n't regret their decision to apply for a teach first fellow .
" he 's building bridges between the students and the regular teachers , " said marion buerck , a biology and chemistry teacher . buerck called teach first " a wonderful program that should definitely be enlarged . "
' perfect mixture of mind and heart ' under the german teach first program , fellows like terwitte are given two-year contracts that earn them about 1,700 euros -lrb- $ 2,268 -rrb- per month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fellows face a rigid selection process before they are sent to the schools the first 66 fellows were sent to the schools in september 2009 .
they were selected from more than 700 graduates who had initially applied .
" we are looking for the perfect mixture of mind and heart , " said kaija landsberg , the founder of teach first germany .
a graduate of the hertie school of governance in berlin , landsberg wrote her master 's thesis on the problems of integration .
during her studies she came across teach first in britain and teach for america in the united states .
" academic excellence is not enough , " landsberg said .
" what we also need is a high degree of involvement in fields such as social work , cultural initiatives or sports .
applicants must prove they are willing to take leadership positions . "
struggling against the odds landsberg said most of the graduates that apply to teach first were driven by the desire " to give something back to society " after they had received " the privilege of first-class education . "
" what unites us all is the shared belief that more must be done in the education system to serve those who have n't been served so far , " she said .
but teach first has received a lot of criticism from the german teacher 's trade union , which accuses the program of aiming to " de-professionalize " the teaching profession .
the union also questioned the " philanthropic motives " of the graduates .
" we are not lowering any bars , " landsberg says .
" the fellows do n't do the jobs of regular teachers .
it 's just a new way for them to discover the teaching profession , for which they would need additional qualifications anyway . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teach first fellows are used to a different world a different type of leader but turning high-achieving college graduates into teachers is n't the focus of teach first . landsberg says the goal is to make the fellows take what they experienced in the schools " to the next level " of their careers .
" we really need people who have been on the ground and know what it 's about , so they will be to change policies , change companies and change society , " she said .
terwitte said his new job at the ernst-schering school required " a degree of energy unparalleled in his previous life . " he called his endeavor both " taxing and rewarding . "
" sometimes i catch myself thinking : gosh , am i taking more out of this than i 'm able to give to the kids ?
because in many ways i 'm growing , " he said , before adding , " teach first fellows are pre-destined to carry on this work , wherever they go in their future lives . "

" there are question that , ultimately , only the chancellor can answer , " parliamentary committee chairman rainer arnold , from the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , told german daily newspaper bild on saturday , march 27 . arnold was echoing calls by members of the green and left parties , who said on friday that the chancellor should testify before the committee . the demands come after reports earlier in the week that the chancellor 's office had received information that civilians had been killed in a german-ordered airstrike in afghanistan within hours of the event taking place in september 2009 . much of the parliamentary inquiry is focused on who knew what about the bombing and whether knowledge of civilian casualties was kept quiet . e-mail sent to merkel 's office bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up to 142 people were killed in the nato airstrike , with many others injured the german news weekly der spiegel reported on thursday that the country 's foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- sent an e-mail about the attack and causalities to merkel 's office . " many civilians were killed -lrb- numbers vary between 50 and 100 -rrb- , " the email was reported to have read . a spokesman for the government said that the e-mail had been an unconfirmed preliminary report and that the message content had already been handed over to the parliamentary investigation . in addition to arnold 's comments , spd parliamentary speaker thomas oppermann said that the chancellor should have done more , and sooner , to explain the nature of injuries and fatalities caused by the biggest attack involving german troops since the second world war . claims of electioneering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oppermann said the chancellor should have done more to explain , sooner but andreas schockenhoff , the conservative parliamentary group 's vice chairman , rejected the criticism and accused the spd of electioneering tactics ahead of regional voting in the state of north rhine-westphalia . " the claim that angela merkel has not been open about kunduz and its consequences is malicious , " schockenhoff told the german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung . the parliamentary investigation aims to clarify events before and after german colonel georg klein ordered an airstrike on two hijacked fuel tankers .
up to 142 people were killed in the strike , including , it is believed , dozens of civilians . the incident led to a political storm in germany , claiming the jobs of the former minister of defense , franz josef jung , and gemany 's top military officer , wolfgang schneiderhan . rc / dpa / afp / reuters / ap editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the two-day regional elections , which started on sunday , march 28 , are no different . the leader is down in the polls and the votes garnered by his people 's freedom party will partly be viewed as reflecting confidence – or lack thereof – in the prime minister . but berlusconi 's power has long hinged on forming pacts with other parties .
myrta merlino , who hosts a financial program on television called the domino effect , said the elections will also be pivotal for the far-right northern league party , known as the lega in italian . " for the first time , two major regions are likely to go to the lega , " merlino said .
" and if they win , the weight of the lega in the central government will be very , very big .
the northern region will ask to have more money for the efficient regions and less for the south .
and so also for the unity of the country , these elections are important . " resentment against south bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents have accused berlusconi of changing laws for his own benefit the northern league is fiscally conservative , and has long expressed resentment toward southern italy 's dependency on government jobs to keep its population employed .
the lega also has the sympathy of berlusconi 's most powerful minister - finance minister giulio tremonti . the elections are also seen as a test for the left .
years of infighting , ineffective leadership and a series of its own scandals have kept italians from considering the center-left democratic party as a real option . antonio polito , editor of il riformista magazine and a former senator in the southern region of campania , said the regional elections are a chance for the italian left to get the new start it 's looking for . " at the moment , the opposition is unelectable , " polito said .
" if we had general elections now , the center-left would lose .
so the regional elections are an important step to rebuild credibility in the country . " changes in perception and if the left does gain what it 's seeking - more votes and a shift in perception that they could lead italy - it does n't necessarily spell the end of berlusconi . milano finanza magazine editor pierluigi magnaschi said it 's unlikely berlusconi will be going anywhere before the end of his term as prime minister . " i think the end of berlusconi is not near , " said magnaschi .
" he will finish in three years .
after that , the political games are open . " author : megan williams / svs editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the two-day regional elections , which started on sunday , march 28 , are no different . the leader is down in the polls and the votes garnered by his people 's freedom party will partly be viewed as reflecting confidence – or lack thereof – in the prime minister . but berlusconi 's power has long hinged on forming pacts with other parties .
myrta merlino , who hosts a financial program on television called the domino effect , said the elections will also be pivotal for the far-right northern league party , known as the lega in italian . " for the first time , two major regions are likely to go to the lega , " merlino said .
" and if they win , the weight of the lega in the central government will be very , very big .
the northern region will ask to have more money for the efficient regions and less for the south .
and so also for the unity of the country , these elections are important .

the move comes as some other european nations have already opened their doors to former prisoners . according to an interior ministry spokesman , berlin is talking to washington about relocating suitable detainees after they get released from the us-owned guantanamo bay prison in cuba . an unnamed interior ministry official said on saturday , march 27 , that his ministry had " opened talks anew with the united states on this matter . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some prisoners , going home is not an option the discussions were taking place with the approval of the foreign ministry and chancellor angela merkel 's office " on a case-by-case basis , " the official added . meanwhile , the german news magazine " der spiegel " reported that a delegation from berlin recently visited guantanamo to meet with several inmates , including a palestinian , a jordanian and a syrian who are likely candidates for resettlement . spiegel said the delegation , including police and immigration officials , had interviewed the men to assess their suitability and any potential risks if they were to be taken in . risk assessment last year , germany had considered accepting prisoners but later backed off amid concerns that the men could prove dangerous . the interior ministry said on saturday that berlin supported washington 's efforts to close the prison camp and that this had been consistent german policy . spiegel said us special envoy daniel fried had had months of confidential talks last year with the interior ministry , culminating in the handing over of a list of nine candidates .
some of them have since found homes in other nations . the newspaper said the remaining candidates for resettlement included a palestinian from the west bank who was part of a conservative group of imams and had been arrested in pakistan . a jordanian who traveled to afghanistan in the summer of 2001 was also on the list as was a syrian , who had been treated at a kabul hospital at the end of 2001 , and was arrested shortly after his discharge .
the united states wants to release all three men . bildunterschrift : prisoners who are no longer regarded as enemy combatants are eligible for release missed deadline president barack obama 's administration has been reluctant to send some guantanamo prisoners back to their home countries because they might suffer reprisal after being held in us custody . obama had pledged to close down the guantanamo camp by january this year , but some 200 detainees continue to be held there as finding them new homes is proving difficult . european countries are divided over whether to accept freed guantanamo detainees : while most appear reluctant , some have openly expressed support . last week , two chinese uighur men who were released from the detention camp in cuba arrived in switzerland .
in february , the first of five inmates slated to be accepted by spain arrived in madrid . rb / dpa / ap editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 28.03.2010 teach first makes the grade in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teach first fellows are eager to leave mark at problem schools modeled on similar programs in britain and the us , teach first germany attracts high-achieving graduates to challenged schools , aiming to change attitudes and improve society . on a cold thursday morning in march , johannes terwitte is in charge of ensuring schoolyard discipline at the ernst-schering school in berlin 's wedding district .
the 25-year-old graduate of oxford university and the hertie school of governance in berlin was watching a bunch of youngsters enjoying a game of basketball in a break between morning classes .
terwitte is one of 66 high-achieving college graduates who were sent to problem schools in september 2009 under a program run by teach first germany - a not-for-profit charity founded four years ago .
" this brings you to a new level . it 's like a consulting job that requires 70- or 80-hour work weeks , " he said .
' he 's one of us ' during the break , a 14-year-old student of german-turkish origin asks terwitte politely if he can go to the school 's office to check on his next classes .
this kind of discipline and good manners was n't always the norm at the ernst-schering school , where students have earned a reputation for violent behavior , absenteeism and under-achieving .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence was a problem at ernst-schering school the school is situated in a section of berlin dominated by poor immigrant families .
some 85 percent of the school 's children are on free meals , and their parents are often dependent on social welfare .
in spite of his elite academic pedigree , terwitte managed to win the respect of the school 's students . many have even grown fond of him in the seven months he 's spent at the school .
" his music classes are really varied , and always a lot of fun , " said ahed , an 8th grade student .
he also said that terwitte was not just " focused on grades " and listens to the " student 's needs . "
" you can also always approach him with personal things , " said bethlehem , a student from ethiopia .
" he 's one of us because he understands us , " ahed concluded .
but terwitte is not only popular among the school 's students .
the teachers like him too , and do n't regret their decision to apply for a teach first fellow .
" he 's building bridges between the students and the regular teachers , " said marion buerck , a biology and chemistry teacher . buerck called teach first " a wonderful program that should definitely be enlarged . "
' perfect mixture of mind and heart ' under the german teach first program , fellows like terwitte are given two-year contracts that earn them about 1,700 euros -lrb- $ 2,268 -rrb- per month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fellows face a rigid selection process before they are sent to the schools the first 66 fellows were sent to the schools in september 2009 .
they were selected from more than 700 graduates who had initially applied .
" we are looking for the perfect mixture of mind and heart , " said kaija landsberg , the founder of teach first germany .
a graduate of the hertie school of governance in berlin , landsberg wrote her master 's thesis on the problems of integration .
during her studies she came across teach first in britain and teach for america in the united states .
" academic excellence is not enough , " landsberg said .
" what we also need is a high degree of involvement in fields such as social work , cultural initiatives or sports .
applicants must prove they are willing to take leadership positions . "
struggling against the odds landsberg said most of the graduates that apply to teach first were driven by the desire " to give something back to society " after they had received " the privilege of first-class education . "
" what unites us all is the shared belief that more must be done in the education system to serve those who have n't been served so far , " she said .
but teach first has received a lot of criticism from the german teacher 's trade union , which accuses the program of aiming to " de-professionalize " the teaching profession .
the union also questioned the " philanthropic motives " of the graduates .
" we are not lowering any bars , " landsberg says .
" the fellows do n't do the jobs of regular teachers .
it 's just a new way for them to discover the teaching profession , for which they would need additional qualifications anyway . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teach first fellows are used to a different world a different type of leader but turning high-achieving college graduates into teachers is n't the focus of teach first . landsberg says the goal is to make the fellows take what they experienced in the schools " to the next level " of their careers .
" we really need people who have been on the ground and know what it 's about , so they will be to change policies , change companies and change society , " she said .
terwitte said his new job at the ernst-schering school required " a degree of energy unparalleled in his previous life . " he called his endeavor both " taxing and rewarding . "
" sometimes i catch myself thinking : gosh , am i taking more out of this than i 'm able to give to the kids ?
because in many ways i 'm growing , " he said , before adding , " teach first fellows are pre-destined to carry on this work , wherever they go in their future lives . "

abuse allegations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did the pope turn a blind eye to abuse allegations ?
most of the sex abuse scandals which have come to light recently in germany have focused on the catholic church , and the employment of a convicted pedophile priest in 1980 in the city of munich when joseph ratzinger – now pope benedict xvi – served his term as archbishop .
some have questioned whether the pope played a role in the alleged cover-up of some abuse cases .
meanwhile , secular and protestant groups have admitted they also failed in that era to adequately police pedophile attacks on children in care .
last week , germany appointed a special ombudsman to receive and investigate allegations of sex molestation dating from the 1950s in catholic and other private schools .
christine bergmann , a former german minister of family affairs , is tasked with studying cases that happened too long ago to be investigated by police .
germany does not prosecute child sex abuse after the victim turns 28 .

the school says 33 ex-pupils have reported they were sexually abused in the period from 1966 to 1991 .
philipp sturz , one of the school 's 30 trustees , declined to confirm a report in the news magazine " der spiegel " that 40 ex-pupils had lodged complaints and more ex-teachers had been named in the scandal .
abuse allegations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did the pope turn a blind eye to abuse allegations ?
most of the sex abuse scandals which have come to light recently in germany have focused on the catholic church , and the employment of a convicted pedophile priest in 1980 in the city of munich when joseph ratzinger – now pope benedict xvi – served his term as archbishop .
some have questioned whether the pope played a role in the alleged cover-up of some abuse cases .
meanwhile , secular and protestant groups have admitted they also failed in that era to adequately police pedophile attacks on children in care .
last week , germany appointed a special ombudsman to receive and investigate allegations of sex molestation dating from the 1950s in catholic and other private schools .
christine bergmann , a former german minister of family affairs , is tasked with studying cases that happened too long ago to be investigated by police .
germany does not prosecute child sex abuse after the victim turns 28 .
a spate of revelations of abuse and cruelty by clerics and evidence of a cover-up by the church hierarchy has also emerged in other european countries like ireland , austria , the netherlands and switzerland , as well as in the united states. rb / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move came after spain , which holds the eu presidency , said the names of libyans had been removed from a swiss-instigated visa blacklist . spain 's foreign ministry announced in a statement on saturday that the visa blacklist against 188 libyans had been torn up and expressed regret as part of a diplomatic drive by european union leaders .
the foreign ministry in madrid expressed said it " deplored " the problems that the ban had caused to libyans .
the ban was imposed on the initiative of switzerland , which has been embroiled in a long-standing diplomatic row with libya .
tripoli responded in kind by putting out a communiqué .
" in the interests of strengthening its cooperation with the european union , libya lifts the restrictions it earlier imposed on the citizens of the schengen zone , " the libyan foreign ministry said in a statement published by the state news agency jana , referring to the 25-nation visa-free zone in europe .
switzerland is part of the schengen zone but not a member of the 27-nation eu .

the crisis assumed an eu-wide dimension earlier this year , with the swiss travel ban and a tit-for-tat prohibition by libya , which said it would stop issuing visas to citizens from all schengen-area countries .
the swiss move not only infuriated libya , but also schengen states which saw it as an unjustified escalation of a bilateral row .
the schengen area is a grouping of all eu countries except britain , ireland , cyprus , bulgaria and romania , plus non-eu members switzerland , norway and iceland .
the diplomatic feud between switzerland and libya also escalated following a swiss referendum decision in november last year to ban the construction of minarets in the country . in february , gaddafi had condemned the minaret ban and called for a " jihad " or holy war against switzerland. rb / afp / reuters / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move came after spain , which holds the eu presidency , said the names of libyans had been removed from a swiss-instigated visa blacklist . spain 's foreign ministry announced in a statement on saturday that the visa blacklist against 188 libyans had been torn up and expressed regret as part of a diplomatic drive by european union leaders .
the foreign ministry in madrid expressed said it " deplored " the problems that the ban had caused to libyans .
the ban was imposed on the initiative of switzerland , which has been embroiled in a long-standing diplomatic row with libya .
tripoli responded in kind by putting out a communiqué .
" in the interests of strengthening its cooperation with the european union , libya lifts the restrictions it earlier imposed on the citizens of the schengen zone , " the libyan foreign ministry said in a statement published by the state news agency jana , referring to the 25-nation visa-free zone in europe .
switzerland is part of the schengen zone but not a member of the 27-nation eu .
libya had insisted on the eu apologizing for the row , something that spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos had agreed to during a recent visit to tripoli , according to the libyan ambassador to spain .
last week , switzerland said that it was prepared to lift the ban it had imposed in january on libyan officials , including leader moamer gaddafi , for entry into the schengen zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gaddafi had called for a jihad against switzerland after the swiss ban on minarets strife escalates the spat between libya and switzerland dates back to 2008 , when gaddafi 's son , hannibal , was arrested in geneva , allegedly for mistreating his domestic help .
the charges were later dropped but tripoli retaliated by arresting two swiss men on visa charges .
the crisis assumed an eu-wide dimension earlier this year , with the swiss travel ban and a tit-for-tat prohibition by libya , which said it would stop issuing visas to citizens from all schengen-area countries .
the swiss move not only infuriated libya , but also schengen states which saw it as an unjustified escalation of a bilateral row .
the schengen area is a grouping of all eu countries except britain , ireland , cyprus , bulgaria and romania , plus non-eu members switzerland , norway and iceland .
the diplomatic feud between switzerland and libya also escalated following a swiss referendum decision in november last year to ban the construction of minarets in the country . in february , gaddafi had condemned the minaret ban and called for a " jihad " or holy war against switzerland. rb / afp / reuters / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal to buy the struggling swedish company has been two years in the making . after two years of negotiations , a deal has been signed by china 's zhejiang geely holding group that confirms its takeover of volvo .
volvo had been a part of the american ford motor group since 1999 .
the takeover deal was signed by ford 's financial director lewis booth and geely 's president li shufu on sunday at volvo 's headquarters in gothenburg , sweden .
geely gets a bargain the reported price tag of volvo is around $ 1.8 billion -lrb- 1.35 billion euros -rrb- , considerably less than the $ 6.4 billion ford paid for volvo in 1999 .
that would make it the biggest purchase by a chinese car manufacturer .

the 25-year-old graduate of oxford university and the hertie school of governance in berlin was watching a bunch of youngsters enjoying a game of basketball in a break between morning classes .
terwitte is one of 66 high-achieving college graduates who were sent to problem schools in september 2009 under a program run by teach first germany - a not-for-profit charity founded four years ago .
" this brings you to a new level . it 's like a consulting job that requires 70- or 80-hour work weeks , " he said .
' he 's one of us ' during the break , a 14-year-old student of german-turkish origin asks terwitte politely if he can go to the school 's office to check on his next classes .
this kind of discipline and good manners was n't always the norm at the ernst-schering school , where students have earned a reputation for violent behavior , absenteeism and under-achieving .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence was a problem at ernst-schering school the school is situated in a section of berlin dominated by poor immigrant families .
some 85 percent of the school 's children are on free meals , and their parents are often dependent on social welfare .
in spite of his elite academic pedigree , terwitte managed to win the respect of the school 's students . many have even grown fond of him in the seven months he 's spent at the school .
" his music classes are really varied , and always a lot of fun , " said ahed , an 8th grade student .
he also said that terwitte was not just " focused on grades " and listens to the " student 's needs . "
" you can also always approach him with personal things , " said bethlehem , a student from ethiopia .
" he 's one of us because he understands us , " ahed concluded .
but terwitte is not only popular among the school 's students .
the teachers like him too , and do n't regret their decision to apply for a teach first fellow .
" he 's building bridges between the students and the regular teachers , " said marion buerck , a biology and chemistry teacher . buerck called teach first " a wonderful program that should definitely be enlarged . "
' perfect mixture of mind and heart ' under the german teach first program , fellows like terwitte are given two-year contracts that earn them about 1,700 euros -lrb- $ 2,268 -rrb- per month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fellows face a rigid selection process before they are sent to the schools the first 66 fellows were sent to the schools in september 2009 .
they were selected from more than 700 graduates who had initially applied .
" we are looking for the perfect mixture of mind and heart , " said kaija landsberg , the founder of teach first germany .
a graduate of the hertie school of governance in berlin , landsberg wrote her master 's thesis on the problems of integration .
during her studies she came across teach first in britain and teach for america in the united states .
" academic excellence is not enough , " landsberg said .
" what we also need is a high degree of involvement in fields such as social work , cultural initiatives or sports .
applicants must prove they are willing to take leadership positions . "
struggling against the odds landsberg said most of the graduates that apply to teach first were driven by the desire " to give something back to society " after they had received " the privilege of first-class education . "
" what unites us all is the shared belief that more must be done in the education system to serve those who have n't been served so far , " she said .
but teach first has received a lot of criticism from the german teacher 's trade union , which accuses the program of aiming to " de-professionalize " the teaching profession .
the union also questioned the " philanthropic motives " of the graduates .
" we are not lowering any bars , " landsberg says .
" the fellows do n't do the jobs of regular teachers .
it 's just a new way for them to discover the teaching profession , for which they would need additional qualifications anyway . "

as more nations lobby to have their say in world affairs , the g-8 faces a future of reduced influence and relevance . foreign ministers from the group of eight -lrb- g-8 -rrb- major countries gather in the resort city of gatineau in quebec , canada on march 29-30 to lay the groundwork for the g-8 summit meeting to be held in muskoka , ontario , in june .
during the two-day talks , the ministers from britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states will discuss a number of issues , including nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament , how to ensure peace and stability on the volatile afghanistan-pakistan border , and the consequences of terrorism and how to support nations with security vulnerabilities .
the g-8 summit in ontario on june 25-26 is shaping up to be a particularly important one , and not just because of the fluid nature of the global challenges the organization is currently facing .
while matters such as the nuclear ambitions of iran and north korea , the instability in the afghan-pakistan border regions and the threat of international terrorism are undoubtedly more pressing now than they were at the last annual summit in l 'aquila , italy in 2009 , the ontario summit could be a historic one in itself .

driven by its role in addressing the impact of the global economic crisis , the g-20 organization - finance ministers and central bank governors from the world 's top 20 economies - is being viewed by some as the dominant power bloc in a new era of global governance .

" " as with other institutions of global governance , like the united nations , it became clear that the structure of the g-8 does not reflect global realities enough , " he added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de global governance -pipe- 28.03.2010 as g-20 expands its influence , g-8 faces reduced role 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-8 is seeing its influence wane in certain policy areas the shift towards an era of global governance appears to be driven by the expanding power of the g-20 .
as more nations lobby to have their say in world affairs , the g-8 faces a future of reduced influence and relevance . foreign ministers from the group of eight -lrb- g-8 -rrb- major countries gather in the resort city of gatineau in quebec , canada on march 29-30 to lay the groundwork for the g-8 summit meeting to be held in muskoka , ontario , in june .
during the two-day talks , the ministers from britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states will discuss a number of issues , including nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament , how to ensure peace and stability on the volatile afghanistan-pakistan border , and the consequences of terrorism and how to support nations with security vulnerabilities .
the g-8 summit in ontario on june 25-26 is shaping up to be a particularly important one , and not just because of the fluid nature of the global challenges the organization is currently facing .
while matters such as the nuclear ambitions of iran and north korea , the instability in the afghan-pakistan border regions and the threat of international terrorism are undoubtedly more pressing now than they were at the last annual summit in l 'aquila , italy in 2009 , the ontario summit could be a historic one in itself .
some observers have suggested it may be the g-8 's last .
driven by its role in addressing the impact of the global economic crisis , the g-20 organization - finance ministers and central bank governors from the world 's top 20 economies - is being viewed by some as the dominant power bloc in a new era of global governance .
the g-8 has served in various forms as the world 's leading economic forum since 1975 but at its summit in pittsburgh in september 2009 , the g-20 announced that its leaders had " endorsed the g-20 as the premier forum for their international economic cooperation . "
financial crisis exposed g-8 's limitations bildunterschrift : the g-20 's global inclusiveness in addressing the economic crisis showed up the g-8 's limitations while the g-8 focuses more on issues such as security and climate change and leaves its economic and financial policy to the g-7 - essentially the finance ministers of the g-8 minus russia - the rise of the g-20 and the expansion of its powers has some experts wondering how long the g-8 and g-7 can survive in the face of an increasingly influential , more inclusive global decision-making body . " the g-8 - if it survives at all - will be a much less powerful gathering and for a very good reason , " dr. henning meyer , head of the european programme at the global policy institute in london , told deutsche welle . " in the wake of the financial crisis everybody could witness the level of interdependence in the world .
and it became clear that a political structure that excludes important rising countries such as india , china and brazil simply does not have the scope to deal with those global issues . " " as with other institutions of global governance , like the united nations , it became clear that the structure of the g-8 does not reflect global realities enough , " he added . " if global problems of the magnitude of the financial crisis persist , which is very likely , then the real power of the g-8 will permanently shift to the g-20 or some other form of broader political structure .

only the school principal margarita kaufmann and general manager meto salijevic remain in office following the meeting on saturday , march 27 .
the school says 33 ex-pupils have reported they were sexually abused in the period from 1966 to 1991 .
philipp sturz , one of the school 's 30 trustees , declined to confirm a report in the news magazine " der spiegel " that 40 ex-pupils had lodged complaints and more ex-teachers had been named in the scandal .
abuse allegations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did the pope turn a blind eye to abuse allegations ?
most of the sex abuse scandals which have come to light recently in germany have focused on the catholic church , and the employment of a convicted pedophile priest in 1980 in the city of munich when joseph ratzinger – now pope benedict xvi – served his term as archbishop .
some have questioned whether the pope played a role in the alleged cover-up of some abuse cases .
meanwhile , secular and protestant groups have admitted they also failed in that era to adequately police pedophile attacks on children in care .
last week , germany appointed a special ombudsman to receive and investigate allegations of sex molestation dating from the 1950s in catholic and other private schools .
christine bergmann , a former german minister of family affairs , is tasked with studying cases that happened too long ago to be investigated by police .
germany does not prosecute child sex abuse after the victim turns 28 .
a spate of revelations of abuse and cruelty by clerics and evidence of a cover-up by the church hierarchy has also emerged in other european countries like ireland , austria , the netherlands and switzerland , as well as in the united states. rb / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 25-year-old graduate of oxford university and the hertie school of governance in berlin was watching a bunch of youngsters enjoying a game of basketball in a break between morning classes .
terwitte is one of 66 high-achieving college graduates who were sent to problem schools in september 2009 under a program run by teach first germany - a not-for-profit charity founded four years ago .
" this brings you to a new level . it 's like a consulting job that requires 70- or 80-hour work weeks , " he said .
' he 's one of us ' during the break , a 14-year-old student of german-turkish origin asks terwitte politely if he can go to the school 's office to check on his next classes .
this kind of discipline and good manners was n't always the norm at the ernst-schering school , where students have earned a reputation for violent behavior , absenteeism and under-achieving .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence was a problem at ernst-schering school the school is situated in a section of berlin dominated by poor immigrant families .
some 85 percent of the school 's children are on free meals , and their parents are often dependent on social welfare .
in spite of his elite academic pedigree , terwitte managed to win the respect of the school 's students . many have even grown fond of him in the seven months he 's spent at the school .
" his music classes are really varied , and always a lot of fun , " said ahed , an 8th grade student .
he also said that terwitte was not just " focused on grades " and listens to the " student 's needs . "
" you can also always approach him with personal things , " said bethlehem , a student from ethiopia .
" he 's one of us because he understands us , " ahed concluded .
but terwitte is not only popular among the school 's students .
the teachers like him too , and do n't regret their decision to apply for a teach first fellow .
" he 's building bridges between the students and the regular teachers , " said marion buerck , a biology and chemistry teacher . buerck called teach first " a wonderful program that should definitely be enlarged . "
' perfect mixture of mind and heart ' under the german teach first program , fellows like terwitte are given two-year contracts that earn them about 1,700 euros -lrb- $ 2,268 -rrb- per month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fellows face a rigid selection process before they are sent to the schools the first 66 fellows were sent to the schools in september 2009 .
they were selected from more than 700 graduates who had initially applied .
" we are looking for the perfect mixture of mind and heart , " said kaija landsberg , the founder of teach first germany .
a graduate of the hertie school of governance in berlin , landsberg wrote her master 's thesis on the problems of integration .
during her studies she came across teach first in britain and teach for america in the united states .
" academic excellence is not enough , " landsberg said .
" what we also need is a high degree of involvement in fields such as social work , cultural initiatives or sports .
applicants must prove they are willing to take leadership positions . "
struggling against the odds landsberg said most of the graduates that apply to teach first were driven by the desire " to give something back to society " after they had received " the privilege of first-class education . "
" what unites us all is the shared belief that more must be done in the education system to serve those who have n't been served so far , " she said .
but teach first has received a lot of criticism from the german teacher 's trade union , which accuses the program of aiming to " de-professionalize " the teaching profession .
the union also questioned the " philanthropic motives " of the graduates .
" we are not lowering any bars , " landsberg says .
" the fellows do n't do the jobs of regular teachers .
it 's just a new way for them to discover the teaching profession , for which they would need additional qualifications anyway . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teach first fellows are used to a different world a different type of leader but turning high-achieving college graduates into teachers is n't the focus of teach first . landsberg says the goal is to make the fellows take what they experienced in the schools " to the next level " of their careers .
" we really need people who have been on the ground and know what it 's about , so they will be to change policies , change companies and change society , " she said .
terwitte said his new job at the ernst-schering school required " a degree of energy unparalleled in his previous life . " he called his endeavor both " taxing and rewarding . "
" sometimes i catch myself thinking : gosh , am i taking more out of this than i 'm able to give to the kids ?
because in many ways i 'm growing , " he said , before adding , " teach first fellows are pre-destined to carry on this work , wherever they go in their future lives . "

the move came after spain , which holds the eu presidency , said the names of libyans had been removed from a swiss-instigated visa blacklist . spain 's foreign ministry announced in a statement on saturday that the visa blacklist against 188 libyans had been torn up and expressed regret as part of a diplomatic drive by european union leaders .
the foreign ministry in madrid expressed said it " deplored " the problems that the ban had caused to libyans .
the ban was imposed on the initiative of switzerland , which has been embroiled in a long-standing diplomatic row with libya .
tripoli responded in kind by putting out a communiqué .
" in the interests of strengthening its cooperation with the european union , libya lifts the restrictions it earlier imposed on the citizens of the schengen zone , " the libyan foreign ministry said in a statement published by the state news agency jana , referring to the 25-nation visa-free zone in europe .
switzerland is part of the schengen zone but not a member of the 27-nation eu .
libya had insisted on the eu apologizing for the row , something that spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos had agreed to during a recent visit to tripoli , according to the libyan ambassador to spain .
last week , switzerland said that it was prepared to lift the ban it had imposed in january on libyan officials , including leader moamer gaddafi , for entry into the schengen zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gaddafi had called for a jihad against switzerland after the swiss ban on minarets strife escalates the spat between libya and switzerland dates back to 2008 , when gaddafi 's son , hannibal , was arrested in geneva , allegedly for mistreating his domestic help .
the charges were later dropped but tripoli retaliated by arresting two swiss men on visa charges .
the crisis assumed an eu-wide dimension earlier this year , with the swiss travel ban and a tit-for-tat prohibition by libya , which said it would stop issuing visas to citizens from all schengen-area countries .
the swiss move not only infuriated libya , but also schengen states which saw it as an unjustified escalation of a bilateral row .
the schengen area is a grouping of all eu countries except britain , ireland , cyprus , bulgaria and romania , plus non-eu members switzerland , norway and iceland .
the diplomatic feud between switzerland and libya also escalated following a swiss referendum decision in november last year to ban the construction of minarets in the country . in february , gaddafi had condemned the minaret ban and called for a " jihad " or holy war against switzerland. rb / afp / reuters / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move comes as some other european nations have already opened their doors to former prisoners . according to an interior ministry spokesman , berlin is talking to washington about relocating suitable detainees after they get released from the us-owned guantanamo bay prison in cuba . an unnamed interior ministry official said on saturday , march 27 , that his ministry had " opened talks anew with the united states on this matter . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some prisoners , going home is not an option the discussions were taking place with the approval of the foreign ministry and chancellor angela merkel 's office " on a case-by-case basis , " the official added . meanwhile , the german news magazine " der spiegel " reported that a delegation from berlin recently visited guantanamo to meet with several inmates , including a palestinian , a jordanian and a syrian who are likely candidates for resettlement . spiegel said the delegation , including police and immigration officials , had interviewed the men to assess their suitability and any potential risks if they were to be taken in . risk assessment last year , germany had considered accepting prisoners but later backed off amid concerns that the men could prove dangerous . the interior ministry said on saturday that berlin supported washington 's efforts to close the prison camp and that this had been consistent german policy . spiegel said us special envoy daniel fried had had months of confidential talks last year with the interior ministry , culminating in the handing over of a list of nine candidates .
some of them have since found homes in other nations . the newspaper said the remaining candidates for resettlement included a palestinian from the west bank who was part of a conservative group of imams and had been arrested in pakistan . a jordanian who traveled to afghanistan in the summer of 2001 was also on the list as was a syrian , who had been treated at a kabul hospital at the end of 2001 , and was arrested shortly after his discharge .
the united states wants to release all three men . bildunterschrift : prisoners who are no longer regarded as enemy combatants are eligible for release missed deadline president barack obama 's administration has been reluctant to send some guantanamo prisoners back to their home countries because they might suffer reprisal after being held in us custody . obama had pledged to close down the guantanamo camp by january this year , but some 200 detainees continue to be held there as finding them new homes is proving difficult . european countries are divided over whether to accept freed guantanamo detainees : while most appear reluctant , some have openly expressed support . last week , two chinese uighur men who were released from the detention camp in cuba arrived in switzerland .

the move came after spain , which holds the eu presidency , said the names of libyans had been removed from a swiss-instigated visa blacklist . spain 's foreign ministry announced in a statement on saturday that the visa blacklist against 188 libyans had been torn up and expressed regret as part of a diplomatic drive by european union leaders .
the foreign ministry in madrid expressed said it " deplored " the problems that the ban had caused to libyans .
the ban was imposed on the initiative of switzerland , which has been embroiled in a long-standing diplomatic row with libya .
tripoli responded in kind by putting out a communiqué .
" in the interests of strengthening its cooperation with the european union , libya lifts the restrictions it earlier imposed on the citizens of the schengen zone , " the libyan foreign ministry said in a statement published by the state news agency jana , referring to the 25-nation visa-free zone in europe .
switzerland is part of the schengen zone but not a member of the 27-nation eu .
libya had insisted on the eu apologizing for the row , something that spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos had agreed to during a recent visit to tripoli , according to the libyan ambassador to spain .
last week , switzerland said that it was prepared to lift the ban it had imposed in january on libyan officials , including leader moamer gaddafi , for entry into the schengen zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gaddafi had called for a jihad against switzerland after the swiss ban on minarets strife escalates the spat between libya and switzerland dates back to 2008 , when gaddafi 's son , hannibal , was arrested in geneva , allegedly for mistreating his domestic help .
the charges were later dropped but tripoli retaliated by arresting two swiss men on visa charges .
the crisis assumed an eu-wide dimension earlier this year , with the swiss travel ban and a tit-for-tat prohibition by libya , which said it would stop issuing visas to citizens from all schengen-area countries .
the swiss move not only infuriated libya , but also schengen states which saw it as an unjustified escalation of a bilateral row .
the schengen area is a grouping of all eu countries except britain , ireland , cyprus , bulgaria and romania , plus non-eu members switzerland , norway and iceland .
the diplomatic feud between switzerland and libya also escalated following a swiss referendum decision in november last year to ban the construction of minarets in the country . in february , gaddafi had condemned the minaret ban and called for a " jihad " or holy war against switzerland. rb / afp / reuters / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 25-year-old graduate of oxford university and the hertie school of governance in berlin was watching a bunch of youngsters enjoying a game of basketball in a break between morning classes .
terwitte is one of 66 high-achieving college graduates who were sent to problem schools in september 2009 under a program run by teach first germany - a not-for-profit charity founded four years ago .
" this brings you to a new level . it 's like a consulting job that requires 70- or 80-hour work weeks , " he said .
' he 's one of us ' during the break , a 14-year-old student of german-turkish origin asks terwitte politely if he can go to the school 's office to check on his next classes .
this kind of discipline and good manners was n't always the norm at the ernst-schering school , where students have earned a reputation for violent behavior , absenteeism and under-achieving .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence was a problem at ernst-schering school the school is situated in a section of berlin dominated by poor immigrant families .
some 85 percent of the school 's children are on free meals , and their parents are often dependent on social welfare .
in spite of his elite academic pedigree , terwitte managed to win the respect of the school 's students . many have even grown fond of him in the seven months he 's spent at the school .
" his music classes are really varied , and always a lot of fun , " said ahed , an 8th grade student .
he also said that terwitte was not just " focused on grades " and listens to the " student 's needs . "
" you can also always approach him with personal things , " said bethlehem , a student from ethiopia .
" he 's one of us because he understands us , " ahed concluded .
but terwitte is not only popular among the school 's students .
the teachers like him too , and do n't regret their decision to apply for a teach first fellow .
" he 's building bridges between the students and the regular teachers , " said marion buerck , a biology and chemistry teacher . buerck called teach first " a wonderful program that should definitely be enlarged . "
' perfect mixture of mind and heart ' under the german teach first program , fellows like terwitte are given two-year contracts that earn them about 1,700 euros -lrb- $ 2,268 -rrb- per month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fellows face a rigid selection process before they are sent to the schools the first 66 fellows were sent to the schools in september 2009 .
they were selected from more than 700 graduates who had initially applied .
" we are looking for the perfect mixture of mind and heart , " said kaija landsberg , the founder of teach first germany .
a graduate of the hertie school of governance in berlin , landsberg wrote her master 's thesis on the problems of integration .
during her studies she came across teach first in britain and teach for america in the united states .
" academic excellence is not enough , " landsberg said .
" what we also need is a high degree of involvement in fields such as social work , cultural initiatives or sports .
applicants must prove they are willing to take leadership positions . "
struggling against the odds landsberg said most of the graduates that apply to teach first were driven by the desire " to give something back to society " after they had received " the privilege of first-class education . "
" what unites us all is the shared belief that more must be done in the education system to serve those who have n't been served so far , " she said .
but teach first has received a lot of criticism from the german teacher 's trade union , which accuses the program of aiming to " de-professionalize " the teaching profession .
the union also questioned the " philanthropic motives " of the graduates .
" we are not lowering any bars , " landsberg says .
" the fellows do n't do the jobs of regular teachers .
it 's just a new way for them to discover the teaching profession , for which they would need additional qualifications anyway . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teach first fellows are used to a different world a different type of leader but turning high-achieving college graduates into teachers is n't the focus of teach first . landsberg says the goal is to make the fellows take what they experienced in the schools " to the next level " of their careers .
" we really need people who have been on the ground and know what it 's about , so they will be to change policies , change companies and change society , " she said .
terwitte said his new job at the ernst-schering school required " a degree of energy unparalleled in his previous life . " he called his endeavor both " taxing and rewarding . "
" sometimes i catch myself thinking : gosh , am i taking more out of this than i 'm able to give to the kids ?
because in many ways i 'm growing , " he said , before adding , " teach first fellows are pre-destined to carry on this work , wherever they go in their future lives . "

the 25-year-old graduate of oxford university and the hertie school of governance in berlin was watching a bunch of youngsters enjoying a game of basketball in a break between morning classes .
terwitte is one of 66 high-achieving college graduates who were sent to problem schools in september 2009 under a program run by teach first germany - a not-for-profit charity founded four years ago .
" this brings you to a new level . it 's like a consulting job that requires 70- or 80-hour work weeks , " he said .
' he 's one of us ' during the break , a 14-year-old student of german-turkish origin asks terwitte politely if he can go to the school 's office to check on his next classes .
this kind of discipline and good manners was n't always the norm at the ernst-schering school , where students have earned a reputation for violent behavior , absenteeism and under-achieving .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence was a problem at ernst-schering school the school is situated in a section of berlin dominated by poor immigrant families .
some 85 percent of the school 's children are on free meals , and their parents are often dependent on social welfare .
in spite of his elite academic pedigree , terwitte managed to win the respect of the school 's students . many have even grown fond of him in the seven months he 's spent at the school .
" his music classes are really varied , and always a lot of fun , " said ahed , an 8th grade student .
he also said that terwitte was not just " focused on grades " and listens to the " student 's needs . "
" you can also always approach him with personal things , " said bethlehem , a student from ethiopia .
" he 's one of us because he understands us , " ahed concluded .
but terwitte is not only popular among the school 's students .
the teachers like him too , and do n't regret their decision to apply for a teach first fellow .
" he 's building bridges between the students and the regular teachers , " said marion buerck , a biology and chemistry teacher . buerck called teach first " a wonderful program that should definitely be enlarged . "
' perfect mixture of mind and heart ' under the german teach first program , fellows like terwitte are given two-year contracts that earn them about 1,700 euros -lrb- $ 2,268 -rrb- per month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fellows face a rigid selection process before they are sent to the schools the first 66 fellows were sent to the schools in september 2009 .
they were selected from more than 700 graduates who had initially applied .
" we are looking for the perfect mixture of mind and heart , " said kaija landsberg , the founder of teach first germany .
a graduate of the hertie school of governance in berlin , landsberg wrote her master 's thesis on the problems of integration .
during her studies she came across teach first in britain and teach for america in the united states .
" academic excellence is not enough , " landsberg said .
" what we also need is a high degree of involvement in fields such as social work , cultural initiatives or sports .
applicants must prove they are willing to take leadership positions . "
struggling against the odds landsberg said most of the graduates that apply to teach first were driven by the desire " to give something back to society " after they had received " the privilege of first-class education . "
" what unites us all is the shared belief that more must be done in the education system to serve those who have n't been served so far , " she said .
but teach first has received a lot of criticism from the german teacher 's trade union , which accuses the program of aiming to " de-professionalize " the teaching profession .
the union also questioned the " philanthropic motives " of the graduates .
" we are not lowering any bars , " landsberg says .
" the fellows do n't do the jobs of regular teachers .
it 's just a new way for them to discover the teaching profession , for which they would need additional qualifications anyway . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teach first fellows are used to a different world a different type of leader but turning high-achieving college graduates into teachers is n't the focus of teach first . landsberg says the goal is to make the fellows take what they experienced in the schools " to the next level " of their careers .
" we really need people who have been on the ground and know what it 's about , so they will be to change policies , change companies and change society , " she said .
terwitte said his new job at the ernst-schering school required " a degree of energy unparalleled in his previous life . " he called his endeavor both " taxing and rewarding . "
" sometimes i catch myself thinking : gosh , am i taking more out of this than i 'm able to give to the kids ?
because in many ways i 'm growing , " he said , before adding , " teach first fellows are pre-destined to carry on this work , wherever they go in their future lives . "

" on certain areas of finance , development , energy and climate change , both organizations have played a role but economic and financial issues will be taken up more and more by the g-20 , " she told deutsche welle . it is also likely that the g-20 wo n't limit its growing influence to purely economic matters , which could marginalise the g-8 even more .
the g-20 has recently expanded its reach into financing development projects - prompted by the earthquake in haiti - and has started to play a larger role on issues such as energy and climate change , and in particular climate financing . g-8 likely to remain influential on climate , development bildunterschrift : the g-8 will still take the lead on climate change and development policy but will need the g-20 's help guebert believes that while the g-20 's influence will continue to grow in areas which are traditionally within the remit of the g-8 , the group of eight will maintain a strong role in climate policy making and establishing development mechanisms while accepting that the g-20 's involvement is necessary . " on the issue of climate change , the g-8 has long realized that there are key countries , who are members of the g-20 , that need to be included in the debate , " she said .
" however , the g-8 will likely continue to discuss the topic as well and make commitments on issues where the g-8 can come to consensus . " " development issues including global health , food security , water and sanitation and development assistance will continue to play an important role on the g-8 agenda . " group of eight will still lead on security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-8 will still handle security but it is still not the best option the g-8 is also likely to continue to take the lead on issues which fit better on its agenda , such as political security issues including counter-terrorism , nuclear non-proliferation , and the promotion of democracy and good governance .
the fact that not all members of the g-20 are democratic or have the capability or will to provide assistance to other countries makes these issues difficult to discuss in the broader g-20 . however , henning meyer believes that neither the g-8 or the g-20 are equipped to tackle security issues . " the most important aspect of multilateral-governance structures is that all or most relevant players are included in the same process , " he said . " neither the g-8 nor the g-20 in my view are suited to deal with security issues or non-proliferation .
this is the job of the un .
the g-8 or g-20 in effect are just formalized regular meetings where governments consult .

" on certain areas of finance , development , energy and climate change , both organizations have played a role but economic and financial issues will be taken up more and more by the g-20 , " she told deutsche welle . it is also likely that the g-20 wo n't limit its growing influence to purely economic matters , which could marginalise the g-8 even more .
the g-20 has recently expanded its reach into financing development projects - prompted by the earthquake in haiti - and has started to play a larger role on issues such as energy and climate change , and in particular climate financing . g-8 likely to remain influential on climate , development bildunterschrift : the g-8 will still take the lead on climate change and development policy but will need the g-20 's help guebert believes that while the g-20 's influence will continue to grow in areas which are traditionally within the remit of the g-8 , the group of eight will maintain a strong role in climate policy making and establishing development mechanisms while accepting that the g-20 's involvement is necessary . " on the issue of climate change , the g-8 has long realized that there are key countries , who are members of the g-20 , that need to be included in the debate , " she said .
" however , the g-8 will likely continue to discuss the topic as well and make commitments on issues where the g-8 can come to consensus . " " development issues including global health , food security , water and sanitation and development assistance will continue to play an important role on the g-8 agenda . " group of eight will still lead on security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-8 will still handle security but it is still not the best option the g-8 is also likely to continue to take the lead on issues which fit better on its agenda , such as political security issues including counter-terrorism , nuclear non-proliferation , and the promotion of democracy and good governance .
the fact that not all members of the g-20 are democratic or have the capability or will to provide assistance to other countries makes these issues difficult to discuss in the broader g-20 . however , henning meyer believes that neither the g-8 or the g-20 are equipped to tackle security issues . " the most important aspect of multilateral-governance structures is that all or most relevant players are included in the same process , " he said . " neither the g-8 nor the g-20 in my view are suited to deal with security issues or non-proliferation .
this is the job of the un .
the g-8 or g-20 in effect are just formalized regular meetings where governments consult .
none of the outcomes of these meetings are directly binding because the ' agreements in principle ' have to be implemented nationally .
the un has more tools at its disposal . " despite this , the g-8 appears to be safe as long as its involvement in certain areas where the g-20 is too unwieldy to be effective continues and support remains among its members and those external powers that rely on its influence , such as african nations who fear that needed development assistance might disappear without the g-8 . however , a shift toward the g-20 's brand of global governance seems unstoppable with many of the world 's emerging markets , as well as the developed countries like australia who are not members of the g-8 , pushing for full inclusion in the global decision-making process . the g-8 may not be about to disband but it certainly appears to be on the verge of having to accept a new reality where its powers are curbed and where it has to concede influence to a larger forum . author : nick amies editor : rob mudge back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany has been charged with the task since 2002 . thomas de maiziere 's trip to kabul is the first visit to afghanistan by a german interior minister in six years .
germany has been tasked with training afghan police forces since 2002 , and de maiziere is in afghanistan to discuss the slow progress of the mission .
" it 's no success story , but things are improving " said de maiziere .
" the new strategy will hopefully start working , but we can not set the bar too high . "
the german government has outlined a new afghanistan strategy which foresees a new emphasis on training afghan security forces and boosting the number of german instructors to do the job .
on sunday , de maiziere met with his afghan counterpart mohammad hanif atmar and general stanley mcchrystal , the american commander of nato troops in afghanistan .
representatives from the european union police force eupol were also in attendance .
redoubled efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more german police experts are expected this year in afghanistan currently , there are 190 german police experts in afghanistan helping to train afghan police .
this number is scheduled to increase to 260 in 2010 .
by 2014 , 134,000 afghan police are hoped to be in service .
at the moment , there are just under 100,000 .
speaking through a military spokesman , de maiziere said he was optimistic that " success can still be achieved in afghanistan . "
however , recruiting trainees for the afghan police force has its share of difficulties .
an estimated 1,400 afghan police officers were killed last year alone during operations against the taliban . the afghan interior ministry is also investigating how many of the afghan police signed up on the force are actually serving .
drug addiction , illiteracy and corruption are common problems among the officers .
surprise visit from obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai , left , hosted obama at the presidential palace in kabul as de maiziere conducted his meetings in kabul , us president barack obama was en route to the afghan capital for a surprise meeting with afghan president hamid karzai .
the two leaders discussed making progress on good governance , rule of law , and anti-corruption efforts underway in afghanistan . later , obama visited the american airfield bagram in parvan province , where he addressed american troops stationed there . the trip to afghanistan is obama 's first as the commander in chief of the american military forces. mz / dpa / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany has been charged with the task since 2002 . thomas de maiziere 's trip to kabul is the first visit to afghanistan by a german interior minister in six years .
germany has been tasked with training afghan police forces since 2002 , and de maiziere is in afghanistan to discuss the slow progress of the mission .
" it 's no success story , but things are improving " said de maiziere .
" the new strategy will hopefully start working , but we can not set the bar too high . "
the german government has outlined a new afghanistan strategy which foresees a new emphasis on training afghan security forces and boosting the number of german instructors to do the job .
on sunday , de maiziere met with his afghan counterpart mohammad hanif atmar and general stanley mcchrystal , the american commander of nato troops in afghanistan .
representatives from the european union police force eupol were also in attendance .
redoubled efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more german police experts are expected this year in afghanistan currently , there are 190 german police experts in afghanistan helping to train afghan police .
this number is scheduled to increase to 260 in 2010 .
by 2014 , 134,000 afghan police are hoped to be in service .
at the moment , there are just under 100,000 .
speaking through a military spokesman , de maiziere said he was optimistic that " success can still be achieved in afghanistan . "
however , recruiting trainees for the afghan police force has its share of difficulties .
an estimated 1,400 afghan police officers were killed last year alone during operations against the taliban . the afghan interior ministry is also investigating how many of the afghan police signed up on the force are actually serving .
drug addiction , illiteracy and corruption are common problems among the officers .
surprise visit from obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai , left , hosted obama at the presidential palace in kabul as de maiziere conducted his meetings in kabul , us president barack obama was en route to the afghan capital for a surprise meeting with afghan president hamid karzai .

abuse allegations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did the pope turn a blind eye to abuse allegations ?
most of the sex abuse scandals which have come to light recently in germany have focused on the catholic church , and the employment of a convicted pedophile priest in 1980 in the city of munich when joseph ratzinger – now pope benedict xvi – served his term as archbishop .
some have questioned whether the pope played a role in the alleged cover-up of some abuse cases .
meanwhile , secular and protestant groups have admitted they also failed in that era to adequately police pedophile attacks on children in care .
last week , germany appointed a special ombudsman to receive and investigate allegations of sex molestation dating from the 1950s in catholic and other private schools .

most of the sex abuse scandals which have come to light recently in germany have focused on the catholic church , and the employment of a convicted pedophile priest in 1980 in the city of munich when joseph ratzinger – now pope benedict xvi – served his term as archbishop .
some have questioned whether the pope played a role in the alleged cover-up of some abuse cases .
meanwhile , secular and protestant groups have admitted they also failed in that era to adequately police pedophile attacks on children in care .
last week , germany appointed a special ombudsman to receive and investigate allegations of sex molestation dating from the 1950s in catholic and other private schools .
christine bergmann , a former german minister of family affairs , is tasked with studying cases that happened too long ago to be investigated by police .
germany does not prosecute child sex abuse after the victim turns 28 .
a spate of revelations of abuse and cruelty by clerics and evidence of a cover-up by the church hierarchy has also emerged in other european countries like ireland , austria , the netherlands and switzerland , as well as in the united states. rb / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" on certain areas of finance , development , energy and climate change , both organizations have played a role but economic and financial issues will be taken up more and more by the g-20 , " she told deutsche welle . it is also likely that the g-20 wo n't limit its growing influence to purely economic matters , which could marginalise the g-8 even more .
the g-20 has recently expanded its reach into financing development projects - prompted by the earthquake in haiti - and has started to play a larger role on issues such as energy and climate change , and in particular climate financing . g-8 likely to remain influential on climate , development bildunterschrift : the g-8 will still take the lead on climate change and development policy but will need the g-20 's help guebert believes that while the g-20 's influence will continue to grow in areas which are traditionally within the remit of the g-8 , the group of eight will maintain a strong role in climate policy making and establishing development mechanisms while accepting that the g-20 's involvement is necessary . " on the issue of climate change , the g-8 has long realized that there are key countries , who are members of the g-20 , that need to be included in the debate , " she said .
" however , the g-8 will likely continue to discuss the topic as well and make commitments on issues where the g-8 can come to consensus . " " development issues including global health , food security , water and sanitation and development assistance will continue to play an important role on the g-8 agenda . " group of eight will still lead on security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-8 will still handle security but it is still not the best option the g-8 is also likely to continue to take the lead on issues which fit better on its agenda , such as political security issues including counter-terrorism , nuclear non-proliferation , and the promotion of democracy and good governance .
the fact that not all members of the g-20 are democratic or have the capability or will to provide assistance to other countries makes these issues difficult to discuss in the broader g-20 . however , henning meyer believes that neither the g-8 or the g-20 are equipped to tackle security issues . " the most important aspect of multilateral-governance structures is that all or most relevant players are included in the same process , " he said . " neither the g-8 nor the g-20 in my view are suited to deal with security issues or non-proliferation .
this is the job of the un .
the g-8 or g-20 in effect are just formalized regular meetings where governments consult .
none of the outcomes of these meetings are directly binding because the ' agreements in principle ' have to be implemented nationally .
the un has more tools at its disposal . " despite this , the g-8 appears to be safe as long as its involvement in certain areas where the g-20 is too unwieldy to be effective continues and support remains among its members and those external powers that rely on its influence , such as african nations who fear that needed development assistance might disappear without the g-8 . however , a shift toward the g-20 's brand of global governance seems unstoppable with many of the world 's emerging markets , as well as the developed countries like australia who are not members of the g-8 , pushing for full inclusion in the global decision-making process . the g-8 may not be about to disband but it certainly appears to be on the verge of having to accept a new reality where its powers are curbed and where it has to concede influence to a larger forum . author : nick amies editor : rob mudge back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there are question that , ultimately , only the chancellor can answer , " parliamentary committee chairman rainer arnold , from the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , told german daily newspaper bild on saturday , march 27 . arnold was echoing calls by members of the green and left parties , who said on friday that the chancellor should testify before the committee . the demands come after reports earlier in the week that the chancellor 's office had received information that civilians had been killed in a german-ordered airstrike in afghanistan within hours of the event taking place in september 2009 . much of the parliamentary inquiry is focused on who knew what about the bombing and whether knowledge of civilian casualties was kept quiet . e-mail sent to merkel 's office bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up to 142 people were killed in the nato airstrike , with many others injured the german news weekly der spiegel reported on thursday that the country 's foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- sent an e-mail about the attack and causalities to merkel 's office . " many civilians were killed -lrb- numbers vary between 50 and 100 -rrb- , " the email was reported to have read . a spokesman for the government said that the e-mail had been an unconfirmed preliminary report and that the message content had already been handed over to the parliamentary investigation . in addition to arnold 's comments , spd parliamentary speaker thomas oppermann said that the chancellor should have done more , and sooner , to explain the nature of injuries and fatalities caused by the biggest attack involving german troops since the second world war . claims of electioneering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oppermann said the chancellor should have done more to explain , sooner but andreas schockenhoff , the conservative parliamentary group 's vice chairman , rejected the criticism and accused the spd of electioneering tactics ahead of regional voting in the state of north rhine-westphalia .

only the school principal margarita kaufmann and general manager meto salijevic remain in office following the meeting on saturday , march 27 .
the school says 33 ex-pupils have reported they were sexually abused in the period from 1966 to 1991 .
philipp sturz , one of the school 's 30 trustees , declined to confirm a report in the news magazine " der spiegel " that 40 ex-pupils had lodged complaints and more ex-teachers had been named in the scandal .
abuse allegations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did the pope turn a blind eye to abuse allegations ?
most of the sex abuse scandals which have come to light recently in germany have focused on the catholic church , and the employment of a convicted pedophile priest in 1980 in the city of munich when joseph ratzinger – now pope benedict xvi – served his term as archbishop .
some have questioned whether the pope played a role in the alleged cover-up of some abuse cases .
meanwhile , secular and protestant groups have admitted they also failed in that era to adequately police pedophile attacks on children in care .
last week , germany appointed a special ombudsman to receive and investigate allegations of sex molestation dating from the 1950s in catholic and other private schools .
christine bergmann , a former german minister of family affairs , is tasked with studying cases that happened too long ago to be investigated by police .
germany does not prosecute child sex abuse after the victim turns 28 .
a spate of revelations of abuse and cruelty by clerics and evidence of a cover-up by the church hierarchy has also emerged in other european countries like ireland , austria , the netherlands and switzerland , as well as in the united states. rb / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the g-20 has recently expanded its reach into financing development projects - prompted by the earthquake in haiti - and has started to play a larger role on issues such as energy and climate change , and in particular climate financing . g-8 likely to remain influential on climate , development bildunterschrift : the g-8 will still take the lead on climate change and development policy but will need the g-20 's help guebert believes that while the g-20 's influence will continue to grow in areas which are traditionally within the remit of the g-8 , the group of eight will maintain a strong role in climate policy making and establishing development mechanisms while accepting that the g-20 's involvement is necessary . " on the issue of climate change , the g-8 has long realized that there are key countries , who are members of the g-20 , that need to be included in the debate , " she said .
" however , the g-8 will likely continue to discuss the topic as well and make commitments on issues where the g-8 can come to consensus . " " development issues including global health , food security , water and sanitation and development assistance will continue to play an important role on the g-8 agenda . " group of eight will still lead on security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-8 will still handle security but it is still not the best option the g-8 is also likely to continue to take the lead on issues which fit better on its agenda , such as political security issues including counter-terrorism , nuclear non-proliferation , and the promotion of democracy and good governance .
the fact that not all members of the g-20 are democratic or have the capability or will to provide assistance to other countries makes these issues difficult to discuss in the broader g-20 . however , henning meyer believes that neither the g-8 or the g-20 are equipped to tackle security issues . " the most important aspect of multilateral-governance structures is that all or most relevant players are included in the same process , " he said . " neither the g-8 nor the g-20 in my view are suited to deal with security issues or non-proliferation .
this is the job of the un .
the g-8 or g-20 in effect are just formalized regular meetings where governments consult .
none of the outcomes of these meetings are directly binding because the ' agreements in principle ' have to be implemented nationally .
the un has more tools at its disposal . " despite this , the g-8 appears to be safe as long as its involvement in certain areas where the g-20 is too unwieldy to be effective continues and support remains among its members and those external powers that rely on its influence , such as african nations who fear that needed development assistance might disappear without the g-8 . however , a shift toward the g-20 's brand of global governance seems unstoppable with many of the world 's emerging markets , as well as the developed countries like australia who are not members of the g-8 , pushing for full inclusion in the global decision-making process . the g-8 may not be about to disband but it certainly appears to be on the verge of having to accept a new reality where its powers are curbed and where it has to concede influence to a larger forum . author : nick amies editor : rob mudge back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there are question that , ultimately , only the chancellor can answer , " parliamentary committee chairman rainer arnold , from the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , told german daily newspaper bild on saturday , march 27 . arnold was echoing calls by members of the green and left parties , who said on friday that the chancellor should testify before the committee . the demands come after reports earlier in the week that the chancellor 's office had received information that civilians had been killed in a german-ordered airstrike in afghanistan within hours of the event taking place in september 2009 . much of the parliamentary inquiry is focused on who knew what about the bombing and whether knowledge of civilian casualties was kept quiet . e-mail sent to merkel 's office bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up to 142 people were killed in the nato airstrike , with many others injured the german news weekly der spiegel reported on thursday that the country 's foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- sent an e-mail about the attack and causalities to merkel 's office .

as more nations lobby to have their say in world affairs , the g-8 faces a future of reduced influence and relevance . foreign ministers from the group of eight -lrb- g-8 -rrb- major countries gather in the resort city of gatineau in quebec , canada on march 29-30 to lay the groundwork for the g-8 summit meeting to be held in muskoka , ontario , in june .
during the two-day talks , the ministers from britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states will discuss a number of issues , including nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament , how to ensure peace and stability on the volatile afghanistan-pakistan border , and the consequences of terrorism and how to support nations with security vulnerabilities .
the g-8 summit in ontario on june 25-26 is shaping up to be a particularly important one , and not just because of the fluid nature of the global challenges the organization is currently facing .
while matters such as the nuclear ambitions of iran and north korea , the instability in the afghan-pakistan border regions and the threat of international terrorism are undoubtedly more pressing now than they were at the last annual summit in l 'aquila , italy in 2009 , the ontario summit could be a historic one in itself .
some observers have suggested it may be the g-8 's last .
driven by its role in addressing the impact of the global economic crisis , the g-20 organization - finance ministers and central bank governors from the world 's top 20 economies - is being viewed by some as the dominant power bloc in a new era of global governance .
the g-8 has served in various forms as the world 's leading economic forum since 1975 but at its summit in pittsburgh in september 2009 , the g-20 announced that its leaders had " endorsed the g-20 as the premier forum for their international economic cooperation . "
financial crisis exposed g-8 's limitations bildunterschrift : the g-20 's global inclusiveness in addressing the economic crisis showed up the g-8 's limitations while the g-8 focuses more on issues such as security and climate change and leaves its economic and financial policy to the g-7 - essentially the finance ministers of the g-8 minus russia - the rise of the g-20 and the expansion of its powers has some experts wondering how long the g-8 and g-7 can survive in the face of an increasingly influential , more inclusive global decision-making body . " the g-8 - if it survives at all - will be a much less powerful gathering and for a very good reason , " dr. henning meyer , head of the european programme at the global policy institute in london , told deutsche welle . " in the wake of the financial crisis everybody could witness the level of interdependence in the world .
and it became clear that a political structure that excludes important rising countries such as india , china and brazil simply does not have the scope to deal with those global issues . " " as with other institutions of global governance , like the united nations , it became clear that the structure of the g-8 does not reflect global realities enough , " he added . " if global problems of the magnitude of the financial crisis persist , which is very likely , then the real power of the g-8 will permanently shift to the g-20 or some other form of broader political structure .

" many civilians were killed -lrb- numbers vary between 50 and 100 -rrb- , " the email was reported to have read . a spokesman for the government said that the e-mail had been an unconfirmed preliminary report and that the message content had already been handed over to the parliamentary investigation . in addition to arnold 's comments , spd parliamentary speaker thomas oppermann said that the chancellor should have done more , and sooner , to explain the nature of injuries and fatalities caused by the biggest attack involving german troops since the second world war . claims of electioneering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oppermann said the chancellor should have done more to explain , sooner but andreas schockenhoff , the conservative parliamentary group 's vice chairman , rejected the criticism and accused the spd of electioneering tactics ahead of regional voting in the state of north rhine-westphalia . " the claim that angela merkel has not been open about kunduz and its consequences is malicious , " schockenhoff told the german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung . the parliamentary investigation aims to clarify events before and after german colonel georg klein ordered an airstrike on two hijacked fuel tankers .
up to 142 people were killed in the strike , including , it is believed , dozens of civilians . the incident led to a political storm in germany , claiming the jobs of the former minister of defense , franz josef jung , and gemany 's top military officer , wolfgang schneiderhan . rc / dpa / afp / reuters / ap editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move comes as some other european nations have already opened their doors to former prisoners . according to an interior ministry spokesman , berlin is talking to washington about relocating suitable detainees after they get released from the us-owned guantanamo bay prison in cuba . an unnamed interior ministry official said on saturday , march 27 , that his ministry had " opened talks anew with the united states on this matter . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some prisoners , going home is not an option the discussions were taking place with the approval of the foreign ministry and chancellor angela merkel 's office " on a case-by-case basis , " the official added . meanwhile , the german news magazine " der spiegel " reported that a delegation from berlin recently visited guantanamo to meet with several inmates , including a palestinian , a jordanian and a syrian who are likely candidates for resettlement . spiegel said the delegation , including police and immigration officials , had interviewed the men to assess their suitability and any potential risks if they were to be taken in . risk assessment last year , germany had considered accepting prisoners but later backed off amid concerns that the men could prove dangerous . the interior ministry said on saturday that berlin supported washington 's efforts to close the prison camp and that this had been consistent german policy . spiegel said us special envoy daniel fried had had months of confidential talks last year with the interior ministry , culminating in the handing over of a list of nine candidates .
some of them have since found homes in other nations . the newspaper said the remaining candidates for resettlement included a palestinian from the west bank who was part of a conservative group of imams and had been arrested in pakistan . a jordanian who traveled to afghanistan in the summer of 2001 was also on the list as was a syrian , who had been treated at a kabul hospital at the end of 2001 , and was arrested shortly after his discharge .
the united states wants to release all three men . bildunterschrift : prisoners who are no longer regarded as enemy combatants are eligible for release missed deadline president barack obama 's administration has been reluctant to send some guantanamo prisoners back to their home countries because they might suffer reprisal after being held in us custody . obama had pledged to close down the guantanamo camp by january this year , but some 200 detainees continue to be held there as finding them new homes is proving difficult . european countries are divided over whether to accept freed guantanamo detainees : while most appear reluctant , some have openly expressed support . last week , two chinese uighur men who were released from the detention camp in cuba arrived in switzerland .

the move came after spain , which holds the eu presidency , said the names of libyans had been removed from a swiss-instigated visa blacklist . spain 's foreign ministry announced in a statement on saturday that the visa blacklist against 188 libyans had been torn up and expressed regret as part of a diplomatic drive by european union leaders .
the foreign ministry in madrid expressed said it " deplored " the problems that the ban had caused to libyans .
the ban was imposed on the initiative of switzerland , which has been embroiled in a long-standing diplomatic row with libya .
tripoli responded in kind by putting out a communiqué .
" in the interests of strengthening its cooperation with the european union , libya lifts the restrictions it earlier imposed on the citizens of the schengen zone , " the libyan foreign ministry said in a statement published by the state news agency jana , referring to the 25-nation visa-free zone in europe .
switzerland is part of the schengen zone but not a member of the 27-nation eu .
libya had insisted on the eu apologizing for the row , something that spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos had agreed to during a recent visit to tripoli , according to the libyan ambassador to spain .
last week , switzerland said that it was prepared to lift the ban it had imposed in january on libyan officials , including leader moamer gaddafi , for entry into the schengen zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gaddafi had called for a jihad against switzerland after the swiss ban on minarets strife escalates the spat between libya and switzerland dates back to 2008 , when gaddafi 's son , hannibal , was arrested in geneva , allegedly for mistreating his domestic help .
the charges were later dropped but tripoli retaliated by arresting two swiss men on visa charges .
the crisis assumed an eu-wide dimension earlier this year , with the swiss travel ban and a tit-for-tat prohibition by libya , which said it would stop issuing visas to citizens from all schengen-area countries .
the swiss move not only infuriated libya , but also schengen states which saw it as an unjustified escalation of a bilateral row .
the schengen area is a grouping of all eu countries except britain , ireland , cyprus , bulgaria and romania , plus non-eu members switzerland , norway and iceland .
the diplomatic feud between switzerland and libya also escalated following a swiss referendum decision in november last year to ban the construction of minarets in the country . in february , gaddafi had condemned the minaret ban and called for a " jihad " or holy war against switzerland. rb / afp / reuters / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 25-year-old graduate of oxford university and the hertie school of governance in berlin was watching a bunch of youngsters enjoying a game of basketball in a break between morning classes .
terwitte is one of 66 high-achieving college graduates who were sent to problem schools in september 2009 under a program run by teach first germany - a not-for-profit charity founded four years ago .
" this brings you to a new level . it 's like a consulting job that requires 70- or 80-hour work weeks , " he said .
' he 's one of us ' during the break , a 14-year-old student of german-turkish origin asks terwitte politely if he can go to the school 's office to check on his next classes .
this kind of discipline and good manners was n't always the norm at the ernst-schering school , where students have earned a reputation for violent behavior , absenteeism and under-achieving .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence was a problem at ernst-schering school the school is situated in a section of berlin dominated by poor immigrant families .
some 85 percent of the school 's children are on free meals , and their parents are often dependent on social welfare .
in spite of his elite academic pedigree , terwitte managed to win the respect of the school 's students . many have even grown fond of him in the seven months he 's spent at the school .
" his music classes are really varied , and always a lot of fun , " said ahed , an 8th grade student .
he also said that terwitte was not just " focused on grades " and listens to the " student 's needs . "
" you can also always approach him with personal things , " said bethlehem , a student from ethiopia .
" he 's one of us because he understands us , " ahed concluded .
but terwitte is not only popular among the school 's students .
the teachers like him too , and do n't regret their decision to apply for a teach first fellow .
" he 's building bridges between the students and the regular teachers , " said marion buerck , a biology and chemistry teacher . buerck called teach first " a wonderful program that should definitely be enlarged . "
' perfect mixture of mind and heart ' under the german teach first program , fellows like terwitte are given two-year contracts that earn them about 1,700 euros -lrb- $ 2,268 -rrb- per month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fellows face a rigid selection process before they are sent to the schools the first 66 fellows were sent to the schools in september 2009 .
they were selected from more than 700 graduates who had initially applied .
" we are looking for the perfect mixture of mind and heart , " said kaija landsberg , the founder of teach first germany .
a graduate of the hertie school of governance in berlin , landsberg wrote her master 's thesis on the problems of integration .
during her studies she came across teach first in britain and teach for america in the united states .
" academic excellence is not enough , " landsberg said .
" what we also need is a high degree of involvement in fields such as social work , cultural initiatives or sports .
applicants must prove they are willing to take leadership positions . "
struggling against the odds landsberg said most of the graduates that apply to teach first were driven by the desire " to give something back to society " after they had received " the privilege of first-class education . "
" what unites us all is the shared belief that more must be done in the education system to serve those who have n't been served so far , " she said .
but teach first has received a lot of criticism from the german teacher 's trade union , which accuses the program of aiming to " de-professionalize " the teaching profession .
the union also questioned the " philanthropic motives " of the graduates .
" we are not lowering any bars , " landsberg says .
" the fellows do n't do the jobs of regular teachers .
it 's just a new way for them to discover the teaching profession , for which they would need additional qualifications anyway . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teach first fellows are used to a different world a different type of leader but turning high-achieving college graduates into teachers is n't the focus of teach first . landsberg says the goal is to make the fellows take what they experienced in the schools " to the next level " of their careers .
" we really need people who have been on the ground and know what it 's about , so they will be to change policies , change companies and change society , " she said .
terwitte said his new job at the ernst-schering school required " a degree of energy unparalleled in his previous life . " he called his endeavor both " taxing and rewarding . "
" sometimes i catch myself thinking : gosh , am i taking more out of this than i 'm able to give to the kids ?
because in many ways i 'm growing , " he said , before adding , " teach first fellows are pre-destined to carry on this work , wherever they go in their future lives . "

the two-day regional elections , which started on sunday , march 28 , are no different . the leader is down in the polls and the votes garnered by his people 's freedom party will partly be viewed as reflecting confidence – or lack thereof – in the prime minister . but berlusconi 's power has long hinged on forming pacts with other parties .
myrta merlino , who hosts a financial program on television called the domino effect , said the elections will also be pivotal for the far-right northern league party , known as the lega in italian . " for the first time , two major regions are likely to go to the lega , " merlino said .
" and if they win , the weight of the lega in the central government will be very , very big .
the northern region will ask to have more money for the efficient regions and less for the south .
and so also for the unity of the country , these elections are important . " resentment against south bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents have accused berlusconi of changing laws for his own benefit the northern league is fiscally conservative , and has long expressed resentment toward southern italy 's dependency on government jobs to keep its population employed .
the lega also has the sympathy of berlusconi 's most powerful minister - finance minister giulio tremonti . the elections are also seen as a test for the left .
years of infighting , ineffective leadership and a series of its own scandals have kept italians from considering the center-left democratic party as a real option . antonio polito , editor of il riformista magazine and a former senator in the southern region of campania , said the regional elections are a chance for the italian left to get the new start it 's looking for . " at the moment , the opposition is unelectable , " polito said .
" if we had general elections now , the center-left would lose .
so the regional elections are an important step to rebuild credibility in the country . " changes in perception and if the left does gain what it 's seeking - more votes and a shift in perception that they could lead italy - it does n't necessarily spell the end of berlusconi . milano finanza magazine editor pierluigi magnaschi said it 's unlikely berlusconi will be going anywhere before the end of his term as prime minister .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 28.03.2010 teach first makes the grade in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teach first fellows are eager to leave mark at problem schools modeled on similar programs in britain and the us , teach first germany attracts high-achieving graduates to challenged schools , aiming to change attitudes and improve society . on a cold thursday morning in march , johannes terwitte is in charge of ensuring schoolyard discipline at the ernst-schering school in berlin 's wedding district .
the 25-year-old graduate of oxford university and the hertie school of governance in berlin was watching a bunch of youngsters enjoying a game of basketball in a break between morning classes .
terwitte is one of 66 high-achieving college graduates who were sent to problem schools in september 2009 under a program run by teach first germany - a not-for-profit charity founded four years ago .
" this brings you to a new level . it 's like a consulting job that requires 70- or 80-hour work weeks , " he said .
' he 's one of us ' during the break , a 14-year-old student of german-turkish origin asks terwitte politely if he can go to the school 's office to check on his next classes .
this kind of discipline and good manners was n't always the norm at the ernst-schering school , where students have earned a reputation for violent behavior , absenteeism and under-achieving .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence was a problem at ernst-schering school the school is situated in a section of berlin dominated by poor immigrant families .
some 85 percent of the school 's children are on free meals , and their parents are often dependent on social welfare .
in spite of his elite academic pedigree , terwitte managed to win the respect of the school 's students . many have even grown fond of him in the seven months he 's spent at the school .
" his music classes are really varied , and always a lot of fun , " said ahed , an 8th grade student .
he also said that terwitte was not just " focused on grades " and listens to the " student 's needs . "
" you can also always approach him with personal things , " said bethlehem , a student from ethiopia .
" he 's one of us because he understands us , " ahed concluded .
but terwitte is not only popular among the school 's students .
the teachers like him too , and do n't regret their decision to apply for a teach first fellow .
" he 's building bridges between the students and the regular teachers , " said marion buerck , a biology and chemistry teacher . buerck called teach first " a wonderful program that should definitely be enlarged . "
' perfect mixture of mind and heart ' under the german teach first program , fellows like terwitte are given two-year contracts that earn them about 1,700 euros -lrb- $ 2,268 -rrb- per month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fellows face a rigid selection process before they are sent to the schools the first 66 fellows were sent to the schools in september 2009 .
they were selected from more than 700 graduates who had initially applied .
" we are looking for the perfect mixture of mind and heart , " said kaija landsberg , the founder of teach first germany .
a graduate of the hertie school of governance in berlin , landsberg wrote her master 's thesis on the problems of integration .
during her studies she came across teach first in britain and teach for america in the united states .
" academic excellence is not enough , " landsberg said .
" what we also need is a high degree of involvement in fields such as social work , cultural initiatives or sports .
applicants must prove they are willing to take leadership positions . "
struggling against the odds landsberg said most of the graduates that apply to teach first were driven by the desire " to give something back to society " after they had received " the privilege of first-class education . "
" what unites us all is the shared belief that more must be done in the education system to serve those who have n't been served so far , " she said .
but teach first has received a lot of criticism from the german teacher 's trade union , which accuses the program of aiming to " de-professionalize " the teaching profession .
the union also questioned the " philanthropic motives " of the graduates .
" we are not lowering any bars , " landsberg says .
" the fellows do n't do the jobs of regular teachers .
it 's just a new way for them to discover the teaching profession , for which they would need additional qualifications anyway . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teach first fellows are used to a different world a different type of leader but turning high-achieving college graduates into teachers is n't the focus of teach first . landsberg says the goal is to make the fellows take what they experienced in the schools " to the next level " of their careers .
" we really need people who have been on the ground and know what it 's about , so they will be to change policies , change companies and change society , " she said .
terwitte said his new job at the ernst-schering school required " a degree of energy unparalleled in his previous life . " he called his endeavor both " taxing and rewarding . "
" sometimes i catch myself thinking : gosh , am i taking more out of this than i 'm able to give to the kids ?
because in many ways i 'm growing , " he said , before adding , " teach first fellows are pre-destined to carry on this work , wherever they go in their future lives . "

the 25-year-old graduate of oxford university and the hertie school of governance in berlin was watching a bunch of youngsters enjoying a game of basketball in a break between morning classes .
terwitte is one of 66 high-achieving college graduates who were sent to problem schools in september 2009 under a program run by teach first germany - a not-for-profit charity founded four years ago .
" this brings you to a new level . it 's like a consulting job that requires 70- or 80-hour work weeks , " he said .
' he 's one of us ' during the break , a 14-year-old student of german-turkish origin asks terwitte politely if he can go to the school 's office to check on his next classes .
this kind of discipline and good manners was n't always the norm at the ernst-schering school , where students have earned a reputation for violent behavior , absenteeism and under-achieving .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence was a problem at ernst-schering school the school is situated in a section of berlin dominated by poor immigrant families .
some 85 percent of the school 's children are on free meals , and their parents are often dependent on social welfare .
in spite of his elite academic pedigree , terwitte managed to win the respect of the school 's students . many have even grown fond of him in the seven months he 's spent at the school .
" his music classes are really varied , and always a lot of fun , " said ahed , an 8th grade student .
he also said that terwitte was not just " focused on grades " and listens to the " student 's needs . "
" you can also always approach him with personal things , " said bethlehem , a student from ethiopia .
" he 's one of us because he understands us , " ahed concluded .
but terwitte is not only popular among the school 's students .
the teachers like him too , and do n't regret their decision to apply for a teach first fellow .
" he 's building bridges between the students and the regular teachers , " said marion buerck , a biology and chemistry teacher . buerck called teach first " a wonderful program that should definitely be enlarged . "
' perfect mixture of mind and heart ' under the german teach first program , fellows like terwitte are given two-year contracts that earn them about 1,700 euros -lrb- $ 2,268 -rrb- per month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fellows face a rigid selection process before they are sent to the schools the first 66 fellows were sent to the schools in september 2009 .
they were selected from more than 700 graduates who had initially applied .
" we are looking for the perfect mixture of mind and heart , " said kaija landsberg , the founder of teach first germany .
a graduate of the hertie school of governance in berlin , landsberg wrote her master 's thesis on the problems of integration .
during her studies she came across teach first in britain and teach for america in the united states .
" academic excellence is not enough , " landsberg said .
" what we also need is a high degree of involvement in fields such as social work , cultural initiatives or sports .
applicants must prove they are willing to take leadership positions . "
struggling against the odds landsberg said most of the graduates that apply to teach first were driven by the desire " to give something back to society " after they had received " the privilege of first-class education . "
" what unites us all is the shared belief that more must be done in the education system to serve those who have n't been served so far , " she said .
but teach first has received a lot of criticism from the german teacher 's trade union , which accuses the program of aiming to " de-professionalize " the teaching profession .
the union also questioned the " philanthropic motives " of the graduates .
" we are not lowering any bars , " landsberg says .
" the fellows do n't do the jobs of regular teachers .
it 's just a new way for them to discover the teaching profession , for which they would need additional qualifications anyway . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teach first fellows are used to a different world a different type of leader but turning high-achieving college graduates into teachers is n't the focus of teach first . landsberg says the goal is to make the fellows take what they experienced in the schools " to the next level " of their careers .
" we really need people who have been on the ground and know what it 's about , so they will be to change policies , change companies and change society , " she said .
terwitte said his new job at the ernst-schering school required " a degree of energy unparalleled in his previous life . " he called his endeavor both " taxing and rewarding . "
" sometimes i catch myself thinking : gosh , am i taking more out of this than i 'm able to give to the kids ?
because in many ways i 'm growing , " he said , before adding , " teach first fellows are pre-destined to carry on this work , wherever they go in their future lives . "

only the school principal margarita kaufmann and general manager meto salijevic remain in office following the meeting on saturday , march 27 .
the school says 33 ex-pupils have reported they were sexually abused in the period from 1966 to 1991 .
philipp sturz , one of the school 's 30 trustees , declined to confirm a report in the news magazine " der spiegel " that 40 ex-pupils had lodged complaints and more ex-teachers had been named in the scandal .
abuse allegations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did the pope turn a blind eye to abuse allegations ?
most of the sex abuse scandals which have come to light recently in germany have focused on the catholic church , and the employment of a convicted pedophile priest in 1980 in the city of munich when joseph ratzinger – now pope benedict xvi – served his term as archbishop .
some have questioned whether the pope played a role in the alleged cover-up of some abuse cases .
meanwhile , secular and protestant groups have admitted they also failed in that era to adequately police pedophile attacks on children in care .
last week , germany appointed a special ombudsman to receive and investigate allegations of sex molestation dating from the 1950s in catholic and other private schools .
christine bergmann , a former german minister of family affairs , is tasked with studying cases that happened too long ago to be investigated by police .
germany does not prosecute child sex abuse after the victim turns 28 .
a spate of revelations of abuse and cruelty by clerics and evidence of a cover-up by the church hierarchy has also emerged in other european countries like ireland , austria , the netherlands and switzerland , as well as in the united states. rb / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the new strategy will hopefully start working , but we can not set the bar too high . "
the german government has outlined a new afghanistan strategy which foresees a new emphasis on training afghan security forces and boosting the number of german instructors to do the job .
on sunday , de maiziere met with his afghan counterpart mohammad hanif atmar and general stanley mcchrystal , the american commander of nato troops in afghanistan .
representatives from the european union police force eupol were also in attendance .
redoubled efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more german police experts are expected this year in afghanistan currently , there are 190 german police experts in afghanistan helping to train afghan police .
this number is scheduled to increase to 260 in 2010 .
by 2014 , 134,000 afghan police are hoped to be in service .
at the moment , there are just under 100,000 .
speaking through a military spokesman , de maiziere said he was optimistic that " success can still be achieved in afghanistan . "
however , recruiting trainees for the afghan police force has its share of difficulties .
an estimated 1,400 afghan police officers were killed last year alone during operations against the taliban . the afghan interior ministry is also investigating how many of the afghan police signed up on the force are actually serving .
drug addiction , illiteracy and corruption are common problems among the officers .
surprise visit from obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai , left , hosted obama at the presidential palace in kabul as de maiziere conducted his meetings in kabul , us president barack obama was en route to the afghan capital for a surprise meeting with afghan president hamid karzai .
the two leaders discussed making progress on good governance , rule of law , and anti-corruption efforts underway in afghanistan . later , obama visited the american airfield bagram in parvan province , where he addressed american troops stationed there . the trip to afghanistan is obama 's first as the commander in chief of the american military forces. mz / dpa / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

during the two-day talks , the ministers from britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states will discuss a number of issues , including nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament , how to ensure peace and stability on the volatile afghanistan-pakistan border , and the consequences of terrorism and how to support nations with security vulnerabilities .
the g-8 summit in ontario on june 25-26 is shaping up to be a particularly important one , and not just because of the fluid nature of the global challenges the organization is currently facing .
while matters such as the nuclear ambitions of iran and north korea , the instability in the afghan-pakistan border regions and the threat of international terrorism are undoubtedly more pressing now than they were at the last annual summit in l 'aquila , italy in 2009 , the ontario summit could be a historic one in itself .

driven by its role in addressing the impact of the global economic crisis , the g-20 organization - finance ministers and central bank governors from the world 's top 20 economies - is being viewed by some as the dominant power bloc in a new era of global governance .

" " as with other institutions of global governance , like the united nations , it became clear that the structure of the g-8 does not reflect global realities enough , " he added .

during the two-day talks , the ministers from britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states will discuss a number of issues , including nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament , how to ensure peace and stability on the volatile afghanistan-pakistan border , and the consequences of terrorism and how to support nations with security vulnerabilities .
the g-8 summit in ontario on june 25-26 is shaping up to be a particularly important one , and not just because of the fluid nature of the global challenges the organization is currently facing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de global governance -pipe- 28.03.2010 as g-20 expands its influence , g-8 faces reduced role 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-8 is seeing its influence wane in certain policy areas the shift towards an era of global governance appears to be driven by the expanding power of the g-20 .
as more nations lobby to have their say in world affairs , the g-8 faces a future of reduced influence and relevance . foreign ministers from the group of eight -lrb- g-8 -rrb- major countries gather in the resort city of gatineau in quebec , canada on march 29-30 to lay the groundwork for the g-8 summit meeting to be held in muskoka , ontario , in june .
during the two-day talks , the ministers from britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states will discuss a number of issues , including nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament , how to ensure peace and stability on the volatile afghanistan-pakistan border , and the consequences of terrorism and how to support nations with security vulnerabilities .
the g-8 summit in ontario on june 25-26 is shaping up to be a particularly important one , and not just because of the fluid nature of the global challenges the organization is currently facing .
while matters such as the nuclear ambitions of iran and north korea , the instability in the afghan-pakistan border regions and the threat of international terrorism are undoubtedly more pressing now than they were at the last annual summit in l 'aquila , italy in 2009 , the ontario summit could be a historic one in itself .
some observers have suggested it may be the g-8 's last .
driven by its role in addressing the impact of the global economic crisis , the g-20 organization - finance ministers and central bank governors from the world 's top 20 economies - is being viewed by some as the dominant power bloc in a new era of global governance .
the g-8 has served in various forms as the world 's leading economic forum since 1975 but at its summit in pittsburgh in september 2009 , the g-20 announced that its leaders had " endorsed the g-20 as the premier forum for their international economic cooperation . "
financial crisis exposed g-8 's limitations bildunterschrift : the g-20 's global inclusiveness in addressing the economic crisis showed up the g-8 's limitations while the g-8 focuses more on issues such as security and climate change and leaves its economic and financial policy to the g-7 - essentially the finance ministers of the g-8 minus russia - the rise of the g-20 and the expansion of its powers has some experts wondering how long the g-8 and g-7 can survive in the face of an increasingly influential , more inclusive global decision-making body . " the g-8 - if it survives at all - will be a much less powerful gathering and for a very good reason , " dr. henning meyer , head of the european programme at the global policy institute in london , told deutsche welle . " in the wake of the financial crisis everybody could witness the level of interdependence in the world .
and it became clear that a political structure that excludes important rising countries such as india , china and brazil simply does not have the scope to deal with those global issues . " " as with other institutions of global governance , like the united nations , it became clear that the structure of the g-8 does not reflect global realities enough , " he added . " if global problems of the magnitude of the financial crisis persist , which is very likely , then the real power of the g-8 will permanently shift to the g-20 or some other form of broader political structure .

" on certain areas of finance , development , energy and climate change , both organizations have played a role but economic and financial issues will be taken up more and more by the g-20 , " she told deutsche welle . it is also likely that the g-20 wo n't limit its growing influence to purely economic matters , which could marginalise the g-8 even more .
the g-20 has recently expanded its reach into financing development projects - prompted by the earthquake in haiti - and has started to play a larger role on issues such as energy and climate change , and in particular climate financing . g-8 likely to remain influential on climate , development bildunterschrift : the g-8 will still take the lead on climate change and development policy but will need the g-20 's help guebert believes that while the g-20 's influence will continue to grow in areas which are traditionally within the remit of the g-8 , the group of eight will maintain a strong role in climate policy making and establishing development mechanisms while accepting that the g-20 's involvement is necessary . " on the issue of climate change , the g-8 has long realized that there are key countries , who are members of the g-20 , that need to be included in the debate , " she said .
" however , the g-8 will likely continue to discuss the topic as well and make commitments on issues where the g-8 can come to consensus .

the fact that not all members of the g-20 are democratic or have the capability or will to provide assistance to other countries makes these issues difficult to discuss in the broader g-20 . however , henning meyer believes that neither the g-8 or the g-20 are equipped to tackle security issues .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fellows face a rigid selection process before they are sent to the schools the first 66 fellows were sent to the schools in september 2009 .
they were selected from more than 700 graduates who had initially applied .
" we are looking for the perfect mixture of mind and heart , " said kaija landsberg , the founder of teach first germany .
a graduate of the hertie school of governance in berlin , landsberg wrote her master 's thesis on the problems of integration .
during her studies she came across teach first in britain and teach for america in the united states .
" academic excellence is not enough , " landsberg said .
" what we also need is a high degree of involvement in fields such as social work , cultural initiatives or sports .
applicants must prove they are willing to take leadership positions . "
struggling against the odds landsberg said most of the graduates that apply to teach first were driven by the desire " to give something back to society " after they had received " the privilege of first-class education . "
" what unites us all is the shared belief that more must be done in the education system to serve those who have n't been served so far , " she said .
but teach first has received a lot of criticism from the german teacher 's trade union , which accuses the program of aiming to " de-professionalize " the teaching profession .
the union also questioned the " philanthropic motives " of the graduates .
" we are not lowering any bars , " landsberg says .
" the fellows do n't do the jobs of regular teachers .
it 's just a new way for them to discover the teaching profession , for which they would need additional qualifications anyway . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teach first fellows are used to a different world a different type of leader but turning high-achieving college graduates into teachers is n't the focus of teach first . landsberg says the goal is to make the fellows take what they experienced in the schools " to the next level " of their careers .
" we really need people who have been on the ground and know what it 's about , so they will be to change policies , change companies and change society , " she said .
terwitte said his new job at the ernst-schering school required " a degree of energy unparalleled in his previous life . " he called his endeavor both " taxing and rewarding . "
" sometimes i catch myself thinking : gosh , am i taking more out of this than i 'm able to give to the kids ?
because in many ways i 'm growing , " he said , before adding , " teach first fellows are pre-destined to carry on this work , wherever they go in their future lives . "

the move came after spain , which holds the eu presidency , said the names of libyans had been removed from a swiss-instigated visa blacklist . spain 's foreign ministry announced in a statement on saturday that the visa blacklist against 188 libyans had been torn up and expressed regret as part of a diplomatic drive by european union leaders .
the foreign ministry in madrid expressed said it " deplored " the problems that the ban had caused to libyans .
the ban was imposed on the initiative of switzerland , which has been embroiled in a long-standing diplomatic row with libya .
tripoli responded in kind by putting out a communiqué .
" in the interests of strengthening its cooperation with the european union , libya lifts the restrictions it earlier imposed on the citizens of the schengen zone , " the libyan foreign ministry said in a statement published by the state news agency jana , referring to the 25-nation visa-free zone in europe .
switzerland is part of the schengen zone but not a member of the 27-nation eu .
libya had insisted on the eu apologizing for the row , something that spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos had agreed to during a recent visit to tripoli , according to the libyan ambassador to spain .
last week , switzerland said that it was prepared to lift the ban it had imposed in january on libyan officials , including leader moamer gaddafi , for entry into the schengen zone .

the charges were later dropped but tripoli retaliated by arresting two swiss men on visa charges .
the crisis assumed an eu-wide dimension earlier this year , with the swiss travel ban and a tit-for-tat prohibition by libya , which said it would stop issuing visas to citizens from all schengen-area countries .
the swiss move not only infuriated libya , but also schengen states which saw it as an unjustified escalation of a bilateral row .
the schengen area is a grouping of all eu countries except britain , ireland , cyprus , bulgaria and romania , plus non-eu members switzerland , norway and iceland .
the diplomatic feud between switzerland and libya also escalated following a swiss referendum decision in november last year to ban the construction of minarets in the country . in february , gaddafi had condemned the minaret ban and called for a " jihad " or holy war against switzerland. rb / afp / reuters / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the schengen area is a grouping of all eu countries except britain , ireland , cyprus , bulgaria and romania , plus non-eu members switzerland , norway and iceland .
the diplomatic feud between switzerland and libya also escalated following a swiss referendum decision in november last year to ban the construction of minarets in the country . in february , gaddafi had condemned the minaret ban and called for a " jihad " or holy war against switzerland. rb / afp / reuters / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

only the school principal margarita kaufmann and general manager meto salijevic remain in office following the meeting on saturday , march 27 .
the school says 33 ex-pupils have reported they were sexually abused in the period from 1966 to 1991 .
philipp sturz , one of the school 's 30 trustees , declined to confirm a report in the news magazine " der spiegel " that 40 ex-pupils had lodged complaints and more ex-teachers had been named in the scandal .
abuse allegations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did the pope turn a blind eye to abuse allegations ?
most of the sex abuse scandals which have come to light recently in germany have focused on the catholic church , and the employment of a convicted pedophile priest in 1980 in the city of munich when joseph ratzinger – now pope benedict xvi – served his term as archbishop .
some have questioned whether the pope played a role in the alleged cover-up of some abuse cases .
meanwhile , secular and protestant groups have admitted they also failed in that era to adequately police pedophile attacks on children in care .
last week , germany appointed a special ombudsman to receive and investigate allegations of sex molestation dating from the 1950s in catholic and other private schools .
christine bergmann , a former german minister of family affairs , is tasked with studying cases that happened too long ago to be investigated by police .
germany does not prosecute child sex abuse after the victim turns 28 .

only the school principal margarita kaufmann and general manager meto salijevic remain in office following the meeting on saturday , march 27 .
the school says 33 ex-pupils have reported they were sexually abused in the period from 1966 to 1991 .
philipp sturz , one of the school 's 30 trustees , declined to confirm a report in the news magazine " der spiegel " that 40 ex-pupils had lodged complaints and more ex-teachers had been named in the scandal .
abuse allegations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did the pope turn a blind eye to abuse allegations ?
most of the sex abuse scandals which have come to light recently in germany have focused on the catholic church , and the employment of a convicted pedophile priest in 1980 in the city of munich when joseph ratzinger – now pope benedict xvi – served his term as archbishop .
some have questioned whether the pope played a role in the alleged cover-up of some abuse cases .
meanwhile , secular and protestant groups have admitted they also failed in that era to adequately police pedophile attacks on children in care .
last week , germany appointed a special ombudsman to receive and investigate allegations of sex molestation dating from the 1950s in catholic and other private schools .
christine bergmann , a former german minister of family affairs , is tasked with studying cases that happened too long ago to be investigated by police .
germany does not prosecute child sex abuse after the victim turns 28 .

the two-day regional elections , which started on sunday , march 28 , are no different . the leader is down in the polls and the votes garnered by his people 's freedom party will partly be viewed as reflecting confidence – or lack thereof – in the prime minister . but berlusconi 's power has long hinged on forming pacts with other parties .
myrta merlino , who hosts a financial program on television called the domino effect , said the elections will also be pivotal for the far-right northern league party , known as the lega in italian . " for the first time , two major regions are likely to go to the lega , " merlino said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de global governance -pipe- 28.03.2010 as g-20 expands its influence , g-8 faces reduced role 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-8 is seeing its influence wane in certain policy areas the shift towards an era of global governance appears to be driven by the expanding power of the g-20 .
as more nations lobby to have their say in world affairs , the g-8 faces a future of reduced influence and relevance . foreign ministers from the group of eight -lrb- g-8 -rrb- major countries gather in the resort city of gatineau in quebec , canada on march 29-30 to lay the groundwork for the g-8 summit meeting to be held in muskoka , ontario , in june .
during the two-day talks , the ministers from britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states will discuss a number of issues , including nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament , how to ensure peace and stability on the volatile afghanistan-pakistan border , and the consequences of terrorism and how to support nations with security vulnerabilities .
the g-8 summit in ontario on june 25-26 is shaping up to be a particularly important one , and not just because of the fluid nature of the global challenges the organization is currently facing .
while matters such as the nuclear ambitions of iran and north korea , the instability in the afghan-pakistan border regions and the threat of international terrorism are undoubtedly more pressing now than they were at the last annual summit in l 'aquila , italy in 2009 , the ontario summit could be a historic one in itself .
some observers have suggested it may be the g-8 's last .
driven by its role in addressing the impact of the global economic crisis , the g-20 organization - finance ministers and central bank governors from the world 's top 20 economies - is being viewed by some as the dominant power bloc in a new era of global governance .
the g-8 has served in various forms as the world 's leading economic forum since 1975 but at its summit in pittsburgh in september 2009 , the g-20 announced that its leaders had " endorsed the g-20 as the premier forum for their international economic cooperation . "
financial crisis exposed g-8 's limitations bildunterschrift : the g-20 's global inclusiveness in addressing the economic crisis showed up the g-8 's limitations while the g-8 focuses more on issues such as security and climate change and leaves its economic and financial policy to the g-7 - essentially the finance ministers of the g-8 minus russia - the rise of the g-20 and the expansion of its powers has some experts wondering how long the g-8 and g-7 can survive in the face of an increasingly influential , more inclusive global decision-making body . " the g-8 - if it survives at all - will be a much less powerful gathering and for a very good reason , " dr. henning meyer , head of the european programme at the global policy institute in london , told deutsche welle . " in the wake of the financial crisis everybody could witness the level of interdependence in the world .
and it became clear that a political structure that excludes important rising countries such as india , china and brazil simply does not have the scope to deal with those global issues . " " as with other institutions of global governance , like the united nations , it became clear that the structure of the g-8 does not reflect global realities enough , " he added . " if global problems of the magnitude of the financial crisis persist , which is very likely , then the real power of the g-8 will permanently shift to the g-20 or some other form of broader political structure .

" on certain areas of finance , development , energy and climate change , both organizations have played a role but economic and financial issues will be taken up more and more by the g-20 , " she told deutsche welle . it is also likely that the g-20 wo n't limit its growing influence to purely economic matters , which could marginalise the g-8 even more .
the g-20 has recently expanded its reach into financing development projects - prompted by the earthquake in haiti - and has started to play a larger role on issues such as energy and climate change , and in particular climate financing . g-8 likely to remain influential on climate , development bildunterschrift : the g-8 will still take the lead on climate change and development policy but will need the g-20 's help guebert believes that while the g-20 's influence will continue to grow in areas which are traditionally within the remit of the g-8 , the group of eight will maintain a strong role in climate policy making and establishing development mechanisms while accepting that the g-20 's involvement is necessary . " on the issue of climate change , the g-8 has long realized that there are key countries , who are members of the g-20 , that need to be included in the debate , " she said .
" however , the g-8 will likely continue to discuss the topic as well and make commitments on issues where the g-8 can come to consensus . " " development issues including global health , food security , water and sanitation and development assistance will continue to play an important role on the g-8 agenda . " group of eight will still lead on security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-8 will still handle security but it is still not the best option the g-8 is also likely to continue to take the lead on issues which fit better on its agenda , such as political security issues including counter-terrorism , nuclear non-proliferation , and the promotion of democracy and good governance .
the fact that not all members of the g-20 are democratic or have the capability or will to provide assistance to other countries makes these issues difficult to discuss in the broader g-20 . however , henning meyer believes that neither the g-8 or the g-20 are equipped to tackle security issues . " the most important aspect of multilateral-governance structures is that all or most relevant players are included in the same process , " he said . " neither the g-8 nor the g-20 in my view are suited to deal with security issues or non-proliferation .
this is the job of the un .
the g-8 or g-20 in effect are just formalized regular meetings where governments consult .
none of the outcomes of these meetings are directly binding because the ' agreements in principle ' have to be implemented nationally .
the un has more tools at its disposal . " despite this , the g-8 appears to be safe as long as its involvement in certain areas where the g-20 is too unwieldy to be effective continues and support remains among its members and those external powers that rely on its influence , such as african nations who fear that needed development assistance might disappear without the g-8 . however , a shift toward the g-20 's brand of global governance seems unstoppable with many of the world 's emerging markets , as well as the developed countries like australia who are not members of the g-8 , pushing for full inclusion in the global decision-making process . the g-8 may not be about to disband but it certainly appears to be on the verge of having to accept a new reality where its powers are curbed and where it has to concede influence to a larger forum . author : nick amies editor : rob mudge back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 28.03.2010 teach first makes the grade in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teach first fellows are eager to leave mark at problem schools modeled on similar programs in britain and the us , teach first germany attracts high-achieving graduates to challenged schools , aiming to change attitudes and improve society . on a cold thursday morning in march , johannes terwitte is in charge of ensuring schoolyard discipline at the ernst-schering school in berlin 's wedding district .
the 25-year-old graduate of oxford university and the hertie school of governance in berlin was watching a bunch of youngsters enjoying a game of basketball in a break between morning classes .
terwitte is one of 66 high-achieving college graduates who were sent to problem schools in september 2009 under a program run by teach first germany - a not-for-profit charity founded four years ago .
" this brings you to a new level . it 's like a consulting job that requires 70- or 80-hour work weeks , " he said .
' he 's one of us ' during the break , a 14-year-old student of german-turkish origin asks terwitte politely if he can go to the school 's office to check on his next classes .
this kind of discipline and good manners was n't always the norm at the ernst-schering school , where students have earned a reputation for violent behavior , absenteeism and under-achieving .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence was a problem at ernst-schering school the school is situated in a section of berlin dominated by poor immigrant families .
some 85 percent of the school 's children are on free meals , and their parents are often dependent on social welfare .
in spite of his elite academic pedigree , terwitte managed to win the respect of the school 's students . many have even grown fond of him in the seven months he 's spent at the school .
" his music classes are really varied , and always a lot of fun , " said ahed , an 8th grade student .
he also said that terwitte was not just " focused on grades " and listens to the " student 's needs . "
" you can also always approach him with personal things , " said bethlehem , a student from ethiopia .
" he 's one of us because he understands us , " ahed concluded .
but terwitte is not only popular among the school 's students .
the teachers like him too , and do n't regret their decision to apply for a teach first fellow .
" he 's building bridges between the students and the regular teachers , " said marion buerck , a biology and chemistry teacher . buerck called teach first " a wonderful program that should definitely be enlarged . "
' perfect mixture of mind and heart ' under the german teach first program , fellows like terwitte are given two-year contracts that earn them about 1,700 euros -lrb- $ 2,268 -rrb- per month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fellows face a rigid selection process before they are sent to the schools the first 66 fellows were sent to the schools in september 2009 .
they were selected from more than 700 graduates who had initially applied .
" we are looking for the perfect mixture of mind and heart , " said kaija landsberg , the founder of teach first germany .
a graduate of the hertie school of governance in berlin , landsberg wrote her master 's thesis on the problems of integration .
during her studies she came across teach first in britain and teach for america in the united states .
" academic excellence is not enough , " landsberg said .
" what we also need is a high degree of involvement in fields such as social work , cultural initiatives or sports .
applicants must prove they are willing to take leadership positions . "
struggling against the odds landsberg said most of the graduates that apply to teach first were driven by the desire " to give something back to society " after they had received " the privilege of first-class education . "
" what unites us all is the shared belief that more must be done in the education system to serve those who have n't been served so far , " she said .
but teach first has received a lot of criticism from the german teacher 's trade union , which accuses the program of aiming to " de-professionalize " the teaching profession .
the union also questioned the " philanthropic motives " of the graduates .
" we are not lowering any bars , " landsberg says .
" the fellows do n't do the jobs of regular teachers .
it 's just a new way for them to discover the teaching profession , for which they would need additional qualifications anyway . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teach first fellows are used to a different world a different type of leader but turning high-achieving college graduates into teachers is n't the focus of teach first . landsberg says the goal is to make the fellows take what they experienced in the schools " to the next level " of their careers .
" we really need people who have been on the ground and know what it 's about , so they will be to change policies , change companies and change society , " she said .
terwitte said his new job at the ernst-schering school required " a degree of energy unparalleled in his previous life . " he called his endeavor both " taxing and rewarding . "
" sometimes i catch myself thinking : gosh , am i taking more out of this than i 'm able to give to the kids ?
because in many ways i 'm growing , " he said , before adding , " teach first fellows are pre-destined to carry on this work , wherever they go in their future lives . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de global governance -pipe- 28.03.2010 as g-20 expands its influence , g-8 faces reduced role 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-8 is seeing its influence wane in certain policy areas the shift towards an era of global governance appears to be driven by the expanding power of the g-20 .
as more nations lobby to have their say in world affairs , the g-8 faces a future of reduced influence and relevance . foreign ministers from the group of eight -lrb- g-8 -rrb- major countries gather in the resort city of gatineau in quebec , canada on march 29-30 to lay the groundwork for the g-8 summit meeting to be held in muskoka , ontario , in june .
during the two-day talks , the ministers from britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states will discuss a number of issues , including nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament , how to ensure peace and stability on the volatile afghanistan-pakistan border , and the consequences of terrorism and how to support nations with security vulnerabilities .
the g-8 summit in ontario on june 25-26 is shaping up to be a particularly important one , and not just because of the fluid nature of the global challenges the organization is currently facing .
while matters such as the nuclear ambitions of iran and north korea , the instability in the afghan-pakistan border regions and the threat of international terrorism are undoubtedly more pressing now than they were at the last annual summit in l 'aquila , italy in 2009 , the ontario summit could be a historic one in itself .
some observers have suggested it may be the g-8 's last .
driven by its role in addressing the impact of the global economic crisis , the g-20 organization - finance ministers and central bank governors from the world 's top 20 economies - is being viewed by some as the dominant power bloc in a new era of global governance .
the g-8 has served in various forms as the world 's leading economic forum since 1975 but at its summit in pittsburgh in september 2009 , the g-20 announced that its leaders had " endorsed the g-20 as the premier forum for their international economic cooperation . "
financial crisis exposed g-8 's limitations bildunterschrift : the g-20 's global inclusiveness in addressing the economic crisis showed up the g-8 's limitations while the g-8 focuses more on issues such as security and climate change and leaves its economic and financial policy to the g-7 - essentially the finance ministers of the g-8 minus russia - the rise of the g-20 and the expansion of its powers has some experts wondering how long the g-8 and g-7 can survive in the face of an increasingly influential , more inclusive global decision-making body . " the g-8 - if it survives at all - will be a much less powerful gathering and for a very good reason , " dr. henning meyer , head of the european programme at the global policy institute in london , told deutsche welle . " in the wake of the financial crisis everybody could witness the level of interdependence in the world .
and it became clear that a political structure that excludes important rising countries such as india , china and brazil simply does not have the scope to deal with those global issues . " " as with other institutions of global governance , like the united nations , it became clear that the structure of the g-8 does not reflect global realities enough , " he added . " if global problems of the magnitude of the financial crisis persist , which is very likely , then the real power of the g-8 will permanently shift to the g-20 or some other form of broader political structure .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 28.03.2010 italian regions vote in litmus test for berlusconi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's been a tough year for silvio berlusconi voters have begun casting ballots in italy 's regional elections which are largely seen as a key test of prime minister silvio berlusconi 's popularity after a year dominated by political and personal scandals . ever since media magnate silvio berlusconi stepped onto the italian political scene almost 16 years ago , experts have been predicting his imminent demise .
the two-day regional elections , which started on sunday , march 28 , are no different . the leader is down in the polls and the votes garnered by his people 's freedom party will partly be viewed as reflecting confidence – or lack thereof – in the prime minister . but berlusconi 's power has long hinged on forming pacts with other parties .
myrta merlino , who hosts a financial program on television called the domino effect , said the elections will also be pivotal for the far-right northern league party , known as the lega in italian . " for the first time , two major regions are likely to go to the lega , " merlino said .
" and if they win , the weight of the lega in the central government will be very , very big .
the northern region will ask to have more money for the efficient regions and less for the south .
and so also for the unity of the country , these elections are important . " resentment against south bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents have accused berlusconi of changing laws for his own benefit the northern league is fiscally conservative , and has long expressed resentment toward southern italy 's dependency on government jobs to keep its population employed .
the lega also has the sympathy of berlusconi 's most powerful minister - finance minister giulio tremonti . the elections are also seen as a test for the left .
years of infighting , ineffective leadership and a series of its own scandals have kept italians from considering the center-left democratic party as a real option . antonio polito , editor of il riformista magazine and a former senator in the southern region of campania , said the regional elections are a chance for the italian left to get the new start it 's looking for . " at the moment , the opposition is unelectable , " polito said .
" if we had general elections now , the center-left would lose .
so the regional elections are an important step to rebuild credibility in the country . " changes in perception and if the left does gain what it 's seeking - more votes and a shift in perception that they could lead italy - it does n't necessarily spell the end of berlusconi . milano finanza magazine editor pierluigi magnaschi said it 's unlikely berlusconi will be going anywhere before the end of his term as prime minister . " i think the end of berlusconi is not near , " said magnaschi .
" he will finish in three years .
after that , the political games are open . " author : megan williams / svs editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 28.03.2010 german school 's board members step down amid sex abuse scandal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-students have demanded a purge at odenwald five out of seven board members of the prestigious odenwald private boarding school have resigned amid revelations that several of its teachers sexually abused pupils more than two decades ago . the revelations of past abuse at the non-religious boarding school near the southern town of heppenheim in the state of hesse come at a time when catholic institutions in germany and elsewhere are facing similar allegations .
only the school principal margarita kaufmann and general manager meto salijevic remain in office following the meeting on saturday , march 27 .
the school says 33 ex-pupils have reported they were sexually abused in the period from 1966 to 1991 .
philipp sturz , one of the school 's 30 trustees , declined to confirm a report in the news magazine " der spiegel " that 40 ex-pupils had lodged complaints and more ex-teachers had been named in the scandal .
abuse allegations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did the pope turn a blind eye to abuse allegations ?
most of the sex abuse scandals which have come to light recently in germany have focused on the catholic church , and the employment of a convicted pedophile priest in 1980 in the city of munich when joseph ratzinger – now pope benedict xvi – served his term as archbishop .
some have questioned whether the pope played a role in the alleged cover-up of some abuse cases .
meanwhile , secular and protestant groups have admitted they also failed in that era to adequately police pedophile attacks on children in care .
last week , germany appointed a special ombudsman to receive and investigate allegations of sex molestation dating from the 1950s in catholic and other private schools .
christine bergmann , a former german minister of family affairs , is tasked with studying cases that happened too long ago to be investigated by police .
germany does not prosecute child sex abuse after the victim turns 28 .
a spate of revelations of abuse and cruelty by clerics and evidence of a cover-up by the church hierarchy has also emerged in other european countries like ireland , austria , the netherlands and switzerland , as well as in the united states. rb / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

abuse allegations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did the pope turn a blind eye to abuse allegations ?
most of the sex abuse scandals which have come to light recently in germany have focused on the catholic church , and the employment of a convicted pedophile priest in 1980 in the city of munich when joseph ratzinger – now pope benedict xvi – served his term as archbishop .
some have questioned whether the pope played a role in the alleged cover-up of some abuse cases .

last week , germany appointed a special ombudsman to receive and investigate allegations of sex molestation dating from the 1950s in catholic and other private schools .

the move came after spain , which holds the eu presidency , said the names of libyans had been removed from a swiss-instigated visa blacklist . spain 's foreign ministry announced in a statement on saturday that the visa blacklist against 188 libyans had been torn up and expressed regret as part of a diplomatic drive by european union leaders .
the foreign ministry in madrid expressed said it " deplored " the problems that the ban had caused to libyans .
the ban was imposed on the initiative of switzerland , which has been embroiled in a long-standing diplomatic row with libya .
tripoli responded in kind by putting out a communiqué .
" in the interests of strengthening its cooperation with the european union , libya lifts the restrictions it earlier imposed on the citizens of the schengen zone , " the libyan foreign ministry said in a statement published by the state news agency jana , referring to the 25-nation visa-free zone in europe .
switzerland is part of the schengen zone but not a member of the 27-nation eu .

the crisis assumed an eu-wide dimension earlier this year , with the swiss travel ban and a tit-for-tat prohibition by libya , which said it would stop issuing visas to citizens from all schengen-area countries .
the swiss move not only infuriated libya , but also schengen states which saw it as an unjustified escalation of a bilateral row .

the move came after spain , which holds the eu presidency , said the names of libyans had been removed from a swiss-instigated visa blacklist . spain 's foreign ministry announced in a statement on saturday that the visa blacklist against 188 libyans had been torn up and expressed regret as part of a diplomatic drive by european union leaders .
the foreign ministry in madrid expressed said it " deplored " the problems that the ban had caused to libyans .
the ban was imposed on the initiative of switzerland , which has been embroiled in a long-standing diplomatic row with libya .
tripoli responded in kind by putting out a communiqué .
" in the interests of strengthening its cooperation with the european union , libya lifts the restrictions it earlier imposed on the citizens of the schengen zone , " the libyan foreign ministry said in a statement published by the state news agency jana , referring to the 25-nation visa-free zone in europe .
switzerland is part of the schengen zone but not a member of the 27-nation eu .
libya had insisted on the eu apologizing for the row , something that spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos had agreed to during a recent visit to tripoli , according to the libyan ambassador to spain .
last week , switzerland said that it was prepared to lift the ban it had imposed in january on libyan officials , including leader moamer gaddafi , for entry into the schengen zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gaddafi had called for a jihad against switzerland after the swiss ban on minarets strife escalates the spat between libya and switzerland dates back to 2008 , when gaddafi 's son , hannibal , was arrested in geneva , allegedly for mistreating his domestic help .
the charges were later dropped but tripoli retaliated by arresting two swiss men on visa charges .

germany has been charged with the task since 2002 . thomas de maiziere 's trip to kabul is the first visit to afghanistan by a german interior minister in six years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de global governance -pipe- 28.03.2010 as g-20 expands its influence , g-8 faces reduced role 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-8 is seeing its influence wane in certain policy areas the shift towards an era of global governance appears to be driven by the expanding power of the g-20 .
as more nations lobby to have their say in world affairs , the g-8 faces a future of reduced influence and relevance . foreign ministers from the group of eight -lrb- g-8 -rrb- major countries gather in the resort city of gatineau in quebec , canada on march 29-30 to lay the groundwork for the g-8 summit meeting to be held in muskoka , ontario , in june .
during the two-day talks , the ministers from britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states will discuss a number of issues , including nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament , how to ensure peace and stability on the volatile afghanistan-pakistan border , and the consequences of terrorism and how to support nations with security vulnerabilities .
the g-8 summit in ontario on june 25-26 is shaping up to be a particularly important one , and not just because of the fluid nature of the global challenges the organization is currently facing .
while matters such as the nuclear ambitions of iran and north korea , the instability in the afghan-pakistan border regions and the threat of international terrorism are undoubtedly more pressing now than they were at the last annual summit in l 'aquila , italy in 2009 , the ontario summit could be a historic one in itself .
some observers have suggested it may be the g-8 's last .
driven by its role in addressing the impact of the global economic crisis , the g-20 organization - finance ministers and central bank governors from the world 's top 20 economies - is being viewed by some as the dominant power bloc in a new era of global governance .
the g-8 has served in various forms as the world 's leading economic forum since 1975 but at its summit in pittsburgh in september 2009 , the g-20 announced that its leaders had " endorsed the g-20 as the premier forum for their international economic cooperation . "
financial crisis exposed g-8 's limitations bildunterschrift : the g-20 's global inclusiveness in addressing the economic crisis showed up the g-8 's limitations while the g-8 focuses more on issues such as security and climate change and leaves its economic and financial policy to the g-7 - essentially the finance ministers of the g-8 minus russia - the rise of the g-20 and the expansion of its powers has some experts wondering how long the g-8 and g-7 can survive in the face of an increasingly influential , more inclusive global decision-making body . " the g-8 - if it survives at all - will be a much less powerful gathering and for a very good reason , " dr. henning meyer , head of the european programme at the global policy institute in london , told deutsche welle . " in the wake of the financial crisis everybody could witness the level of interdependence in the world .
and it became clear that a political structure that excludes important rising countries such as india , china and brazil simply does not have the scope to deal with those global issues . " " as with other institutions of global governance , like the united nations , it became clear that the structure of the g-8 does not reflect global realities enough , " he added . " if global problems of the magnitude of the financial crisis persist , which is very likely , then the real power of the g-8 will permanently shift to the g-20 or some other form of broader political structure .

-lrb- 26.09.2009 -rrb- opinion : the g-20 summit in pittsburgh - a new chapter in world politics ?
the group of 20 leading economies meets in pittsburg on thursday and friday .
the summit will yield few concrete results but will show that the days of the g-8 are over , says dw 's economics editor henrik boehme .
-lrb- 23.09.2009 -rrb- is the earth still governable ?
huge challenges for international development policy the coming decade will show whether mankind will be able to work together effectively to tackle global challenges like reducing poverty and conflicts while boosting development worldwide , says prof. dr. dirk messner .

the 25-year-old graduate of oxford university and the hertie school of governance in berlin was watching a bunch of youngsters enjoying a game of basketball in a break between morning classes .
terwitte is one of 66 high-achieving college graduates who were sent to problem schools in september 2009 under a program run by teach first germany - a not-for-profit charity founded four years ago .
" this brings you to a new level . it 's like a consulting job that requires 70- or 80-hour work weeks , " he said .
' he 's one of us ' during the break , a 14-year-old student of german-turkish origin asks terwitte politely if he can go to the school 's office to check on his next classes .
this kind of discipline and good manners was n't always the norm at the ernst-schering school , where students have earned a reputation for violent behavior , absenteeism and under-achieving .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence was a problem at ernst-schering school the school is situated in a section of berlin dominated by poor immigrant families .
some 85 percent of the school 's children are on free meals , and their parents are often dependent on social welfare .
in spite of his elite academic pedigree , terwitte managed to win the respect of the school 's students . many have even grown fond of him in the seven months he 's spent at the school .
" his music classes are really varied , and always a lot of fun , " said ahed , an 8th grade student .
he also said that terwitte was not just " focused on grades " and listens to the " student 's needs . "
" you can also always approach him with personal things , " said bethlehem , a student from ethiopia .
" he 's one of us because he understands us , " ahed concluded .
but terwitte is not only popular among the school 's students .
the teachers like him too , and do n't regret their decision to apply for a teach first fellow .
" he 's building bridges between the students and the regular teachers , " said marion buerck , a biology and chemistry teacher . buerck called teach first " a wonderful program that should definitely be enlarged . "
' perfect mixture of mind and heart ' under the german teach first program , fellows like terwitte are given two-year contracts that earn them about 1,700 euros -lrb- $ 2,268 -rrb- per month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fellows face a rigid selection process before they are sent to the schools the first 66 fellows were sent to the schools in september 2009 .
they were selected from more than 700 graduates who had initially applied .
" we are looking for the perfect mixture of mind and heart , " said kaija landsberg , the founder of teach first germany .
a graduate of the hertie school of governance in berlin , landsberg wrote her master 's thesis on the problems of integration .
during her studies she came across teach first in britain and teach for america in the united states .
" academic excellence is not enough , " landsberg said .
" what we also need is a high degree of involvement in fields such as social work , cultural initiatives or sports .
applicants must prove they are willing to take leadership positions . "
struggling against the odds landsberg said most of the graduates that apply to teach first were driven by the desire " to give something back to society " after they had received " the privilege of first-class education . "
" what unites us all is the shared belief that more must be done in the education system to serve those who have n't been served so far , " she said .
but teach first has received a lot of criticism from the german teacher 's trade union , which accuses the program of aiming to " de-professionalize " the teaching profession .
the union also questioned the " philanthropic motives " of the graduates .
" we are not lowering any bars , " landsberg says .
" the fellows do n't do the jobs of regular teachers .
it 's just a new way for them to discover the teaching profession , for which they would need additional qualifications anyway . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teach first fellows are used to a different world a different type of leader but turning high-achieving college graduates into teachers is n't the focus of teach first . landsberg says the goal is to make the fellows take what they experienced in the schools " to the next level " of their careers .
" we really need people who have been on the ground and know what it 's about , so they will be to change policies , change companies and change society , " she said .
terwitte said his new job at the ernst-schering school required " a degree of energy unparalleled in his previous life . " he called his endeavor both " taxing and rewarding . "
" sometimes i catch myself thinking : gosh , am i taking more out of this than i 'm able to give to the kids ?

as more nations lobby to have their say in world affairs , the g-8 faces a future of reduced influence and relevance . foreign ministers from the group of eight -lrb- g-8 -rrb- major countries gather in the resort city of gatineau in quebec , canada on march 29-30 to lay the groundwork for the g-8 summit meeting to be held in muskoka , ontario , in june .
during the two-day talks , the ministers from britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states will discuss a number of issues , including nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament , how to ensure peace and stability on the volatile afghanistan-pakistan border , and the consequences of terrorism and how to support nations with security vulnerabilities .
the g-8 summit in ontario on june 25-26 is shaping up to be a particularly important one , and not just because of the fluid nature of the global challenges the organization is currently facing .
while matters such as the nuclear ambitions of iran and north korea , the instability in the afghan-pakistan border regions and the threat of international terrorism are undoubtedly more pressing now than they were at the last annual summit in l 'aquila , italy in 2009 , the ontario summit could be a historic one in itself .
some observers have suggested it may be the g-8 's last .
driven by its role in addressing the impact of the global economic crisis , the g-20 organization - finance ministers and central bank governors from the world 's top 20 economies - is being viewed by some as the dominant power bloc in a new era of global governance .
the g-8 has served in various forms as the world 's leading economic forum since 1975 but at its summit in pittsburgh in september 2009 , the g-20 announced that its leaders had " endorsed the g-20 as the premier forum for their international economic cooperation . "
financial crisis exposed g-8 's limitations bildunterschrift : the g-20 's global inclusiveness in addressing the economic crisis showed up the g-8 's limitations while the g-8 focuses more on issues such as security and climate change and leaves its economic and financial policy to the g-7 - essentially the finance ministers of the g-8 minus russia - the rise of the g-20 and the expansion of its powers has some experts wondering how long the g-8 and g-7 can survive in the face of an increasingly influential , more inclusive global decision-making body . " the g-8 - if it survives at all - will be a much less powerful gathering and for a very good reason , " dr. henning meyer , head of the european programme at the global policy institute in london , told deutsche welle . " in the wake of the financial crisis everybody could witness the level of interdependence in the world .
and it became clear that a political structure that excludes important rising countries such as india , china and brazil simply does not have the scope to deal with those global issues . " " as with other institutions of global governance , like the united nations , it became clear that the structure of the g-8 does not reflect global realities enough , " he added . " if global problems of the magnitude of the financial crisis persist , which is very likely , then the real power of the g-8 will permanently shift to the g-20 or some other form of broader political structure .

financial crisis exposed g-8 's limitations bildunterschrift : the g-20 's global inclusiveness in addressing the economic crisis showed up the g-8 's limitations while the g-8 focuses more on issues such as security and climate change and leaves its economic and financial policy to the g-7 - essentially the finance ministers of the g-8 minus russia - the rise of the g-20 and the expansion of its powers has some experts wondering how long the g-8 and g-7 can survive in the face of an increasingly influential , more inclusive global decision-making body . " the g-8 - if it survives at all - will be a much less powerful gathering and for a very good reason , " dr. henning meyer , head of the european programme at the global policy institute in london , told deutsche welle . " in the wake of the financial crisis everybody could witness the level of interdependence in the world .
and it became clear that a political structure that excludes important rising countries such as india , china and brazil simply does not have the scope to deal with those global issues . " " as with other institutions of global governance , like the united nations , it became clear that the structure of the g-8 does not reflect global realities enough , " he added . " if global problems of the magnitude of the financial crisis persist , which is very likely , then the real power of the g-8 will permanently shift to the g-20 or some other form of broader political structure .

" on certain areas of finance , development , energy and climate change , both organizations have played a role but economic and financial issues will be taken up more and more by the g-20 , " she told deutsche welle . it is also likely that the g-20 wo n't limit its growing influence to purely economic matters , which could marginalise the g-8 even more .

" on the issue of climate change , the g-8 has long realized that there are key countries , who are members of the g-20 , that need to be included in the debate , " she said .

the fact that not all members of the g-20 are democratic or have the capability or will to provide assistance to other countries makes these issues difficult to discuss in the broader g-20 . however , henning meyer believes that neither the g-8 or the g-20 are equipped to tackle security issues .

the g-20 has recently expanded its reach into financing development projects - prompted by the earthquake in haiti - and has started to play a larger role on issues such as energy and climate change , and in particular climate financing . g-8 likely to remain influential on climate , development bildunterschrift : the g-8 will still take the lead on climate change and development policy but will need the g-20 's help guebert believes that while the g-20 's influence will continue to grow in areas which are traditionally within the remit of the g-8 , the group of eight will maintain a strong role in climate policy making and establishing development mechanisms while accepting that the g-20 's involvement is necessary . " on the issue of climate change , the g-8 has long realized that there are key countries , who are members of the g-20 , that need to be included in the debate , " she said .
" however , the g-8 will likely continue to discuss the topic as well and make commitments on issues where the g-8 can come to consensus . " " development issues including global health , food security , water and sanitation and development assistance will continue to play an important role on the g-8 agenda . " group of eight will still lead on security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-8 will still handle security but it is still not the best option the g-8 is also likely to continue to take the lead on issues which fit better on its agenda , such as political security issues including counter-terrorism , nuclear non-proliferation , and the promotion of democracy and good governance .
the fact that not all members of the g-20 are democratic or have the capability or will to provide assistance to other countries makes these issues difficult to discuss in the broader g-20 . however , henning meyer believes that neither the g-8 or the g-20 are equipped to tackle security issues . " the most important aspect of multilateral-governance structures is that all or most relevant players are included in the same process , " he said . " neither the g-8 nor the g-20 in my view are suited to deal with security issues or non-proliferation .
this is the job of the un .
the g-8 or g-20 in effect are just formalized regular meetings where governments consult .
none of the outcomes of these meetings are directly binding because the ' agreements in principle ' have to be implemented nationally .
the un has more tools at its disposal . " despite this , the g-8 appears to be safe as long as its involvement in certain areas where the g-20 is too unwieldy to be effective continues and support remains among its members and those external powers that rely on its influence , such as african nations who fear that needed development assistance might disappear without the g-8 . however , a shift toward the g-20 's brand of global governance seems unstoppable with many of the world 's emerging markets , as well as the developed countries like australia who are not members of the g-8 , pushing for full inclusion in the global decision-making process . the g-8 may not be about to disband but it certainly appears to be on the verge of having to accept a new reality where its powers are curbed and where it has to concede influence to a larger forum . author : nick amies editor : rob mudge back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 25-year-old graduate of oxford university and the hertie school of governance in berlin was watching a bunch of youngsters enjoying a game of basketball in a break between morning classes .
terwitte is one of 66 high-achieving college graduates who were sent to problem schools in september 2009 under a program run by teach first germany - a not-for-profit charity founded four years ago .
" this brings you to a new level . it 's like a consulting job that requires 70- or 80-hour work weeks , " he said .
' he 's one of us ' during the break , a 14-year-old student of german-turkish origin asks terwitte politely if he can go to the school 's office to check on his next classes .
this kind of discipline and good manners was n't always the norm at the ernst-schering school , where students have earned a reputation for violent behavior , absenteeism and under-achieving .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence was a problem at ernst-schering school the school is situated in a section of berlin dominated by poor immigrant families .
some 85 percent of the school 's children are on free meals , and their parents are often dependent on social welfare .
in spite of his elite academic pedigree , terwitte managed to win the respect of the school 's students . many have even grown fond of him in the seven months he 's spent at the school .
" his music classes are really varied , and always a lot of fun , " said ahed , an 8th grade student .
he also said that terwitte was not just " focused on grades " and listens to the " student 's needs . "
" you can also always approach him with personal things , " said bethlehem , a student from ethiopia .
" he 's one of us because he understands us , " ahed concluded .
but terwitte is not only popular among the school 's students .
the teachers like him too , and do n't regret their decision to apply for a teach first fellow .
" he 's building bridges between the students and the regular teachers , " said marion buerck , a biology and chemistry teacher . buerck called teach first " a wonderful program that should definitely be enlarged . "
' perfect mixture of mind and heart ' under the german teach first program , fellows like terwitte are given two-year contracts that earn them about 1,700 euros -lrb- $ 2,268 -rrb- per month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fellows face a rigid selection process before they are sent to the schools the first 66 fellows were sent to the schools in september 2009 .
they were selected from more than 700 graduates who had initially applied .
" we are looking for the perfect mixture of mind and heart , " said kaija landsberg , the founder of teach first germany .
a graduate of the hertie school of governance in berlin , landsberg wrote her master 's thesis on the problems of integration .
during her studies she came across teach first in britain and teach for america in the united states .
" academic excellence is not enough , " landsberg said .
" what we also need is a high degree of involvement in fields such as social work , cultural initiatives or sports .
applicants must prove they are willing to take leadership positions . "
struggling against the odds landsberg said most of the graduates that apply to teach first were driven by the desire " to give something back to society " after they had received " the privilege of first-class education . "
" what unites us all is the shared belief that more must be done in the education system to serve those who have n't been served so far , " she said .
but teach first has received a lot of criticism from the german teacher 's trade union , which accuses the program of aiming to " de-professionalize " the teaching profession .
the union also questioned the " philanthropic motives " of the graduates .
" we are not lowering any bars , " landsberg says .
" the fellows do n't do the jobs of regular teachers .
it 's just a new way for them to discover the teaching profession , for which they would need additional qualifications anyway . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teach first fellows are used to a different world a different type of leader but turning high-achieving college graduates into teachers is n't the focus of teach first . landsberg says the goal is to make the fellows take what they experienced in the schools " to the next level " of their careers .
" we really need people who have been on the ground and know what it 's about , so they will be to change policies , change companies and change society , " she said .
terwitte said his new job at the ernst-schering school required " a degree of energy unparalleled in his previous life . " he called his endeavor both " taxing and rewarding . "
" sometimes i catch myself thinking : gosh , am i taking more out of this than i 'm able to give to the kids ?
because in many ways i 'm growing , " he said , before adding , " teach first fellows are pre-destined to carry on this work , wherever they go in their future lives . "

germany has been charged with the task since 2002 . thomas de maiziere 's trip to kabul is the first visit to afghanistan by a german interior minister in six years .
germany has been tasked with training afghan police forces since 2002 , and de maiziere is in afghanistan to discuss the slow progress of the mission .
" it 's no success story , but things are improving " said de maiziere .
" the new strategy will hopefully start working , but we can not set the bar too high . "
the german government has outlined a new afghanistan strategy which foresees a new emphasis on training afghan security forces and boosting the number of german instructors to do the job .
on sunday , de maiziere met with his afghan counterpart mohammad hanif atmar and general stanley mcchrystal , the american commander of nato troops in afghanistan .
representatives from the european union police force eupol were also in attendance .
redoubled efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more german police experts are expected this year in afghanistan currently , there are 190 german police experts in afghanistan helping to train afghan police .
this number is scheduled to increase to 260 in 2010 .
by 2014 , 134,000 afghan police are hoped to be in service .
at the moment , there are just under 100,000 .
speaking through a military spokesman , de maiziere said he was optimistic that " success can still be achieved in afghanistan . "
however , recruiting trainees for the afghan police force has its share of difficulties .
an estimated 1,400 afghan police officers were killed last year alone during operations against the taliban . the afghan interior ministry is also investigating how many of the afghan police signed up on the force are actually serving .
drug addiction , illiteracy and corruption are common problems among the officers .
surprise visit from obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai , left , hosted obama at the presidential palace in kabul as de maiziere conducted his meetings in kabul , us president barack obama was en route to the afghan capital for a surprise meeting with afghan president hamid karzai .
the two leaders discussed making progress on good governance , rule of law , and anti-corruption efforts underway in afghanistan . later , obama visited the american airfield bagram in parvan province , where he addressed american troops stationed there . the trip to afghanistan is obama 's first as the commander in chief of the american military forces. mz / dpa / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany has been charged with the task since 2002 . thomas de maiziere 's trip to kabul is the first visit to afghanistan by a german interior minister in six years .
germany has been tasked with training afghan police forces since 2002 , and de maiziere is in afghanistan to discuss the slow progress of the mission .
" it 's no success story , but things are improving " said de maiziere .
" the new strategy will hopefully start working , but we can not set the bar too high . "
the german government has outlined a new afghanistan strategy which foresees a new emphasis on training afghan security forces and boosting the number of german instructors to do the job .

the move comes as some other european nations have already opened their doors to former prisoners . according to an interior ministry spokesman , berlin is talking to washington about relocating suitable detainees after they get released from the us-owned guantanamo bay prison in cuba . an unnamed interior ministry official said on saturday , march 27 , that his ministry had " opened talks anew with the united states on this matter . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some prisoners , going home is not an option the discussions were taking place with the approval of the foreign ministry and chancellor angela merkel 's office " on a case-by-case basis , " the official added . meanwhile , the german news magazine " der spiegel " reported that a delegation from berlin recently visited guantanamo to meet with several inmates , including a palestinian , a jordanian and a syrian who are likely candidates for resettlement . spiegel said the delegation , including police and immigration officials , had interviewed the men to assess their suitability and any potential risks if they were to be taken in . risk assessment last year , germany had considered accepting prisoners but later backed off amid concerns that the men could prove dangerous . the interior ministry said on saturday that berlin supported washington 's efforts to close the prison camp and that this had been consistent german policy . spiegel said us special envoy daniel fried had had months of confidential talks last year with the interior ministry , culminating in the handing over of a list of nine candidates .
some of them have since found homes in other nations . the newspaper said the remaining candidates for resettlement included a palestinian from the west bank who was part of a conservative group of imams and had been arrested in pakistan . a jordanian who traveled to afghanistan in the summer of 2001 was also on the list as was a syrian , who had been treated at a kabul hospital at the end of 2001 , and was arrested shortly after his discharge .

the move comes as some other european nations have already opened their doors to former prisoners . according to an interior ministry spokesman , berlin is talking to washington about relocating suitable detainees after they get released from the us-owned guantanamo bay prison in cuba . an unnamed interior ministry official said on saturday , march 27 , that his ministry had " opened talks anew with the united states on this matter . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some prisoners , going home is not an option the discussions were taking place with the approval of the foreign ministry and chancellor angela merkel 's office " on a case-by-case basis , " the official added . meanwhile , the german news magazine " der spiegel " reported that a delegation from berlin recently visited guantanamo to meet with several inmates , including a palestinian , a jordanian and a syrian who are likely candidates for resettlement . spiegel said the delegation , including police and immigration officials , had interviewed the men to assess their suitability and any potential risks if they were to be taken in . risk assessment last year , germany had considered accepting prisoners but later backed off amid concerns that the men could prove dangerous . the interior ministry said on saturday that berlin supported washington 's efforts to close the prison camp and that this had been consistent german policy . spiegel said us special envoy daniel fried had had months of confidential talks last year with the interior ministry , culminating in the handing over of a list of nine candidates .
some of them have since found homes in other nations . the newspaper said the remaining candidates for resettlement included a palestinian from the west bank who was part of a conservative group of imams and had been arrested in pakistan . a jordanian who traveled to afghanistan in the summer of 2001 was also on the list as was a syrian , who had been treated at a kabul hospital at the end of 2001 , and was arrested shortly after his discharge .
the united states wants to release all three men . bildunterschrift : prisoners who are no longer regarded as enemy combatants are eligible for release missed deadline president barack obama 's administration has been reluctant to send some guantanamo prisoners back to their home countries because they might suffer reprisal after being held in us custody . obama had pledged to close down the guantanamo camp by january this year , but some 200 detainees continue to be held there as finding them new homes is proving difficult . european countries are divided over whether to accept freed guantanamo detainees : while most appear reluctant , some have openly expressed support . last week , two chinese uighur men who were released from the detention camp in cuba arrived in switzerland .
in february , the first of five inmates slated to be accepted by spain arrived in madrid . rb / dpa / ap editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the two-day regional elections , which started on sunday , march 28 , are no different . the leader is down in the polls and the votes garnered by his people 's freedom party will partly be viewed as reflecting confidence – or lack thereof – in the prime minister . but berlusconi 's power has long hinged on forming pacts with other parties .
myrta merlino , who hosts a financial program on television called the domino effect , said the elections will also be pivotal for the far-right northern league party , known as the lega in italian . " for the first time , two major regions are likely to go to the lega , " merlino said .

" many civilians were killed -lrb- numbers vary between 50 and 100 -rrb- , " the email was reported to have read . a spokesman for the government said that the e-mail had been an unconfirmed preliminary report and that the message content had already been handed over to the parliamentary investigation . in addition to arnold 's comments , spd parliamentary speaker thomas oppermann said that the chancellor should have done more , and sooner , to explain the nature of injuries and fatalities caused by the biggest attack involving german troops since the second world war . claims of electioneering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oppermann said the chancellor should have done more to explain , sooner but andreas schockenhoff , the conservative parliamentary group 's vice chairman , rejected the criticism and accused the spd of electioneering tactics ahead of regional voting in the state of north rhine-westphalia . " the claim that angela merkel has not been open about kunduz and its consequences is malicious , " schockenhoff told the german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung . the parliamentary investigation aims to clarify events before and after german colonel georg klein ordered an airstrike on two hijacked fuel tankers .
up to 142 people were killed in the strike , including , it is believed , dozens of civilians . the incident led to a political storm in germany , claiming the jobs of the former minister of defense , franz josef jung , and gemany 's top military officer , wolfgang schneiderhan . rc / dpa / afp / reuters / ap editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany has been charged with the task since 2002 . thomas de maiziere 's trip to kabul is the first visit to afghanistan by a german interior minister in six years .
germany has been tasked with training afghan police forces since 2002 , and de maiziere is in afghanistan to discuss the slow progress of the mission .
" it 's no success story , but things are improving " said de maiziere .
" the new strategy will hopefully start working , but we can not set the bar too high . "
the german government has outlined a new afghanistan strategy which foresees a new emphasis on training afghan security forces and boosting the number of german instructors to do the job .

by 2014 , 134,000 afghan police are hoped to be in service .
at the moment , there are just under 100,000 .
speaking through a military spokesman , de maiziere said he was optimistic that " success can still be achieved in afghanistan . "
however , recruiting trainees for the afghan police force has its share of difficulties .
an estimated 1,400 afghan police officers were killed last year alone during operations against the taliban . the afghan interior ministry is also investigating how many of the afghan police signed up on the force are actually serving .

only the school principal margarita kaufmann and general manager meto salijevic remain in office following the meeting on saturday , march 27 .
the school says 33 ex-pupils have reported they were sexually abused in the period from 1966 to 1991 .
philipp sturz , one of the school 's 30 trustees , declined to confirm a report in the news magazine " der spiegel " that 40 ex-pupils had lodged complaints and more ex-teachers had been named in the scandal .
abuse allegations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did the pope turn a blind eye to abuse allegations ?
most of the sex abuse scandals which have come to light recently in germany have focused on the catholic church , and the employment of a convicted pedophile priest in 1980 in the city of munich when joseph ratzinger – now pope benedict xvi – served his term as archbishop .
some have questioned whether the pope played a role in the alleged cover-up of some abuse cases .
meanwhile , secular and protestant groups have admitted they also failed in that era to adequately police pedophile attacks on children in care .
last week , germany appointed a special ombudsman to receive and investigate allegations of sex molestation dating from the 1950s in catholic and other private schools .
christine bergmann , a former german minister of family affairs , is tasked with studying cases that happened too long ago to be investigated by police .
germany does not prosecute child sex abuse after the victim turns 28 .
a spate of revelations of abuse and cruelty by clerics and evidence of a cover-up by the church hierarchy has also emerged in other european countries like ireland , austria , the netherlands and switzerland , as well as in the united states. rb / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

abuse allegations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did the pope turn a blind eye to abuse allegations ?
most of the sex abuse scandals which have come to light recently in germany have focused on the catholic church , and the employment of a convicted pedophile priest in 1980 in the city of munich when joseph ratzinger – now pope benedict xvi – served his term as archbishop .
some have questioned whether the pope played a role in the alleged cover-up of some abuse cases .
meanwhile , secular and protestant groups have admitted they also failed in that era to adequately police pedophile attacks on children in care .
last week , germany appointed a special ombudsman to receive and investigate allegations of sex molestation dating from the 1950s in catholic and other private schools .
christine bergmann , a former german minister of family affairs , is tasked with studying cases that happened too long ago to be investigated by police .

germany has been charged with the task since 2002 . thomas de maiziere 's trip to kabul is the first visit to afghanistan by a german interior minister in six years .
germany has been tasked with training afghan police forces since 2002 , and de maiziere is in afghanistan to discuss the slow progress of the mission .
" it 's no success story , but things are improving " said de maiziere .
" the new strategy will hopefully start working , but we can not set the bar too high . "
the german government has outlined a new afghanistan strategy which foresees a new emphasis on training afghan security forces and boosting the number of german instructors to do the job .
on sunday , de maiziere met with his afghan counterpart mohammad hanif atmar and general stanley mcchrystal , the american commander of nato troops in afghanistan .
representatives from the european union police force eupol were also in attendance .
redoubled efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more german police experts are expected this year in afghanistan currently , there are 190 german police experts in afghanistan helping to train afghan police .
this number is scheduled to increase to 260 in 2010 .
by 2014 , 134,000 afghan police are hoped to be in service .
at the moment , there are just under 100,000 .
speaking through a military spokesman , de maiziere said he was optimistic that " success can still be achieved in afghanistan . "
however , recruiting trainees for the afghan police force has its share of difficulties .
an estimated 1,400 afghan police officers were killed last year alone during operations against the taliban . the afghan interior ministry is also investigating how many of the afghan police signed up on the force are actually serving .
drug addiction , illiteracy and corruption are common problems among the officers .
surprise visit from obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai , left , hosted obama at the presidential palace in kabul as de maiziere conducted his meetings in kabul , us president barack obama was en route to the afghan capital for a surprise meeting with afghan president hamid karzai .
the two leaders discussed making progress on good governance , rule of law , and anti-corruption efforts underway in afghanistan . later , obama visited the american airfield bagram in parvan province , where he addressed american troops stationed there . the trip to afghanistan is obama 's first as the commander in chief of the american military forces. mz / dpa / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there are question that , ultimately , only the chancellor can answer , " parliamentary committee chairman rainer arnold , from the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , told german daily newspaper bild on saturday , march 27 . arnold was echoing calls by members of the green and left parties , who said on friday that the chancellor should testify before the committee . the demands come after reports earlier in the week that the chancellor 's office had received information that civilians had been killed in a german-ordered airstrike in afghanistan within hours of the event taking place in september 2009 . much of the parliamentary inquiry is focused on who knew what about the bombing and whether knowledge of civilian casualties was kept quiet . e-mail sent to merkel 's office bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up to 142 people were killed in the nato airstrike , with many others injured the german news weekly der spiegel reported on thursday that the country 's foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- sent an e-mail about the attack and causalities to merkel 's office .

" the claim that angela merkel has not been open about kunduz and its consequences is malicious , " schockenhoff told the german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung . the parliamentary investigation aims to clarify events before and after german colonel georg klein ordered an airstrike on two hijacked fuel tankers .
up to 142 people were killed in the strike , including , it is believed , dozens of civilians . the incident led to a political storm in germany , claiming the jobs of the former minister of defense , franz josef jung , and gemany 's top military officer , wolfgang schneiderhan . rc / dpa / afp / reuters / ap editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
