" one thing that did not work well in copenhagen is that a small circle met and the regional groups felt left out of the debate , " merkel said in bonn on sunday .
germany and mexico hope to get negotiations moving again and have invited representatives from developed and developing countries to bonn to flesh out common ground on environmental issues .
developed versus developing nations mexican president felipe calderon stressed that developing and developed countries must agree on the issue of finance for poorer countries , to enable them to fight climate change .
" this atmosphere of trust is something we really need to make use of for the fast-track financing , " he told ministers in bonn .
" 2010 is the year when we need to take action . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traffic is just one of many climate issues on the agenda the conference - dubbed the petersberg climate dialogue - comes five months after the disastrous summit in copenhagen last december , where countries merely agreed that global temperatures should rise by no more than 2 degrees celsius , but failed to specify any details on how this could be achieved and shared out between the nations .
developing countries have long demanded that richer countries must pay a bigger share in the fight against greenhosue gas emissions , as big industrial nations are the main polluters .
mexico is slated to host the next full-scale un climate summit at the resort of cancun in late november .
meeting designed to re-kindle confidence the petersberg gathering - at germany 's former hilltop government guesthouse when bonn was still the capital - is not expected to make any formal resolutions , but the germans and mexicans are hoping it will come up with ideas to clear the logjam on climate policies .
german environment minister norbert roettgen said the purpose of the meeting was " confidence-building " among emerging and industrial nations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is the world 's biggest polluter , along with the us " we have to get trust and flexibility back into the climate process , " he said .
the german environment minister also urged the european union to take on the pioneering role of developing and implementing low-carbon policies .
the two most important figures at the bonn talks are likely to be the chief us and chinese negotiators .
world leaders realized in copenhagen that climate talks would continue to be very difficult .
already , the president of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , has dampened expectations , telling the german newspaper hamburger abendblatt that there would probably not be any legally binding agreements made in cancun , but perhaps some progress in deciding who makes the sacrifices. gb / ng / dpa / epd / ap / afp editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 02.05.2010 danish-icelandic installation artist takes berlin by storm großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eliasson 's work is an adventure for the eyes olafur eliasson is a star on the art scene , with a well-established studio in berlin .
now , the city is home to a major solo exhibition of his works . olafur eliasson 's art has already been gracing berlin for weeks , though most people would not have realized it .
chalk lines trail through parks and disappear under bushes .
next to some trees and lampposts there are bicycles with mirror-covered wheels .
large logs that arrived with the tide on iceland 's shores lie around the city as if they had fallen there by accident . in addition to all this , a van with an attached mirror has been confronting passers-by , cars , trains , buildings and billboards with their own reflections - a process that was filmed and is now on display at the martin-gropius-bau hall in berlin . the exhibition is titled " innen stadt aussen " - which the curators have translated as " inner city out " but is also a play on words that could mean " inside instead of outside . " just like all other aspects of eliasson 's work , the focus of these exhibits is our own perception . deceptive impressions " i think we take what we see and perceive for granted , " said eliasson .
" we believe that sight is objective or physical and natural , or even a gift from god in some cases . " bildunterschrift : halogen lamps create cascaded images of the exhibition 's visitors eliasson , however , is convinced that our perception of the world is determined by culture - meaning that the same things can be seen in many different ways , and that sight can be deceiving .
his art aims to demonstrate this belief in an entertaining and comprehensible way , forcing us to consider the difference between reality and reflection and between truth and deception . the nature of reality eliasson belives that every artwork needs an observer .
according to daniel birnbaum , the curator of the exhibition , in the case of eliasson 's work " there are objects you can display in a gallery , but what really counts is the confrontation with them . " of course , it is also about what goes on in the mind of the beholder - like the moment he or she becomes confused when taking a glance out of the window of the exhibition hall , only to be confronted with an identical-looking building .
a mirror mounted outside is responsible for this illusion . bildunterschrift : light and reflections are a major theme at the exhibition actors and discoverers according to eliasson , the exhibition 's visitors are partly responsible for what they see . " we entrust the visitors with the responsibility to see the exhibition for themselves , " said eliasson .
" we do n't interpret it for them .
we really do n't attempt to patronize the people . " to eliasson , the exhibition 's visitors become something like actors and discoverers once they enter the building and decide to continue through one of the two doors .
to the right , they encounter a typical berlin sidewalk - a piece of the city inside the museum .
to the left , a path leads through thick fog that changes colors with each step , making the visitor feel isolated and lost in a public place . for curator daniel birnbaum , eliasson is an artist " who works in a simple , pragmatic , direct and honest manner . " " he does n't produce illusions , " added birnbaum .
" it 's rather about the construction of the human gaze . " bildunterschrift : the visitor can feel lost and vulnerable in colored fog optical adventures scientists are likely to appreciate this exhibition , as will children , art historians and lovers of simple shapes .
eliasson does n't just play with light refractions , mirrors and shadows , but also with geometrical shapes like triangles , circles , squares and spheres . he makes a transparent tube look like it is dancing in the light of a stroboscope , makes geodetic spheres glow , and manages to transform the atrium of the martin-gropius-bau building into a crystal wonderland .
the boundaries between the inside and the outside become blurred - and the visitor is awed . the exhibition olafur eliasson : innen stadt aussen , runs from april 28 through august 9 at the martin-gropius-bau in berlin . author : silke bartlick -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the scots have their own devolved parliament , but they also elect the british government in london .
their votes play a key role in deciding who will rule the united kingdom . on may 6th , the people of the uk will be electing a new parliament .
that includes people north of the english border in scotland , the home country of prime minister gordon brown .
although they have their own additional devolved parliament in edinburgh , the scots also send mps to london . although it only accounts for 59 of the 650 seats , the vote in scotland could play a decisive role in determining the outcome of the general election .
edinburgh 's princes street is busy as usual .
the city 's main shopping street attracts locals and tourists alike .
amongst them is sheila gilmore .
the labour party candidate for edinburgh east is on her way to her next campaign appointment . the elections for the british parliament are very important to scotland , says gilmore .
" we do have our own devolved parliament that looks after our domestic issues , but the overall the funding package is determined by the uk government .
the economy , which is important to everybody in scotland , will be affected by who 's in government and the kind of policies they follow . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scotland has had its own devolved parliament since 1999 labour versus scottish nationalists ?
traditionally , scotland is considered a labour bastion , and gilmore , who 's seat has been labour for decades , is confident that 's the way it will stay .
but prime minister gordon brown 's party has lost support across the country – including scotland .
at the last election to the scottish parliament in 2007 , which is run on the basis of proportional representation instead of the uk 's " first-past-the-post " system , labour did n't win enough seats to form a government .
the country is now ruled by a minority adminsitration formed by the pro-independence scottish national party .
that gives the election a " different buzz from south of the border , " says eberhard bort from the school of governance at edinburgh university .
only 25 to 30 % of scots really want independence from the rest of the uk , he says .
but it seems the scots like devoloution - " especially with a nationalist government , " says bort with a smile .
the opinion polls indicate it 's unlikely that labour will win the uk election on may the 6th .
the best brown can hope for is a hung parliament , with labour winning most seats .
but for that , he must succeed here in scotland , according to political analyst bort .
chris harvie shares his view . the professor of politics sits in the scottish parliament for the scottish national party .
he says labour is dependent on a " substantial return " of labour seats in scotland .
" of the 59 seats , they would expect up to 45 to return labour candidates , " says harvie , himself a former labour man .
" if not , scotland has become a liability rather than an asset to labour . "
this could benefit his own party , says harvie .
snp leader and scottish firstminister alex salmond hopes his party can increase ist current 7 seats to 20 in the election and has been actively campaigning for a hung parliament , which would give a lot of bargaining power to small parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scottish national party leader alex salmond was voted first minister in 2007 .
the ghost of " maggie " thatcher in spite of the unpopularity of the present labour government , which can be attributed partly to the economic crisis , partly to britain 's role in iraq and afghanistan , the polls are not predicting a huge victory for the conservatives .
they too , badly need to win seats in scotland .
at the moment they have only one scottish constituency seat in the westminster parliament .
but in the scottish parliament , which operates on a system of proportional representation , they have been able to win 17 seats .
john lamont has one of them .
now , the young conservative hopes to win the seat in westminster for his constituency of berwickshire , roxburgh and selkirk in the scottish borders .
but the conservatives have an image problem .
lamont is convinced his party 's policies would go down well with the voters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in traditional scottish villages , support for the conservatives is minimal " but the conservative brand is perceived as anti-scotland , " he says , and people still mention mrs thatcher , who introduced some measures very unpoplar with the people of scotland , as a reason not to vote conservative .
" amazing , that was 20 years ago , " says lamont , " i was barely born then ! "
a major force across the uk - the " libdems " the other party playing a bigger role than ever before in this election , in scotland and across the uk , are the liberal democrats .
if neither labour nor conservatives gain an absolute majority , the libdems will become extremely influential in british politics , either as a potential coalition partner or in tolerating a minority government .
party leaders are trying hard not to be drawn on that issue .
" i do n't think it 's clever to speculate on what parliament will look like " , says tavish scott , head of the libdems in scotland .
" the number one need is to get the deficit under control and deal with the state of public finances , which are in an awful crisis in the uk . "
another of his party 's main aims is to " clean up " politics .
here , the liberal democrat hits a note that most voters are concerned about .
after numerous scandals , many people across the uk are getting tired of politics .
" i worry that the expenses scandal that has taken place in the house of commons over the last year or so has turned many people off politics , " says scott , " and that many people will say we 're all as bad as each other and i do n't want anything to do with any of you . "
he fears that could result in a low turnout .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scandals in london could affect the way the scottish capital votes talking to voters back out on princes street , it seems as if tavish scott could have hit the nail on the head .
" you vote for the party you always voted for , " says one passer-by .
" but when the policies come across , they 're all shouting the same sort of thing .
and lately , after all the scandals , you feel a bit disillusioned with them all . "
" well to be quite honest , there is n't much choosing between the parties , " adds a shopper .
" they 're all too busy doing their own thing .
i wish they would actually think of the public and what we want , instead of promising us everything , then , when they come into power , it 's just the same as ever . "

he attended a commemoration ceremony sunday at the former concentration camp . sixty-five years after the liberation by us forces of the dachau nazi concentration camp , german president horst koehler spoke at a ceremony there , thanking former prisoners for their work in keeping the memory of the nazis ' crimes alive .
some 650 former inmates of the camp took part in the commemoration ceremonies on sunday , during which koehler called dachau an important reminder of germany 's darkest period .
before giving his speech , koehler laid a wreath at the site of the former crematorium .
he is the first german president to visit the memorial , located near munich in southern germany .

the aid package requires that athens implement tough austerity measures . eurozone finance ministers , in an emergency session on sunday , approved a loan package to save greece from defaulting on its debt .
eurogroup head jean-claude juncker said a total of 110 billion euros -lrb- $ 146 billion -rrb- would be spread out over three years .
up to 30 billion euros will be ready to be disbursed in 2010 . eurozone states are expected to give 80 billion euros while the rest is to be provided by the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- . it is by far the largest bailout ever assembled for a country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tough times ahead for papandreou 's greece juncker announced a fresh eu summit for may 7 to officially approve the bailout .
he stressed the help for athens was conditional on the greek government implementing strict financial reforms . he also said that at germany 's insistence , all ministers would discuss with their national banking sector the possibility of voluntary bank contributions to the aid package . international support eu president herman van rompuy welcomed the agreement . " i am convinced that this sound and ambitious program will enable greece to put right its economic and financial situation as well as its competitiveness , " he said in a statement . in exchange for financial aid from both the eu and the imf , athens has promised further austerity measures to get the country 's budget back into shape . greek prime minister george papandreou said the he would " do anything to avoid the country going bankrupt .

" us president barack obama told papandreou in a telephone interview late on sunday that he welcomed greece 's ambitious reform programs and the support from the eu and the imf . germany 's merkel backs bailout much of sunday 's talks depended on the attitude of germany , which is expected to foot the largest chunk of the bill - around 22 billion euros . german chancellor angela merkel had been hesitant about rushing aid to greece because it is unpopular among germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will have to pay the biggest chunk of the bailout on sunday however , merkel got fully behind the measure , calling the greek austerity program very ambitious and saying there was no choice but to save greece . " i think this is the only way we can restore the stability of the euro , " merkel said .
" i 'm going to work for the greece program and its passage . " german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble said the german cabinet would meet monday to work on a draft legislation for the aid .
he said the bill would then be approved in the german parliament by friday . to ensure the stability of the euro , schaeuble told german public television ard late on sunday , " we , as well as the german people and the taxpayer , have to take on this difficult decision -lsb- to approve the aid deal -rsb- . " he also warned greece that " the smallest deviation -lsb- from the austerity plan -rsb- would have consequences , that much is clear , " he told ard . widespread protests across greece but athen 's plans for painful wage and pension cuts have already triggered widespread protest in greece with unions planning a nationwide strike on wednesday .

" these sacrifices will give us breathing space and the time we need to make changes , " papandreou said , defending the measures .

we really do n't attempt to patronize the people . " to eliasson , the exhibition 's visitors become something like actors and discoverers once they enter the building and decide to continue through one of the two doors .

to the left , a path leads through thick fog that changes colors with each step , making the visitor feel isolated and lost in a public place . for curator daniel birnbaum , eliasson is an artist " who works in a simple , pragmatic , direct and honest manner .

now , the city is home to a major solo exhibition of his works . olafur eliasson 's art has already been gracing berlin for weeks , though most people would not have realized it .
chalk lines trail through parks and disappear under bushes .
next to some trees and lampposts there are bicycles with mirror-covered wheels .
large logs that arrived with the tide on iceland 's shores lie around the city as if they had fallen there by accident . in addition to all this , a van with an attached mirror has been confronting passers-by , cars , trains , buildings and billboards with their own reflections - a process that was filmed and is now on display at the martin-gropius-bau hall in berlin . the exhibition is titled " innen stadt aussen " - which the curators have translated as " inner city out " but is also a play on words that could mean " inside instead of outside . " just like all other aspects of eliasson 's work , the focus of these exhibits is our own perception . deceptive impressions " i think we take what we see and perceive for granted , " said eliasson .
" we believe that sight is objective or physical and natural , or even a gift from god in some cases . " bildunterschrift : halogen lamps create cascaded images of the exhibition 's visitors eliasson , however , is convinced that our perception of the world is determined by culture - meaning that the same things can be seen in many different ways , and that sight can be deceiving .
his art aims to demonstrate this belief in an entertaining and comprehensible way , forcing us to consider the difference between reality and reflection and between truth and deception . the nature of reality eliasson belives that every artwork needs an observer .

he attended a commemoration ceremony sunday at the former concentration camp . sixty-five years after the liberation by us forces of the dachau nazi concentration camp , german president horst koehler spoke at a ceremony there , thanking former prisoners for their work in keeping the memory of the nazis ' crimes alive .
some 650 former inmates of the camp took part in the commemoration ceremonies on sunday , during which koehler called dachau an important reminder of germany 's darkest period .
before giving his speech , koehler laid a wreath at the site of the former crematorium .
he is the first german president to visit the memorial , located near munich in southern germany .
camp model dachau was set up in 1933 and was the only camp to operate for the entire 12 years of the nazi regime .
it also served as a model for other camps later constructed across germany and in countries occupied by nazi forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dachau was liberated on april 29 , 1945 by us troops the first inmates at the camp were political prisoners , but soon dachau also held jews , sinti and roma , gays and people classified as " asocial " and " criminal " by the regime .
in total some 200,000 people from across europe were held at dachau - more then 43,000 people died or were killed at the camp .
when us troops arrived on april 29 , 1945 , they found around 32,000 prisoners .
two decades after its liberation , the site became a memorial thanks to the work of surviving inmates .

the scots have their own devolved parliament , but they also elect the british government in london .
their votes play a key role in deciding who will rule the united kingdom . on may 6th , the people of the uk will be electing a new parliament .
that includes people north of the english border in scotland , the home country of prime minister gordon brown .
although they have their own additional devolved parliament in edinburgh , the scots also send mps to london . although it only accounts for 59 of the 650 seats , the vote in scotland could play a decisive role in determining the outcome of the general election .
edinburgh 's princes street is busy as usual .
the city 's main shopping street attracts locals and tourists alike .
amongst them is sheila gilmore .
the labour party candidate for edinburgh east is on her way to her next campaign appointment . the elections for the british parliament are very important to scotland , says gilmore .
" we do have our own devolved parliament that looks after our domestic issues , but the overall the funding package is determined by the uk government .
the economy , which is important to everybody in scotland , will be affected by who 's in government and the kind of policies they follow . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scotland has had its own devolved parliament since 1999 labour versus scottish nationalists ?
traditionally , scotland is considered a labour bastion , and gilmore , who 's seat has been labour for decades , is confident that 's the way it will stay .
but prime minister gordon brown 's party has lost support across the country – including scotland .
at the last election to the scottish parliament in 2007 , which is run on the basis of proportional representation instead of the uk 's " first-past-the-post " system , labour did n't win enough seats to form a government .
the country is now ruled by a minority adminsitration formed by the pro-independence scottish national party .
that gives the election a " different buzz from south of the border , " says eberhard bort from the school of governance at edinburgh university .
only 25 to 30 % of scots really want independence from the rest of the uk , he says .
but it seems the scots like devoloution - " especially with a nationalist government , " says bort with a smile .
the opinion polls indicate it 's unlikely that labour will win the uk election on may the 6th .
the best brown can hope for is a hung parliament , with labour winning most seats .
but for that , he must succeed here in scotland , according to political analyst bort .
chris harvie shares his view . the professor of politics sits in the scottish parliament for the scottish national party .
he says labour is dependent on a " substantial return " of labour seats in scotland .
" of the 59 seats , they would expect up to 45 to return labour candidates , " says harvie , himself a former labour man .
" if not , scotland has become a liability rather than an asset to labour . "
this could benefit his own party , says harvie .
snp leader and scottish firstminister alex salmond hopes his party can increase ist current 7 seats to 20 in the election and has been actively campaigning for a hung parliament , which would give a lot of bargaining power to small parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scottish national party leader alex salmond was voted first minister in 2007 .
the ghost of " maggie " thatcher in spite of the unpopularity of the present labour government , which can be attributed partly to the economic crisis , partly to britain 's role in iraq and afghanistan , the polls are not predicting a huge victory for the conservatives .
they too , badly need to win seats in scotland .
at the moment they have only one scottish constituency seat in the westminster parliament .
but in the scottish parliament , which operates on a system of proportional representation , they have been able to win 17 seats .
john lamont has one of them .
now , the young conservative hopes to win the seat in westminster for his constituency of berwickshire , roxburgh and selkirk in the scottish borders .
but the conservatives have an image problem .
lamont is convinced his party 's policies would go down well with the voters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in traditional scottish villages , support for the conservatives is minimal " but the conservative brand is perceived as anti-scotland , " he says , and people still mention mrs thatcher , who introduced some measures very unpoplar with the people of scotland , as a reason not to vote conservative .
" amazing , that was 20 years ago , " says lamont , " i was barely born then ! "
a major force across the uk - the " libdems " the other party playing a bigger role than ever before in this election , in scotland and across the uk , are the liberal democrats .
if neither labour nor conservatives gain an absolute majority , the libdems will become extremely influential in british politics , either as a potential coalition partner or in tolerating a minority government .
party leaders are trying hard not to be drawn on that issue .
" i do n't think it 's clever to speculate on what parliament will look like " , says tavish scott , head of the libdems in scotland .
" the number one need is to get the deficit under control and deal with the state of public finances , which are in an awful crisis in the uk . "
another of his party 's main aims is to " clean up " politics .
here , the liberal democrat hits a note that most voters are concerned about .
after numerous scandals , many people across the uk are getting tired of politics .
" i worry that the expenses scandal that has taken place in the house of commons over the last year or so has turned many people off politics , " says scott , " and that many people will say we 're all as bad as each other and i do n't want anything to do with any of you . "
he fears that could result in a low turnout .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scandals in london could affect the way the scottish capital votes talking to voters back out on princes street , it seems as if tavish scott could have hit the nail on the head .
" you vote for the party you always voted for , " says one passer-by .
" but when the policies come across , they 're all shouting the same sort of thing .
and lately , after all the scandals , you feel a bit disillusioned with them all . "
" well to be quite honest , there is n't much choosing between the parties , " adds a shopper .
" they 're all too busy doing their own thing .
i wish they would actually think of the public and what we want , instead of promising us everything , then , when they come into power , it 's just the same as ever . "

they too , badly need to win seats in scotland .
at the moment they have only one scottish constituency seat in the westminster parliament .
but in the scottish parliament , which operates on a system of proportional representation , they have been able to win 17 seats .
john lamont has one of them .
now , the young conservative hopes to win the seat in westminster for his constituency of berwickshire , roxburgh and selkirk in the scottish borders .
but the conservatives have an image problem .
lamont is convinced his party 's policies would go down well with the voters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in traditional scottish villages , support for the conservatives is minimal " but the conservative brand is perceived as anti-scotland , " he says , and people still mention mrs thatcher , who introduced some measures very unpoplar with the people of scotland , as a reason not to vote conservative .
" amazing , that was 20 years ago , " says lamont , " i was barely born then ! "
a major force across the uk - the " libdems " the other party playing a bigger role than ever before in this election , in scotland and across the uk , are the liberal democrats .
if neither labour nor conservatives gain an absolute majority , the libdems will become extremely influential in british politics , either as a potential coalition partner or in tolerating a minority government .
party leaders are trying hard not to be drawn on that issue .
" i do n't think it 's clever to speculate on what parliament will look like " , says tavish scott , head of the libdems in scotland .
" the number one need is to get the deficit under control and deal with the state of public finances , which are in an awful crisis in the uk . "
another of his party 's main aims is to " clean up " politics .
here , the liberal democrat hits a note that most voters are concerned about .
after numerous scandals , many people across the uk are getting tired of politics .
" i worry that the expenses scandal that has taken place in the house of commons over the last year or so has turned many people off politics , " says scott , " and that many people will say we 're all as bad as each other and i do n't want anything to do with any of you . "
he fears that could result in a low turnout .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scandals in london could affect the way the scottish capital votes talking to voters back out on princes street , it seems as if tavish scott could have hit the nail on the head .
" you vote for the party you always voted for , " says one passer-by .
" but when the policies come across , they 're all shouting the same sort of thing .
and lately , after all the scandals , you feel a bit disillusioned with them all . "
" well to be quite honest , there is n't much choosing between the parties , " adds a shopper .
" they 're all too busy doing their own thing .
i wish they would actually think of the public and what we want , instead of promising us everything , then , when they come into power , it 's just the same as ever . "

the scots have their own devolved parliament , but they also elect the british government in london .
their votes play a key role in deciding who will rule the united kingdom . on may 6th , the people of the uk will be electing a new parliament .
that includes people north of the english border in scotland , the home country of prime minister gordon brown .
although they have their own additional devolved parliament in edinburgh , the scots also send mps to london . although it only accounts for 59 of the 650 seats , the vote in scotland could play a decisive role in determining the outcome of the general election .
edinburgh 's princes street is busy as usual .
the city 's main shopping street attracts locals and tourists alike .
amongst them is sheila gilmore .
the labour party candidate for edinburgh east is on her way to her next campaign appointment . the elections for the british parliament are very important to scotland , says gilmore .
" we do have our own devolved parliament that looks after our domestic issues , but the overall the funding package is determined by the uk government .
the economy , which is important to everybody in scotland , will be affected by who 's in government and the kind of policies they follow . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scotland has had its own devolved parliament since 1999 labour versus scottish nationalists ?
traditionally , scotland is considered a labour bastion , and gilmore , who 's seat has been labour for decades , is confident that 's the way it will stay .
but prime minister gordon brown 's party has lost support across the country – including scotland .
at the last election to the scottish parliament in 2007 , which is run on the basis of proportional representation instead of the uk 's " first-past-the-post " system , labour did n't win enough seats to form a government .
the country is now ruled by a minority adminsitration formed by the pro-independence scottish national party .
that gives the election a " different buzz from south of the border , " says eberhard bort from the school of governance at edinburgh university .
only 25 to 30 % of scots really want independence from the rest of the uk , he says .
but it seems the scots like devoloution - " especially with a nationalist government , " says bort with a smile .
the opinion polls indicate it 's unlikely that labour will win the uk election on may the 6th .
the best brown can hope for is a hung parliament , with labour winning most seats .
but for that , he must succeed here in scotland , according to political analyst bort .
chris harvie shares his view . the professor of politics sits in the scottish parliament for the scottish national party .
he says labour is dependent on a " substantial return " of labour seats in scotland .
" of the 59 seats , they would expect up to 45 to return labour candidates , " says harvie , himself a former labour man .
" if not , scotland has become a liability rather than an asset to labour . "
this could benefit his own party , says harvie .
snp leader and scottish firstminister alex salmond hopes his party can increase ist current 7 seats to 20 in the election and has been actively campaigning for a hung parliament , which would give a lot of bargaining power to small parties .

eurogroup head jean-claude juncker said a total of 110 billion euros -lrb- $ 146 billion -rrb- would be spread out over three years .
up to 30 billion euros will be ready to be disbursed in 2010 . eurozone states are expected to give 80 billion euros while the rest is to be provided by the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- . it is by far the largest bailout ever assembled for a country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tough times ahead for papandreou 's greece juncker announced a fresh eu summit for may 7 to officially approve the bailout .
he stressed the help for athens was conditional on the greek government implementing strict financial reforms . he also said that at germany 's insistence , all ministers would discuss with their national banking sector the possibility of voluntary bank contributions to the aid package . international support eu president herman van rompuy welcomed the agreement . " i am convinced that this sound and ambitious program will enable greece to put right its economic and financial situation as well as its competitiveness , " he said in a statement . in exchange for financial aid from both the eu and the imf , athens has promised further austerity measures to get the country 's budget back into shape . greek prime minister george papandreou said the he would " do anything to avoid the country going bankrupt .

" us president barack obama told papandreou in a telephone interview late on sunday that he welcomed greece 's ambitious reform programs and the support from the eu and the imf . germany 's merkel backs bailout much of sunday 's talks depended on the attitude of germany , which is expected to foot the largest chunk of the bill - around 22 billion euros . german chancellor angela merkel had been hesitant about rushing aid to greece because it is unpopular among germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will have to pay the biggest chunk of the bailout on sunday however , merkel got fully behind the measure , calling the greek austerity program very ambitious and saying there was no choice but to save greece . " i think this is the only way we can restore the stability of the euro , " merkel said .
" i 'm going to work for the greece program and its passage . " german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble said the german cabinet would meet monday to work on a draft legislation for the aid .
he said the bill would then be approved in the german parliament by friday . to ensure the stability of the euro , schaeuble told german public television ard late on sunday , " we , as well as the german people and the taxpayer , have to take on this difficult decision -lsb- to approve the aid deal -rsb- . " he also warned greece that " the smallest deviation -lsb- from the austerity plan -rsb- would have consequences , that much is clear , " he told ard . widespread protests across greece but athen 's plans for painful wage and pension cuts have already triggered widespread protest in greece with unions planning a nationwide strike on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the austerity measures are deeply unpopular in greece the fresh round of cuts aims at saving 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 40 billion -rrb- over the next three years with civil servants and pensioners bearing the brunt of the effort . " these sacrifices will give us breathing space and the time we need to make changes , " papandreou said , defending the measures . " i want to tell greeks very honestly that we have a big trial ahead , " he said . ai / ng / dpa / afp / reuters editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he attended a commemoration ceremony sunday at the former concentration camp . sixty-five years after the liberation by us forces of the dachau nazi concentration camp , german president horst koehler spoke at a ceremony there , thanking former prisoners for their work in keeping the memory of the nazis ' crimes alive .
some 650 former inmates of the camp took part in the commemoration ceremonies on sunday , during which koehler called dachau an important reminder of germany 's darkest period .
before giving his speech , koehler laid a wreath at the site of the former crematorium .
he is the first german president to visit the memorial , located near munich in southern germany .
camp model dachau was set up in 1933 and was the only camp to operate for the entire 12 years of the nazi regime .
it also served as a model for other camps later constructed across germany and in countries occupied by nazi forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dachau was liberated on april 29 , 1945 by us troops the first inmates at the camp were political prisoners , but soon dachau also held jews , sinti and roma , gays and people classified as " asocial " and " criminal " by the regime .
in total some 200,000 people from across europe were held at dachau - more then 43,000 people died or were killed at the camp .
when us troops arrived on april 29 , 1945 , they found around 32,000 prisoners .
two decades after its liberation , the site became a memorial thanks to the work of surviving inmates .
the memorial and museum receive around 700,000 visitors each year. ai / dpa / epd / kna editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the scots have their own devolved parliament , but they also elect the british government in london .
their votes play a key role in deciding who will rule the united kingdom . on may 6th , the people of the uk will be electing a new parliament .
that includes people north of the english border in scotland , the home country of prime minister gordon brown .
although they have their own additional devolved parliament in edinburgh , the scots also send mps to london . although it only accounts for 59 of the 650 seats , the vote in scotland could play a decisive role in determining the outcome of the general election .
edinburgh 's princes street is busy as usual .
the city 's main shopping street attracts locals and tourists alike .
amongst them is sheila gilmore .
the labour party candidate for edinburgh east is on her way to her next campaign appointment . the elections for the british parliament are very important to scotland , says gilmore .
" we do have our own devolved parliament that looks after our domestic issues , but the overall the funding package is determined by the uk government .
the economy , which is important to everybody in scotland , will be affected by who 's in government and the kind of policies they follow . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scotland has had its own devolved parliament since 1999 labour versus scottish nationalists ?
traditionally , scotland is considered a labour bastion , and gilmore , who 's seat has been labour for decades , is confident that 's the way it will stay .
but prime minister gordon brown 's party has lost support across the country – including scotland .
at the last election to the scottish parliament in 2007 , which is run on the basis of proportional representation instead of the uk 's " first-past-the-post " system , labour did n't win enough seats to form a government .
the country is now ruled by a minority adminsitration formed by the pro-independence scottish national party .
that gives the election a " different buzz from south of the border , " says eberhard bort from the school of governance at edinburgh university .
only 25 to 30 % of scots really want independence from the rest of the uk , he says .
but it seems the scots like devoloution - " especially with a nationalist government , " says bort with a smile .
the opinion polls indicate it 's unlikely that labour will win the uk election on may the 6th .
the best brown can hope for is a hung parliament , with labour winning most seats .
but for that , he must succeed here in scotland , according to political analyst bort .
chris harvie shares his view . the professor of politics sits in the scottish parliament for the scottish national party .
he says labour is dependent on a " substantial return " of labour seats in scotland .
" of the 59 seats , they would expect up to 45 to return labour candidates , " says harvie , himself a former labour man .
" if not , scotland has become a liability rather than an asset to labour . "
this could benefit his own party , says harvie .
snp leader and scottish firstminister alex salmond hopes his party can increase ist current 7 seats to 20 in the election and has been actively campaigning for a hung parliament , which would give a lot of bargaining power to small parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scottish national party leader alex salmond was voted first minister in 2007 .
the ghost of " maggie " thatcher in spite of the unpopularity of the present labour government , which can be attributed partly to the economic crisis , partly to britain 's role in iraq and afghanistan , the polls are not predicting a huge victory for the conservatives .
they too , badly need to win seats in scotland .
at the moment they have only one scottish constituency seat in the westminster parliament .
but in the scottish parliament , which operates on a system of proportional representation , they have been able to win 17 seats .
john lamont has one of them .
now , the young conservative hopes to win the seat in westminster for his constituency of berwickshire , roxburgh and selkirk in the scottish borders .
but the conservatives have an image problem .
lamont is convinced his party 's policies would go down well with the voters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in traditional scottish villages , support for the conservatives is minimal " but the conservative brand is perceived as anti-scotland , " he says , and people still mention mrs thatcher , who introduced some measures very unpoplar with the people of scotland , as a reason not to vote conservative .
" amazing , that was 20 years ago , " says lamont , " i was barely born then ! "
a major force across the uk - the " libdems " the other party playing a bigger role than ever before in this election , in scotland and across the uk , are the liberal democrats .
if neither labour nor conservatives gain an absolute majority , the libdems will become extremely influential in british politics , either as a potential coalition partner or in tolerating a minority government .
party leaders are trying hard not to be drawn on that issue .
" i do n't think it 's clever to speculate on what parliament will look like " , says tavish scott , head of the libdems in scotland .
" the number one need is to get the deficit under control and deal with the state of public finances , which are in an awful crisis in the uk . "
another of his party 's main aims is to " clean up " politics .
here , the liberal democrat hits a note that most voters are concerned about .
after numerous scandals , many people across the uk are getting tired of politics .
" i worry that the expenses scandal that has taken place in the house of commons over the last year or so has turned many people off politics , " says scott , " and that many people will say we 're all as bad as each other and i do n't want anything to do with any of you . "
he fears that could result in a low turnout .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scandals in london could affect the way the scottish capital votes talking to voters back out on princes street , it seems as if tavish scott could have hit the nail on the head .
" you vote for the party you always voted for , " says one passer-by .
" but when the policies come across , they 're all shouting the same sort of thing .
and lately , after all the scandals , you feel a bit disillusioned with them all . "
" well to be quite honest , there is n't much choosing between the parties , " adds a shopper .
" they 're all too busy doing their own thing .

" one thing that did not work well in copenhagen is that a small circle met and the regional groups felt left out of the debate , " merkel said in bonn on sunday .
germany and mexico hope to get negotiations moving again and have invited representatives from developed and developing countries to bonn to flesh out common ground on environmental issues .
developed versus developing nations mexican president felipe calderon stressed that developing and developed countries must agree on the issue of finance for poorer countries , to enable them to fight climate change .
" this atmosphere of trust is something we really need to make use of for the fast-track financing , " he told ministers in bonn .
" 2010 is the year when we need to take action . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traffic is just one of many climate issues on the agenda the conference - dubbed the petersberg climate dialogue - comes five months after the disastrous summit in copenhagen last december , where countries merely agreed that global temperatures should rise by no more than 2 degrees celsius , but failed to specify any details on how this could be achieved and shared out between the nations .
developing countries have long demanded that richer countries must pay a bigger share in the fight against greenhosue gas emissions , as big industrial nations are the main polluters .
mexico is slated to host the next full-scale un climate summit at the resort of cancun in late november .
meeting designed to re-kindle confidence the petersberg gathering - at germany 's former hilltop government guesthouse when bonn was still the capital - is not expected to make any formal resolutions , but the germans and mexicans are hoping it will come up with ideas to clear the logjam on climate policies .
german environment minister norbert roettgen said the purpose of the meeting was " confidence-building " among emerging and industrial nations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is the world 's biggest polluter , along with the us " we have to get trust and flexibility back into the climate process , " he said .
the german environment minister also urged the european union to take on the pioneering role of developing and implementing low-carbon policies .
the two most important figures at the bonn talks are likely to be the chief us and chinese negotiators .
world leaders realized in copenhagen that climate talks would continue to be very difficult .
already , the president of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , has dampened expectations , telling the german newspaper hamburger abendblatt that there would probably not be any legally binding agreements made in cancun , but perhaps some progress in deciding who makes the sacrifices. gb / ng / dpa / epd / ap / afp editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the aid package requires that athens implement tough austerity measures . eurozone finance ministers , in an emergency session on sunday , approved a loan package to save greece from defaulting on its debt .
eurogroup head jean-claude juncker said a total of 110 billion euros -lrb- $ 146 billion -rrb- would be spread out over three years .
up to 30 billion euros will be ready to be disbursed in 2010 . eurozone states are expected to give 80 billion euros while the rest is to be provided by the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- . it is by far the largest bailout ever assembled for a country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tough times ahead for papandreou 's greece juncker announced a fresh eu summit for may 7 to officially approve the bailout .
he stressed the help for athens was conditional on the greek government implementing strict financial reforms . he also said that at germany 's insistence , all ministers would discuss with their national banking sector the possibility of voluntary bank contributions to the aid package . international support eu president herman van rompuy welcomed the agreement . " i am convinced that this sound and ambitious program will enable greece to put right its economic and financial situation as well as its competitiveness , " he said in a statement . in exchange for financial aid from both the eu and the imf , athens has promised further austerity measures to get the country 's budget back into shape . greek prime minister george papandreou said the he would " do anything to avoid the country going bankrupt . " " it is an unprecedented support package for an unprecedented effort by the greek people , " a somber papandreou , wearing a dark purple tie , the color used for funerals in greece , told a televised cabinet meeting . eu commissioners for economic and monetary affairs olli rehn welcomed athens ' latest austerity efforts as a " very convincing and comprehensive program . " us president barack obama told papandreou in a telephone interview late on sunday that he welcomed greece 's ambitious reform programs and the support from the eu and the imf . germany 's merkel backs bailout much of sunday 's talks depended on the attitude of germany , which is expected to foot the largest chunk of the bill - around 22 billion euros . german chancellor angela merkel had been hesitant about rushing aid to greece because it is unpopular among germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will have to pay the biggest chunk of the bailout on sunday however , merkel got fully behind the measure , calling the greek austerity program very ambitious and saying there was no choice but to save greece . " i think this is the only way we can restore the stability of the euro , " merkel said .
" i 'm going to work for the greece program and its passage . " german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble said the german cabinet would meet monday to work on a draft legislation for the aid .
he said the bill would then be approved in the german parliament by friday . to ensure the stability of the euro , schaeuble told german public television ard late on sunday , " we , as well as the german people and the taxpayer , have to take on this difficult decision -lsb- to approve the aid deal -rsb- . " he also warned greece that " the smallest deviation -lsb- from the austerity plan -rsb- would have consequences , that much is clear , " he told ard . widespread protests across greece but athen 's plans for painful wage and pension cuts have already triggered widespread protest in greece with unions planning a nationwide strike on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the austerity measures are deeply unpopular in greece the fresh round of cuts aims at saving 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 40 billion -rrb- over the next three years with civil servants and pensioners bearing the brunt of the effort .

the aid package requires that athens implement tough austerity measures . eurozone finance ministers , in an emergency session on sunday , approved a loan package to save greece from defaulting on its debt .
eurogroup head jean-claude juncker said a total of 110 billion euros -lrb- $ 146 billion -rrb- would be spread out over three years .
up to 30 billion euros will be ready to be disbursed in 2010 . eurozone states are expected to give 80 billion euros while the rest is to be provided by the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- . it is by far the largest bailout ever assembled for a country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tough times ahead for papandreou 's greece juncker announced a fresh eu summit for may 7 to officially approve the bailout .
he stressed the help for athens was conditional on the greek government implementing strict financial reforms . he also said that at germany 's insistence , all ministers would discuss with their national banking sector the possibility of voluntary bank contributions to the aid package . international support eu president herman van rompuy welcomed the agreement . " i am convinced that this sound and ambitious program will enable greece to put right its economic and financial situation as well as its competitiveness , " he said in a statement . in exchange for financial aid from both the eu and the imf , athens has promised further austerity measures to get the country 's budget back into shape . greek prime minister george papandreou said the he would " do anything to avoid the country going bankrupt . " " it is an unprecedented support package for an unprecedented effort by the greek people , " a somber papandreou , wearing a dark purple tie , the color used for funerals in greece , told a televised cabinet meeting . eu commissioners for economic and monetary affairs olli rehn welcomed athens ' latest austerity efforts as a " very convincing and comprehensive program . " us president barack obama told papandreou in a telephone interview late on sunday that he welcomed greece 's ambitious reform programs and the support from the eu and the imf . germany 's merkel backs bailout much of sunday 's talks depended on the attitude of germany , which is expected to foot the largest chunk of the bill - around 22 billion euros . german chancellor angela merkel had been hesitant about rushing aid to greece because it is unpopular among germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will have to pay the biggest chunk of the bailout on sunday however , merkel got fully behind the measure , calling the greek austerity program very ambitious and saying there was no choice but to save greece . " i think this is the only way we can restore the stability of the euro , " merkel said .
" i 'm going to work for the greece program and its passage . " german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble said the german cabinet would meet monday to work on a draft legislation for the aid .
he said the bill would then be approved in the german parliament by friday . to ensure the stability of the euro , schaeuble told german public television ard late on sunday , " we , as well as the german people and the taxpayer , have to take on this difficult decision -lsb- to approve the aid deal -rsb- . " he also warned greece that " the smallest deviation -lsb- from the austerity plan -rsb- would have consequences , that much is clear , " he told ard . widespread protests across greece but athen 's plans for painful wage and pension cuts have already triggered widespread protest in greece with unions planning a nationwide strike on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the austerity measures are deeply unpopular in greece the fresh round of cuts aims at saving 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 40 billion -rrb- over the next three years with civil servants and pensioners bearing the brunt of the effort . " these sacrifices will give us breathing space and the time we need to make changes , " papandreou said , defending the measures .

he also conceived three children with two women , the order recently said in an official apology . he died in 2008 , still a priest , despite being told to retire to a life of " prayer and penitence " by the pope in 2006 .
eight priests had accused maciel of molesting them as children years before this , but the order denied these claims . at the time , he was one of the most prominent persons to be disciplined for sexual misconduct in the church 's history . without addressing accusations that the church hierarchy was aware of and covered up maciel 's misconduct , the vatican condemned the legion founder 's " very serious and objectively immoral actions confirmed by incontestable testimonies " in its statement on saturday . the legion of christ has about 850 priests and 2,500 seminarians in 21 countries around the world .
it also runs a catholic university in rome . msh / reuters / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i 'm going to work for the greece program and its passage . " german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble said the german cabinet would meet monday to work on a draft legislation for the aid .
he said the bill would then be approved in the german parliament by friday . to ensure the stability of the euro , schaeuble told german public television ard late on sunday , " we , as well as the german people and the taxpayer , have to take on this difficult decision -lsb- to approve the aid deal -rsb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 02.05.2010 germany calls for " basis of trust " at climate talks in bonn großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and calderon want to get stalled climate talks back on track in an attempt to revive stalled global warming talks , germany and mexico are co-hosting a three-day conference in bonn with officials from 45 nations to consider ways out of the impasse . german chancellor angela merkel has urged world environment ministers to " find a basis of trust " before the next un climate summit in cancun , mexico , in november , after talks in copenhagen last december failed to achieve international consensus on how to tackle climate change .
" one thing that did not work well in copenhagen is that a small circle met and the regional groups felt left out of the debate , " merkel said in bonn on sunday .
germany and mexico hope to get negotiations moving again and have invited representatives from developed and developing countries to bonn to flesh out common ground on environmental issues .
developed versus developing nations mexican president felipe calderon stressed that developing and developed countries must agree on the issue of finance for poorer countries , to enable them to fight climate change .
" this atmosphere of trust is something we really need to make use of for the fast-track financing , " he told ministers in bonn .
" 2010 is the year when we need to take action . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traffic is just one of many climate issues on the agenda the conference - dubbed the petersberg climate dialogue - comes five months after the disastrous summit in copenhagen last december , where countries merely agreed that global temperatures should rise by no more than 2 degrees celsius , but failed to specify any details on how this could be achieved and shared out between the nations .
developing countries have long demanded that richer countries must pay a bigger share in the fight against greenhosue gas emissions , as big industrial nations are the main polluters .
mexico is slated to host the next full-scale un climate summit at the resort of cancun in late november .
meeting designed to re-kindle confidence the petersberg gathering - at germany 's former hilltop government guesthouse when bonn was still the capital - is not expected to make any formal resolutions , but the germans and mexicans are hoping it will come up with ideas to clear the logjam on climate policies .
german environment minister norbert roettgen said the purpose of the meeting was " confidence-building " among emerging and industrial nations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is the world 's biggest polluter , along with the us " we have to get trust and flexibility back into the climate process , " he said .
the german environment minister also urged the european union to take on the pioneering role of developing and implementing low-carbon policies .
the two most important figures at the bonn talks are likely to be the chief us and chinese negotiators .
world leaders realized in copenhagen that climate talks would continue to be very difficult .
already , the president of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , has dampened expectations , telling the german newspaper hamburger abendblatt that there would probably not be any legally binding agreements made in cancun , but perhaps some progress in deciding who makes the sacrifices. gb / ng / dpa / epd / ap / afp editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the legionaries thank the holy father and embrace his provisions with faith and obedience , " the group said on its website after the vatican announced the move . the roman catholic church and pope benedict xvi , in particular , are currently under increasing pressure to tighten up internal discipline , after a series of previously covered-up sex abuse cases have come to light across europe . founding father the order 's founder , marcial maciel , is alleged to have sexually abused numerous underage seminarians .
he also conceived three children with two women , the order recently said in an official apology . he died in 2008 , still a priest , despite being told to retire to a life of " prayer and penitence " by the pope in 2006 .
eight priests had accused maciel of molesting them as children years before this , but the order denied these claims . at the time , he was one of the most prominent persons to be disciplined for sexual misconduct in the church 's history . without addressing accusations that the church hierarchy was aware of and covered up maciel 's misconduct , the vatican condemned the legion founder 's " very serious and objectively immoral actions confirmed by incontestable testimonies " in its statement on saturday . the legion of christ has about 850 priests and 2,500 seminarians in 21 countries around the world .

he also conceived three children with two women , the order recently said in an official apology . he died in 2008 , still a priest , despite being told to retire to a life of " prayer and penitence " by the pope in 2006 .
eight priests had accused maciel of molesting them as children years before this , but the order denied these claims . at the time , he was one of the most prominent persons to be disciplined for sexual misconduct in the church 's history . without addressing accusations that the church hierarchy was aware of and covered up maciel 's misconduct , the vatican condemned the legion founder 's " very serious and objectively immoral actions confirmed by incontestable testimonies " in its statement on saturday . the legion of christ has about 850 priests and 2,500 seminarians in 21 countries around the world .

" the legionaries thank the holy father and embrace his provisions with faith and obedience , " the group said on its website after the vatican announced the move . the roman catholic church and pope benedict xvi , in particular , are currently under increasing pressure to tighten up internal discipline , after a series of previously covered-up sex abuse cases have come to light across europe . founding father the order 's founder , marcial maciel , is alleged to have sexually abused numerous underage seminarians .
he also conceived three children with two women , the order recently said in an official apology . he died in 2008 , still a priest , despite being told to retire to a life of " prayer and penitence " by the pope in 2006 .
eight priests had accused maciel of molesting them as children years before this , but the order denied these claims . at the time , he was one of the most prominent persons to be disciplined for sexual misconduct in the church 's history . without addressing accusations that the church hierarchy was aware of and covered up maciel 's misconduct , the vatican condemned the legion founder 's " very serious and objectively immoral actions confirmed by incontestable testimonies " in its statement on saturday . the legion of christ has about 850 priests and 2,500 seminarians in 21 countries around the world .
it also runs a catholic university in rome . msh / reuters / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" one thing that did not work well in copenhagen is that a small circle met and the regional groups felt left out of the debate , " merkel said in bonn on sunday .
germany and mexico hope to get negotiations moving again and have invited representatives from developed and developing countries to bonn to flesh out common ground on environmental issues .
developed versus developing nations mexican president felipe calderon stressed that developing and developed countries must agree on the issue of finance for poorer countries , to enable them to fight climate change .
" this atmosphere of trust is something we really need to make use of for the fast-track financing , " he told ministers in bonn .
" 2010 is the year when we need to take action . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traffic is just one of many climate issues on the agenda the conference - dubbed the petersberg climate dialogue - comes five months after the disastrous summit in copenhagen last december , where countries merely agreed that global temperatures should rise by no more than 2 degrees celsius , but failed to specify any details on how this could be achieved and shared out between the nations .
developing countries have long demanded that richer countries must pay a bigger share in the fight against greenhosue gas emissions , as big industrial nations are the main polluters .
mexico is slated to host the next full-scale un climate summit at the resort of cancun in late november .
meeting designed to re-kindle confidence the petersberg gathering - at germany 's former hilltop government guesthouse when bonn was still the capital - is not expected to make any formal resolutions , but the germans and mexicans are hoping it will come up with ideas to clear the logjam on climate policies .
german environment minister norbert roettgen said the purpose of the meeting was " confidence-building " among emerging and industrial nations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is the world 's biggest polluter , along with the us " we have to get trust and flexibility back into the climate process , " he said .
the german environment minister also urged the european union to take on the pioneering role of developing and implementing low-carbon policies .
the two most important figures at the bonn talks are likely to be the chief us and chinese negotiators .
world leaders realized in copenhagen that climate talks would continue to be very difficult .
already , the president of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , has dampened expectations , telling the german newspaper hamburger abendblatt that there would probably not be any legally binding agreements made in cancun , but perhaps some progress in deciding who makes the sacrifices. gb / ng / dpa / epd / ap / afp editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , the city is home to a major solo exhibition of his works . olafur eliasson 's art has already been gracing berlin for weeks , though most people would not have realized it .
chalk lines trail through parks and disappear under bushes .
next to some trees and lampposts there are bicycles with mirror-covered wheels .
large logs that arrived with the tide on iceland 's shores lie around the city as if they had fallen there by accident . in addition to all this , a van with an attached mirror has been confronting passers-by , cars , trains , buildings and billboards with their own reflections - a process that was filmed and is now on display at the martin-gropius-bau hall in berlin . the exhibition is titled " innen stadt aussen " - which the curators have translated as " inner city out " but is also a play on words that could mean " inside instead of outside . " just like all other aspects of eliasson 's work , the focus of these exhibits is our own perception . deceptive impressions " i think we take what we see and perceive for granted , " said eliasson .
" we believe that sight is objective or physical and natural , or even a gift from god in some cases . " bildunterschrift : halogen lamps create cascaded images of the exhibition 's visitors eliasson , however , is convinced that our perception of the world is determined by culture - meaning that the same things can be seen in many different ways , and that sight can be deceiving .
his art aims to demonstrate this belief in an entertaining and comprehensible way , forcing us to consider the difference between reality and reflection and between truth and deception . the nature of reality eliasson belives that every artwork needs an observer .
according to daniel birnbaum , the curator of the exhibition , in the case of eliasson 's work " there are objects you can display in a gallery , but what really counts is the confrontation with them . " of course , it is also about what goes on in the mind of the beholder - like the moment he or she becomes confused when taking a glance out of the window of the exhibition hall , only to be confronted with an identical-looking building .
a mirror mounted outside is responsible for this illusion . bildunterschrift : light and reflections are a major theme at the exhibition actors and discoverers according to eliasson , the exhibition 's visitors are partly responsible for what they see . " we entrust the visitors with the responsibility to see the exhibition for themselves , " said eliasson .
" we do n't interpret it for them .
we really do n't attempt to patronize the people . " to eliasson , the exhibition 's visitors become something like actors and discoverers once they enter the building and decide to continue through one of the two doors .
to the right , they encounter a typical berlin sidewalk - a piece of the city inside the museum .
to the left , a path leads through thick fog that changes colors with each step , making the visitor feel isolated and lost in a public place . for curator daniel birnbaum , eliasson is an artist " who works in a simple , pragmatic , direct and honest manner . " " he does n't produce illusions , " added birnbaum .
" it 's rather about the construction of the human gaze . " bildunterschrift : the visitor can feel lost and vulnerable in colored fog optical adventures scientists are likely to appreciate this exhibition , as will children , art historians and lovers of simple shapes .

large logs that arrived with the tide on iceland 's shores lie around the city as if they had fallen there by accident . in addition to all this , a van with an attached mirror has been confronting passers-by , cars , trains , buildings and billboards with their own reflections - a process that was filmed and is now on display at the martin-gropius-bau hall in berlin . the exhibition is titled " innen stadt aussen " - which the curators have translated as " inner city out " but is also a play on words that could mean " inside instead of outside . " just like all other aspects of eliasson 's work , the focus of these exhibits is our own perception . deceptive impressions " i think we take what we see and perceive for granted , " said eliasson .
" we believe that sight is objective or physical and natural , or even a gift from god in some cases . " bildunterschrift : halogen lamps create cascaded images of the exhibition 's visitors eliasson , however , is convinced that our perception of the world is determined by culture - meaning that the same things can be seen in many different ways , and that sight can be deceiving .
his art aims to demonstrate this belief in an entertaining and comprehensible way , forcing us to consider the difference between reality and reflection and between truth and deception . the nature of reality eliasson belives that every artwork needs an observer .
according to daniel birnbaum , the curator of the exhibition , in the case of eliasson 's work " there are objects you can display in a gallery , but what really counts is the confrontation with them . " of course , it is also about what goes on in the mind of the beholder - like the moment he or she becomes confused when taking a glance out of the window of the exhibition hall , only to be confronted with an identical-looking building .

" we entrust the visitors with the responsibility to see the exhibition for themselves , " said eliasson .
" we do n't interpret it for them .
we really do n't attempt to patronize the people . " to eliasson , the exhibition 's visitors become something like actors and discoverers once they enter the building and decide to continue through one of the two doors .
to the right , they encounter a typical berlin sidewalk - a piece of the city inside the museum .
to the left , a path leads through thick fog that changes colors with each step , making the visitor feel isolated and lost in a public place . for curator daniel birnbaum , eliasson is an artist " who works in a simple , pragmatic , direct and honest manner .

the scots have their own devolved parliament , but they also elect the british government in london .
their votes play a key role in deciding who will rule the united kingdom . on may 6th , the people of the uk will be electing a new parliament .
that includes people north of the english border in scotland , the home country of prime minister gordon brown .
although they have their own additional devolved parliament in edinburgh , the scots also send mps to london . although it only accounts for 59 of the 650 seats , the vote in scotland could play a decisive role in determining the outcome of the general election .
edinburgh 's princes street is busy as usual .
the city 's main shopping street attracts locals and tourists alike .
amongst them is sheila gilmore .
the labour party candidate for edinburgh east is on her way to her next campaign appointment . the elections for the british parliament are very important to scotland , says gilmore .
" we do have our own devolved parliament that looks after our domestic issues , but the overall the funding package is determined by the uk government .
the economy , which is important to everybody in scotland , will be affected by who 's in government and the kind of policies they follow . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scotland has had its own devolved parliament since 1999 labour versus scottish nationalists ?
traditionally , scotland is considered a labour bastion , and gilmore , who 's seat has been labour for decades , is confident that 's the way it will stay .
but prime minister gordon brown 's party has lost support across the country – including scotland .
at the last election to the scottish parliament in 2007 , which is run on the basis of proportional representation instead of the uk 's " first-past-the-post " system , labour did n't win enough seats to form a government .
the country is now ruled by a minority adminsitration formed by the pro-independence scottish national party .
that gives the election a " different buzz from south of the border , " says eberhard bort from the school of governance at edinburgh university .
only 25 to 30 % of scots really want independence from the rest of the uk , he says .
but it seems the scots like devoloution - " especially with a nationalist government , " says bort with a smile .
the opinion polls indicate it 's unlikely that labour will win the uk election on may the 6th .
the best brown can hope for is a hung parliament , with labour winning most seats .
but for that , he must succeed here in scotland , according to political analyst bort .
chris harvie shares his view . the professor of politics sits in the scottish parliament for the scottish national party .
he says labour is dependent on a " substantial return " of labour seats in scotland .
" of the 59 seats , they would expect up to 45 to return labour candidates , " says harvie , himself a former labour man .
" if not , scotland has become a liability rather than an asset to labour . "
this could benefit his own party , says harvie .
snp leader and scottish firstminister alex salmond hopes his party can increase ist current 7 seats to 20 in the election and has been actively campaigning for a hung parliament , which would give a lot of bargaining power to small parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scottish national party leader alex salmond was voted first minister in 2007 .
the ghost of " maggie " thatcher in spite of the unpopularity of the present labour government , which can be attributed partly to the economic crisis , partly to britain 's role in iraq and afghanistan , the polls are not predicting a huge victory for the conservatives .
they too , badly need to win seats in scotland .
at the moment they have only one scottish constituency seat in the westminster parliament .
but in the scottish parliament , which operates on a system of proportional representation , they have been able to win 17 seats .
john lamont has one of them .
now , the young conservative hopes to win the seat in westminster for his constituency of berwickshire , roxburgh and selkirk in the scottish borders .
but the conservatives have an image problem .
lamont is convinced his party 's policies would go down well with the voters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in traditional scottish villages , support for the conservatives is minimal " but the conservative brand is perceived as anti-scotland , " he says , and people still mention mrs thatcher , who introduced some measures very unpoplar with the people of scotland , as a reason not to vote conservative .
" amazing , that was 20 years ago , " says lamont , " i was barely born then ! "
a major force across the uk - the " libdems " the other party playing a bigger role than ever before in this election , in scotland and across the uk , are the liberal democrats .
if neither labour nor conservatives gain an absolute majority , the libdems will become extremely influential in british politics , either as a potential coalition partner or in tolerating a minority government .
party leaders are trying hard not to be drawn on that issue .
" i do n't think it 's clever to speculate on what parliament will look like " , says tavish scott , head of the libdems in scotland .
" the number one need is to get the deficit under control and deal with the state of public finances , which are in an awful crisis in the uk . "
another of his party 's main aims is to " clean up " politics .
here , the liberal democrat hits a note that most voters are concerned about .
after numerous scandals , many people across the uk are getting tired of politics .
" i worry that the expenses scandal that has taken place in the house of commons over the last year or so has turned many people off politics , " says scott , " and that many people will say we 're all as bad as each other and i do n't want anything to do with any of you . "
he fears that could result in a low turnout .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scandals in london could affect the way the scottish capital votes talking to voters back out on princes street , it seems as if tavish scott could have hit the nail on the head .
" you vote for the party you always voted for , " says one passer-by .
" but when the policies come across , they 're all shouting the same sort of thing .
and lately , after all the scandals , you feel a bit disillusioned with them all . "
" well to be quite honest , there is n't much choosing between the parties , " adds a shopper .
" they 're all too busy doing their own thing .
i wish they would actually think of the public and what we want , instead of promising us everything , then , when they come into power , it 's just the same as ever . "

the scots have their own devolved parliament , but they also elect the british government in london .
their votes play a key role in deciding who will rule the united kingdom . on may 6th , the people of the uk will be electing a new parliament .
that includes people north of the english border in scotland , the home country of prime minister gordon brown .
although they have their own additional devolved parliament in edinburgh , the scots also send mps to london . although it only accounts for 59 of the 650 seats , the vote in scotland could play a decisive role in determining the outcome of the general election .
edinburgh 's princes street is busy as usual .
the city 's main shopping street attracts locals and tourists alike .
amongst them is sheila gilmore .
the labour party candidate for edinburgh east is on her way to her next campaign appointment . the elections for the british parliament are very important to scotland , says gilmore .
" we do have our own devolved parliament that looks after our domestic issues , but the overall the funding package is determined by the uk government .
the economy , which is important to everybody in scotland , will be affected by who 's in government and the kind of policies they follow . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scotland has had its own devolved parliament since 1999 labour versus scottish nationalists ?
traditionally , scotland is considered a labour bastion , and gilmore , who 's seat has been labour for decades , is confident that 's the way it will stay .
but prime minister gordon brown 's party has lost support across the country – including scotland .
at the last election to the scottish parliament in 2007 , which is run on the basis of proportional representation instead of the uk 's " first-past-the-post " system , labour did n't win enough seats to form a government .
the country is now ruled by a minority adminsitration formed by the pro-independence scottish national party .
that gives the election a " different buzz from south of the border , " says eberhard bort from the school of governance at edinburgh university .
only 25 to 30 % of scots really want independence from the rest of the uk , he says .
but it seems the scots like devoloution - " especially with a nationalist government , " says bort with a smile .
the opinion polls indicate it 's unlikely that labour will win the uk election on may the 6th .
the best brown can hope for is a hung parliament , with labour winning most seats .
but for that , he must succeed here in scotland , according to political analyst bort .
chris harvie shares his view . the professor of politics sits in the scottish parliament for the scottish national party .
he says labour is dependent on a " substantial return " of labour seats in scotland .
" of the 59 seats , they would expect up to 45 to return labour candidates , " says harvie , himself a former labour man .
" if not , scotland has become a liability rather than an asset to labour . "
this could benefit his own party , says harvie .
snp leader and scottish firstminister alex salmond hopes his party can increase ist current 7 seats to 20 in the election and has been actively campaigning for a hung parliament , which would give a lot of bargaining power to small parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scottish national party leader alex salmond was voted first minister in 2007 .
the ghost of " maggie " thatcher in spite of the unpopularity of the present labour government , which can be attributed partly to the economic crisis , partly to britain 's role in iraq and afghanistan , the polls are not predicting a huge victory for the conservatives .
they too , badly need to win seats in scotland .
at the moment they have only one scottish constituency seat in the westminster parliament .
but in the scottish parliament , which operates on a system of proportional representation , they have been able to win 17 seats .
john lamont has one of them .
now , the young conservative hopes to win the seat in westminster for his constituency of berwickshire , roxburgh and selkirk in the scottish borders .
but the conservatives have an image problem .
lamont is convinced his party 's policies would go down well with the voters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in traditional scottish villages , support for the conservatives is minimal " but the conservative brand is perceived as anti-scotland , " he says , and people still mention mrs thatcher , who introduced some measures very unpoplar with the people of scotland , as a reason not to vote conservative .
" amazing , that was 20 years ago , " says lamont , " i was barely born then ! "
a major force across the uk - the " libdems " the other party playing a bigger role than ever before in this election , in scotland and across the uk , are the liberal democrats .
if neither labour nor conservatives gain an absolute majority , the libdems will become extremely influential in british politics , either as a potential coalition partner or in tolerating a minority government .
party leaders are trying hard not to be drawn on that issue .
" i do n't think it 's clever to speculate on what parliament will look like " , says tavish scott , head of the libdems in scotland .
" the number one need is to get the deficit under control and deal with the state of public finances , which are in an awful crisis in the uk . "
another of his party 's main aims is to " clean up " politics .
here , the liberal democrat hits a note that most voters are concerned about .
after numerous scandals , many people across the uk are getting tired of politics .
" i worry that the expenses scandal that has taken place in the house of commons over the last year or so has turned many people off politics , " says scott , " and that many people will say we 're all as bad as each other and i do n't want anything to do with any of you . "

the scots have their own devolved parliament , but they also elect the british government in london .
their votes play a key role in deciding who will rule the united kingdom . on may 6th , the people of the uk will be electing a new parliament .
that includes people north of the english border in scotland , the home country of prime minister gordon brown .
although they have their own additional devolved parliament in edinburgh , the scots also send mps to london . although it only accounts for 59 of the 650 seats , the vote in scotland could play a decisive role in determining the outcome of the general election .
edinburgh 's princes street is busy as usual .
the city 's main shopping street attracts locals and tourists alike .
amongst them is sheila gilmore .
the labour party candidate for edinburgh east is on her way to her next campaign appointment . the elections for the british parliament are very important to scotland , says gilmore .
" we do have our own devolved parliament that looks after our domestic issues , but the overall the funding package is determined by the uk government .
the economy , which is important to everybody in scotland , will be affected by who 's in government and the kind of policies they follow . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scotland has had its own devolved parliament since 1999 labour versus scottish nationalists ?
traditionally , scotland is considered a labour bastion , and gilmore , who 's seat has been labour for decades , is confident that 's the way it will stay .
but prime minister gordon brown 's party has lost support across the country – including scotland .
at the last election to the scottish parliament in 2007 , which is run on the basis of proportional representation instead of the uk 's " first-past-the-post " system , labour did n't win enough seats to form a government .
the country is now ruled by a minority adminsitration formed by the pro-independence scottish national party .
that gives the election a " different buzz from south of the border , " says eberhard bort from the school of governance at edinburgh university .
only 25 to 30 % of scots really want independence from the rest of the uk , he says .
but it seems the scots like devoloution - " especially with a nationalist government , " says bort with a smile .
the opinion polls indicate it 's unlikely that labour will win the uk election on may the 6th .
the best brown can hope for is a hung parliament , with labour winning most seats .
but for that , he must succeed here in scotland , according to political analyst bort .
chris harvie shares his view . the professor of politics sits in the scottish parliament for the scottish national party .
he says labour is dependent on a " substantial return " of labour seats in scotland .
" of the 59 seats , they would expect up to 45 to return labour candidates , " says harvie , himself a former labour man .
" if not , scotland has become a liability rather than an asset to labour . "
this could benefit his own party , says harvie .
snp leader and scottish firstminister alex salmond hopes his party can increase ist current 7 seats to 20 in the election and has been actively campaigning for a hung parliament , which would give a lot of bargaining power to small parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scottish national party leader alex salmond was voted first minister in 2007 .
the ghost of " maggie " thatcher in spite of the unpopularity of the present labour government , which can be attributed partly to the economic crisis , partly to britain 's role in iraq and afghanistan , the polls are not predicting a huge victory for the conservatives .
they too , badly need to win seats in scotland .
at the moment they have only one scottish constituency seat in the westminster parliament .
but in the scottish parliament , which operates on a system of proportional representation , they have been able to win 17 seats .
john lamont has one of them .
now , the young conservative hopes to win the seat in westminster for his constituency of berwickshire , roxburgh and selkirk in the scottish borders .
but the conservatives have an image problem .
lamont is convinced his party 's policies would go down well with the voters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in traditional scottish villages , support for the conservatives is minimal " but the conservative brand is perceived as anti-scotland , " he says , and people still mention mrs thatcher , who introduced some measures very unpoplar with the people of scotland , as a reason not to vote conservative .
" amazing , that was 20 years ago , " says lamont , " i was barely born then ! "
a major force across the uk - the " libdems " the other party playing a bigger role than ever before in this election , in scotland and across the uk , are the liberal democrats .
if neither labour nor conservatives gain an absolute majority , the libdems will become extremely influential in british politics , either as a potential coalition partner or in tolerating a minority government .
party leaders are trying hard not to be drawn on that issue .
" i do n't think it 's clever to speculate on what parliament will look like " , says tavish scott , head of the libdems in scotland .
" the number one need is to get the deficit under control and deal with the state of public finances , which are in an awful crisis in the uk . "
another of his party 's main aims is to " clean up " politics .
here , the liberal democrat hits a note that most voters are concerned about .
after numerous scandals , many people across the uk are getting tired of politics .
" i worry that the expenses scandal that has taken place in the house of commons over the last year or so has turned many people off politics , " says scott , " and that many people will say we 're all as bad as each other and i do n't want anything to do with any of you . "
he fears that could result in a low turnout .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scandals in london could affect the way the scottish capital votes talking to voters back out on princes street , it seems as if tavish scott could have hit the nail on the head .
" you vote for the party you always voted for , " says one passer-by .
" but when the policies come across , they 're all shouting the same sort of thing .
and lately , after all the scandals , you feel a bit disillusioned with them all . "
" well to be quite honest , there is n't much choosing between the parties , " adds a shopper .
" they 're all too busy doing their own thing .
i wish they would actually think of the public and what we want , instead of promising us everything , then , when they come into power , it 's just the same as ever . "

now , the city is home to a major solo exhibition of his works . olafur eliasson 's art has already been gracing berlin for weeks , though most people would not have realized it .
chalk lines trail through parks and disappear under bushes .
next to some trees and lampposts there are bicycles with mirror-covered wheels .
large logs that arrived with the tide on iceland 's shores lie around the city as if they had fallen there by accident . in addition to all this , a van with an attached mirror has been confronting passers-by , cars , trains , buildings and billboards with their own reflections - a process that was filmed and is now on display at the martin-gropius-bau hall in berlin . the exhibition is titled " innen stadt aussen " - which the curators have translated as " inner city out " but is also a play on words that could mean " inside instead of outside . " just like all other aspects of eliasson 's work , the focus of these exhibits is our own perception . deceptive impressions " i think we take what we see and perceive for granted , " said eliasson .
" we believe that sight is objective or physical and natural , or even a gift from god in some cases . " bildunterschrift : halogen lamps create cascaded images of the exhibition 's visitors eliasson , however , is convinced that our perception of the world is determined by culture - meaning that the same things can be seen in many different ways , and that sight can be deceiving .
his art aims to demonstrate this belief in an entertaining and comprehensible way , forcing us to consider the difference between reality and reflection and between truth and deception . the nature of reality eliasson belives that every artwork needs an observer .
according to daniel birnbaum , the curator of the exhibition , in the case of eliasson 's work " there are objects you can display in a gallery , but what really counts is the confrontation with them . " of course , it is also about what goes on in the mind of the beholder - like the moment he or she becomes confused when taking a glance out of the window of the exhibition hall , only to be confronted with an identical-looking building .
a mirror mounted outside is responsible for this illusion . bildunterschrift : light and reflections are a major theme at the exhibition actors and discoverers according to eliasson , the exhibition 's visitors are partly responsible for what they see . " we entrust the visitors with the responsibility to see the exhibition for themselves , " said eliasson .
" we do n't interpret it for them .
we really do n't attempt to patronize the people . " to eliasson , the exhibition 's visitors become something like actors and discoverers once they enter the building and decide to continue through one of the two doors .
to the right , they encounter a typical berlin sidewalk - a piece of the city inside the museum .
to the left , a path leads through thick fog that changes colors with each step , making the visitor feel isolated and lost in a public place . for curator daniel birnbaum , eliasson is an artist " who works in a simple , pragmatic , direct and honest manner . " " he does n't produce illusions , " added birnbaum .
" it 's rather about the construction of the human gaze . " bildunterschrift : the visitor can feel lost and vulnerable in colored fog optical adventures scientists are likely to appreciate this exhibition , as will children , art historians and lovers of simple shapes .
eliasson does n't just play with light refractions , mirrors and shadows , but also with geometrical shapes like triangles , circles , squares and spheres . he makes a transparent tube look like it is dancing in the light of a stroboscope , makes geodetic spheres glow , and manages to transform the atrium of the martin-gropius-bau building into a crystal wonderland .

now , the city is home to a major solo exhibition of his works . olafur eliasson 's art has already been gracing berlin for weeks , though most people would not have realized it .
chalk lines trail through parks and disappear under bushes .
next to some trees and lampposts there are bicycles with mirror-covered wheels .
large logs that arrived with the tide on iceland 's shores lie around the city as if they had fallen there by accident . in addition to all this , a van with an attached mirror has been confronting passers-by , cars , trains , buildings and billboards with their own reflections - a process that was filmed and is now on display at the martin-gropius-bau hall in berlin . the exhibition is titled " innen stadt aussen " - which the curators have translated as " inner city out " but is also a play on words that could mean " inside instead of outside . " just like all other aspects of eliasson 's work , the focus of these exhibits is our own perception . deceptive impressions " i think we take what we see and perceive for granted , " said eliasson .
" we believe that sight is objective or physical and natural , or even a gift from god in some cases . " bildunterschrift : halogen lamps create cascaded images of the exhibition 's visitors eliasson , however , is convinced that our perception of the world is determined by culture - meaning that the same things can be seen in many different ways , and that sight can be deceiving .
his art aims to demonstrate this belief in an entertaining and comprehensible way , forcing us to consider the difference between reality and reflection and between truth and deception . the nature of reality eliasson belives that every artwork needs an observer .
according to daniel birnbaum , the curator of the exhibition , in the case of eliasson 's work " there are objects you can display in a gallery , but what really counts is the confrontation with them . " of course , it is also about what goes on in the mind of the beholder - like the moment he or she becomes confused when taking a glance out of the window of the exhibition hall , only to be confronted with an identical-looking building .
a mirror mounted outside is responsible for this illusion . bildunterschrift : light and reflections are a major theme at the exhibition actors and discoverers according to eliasson , the exhibition 's visitors are partly responsible for what they see . " we entrust the visitors with the responsibility to see the exhibition for themselves , " said eliasson .
" we do n't interpret it for them .
we really do n't attempt to patronize the people . " to eliasson , the exhibition 's visitors become something like actors and discoverers once they enter the building and decide to continue through one of the two doors .
to the right , they encounter a typical berlin sidewalk - a piece of the city inside the museum .
to the left , a path leads through thick fog that changes colors with each step , making the visitor feel isolated and lost in a public place . for curator daniel birnbaum , eliasson is an artist " who works in a simple , pragmatic , direct and honest manner . " " he does n't produce illusions , " added birnbaum .
" it 's rather about the construction of the human gaze . " bildunterschrift : the visitor can feel lost and vulnerable in colored fog optical adventures scientists are likely to appreciate this exhibition , as will children , art historians and lovers of simple shapes .
eliasson does n't just play with light refractions , mirrors and shadows , but also with geometrical shapes like triangles , circles , squares and spheres . he makes a transparent tube look like it is dancing in the light of a stroboscope , makes geodetic spheres glow , and manages to transform the atrium of the martin-gropius-bau building into a crystal wonderland .

the scots have their own devolved parliament , but they also elect the british government in london .
their votes play a key role in deciding who will rule the united kingdom . on may 6th , the people of the uk will be electing a new parliament .
that includes people north of the english border in scotland , the home country of prime minister gordon brown .
although they have their own additional devolved parliament in edinburgh , the scots also send mps to london . although it only accounts for 59 of the 650 seats , the vote in scotland could play a decisive role in determining the outcome of the general election .
edinburgh 's princes street is busy as usual .
the city 's main shopping street attracts locals and tourists alike .
amongst them is sheila gilmore .
the labour party candidate for edinburgh east is on her way to her next campaign appointment . the elections for the british parliament are very important to scotland , says gilmore .
" we do have our own devolved parliament that looks after our domestic issues , but the overall the funding package is determined by the uk government .
the economy , which is important to everybody in scotland , will be affected by who 's in government and the kind of policies they follow . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scotland has had its own devolved parliament since 1999 labour versus scottish nationalists ?
traditionally , scotland is considered a labour bastion , and gilmore , who 's seat has been labour for decades , is confident that 's the way it will stay .
but prime minister gordon brown 's party has lost support across the country – including scotland .
at the last election to the scottish parliament in 2007 , which is run on the basis of proportional representation instead of the uk 's " first-past-the-post " system , labour did n't win enough seats to form a government .
the country is now ruled by a minority adminsitration formed by the pro-independence scottish national party .
that gives the election a " different buzz from south of the border , " says eberhard bort from the school of governance at edinburgh university .
only 25 to 30 % of scots really want independence from the rest of the uk , he says .
but it seems the scots like devoloution - " especially with a nationalist government , " says bort with a smile .
the opinion polls indicate it 's unlikely that labour will win the uk election on may the 6th .
the best brown can hope for is a hung parliament , with labour winning most seats .
but for that , he must succeed here in scotland , according to political analyst bort .
chris harvie shares his view . the professor of politics sits in the scottish parliament for the scottish national party .
he says labour is dependent on a " substantial return " of labour seats in scotland .
" of the 59 seats , they would expect up to 45 to return labour candidates , " says harvie , himself a former labour man .
" if not , scotland has become a liability rather than an asset to labour . "
this could benefit his own party , says harvie .
snp leader and scottish firstminister alex salmond hopes his party can increase ist current 7 seats to 20 in the election and has been actively campaigning for a hung parliament , which would give a lot of bargaining power to small parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scottish national party leader alex salmond was voted first minister in 2007 .
the ghost of " maggie " thatcher in spite of the unpopularity of the present labour government , which can be attributed partly to the economic crisis , partly to britain 's role in iraq and afghanistan , the polls are not predicting a huge victory for the conservatives .
they too , badly need to win seats in scotland .
at the moment they have only one scottish constituency seat in the westminster parliament .
but in the scottish parliament , which operates on a system of proportional representation , they have been able to win 17 seats .
john lamont has one of them .
now , the young conservative hopes to win the seat in westminster for his constituency of berwickshire , roxburgh and selkirk in the scottish borders .
but the conservatives have an image problem .
lamont is convinced his party 's policies would go down well with the voters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in traditional scottish villages , support for the conservatives is minimal " but the conservative brand is perceived as anti-scotland , " he says , and people still mention mrs thatcher , who introduced some measures very unpoplar with the people of scotland , as a reason not to vote conservative .
" amazing , that was 20 years ago , " says lamont , " i was barely born then ! "
a major force across the uk - the " libdems " the other party playing a bigger role than ever before in this election , in scotland and across the uk , are the liberal democrats .
if neither labour nor conservatives gain an absolute majority , the libdems will become extremely influential in british politics , either as a potential coalition partner or in tolerating a minority government .
party leaders are trying hard not to be drawn on that issue .
" i do n't think it 's clever to speculate on what parliament will look like " , says tavish scott , head of the libdems in scotland .
" the number one need is to get the deficit under control and deal with the state of public finances , which are in an awful crisis in the uk . "
another of his party 's main aims is to " clean up " politics .
here , the liberal democrat hits a note that most voters are concerned about .
after numerous scandals , many people across the uk are getting tired of politics .
" i worry that the expenses scandal that has taken place in the house of commons over the last year or so has turned many people off politics , " says scott , " and that many people will say we 're all as bad as each other and i do n't want anything to do with any of you . "
he fears that could result in a low turnout .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scandals in london could affect the way the scottish capital votes talking to voters back out on princes street , it seems as if tavish scott could have hit the nail on the head .
" you vote for the party you always voted for , " says one passer-by .
" but when the policies come across , they 're all shouting the same sort of thing .
and lately , after all the scandals , you feel a bit disillusioned with them all . "
" well to be quite honest , there is n't much choosing between the parties , " adds a shopper .
" they 're all too busy doing their own thing .
i wish they would actually think of the public and what we want , instead of promising us everything , then , when they come into power , it 's just the same as ever . "

" we do have our own devolved parliament that looks after our domestic issues , but the overall the funding package is determined by the uk government .
the economy , which is important to everybody in scotland , will be affected by who 's in government and the kind of policies they follow . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scotland has had its own devolved parliament since 1999 labour versus scottish nationalists ?
traditionally , scotland is considered a labour bastion , and gilmore , who 's seat has been labour for decades , is confident that 's the way it will stay .
but prime minister gordon brown 's party has lost support across the country – including scotland .
at the last election to the scottish parliament in 2007 , which is run on the basis of proportional representation instead of the uk 's " first-past-the-post " system , labour did n't win enough seats to form a government .
the country is now ruled by a minority adminsitration formed by the pro-independence scottish national party .
that gives the election a " different buzz from south of the border , " says eberhard bort from the school of governance at edinburgh university .
only 25 to 30 % of scots really want independence from the rest of the uk , he says .
but it seems the scots like devoloution - " especially with a nationalist government , " says bort with a smile .
the opinion polls indicate it 's unlikely that labour will win the uk election on may the 6th .
the best brown can hope for is a hung parliament , with labour winning most seats .
but for that , he must succeed here in scotland , according to political analyst bort .
chris harvie shares his view . the professor of politics sits in the scottish parliament for the scottish national party .
he says labour is dependent on a " substantial return " of labour seats in scotland .
" of the 59 seats , they would expect up to 45 to return labour candidates , " says harvie , himself a former labour man .
" if not , scotland has become a liability rather than an asset to labour . "
this could benefit his own party , says harvie .
snp leader and scottish firstminister alex salmond hopes his party can increase ist current 7 seats to 20 in the election and has been actively campaigning for a hung parliament , which would give a lot of bargaining power to small parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scottish national party leader alex salmond was voted first minister in 2007 .
the ghost of " maggie " thatcher in spite of the unpopularity of the present labour government , which can be attributed partly to the economic crisis , partly to britain 's role in iraq and afghanistan , the polls are not predicting a huge victory for the conservatives .
they too , badly need to win seats in scotland .
at the moment they have only one scottish constituency seat in the westminster parliament .
but in the scottish parliament , which operates on a system of proportional representation , they have been able to win 17 seats .
john lamont has one of them .
now , the young conservative hopes to win the seat in westminster for his constituency of berwickshire , roxburgh and selkirk in the scottish borders .
but the conservatives have an image problem .
lamont is convinced his party 's policies would go down well with the voters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in traditional scottish villages , support for the conservatives is minimal " but the conservative brand is perceived as anti-scotland , " he says , and people still mention mrs thatcher , who introduced some measures very unpoplar with the people of scotland , as a reason not to vote conservative .
" amazing , that was 20 years ago , " says lamont , " i was barely born then ! "
a major force across the uk - the " libdems " the other party playing a bigger role than ever before in this election , in scotland and across the uk , are the liberal democrats .
if neither labour nor conservatives gain an absolute majority , the libdems will become extremely influential in british politics , either as a potential coalition partner or in tolerating a minority government .
party leaders are trying hard not to be drawn on that issue .
" i do n't think it 's clever to speculate on what parliament will look like " , says tavish scott , head of the libdems in scotland .
" the number one need is to get the deficit under control and deal with the state of public finances , which are in an awful crisis in the uk . "
another of his party 's main aims is to " clean up " politics .
here , the liberal democrat hits a note that most voters are concerned about .
after numerous scandals , many people across the uk are getting tired of politics .
" i worry that the expenses scandal that has taken place in the house of commons over the last year or so has turned many people off politics , " says scott , " and that many people will say we 're all as bad as each other and i do n't want anything to do with any of you . "
he fears that could result in a low turnout .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scandals in london could affect the way the scottish capital votes talking to voters back out on princes street , it seems as if tavish scott could have hit the nail on the head .
" you vote for the party you always voted for , " says one passer-by .
" but when the policies come across , they 're all shouting the same sort of thing .
and lately , after all the scandals , you feel a bit disillusioned with them all . "
" well to be quite honest , there is n't much choosing between the parties , " adds a shopper .
" they 're all too busy doing their own thing .
i wish they would actually think of the public and what we want , instead of promising us everything , then , when they come into power , it 's just the same as ever . "

the ghost of " maggie " thatcher in spite of the unpopularity of the present labour government , which can be attributed partly to the economic crisis , partly to britain 's role in iraq and afghanistan , the polls are not predicting a huge victory for the conservatives .
they too , badly need to win seats in scotland .
at the moment they have only one scottish constituency seat in the westminster parliament .
but in the scottish parliament , which operates on a system of proportional representation , they have been able to win 17 seats .
john lamont has one of them .
now , the young conservative hopes to win the seat in westminster for his constituency of berwickshire , roxburgh and selkirk in the scottish borders .
but the conservatives have an image problem .
lamont is convinced his party 's policies would go down well with the voters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in traditional scottish villages , support for the conservatives is minimal " but the conservative brand is perceived as anti-scotland , " he says , and people still mention mrs thatcher , who introduced some measures very unpoplar with the people of scotland , as a reason not to vote conservative .
" amazing , that was 20 years ago , " says lamont , " i was barely born then ! "
a major force across the uk - the " libdems " the other party playing a bigger role than ever before in this election , in scotland and across the uk , are the liberal democrats .
if neither labour nor conservatives gain an absolute majority , the libdems will become extremely influential in british politics , either as a potential coalition partner or in tolerating a minority government .
party leaders are trying hard not to be drawn on that issue .
" i do n't think it 's clever to speculate on what parliament will look like " , says tavish scott , head of the libdems in scotland .
" the number one need is to get the deficit under control and deal with the state of public finances , which are in an awful crisis in the uk . "
another of his party 's main aims is to " clean up " politics .
here , the liberal democrat hits a note that most voters are concerned about .
after numerous scandals , many people across the uk are getting tired of politics .
" i worry that the expenses scandal that has taken place in the house of commons over the last year or so has turned many people off politics , " says scott , " and that many people will say we 're all as bad as each other and i do n't want anything to do with any of you . "
he fears that could result in a low turnout .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scandals in london could affect the way the scottish capital votes talking to voters back out on princes street , it seems as if tavish scott could have hit the nail on the head .
" you vote for the party you always voted for , " says one passer-by .
" but when the policies come across , they 're all shouting the same sort of thing .
and lately , after all the scandals , you feel a bit disillusioned with them all . "
" well to be quite honest , there is n't much choosing between the parties , " adds a shopper .
" they 're all too busy doing their own thing .
i wish they would actually think of the public and what we want , instead of promising us everything , then , when they come into power , it 's just the same as ever . "

now , the city is home to a major solo exhibition of his works . olafur eliasson 's art has already been gracing berlin for weeks , though most people would not have realized it .
chalk lines trail through parks and disappear under bushes .
next to some trees and lampposts there are bicycles with mirror-covered wheels .
large logs that arrived with the tide on iceland 's shores lie around the city as if they had fallen there by accident . in addition to all this , a van with an attached mirror has been confronting passers-by , cars , trains , buildings and billboards with their own reflections - a process that was filmed and is now on display at the martin-gropius-bau hall in berlin . the exhibition is titled " innen stadt aussen " - which the curators have translated as " inner city out " but is also a play on words that could mean " inside instead of outside . " just like all other aspects of eliasson 's work , the focus of these exhibits is our own perception . deceptive impressions " i think we take what we see and perceive for granted , " said eliasson .
" we believe that sight is objective or physical and natural , or even a gift from god in some cases . " bildunterschrift : halogen lamps create cascaded images of the exhibition 's visitors eliasson , however , is convinced that our perception of the world is determined by culture - meaning that the same things can be seen in many different ways , and that sight can be deceiving .
his art aims to demonstrate this belief in an entertaining and comprehensible way , forcing us to consider the difference between reality and reflection and between truth and deception . the nature of reality eliasson belives that every artwork needs an observer .
according to daniel birnbaum , the curator of the exhibition , in the case of eliasson 's work " there are objects you can display in a gallery , but what really counts is the confrontation with them . " of course , it is also about what goes on in the mind of the beholder - like the moment he or she becomes confused when taking a glance out of the window of the exhibition hall , only to be confronted with an identical-looking building .
a mirror mounted outside is responsible for this illusion . bildunterschrift : light and reflections are a major theme at the exhibition actors and discoverers according to eliasson , the exhibition 's visitors are partly responsible for what they see . " we entrust the visitors with the responsibility to see the exhibition for themselves , " said eliasson .
" we do n't interpret it for them .
we really do n't attempt to patronize the people . " to eliasson , the exhibition 's visitors become something like actors and discoverers once they enter the building and decide to continue through one of the two doors .
to the right , they encounter a typical berlin sidewalk - a piece of the city inside the museum .
to the left , a path leads through thick fog that changes colors with each step , making the visitor feel isolated and lost in a public place . for curator daniel birnbaum , eliasson is an artist " who works in a simple , pragmatic , direct and honest manner . " " he does n't produce illusions , " added birnbaum .
" it 's rather about the construction of the human gaze . " bildunterschrift : the visitor can feel lost and vulnerable in colored fog optical adventures scientists are likely to appreciate this exhibition , as will children , art historians and lovers of simple shapes .
eliasson does n't just play with light refractions , mirrors and shadows , but also with geometrical shapes like triangles , circles , squares and spheres . he makes a transparent tube look like it is dancing in the light of a stroboscope , makes geodetic spheres glow , and manages to transform the atrium of the martin-gropius-bau building into a crystal wonderland .

" one thing that did not work well in copenhagen is that a small circle met and the regional groups felt left out of the debate , " merkel said in bonn on sunday .
germany and mexico hope to get negotiations moving again and have invited representatives from developed and developing countries to bonn to flesh out common ground on environmental issues .
developed versus developing nations mexican president felipe calderon stressed that developing and developed countries must agree on the issue of finance for poorer countries , to enable them to fight climate change .
" this atmosphere of trust is something we really need to make use of for the fast-track financing , " he told ministers in bonn .
" 2010 is the year when we need to take action . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traffic is just one of many climate issues on the agenda the conference - dubbed the petersberg climate dialogue - comes five months after the disastrous summit in copenhagen last december , where countries merely agreed that global temperatures should rise by no more than 2 degrees celsius , but failed to specify any details on how this could be achieved and shared out between the nations .
developing countries have long demanded that richer countries must pay a bigger share in the fight against greenhosue gas emissions , as big industrial nations are the main polluters .
mexico is slated to host the next full-scale un climate summit at the resort of cancun in late november .
meeting designed to re-kindle confidence the petersberg gathering - at germany 's former hilltop government guesthouse when bonn was still the capital - is not expected to make any formal resolutions , but the germans and mexicans are hoping it will come up with ideas to clear the logjam on climate policies .
german environment minister norbert roettgen said the purpose of the meeting was " confidence-building " among emerging and industrial nations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is the world 's biggest polluter , along with the us " we have to get trust and flexibility back into the climate process , " he said .
the german environment minister also urged the european union to take on the pioneering role of developing and implementing low-carbon policies .
the two most important figures at the bonn talks are likely to be the chief us and chinese negotiators .
world leaders realized in copenhagen that climate talks would continue to be very difficult .
already , the president of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , has dampened expectations , telling the german newspaper hamburger abendblatt that there would probably not be any legally binding agreements made in cancun , but perhaps some progress in deciding who makes the sacrifices. gb / ng / dpa / epd / ap / afp editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the aid package requires that athens implement tough austerity measures . eurozone finance ministers , in an emergency session on sunday , approved a loan package to save greece from defaulting on its debt .
eurogroup head jean-claude juncker said a total of 110 billion euros -lrb- $ 146 billion -rrb- would be spread out over three years .
up to 30 billion euros will be ready to be disbursed in 2010 . eurozone states are expected to give 80 billion euros while the rest is to be provided by the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- . it is by far the largest bailout ever assembled for a country .

" us president barack obama told papandreou in a telephone interview late on sunday that he welcomed greece 's ambitious reform programs and the support from the eu and the imf . germany 's merkel backs bailout much of sunday 's talks depended on the attitude of germany , which is expected to foot the largest chunk of the bill - around 22 billion euros . german chancellor angela merkel had been hesitant about rushing aid to greece because it is unpopular among germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will have to pay the biggest chunk of the bailout on sunday however , merkel got fully behind the measure , calling the greek austerity program very ambitious and saying there was no choice but to save greece .

" i 'm going to work for the greece program and its passage . " german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble said the german cabinet would meet monday to work on a draft legislation for the aid .
he said the bill would then be approved in the german parliament by friday . to ensure the stability of the euro , schaeuble told german public television ard late on sunday , " we , as well as the german people and the taxpayer , have to take on this difficult decision -lsb- to approve the aid deal -rsb- . " he also warned greece that " the smallest deviation -lsb- from the austerity plan -rsb- would have consequences , that much is clear , " he told ard . widespread protests across greece but athen 's plans for painful wage and pension cuts have already triggered widespread protest in greece with unions planning a nationwide strike on wednesday .

he also conceived three children with two women , the order recently said in an official apology . he died in 2008 , still a priest , despite being told to retire to a life of " prayer and penitence " by the pope in 2006 .
eight priests had accused maciel of molesting them as children years before this , but the order denied these claims . at the time , he was one of the most prominent persons to be disciplined for sexual misconduct in the church 's history . without addressing accusations that the church hierarchy was aware of and covered up maciel 's misconduct , the vatican condemned the legion founder 's " very serious and objectively immoral actions confirmed by incontestable testimonies " in its statement on saturday . the legion of christ has about 850 priests and 2,500 seminarians in 21 countries around the world .

" 2010 is the year when we need to take action . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traffic is just one of many climate issues on the agenda the conference - dubbed the petersberg climate dialogue - comes five months after the disastrous summit in copenhagen last december , where countries merely agreed that global temperatures should rise by no more than 2 degrees celsius , but failed to specify any details on how this could be achieved and shared out between the nations .
developing countries have long demanded that richer countries must pay a bigger share in the fight against greenhosue gas emissions , as big industrial nations are the main polluters .
mexico is slated to host the next full-scale un climate summit at the resort of cancun in late november .
meeting designed to re-kindle confidence the petersberg gathering - at germany 's former hilltop government guesthouse when bonn was still the capital - is not expected to make any formal resolutions , but the germans and mexicans are hoping it will come up with ideas to clear the logjam on climate policies .
german environment minister norbert roettgen said the purpose of the meeting was " confidence-building " among emerging and industrial nations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is the world 's biggest polluter , along with the us " we have to get trust and flexibility back into the climate process , " he said .
the german environment minister also urged the european union to take on the pioneering role of developing and implementing low-carbon policies .
the two most important figures at the bonn talks are likely to be the chief us and chinese negotiators .
world leaders realized in copenhagen that climate talks would continue to be very difficult .
already , the president of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , has dampened expectations , telling the german newspaper hamburger abendblatt that there would probably not be any legally binding agreements made in cancun , but perhaps some progress in deciding who makes the sacrifices. gb / ng / dpa / epd / ap / afp editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , the city is home to a major solo exhibition of his works . olafur eliasson 's art has already been gracing berlin for weeks , though most people would not have realized it .
chalk lines trail through parks and disappear under bushes .
next to some trees and lampposts there are bicycles with mirror-covered wheels .
large logs that arrived with the tide on iceland 's shores lie around the city as if they had fallen there by accident . in addition to all this , a van with an attached mirror has been confronting passers-by , cars , trains , buildings and billboards with their own reflections - a process that was filmed and is now on display at the martin-gropius-bau hall in berlin . the exhibition is titled " innen stadt aussen " - which the curators have translated as " inner city out " but is also a play on words that could mean " inside instead of outside . " just like all other aspects of eliasson 's work , the focus of these exhibits is our own perception . deceptive impressions " i think we take what we see and perceive for granted , " said eliasson .
" we believe that sight is objective or physical and natural , or even a gift from god in some cases . " bildunterschrift : halogen lamps create cascaded images of the exhibition 's visitors eliasson , however , is convinced that our perception of the world is determined by culture - meaning that the same things can be seen in many different ways , and that sight can be deceiving .
his art aims to demonstrate this belief in an entertaining and comprehensible way , forcing us to consider the difference between reality and reflection and between truth and deception . the nature of reality eliasson belives that every artwork needs an observer .
according to daniel birnbaum , the curator of the exhibition , in the case of eliasson 's work " there are objects you can display in a gallery , but what really counts is the confrontation with them . " of course , it is also about what goes on in the mind of the beholder - like the moment he or she becomes confused when taking a glance out of the window of the exhibition hall , only to be confronted with an identical-looking building .
a mirror mounted outside is responsible for this illusion . bildunterschrift : light and reflections are a major theme at the exhibition actors and discoverers according to eliasson , the exhibition 's visitors are partly responsible for what they see . " we entrust the visitors with the responsibility to see the exhibition for themselves , " said eliasson .
" we do n't interpret it for them .
we really do n't attempt to patronize the people . " to eliasson , the exhibition 's visitors become something like actors and discoverers once they enter the building and decide to continue through one of the two doors .
to the right , they encounter a typical berlin sidewalk - a piece of the city inside the museum .
to the left , a path leads through thick fog that changes colors with each step , making the visitor feel isolated and lost in a public place . for curator daniel birnbaum , eliasson is an artist " who works in a simple , pragmatic , direct and honest manner . " " he does n't produce illusions , " added birnbaum .
" it 's rather about the construction of the human gaze . " bildunterschrift : the visitor can feel lost and vulnerable in colored fog optical adventures scientists are likely to appreciate this exhibition , as will children , art historians and lovers of simple shapes .
eliasson does n't just play with light refractions , mirrors and shadows , but also with geometrical shapes like triangles , circles , squares and spheres . he makes a transparent tube look like it is dancing in the light of a stroboscope , makes geodetic spheres glow , and manages to transform the atrium of the martin-gropius-bau building into a crystal wonderland .
the boundaries between the inside and the outside become blurred - and the visitor is awed . the exhibition olafur eliasson : innen stadt aussen , runs from april 28 through august 9 at the martin-gropius-bau in berlin . author : silke bartlick -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the legionaries thank the holy father and embrace his provisions with faith and obedience , " the group said on its website after the vatican announced the move . the roman catholic church and pope benedict xvi , in particular , are currently under increasing pressure to tighten up internal discipline , after a series of previously covered-up sex abuse cases have come to light across europe . founding father the order 's founder , marcial maciel , is alleged to have sexually abused numerous underage seminarians .
he also conceived three children with two women , the order recently said in an official apology . he died in 2008 , still a priest , despite being told to retire to a life of " prayer and penitence " by the pope in 2006 .
eight priests had accused maciel of molesting them as children years before this , but the order denied these claims . at the time , he was one of the most prominent persons to be disciplined for sexual misconduct in the church 's history . without addressing accusations that the church hierarchy was aware of and covered up maciel 's misconduct , the vatican condemned the legion founder 's " very serious and objectively immoral actions confirmed by incontestable testimonies " in its statement on saturday . the legion of christ has about 850 priests and 2,500 seminarians in 21 countries around the world .

some 650 former inmates of the camp took part in the commemoration ceremonies on sunday , during which koehler called dachau an important reminder of germany 's darkest period .
before giving his speech , koehler laid a wreath at the site of the former crematorium .
he is the first german president to visit the memorial , located near munich in southern germany .

now , the city is home to a major solo exhibition of his works . olafur eliasson 's art has already been gracing berlin for weeks , though most people would not have realized it .
chalk lines trail through parks and disappear under bushes .
next to some trees and lampposts there are bicycles with mirror-covered wheels .
large logs that arrived with the tide on iceland 's shores lie around the city as if they had fallen there by accident . in addition to all this , a van with an attached mirror has been confronting passers-by , cars , trains , buildings and billboards with their own reflections - a process that was filmed and is now on display at the martin-gropius-bau hall in berlin . the exhibition is titled " innen stadt aussen " - which the curators have translated as " inner city out " but is also a play on words that could mean " inside instead of outside . " just like all other aspects of eliasson 's work , the focus of these exhibits is our own perception . deceptive impressions " i think we take what we see and perceive for granted , " said eliasson .
" we believe that sight is objective or physical and natural , or even a gift from god in some cases . " bildunterschrift : halogen lamps create cascaded images of the exhibition 's visitors eliasson , however , is convinced that our perception of the world is determined by culture - meaning that the same things can be seen in many different ways , and that sight can be deceiving .
his art aims to demonstrate this belief in an entertaining and comprehensible way , forcing us to consider the difference between reality and reflection and between truth and deception . the nature of reality eliasson belives that every artwork needs an observer .
according to daniel birnbaum , the curator of the exhibition , in the case of eliasson 's work " there are objects you can display in a gallery , but what really counts is the confrontation with them . " of course , it is also about what goes on in the mind of the beholder - like the moment he or she becomes confused when taking a glance out of the window of the exhibition hall , only to be confronted with an identical-looking building .
a mirror mounted outside is responsible for this illusion . bildunterschrift : light and reflections are a major theme at the exhibition actors and discoverers according to eliasson , the exhibition 's visitors are partly responsible for what they see . " we entrust the visitors with the responsibility to see the exhibition for themselves , " said eliasson .
" we do n't interpret it for them .
we really do n't attempt to patronize the people . " to eliasson , the exhibition 's visitors become something like actors and discoverers once they enter the building and decide to continue through one of the two doors .
to the right , they encounter a typical berlin sidewalk - a piece of the city inside the museum .
to the left , a path leads through thick fog that changes colors with each step , making the visitor feel isolated and lost in a public place . for curator daniel birnbaum , eliasson is an artist " who works in a simple , pragmatic , direct and honest manner . " " he does n't produce illusions , " added birnbaum .
" it 's rather about the construction of the human gaze . " bildunterschrift : the visitor can feel lost and vulnerable in colored fog optical adventures scientists are likely to appreciate this exhibition , as will children , art historians and lovers of simple shapes .
eliasson does n't just play with light refractions , mirrors and shadows , but also with geometrical shapes like triangles , circles , squares and spheres . he makes a transparent tube look like it is dancing in the light of a stroboscope , makes geodetic spheres glow , and manages to transform the atrium of the martin-gropius-bau building into a crystal wonderland .
the boundaries between the inside and the outside become blurred - and the visitor is awed . the exhibition olafur eliasson : innen stadt aussen , runs from april 28 through august 9 at the martin-gropius-bau in berlin . author : silke bartlick -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" one thing that did not work well in copenhagen is that a small circle met and the regional groups felt left out of the debate , " merkel said in bonn on sunday .
germany and mexico hope to get negotiations moving again and have invited representatives from developed and developing countries to bonn to flesh out common ground on environmental issues .
developed versus developing nations mexican president felipe calderon stressed that developing and developed countries must agree on the issue of finance for poorer countries , to enable them to fight climate change .
" this atmosphere of trust is something we really need to make use of for the fast-track financing , " he told ministers in bonn .
" 2010 is the year when we need to take action . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traffic is just one of many climate issues on the agenda the conference - dubbed the petersberg climate dialogue - comes five months after the disastrous summit in copenhagen last december , where countries merely agreed that global temperatures should rise by no more than 2 degrees celsius , but failed to specify any details on how this could be achieved and shared out between the nations .
developing countries have long demanded that richer countries must pay a bigger share in the fight against greenhosue gas emissions , as big industrial nations are the main polluters .
mexico is slated to host the next full-scale un climate summit at the resort of cancun in late november .
meeting designed to re-kindle confidence the petersberg gathering - at germany 's former hilltop government guesthouse when bonn was still the capital - is not expected to make any formal resolutions , but the germans and mexicans are hoping it will come up with ideas to clear the logjam on climate policies .
german environment minister norbert roettgen said the purpose of the meeting was " confidence-building " among emerging and industrial nations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is the world 's biggest polluter , along with the us " we have to get trust and flexibility back into the climate process , " he said .
the german environment minister also urged the european union to take on the pioneering role of developing and implementing low-carbon policies .
the two most important figures at the bonn talks are likely to be the chief us and chinese negotiators .
world leaders realized in copenhagen that climate talks would continue to be very difficult .
already , the president of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , has dampened expectations , telling the german newspaper hamburger abendblatt that there would probably not be any legally binding agreements made in cancun , but perhaps some progress in deciding who makes the sacrifices. gb / ng / dpa / epd / ap / afp editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

although they have their own additional devolved parliament in edinburgh , the scots also send mps to london . although it only accounts for 59 of the 650 seats , the vote in scotland could play a decisive role in determining the outcome of the general election .
edinburgh 's princes street is busy as usual .
the city 's main shopping street attracts locals and tourists alike .
amongst them is sheila gilmore .
the labour party candidate for edinburgh east is on her way to her next campaign appointment . the elections for the british parliament are very important to scotland , says gilmore .
" we do have our own devolved parliament that looks after our domestic issues , but the overall the funding package is determined by the uk government .
the economy , which is important to everybody in scotland , will be affected by who 's in government and the kind of policies they follow . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scotland has had its own devolved parliament since 1999 labour versus scottish nationalists ?
traditionally , scotland is considered a labour bastion , and gilmore , who 's seat has been labour for decades , is confident that 's the way it will stay .
but prime minister gordon brown 's party has lost support across the country – including scotland .
at the last election to the scottish parliament in 2007 , which is run on the basis of proportional representation instead of the uk 's " first-past-the-post " system , labour did n't win enough seats to form a government .
the country is now ruled by a minority adminsitration formed by the pro-independence scottish national party .
that gives the election a " different buzz from south of the border , " says eberhard bort from the school of governance at edinburgh university .
only 25 to 30 % of scots really want independence from the rest of the uk , he says .
but it seems the scots like devoloution - " especially with a nationalist government , " says bort with a smile .
the opinion polls indicate it 's unlikely that labour will win the uk election on may the 6th .
the best brown can hope for is a hung parliament , with labour winning most seats .
but for that , he must succeed here in scotland , according to political analyst bort .
chris harvie shares his view . the professor of politics sits in the scottish parliament for the scottish national party .
he says labour is dependent on a " substantial return " of labour seats in scotland .
" of the 59 seats , they would expect up to 45 to return labour candidates , " says harvie , himself a former labour man .
" if not , scotland has become a liability rather than an asset to labour . "
this could benefit his own party , says harvie .
snp leader and scottish firstminister alex salmond hopes his party can increase ist current 7 seats to 20 in the election and has been actively campaigning for a hung parliament , which would give a lot of bargaining power to small parties .

the ghost of " maggie " thatcher in spite of the unpopularity of the present labour government , which can be attributed partly to the economic crisis , partly to britain 's role in iraq and afghanistan , the polls are not predicting a huge victory for the conservatives .
they too , badly need to win seats in scotland .
at the moment they have only one scottish constituency seat in the westminster parliament .
but in the scottish parliament , which operates on a system of proportional representation , they have been able to win 17 seats .
john lamont has one of them .
now , the young conservative hopes to win the seat in westminster for his constituency of berwickshire , roxburgh and selkirk in the scottish borders .
but the conservatives have an image problem .
lamont is convinced his party 's policies would go down well with the voters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in traditional scottish villages , support for the conservatives is minimal " but the conservative brand is perceived as anti-scotland , " he says , and people still mention mrs thatcher , who introduced some measures very unpoplar with the people of scotland , as a reason not to vote conservative .
" amazing , that was 20 years ago , " says lamont , " i was barely born then ! "
a major force across the uk - the " libdems " the other party playing a bigger role than ever before in this election , in scotland and across the uk , are the liberal democrats .
if neither labour nor conservatives gain an absolute majority , the libdems will become extremely influential in british politics , either as a potential coalition partner or in tolerating a minority government .
party leaders are trying hard not to be drawn on that issue .
" i do n't think it 's clever to speculate on what parliament will look like " , says tavish scott , head of the libdems in scotland .
" the number one need is to get the deficit under control and deal with the state of public finances , which are in an awful crisis in the uk . "
another of his party 's main aims is to " clean up " politics .
here , the liberal democrat hits a note that most voters are concerned about .
after numerous scandals , many people across the uk are getting tired of politics .
" i worry that the expenses scandal that has taken place in the house of commons over the last year or so has turned many people off politics , " says scott , " and that many people will say we 're all as bad as each other and i do n't want anything to do with any of you . "
he fears that could result in a low turnout .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scandals in london could affect the way the scottish capital votes talking to voters back out on princes street , it seems as if tavish scott could have hit the nail on the head .
" you vote for the party you always voted for , " says one passer-by .
" but when the policies come across , they 're all shouting the same sort of thing .
and lately , after all the scandals , you feel a bit disillusioned with them all . "
" well to be quite honest , there is n't much choosing between the parties , " adds a shopper .
" they 're all too busy doing their own thing .
i wish they would actually think of the public and what we want , instead of promising us everything , then , when they come into power , it 's just the same as ever . "

snp leader and scottish firstminister alex salmond hopes his party can increase ist current 7 seats to 20 in the election and has been actively campaigning for a hung parliament , which would give a lot of bargaining power to small parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scottish national party leader alex salmond was voted first minister in 2007 .
the ghost of " maggie " thatcher in spite of the unpopularity of the present labour government , which can be attributed partly to the economic crisis , partly to britain 's role in iraq and afghanistan , the polls are not predicting a huge victory for the conservatives .
they too , badly need to win seats in scotland .
at the moment they have only one scottish constituency seat in the westminster parliament .
but in the scottish parliament , which operates on a system of proportional representation , they have been able to win 17 seats .
john lamont has one of them .
now , the young conservative hopes to win the seat in westminster for his constituency of berwickshire , roxburgh and selkirk in the scottish borders .
but the conservatives have an image problem .
lamont is convinced his party 's policies would go down well with the voters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in traditional scottish villages , support for the conservatives is minimal " but the conservative brand is perceived as anti-scotland , " he says , and people still mention mrs thatcher , who introduced some measures very unpoplar with the people of scotland , as a reason not to vote conservative .
" amazing , that was 20 years ago , " says lamont , " i was barely born then ! "
a major force across the uk - the " libdems " the other party playing a bigger role than ever before in this election , in scotland and across the uk , are the liberal democrats .
if neither labour nor conservatives gain an absolute majority , the libdems will become extremely influential in british politics , either as a potential coalition partner or in tolerating a minority government .
party leaders are trying hard not to be drawn on that issue .
" i do n't think it 's clever to speculate on what parliament will look like " , says tavish scott , head of the libdems in scotland .
" the number one need is to get the deficit under control and deal with the state of public finances , which are in an awful crisis in the uk . "
another of his party 's main aims is to " clean up " politics .
here , the liberal democrat hits a note that most voters are concerned about .
after numerous scandals , many people across the uk are getting tired of politics .
" i worry that the expenses scandal that has taken place in the house of commons over the last year or so has turned many people off politics , " says scott , " and that many people will say we 're all as bad as each other and i do n't want anything to do with any of you . "
he fears that could result in a low turnout .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scandals in london could affect the way the scottish capital votes talking to voters back out on princes street , it seems as if tavish scott could have hit the nail on the head .
" you vote for the party you always voted for , " says one passer-by .
" but when the policies come across , they 're all shouting the same sort of thing .
and lately , after all the scandals , you feel a bit disillusioned with them all . "
" well to be quite honest , there is n't much choosing between the parties , " adds a shopper .
" they 're all too busy doing their own thing .
i wish they would actually think of the public and what we want , instead of promising us everything , then , when they come into power , it 's just the same as ever . "

the aid package requires that athens implement tough austerity measures . eurozone finance ministers , in an emergency session on sunday , approved a loan package to save greece from defaulting on its debt .
eurogroup head jean-claude juncker said a total of 110 billion euros -lrb- $ 146 billion -rrb- would be spread out over three years .
up to 30 billion euros will be ready to be disbursed in 2010 . eurozone states are expected to give 80 billion euros while the rest is to be provided by the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- . it is by far the largest bailout ever assembled for a country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tough times ahead for papandreou 's greece juncker announced a fresh eu summit for may 7 to officially approve the bailout .
he stressed the help for athens was conditional on the greek government implementing strict financial reforms . he also said that at germany 's insistence , all ministers would discuss with their national banking sector the possibility of voluntary bank contributions to the aid package . international support eu president herman van rompuy welcomed the agreement . " i am convinced that this sound and ambitious program will enable greece to put right its economic and financial situation as well as its competitiveness , " he said in a statement . in exchange for financial aid from both the eu and the imf , athens has promised further austerity measures to get the country 's budget back into shape . greek prime minister george papandreou said the he would " do anything to avoid the country going bankrupt . " " it is an unprecedented support package for an unprecedented effort by the greek people , " a somber papandreou , wearing a dark purple tie , the color used for funerals in greece , told a televised cabinet meeting . eu commissioners for economic and monetary affairs olli rehn welcomed athens ' latest austerity efforts as a " very convincing and comprehensive program . " us president barack obama told papandreou in a telephone interview late on sunday that he welcomed greece 's ambitious reform programs and the support from the eu and the imf . germany 's merkel backs bailout much of sunday 's talks depended on the attitude of germany , which is expected to foot the largest chunk of the bill - around 22 billion euros . german chancellor angela merkel had been hesitant about rushing aid to greece because it is unpopular among germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will have to pay the biggest chunk of the bailout on sunday however , merkel got fully behind the measure , calling the greek austerity program very ambitious and saying there was no choice but to save greece . " i think this is the only way we can restore the stability of the euro , " merkel said .
" i 'm going to work for the greece program and its passage . " german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble said the german cabinet would meet monday to work on a draft legislation for the aid .
he said the bill would then be approved in the german parliament by friday . to ensure the stability of the euro , schaeuble told german public television ard late on sunday , " we , as well as the german people and the taxpayer , have to take on this difficult decision -lsb- to approve the aid deal -rsb- . " he also warned greece that " the smallest deviation -lsb- from the austerity plan -rsb- would have consequences , that much is clear , " he told ard . widespread protests across greece but athen 's plans for painful wage and pension cuts have already triggered widespread protest in greece with unions planning a nationwide strike on wednesday .

" these sacrifices will give us breathing space and the time we need to make changes , " papandreou said , defending the measures .

" one thing that did not work well in copenhagen is that a small circle met and the regional groups felt left out of the debate , " merkel said in bonn on sunday .
germany and mexico hope to get negotiations moving again and have invited representatives from developed and developing countries to bonn to flesh out common ground on environmental issues .
developed versus developing nations mexican president felipe calderon stressed that developing and developed countries must agree on the issue of finance for poorer countries , to enable them to fight climate change .
" this atmosphere of trust is something we really need to make use of for the fast-track financing , " he told ministers in bonn .
" 2010 is the year when we need to take action . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traffic is just one of many climate issues on the agenda the conference - dubbed the petersberg climate dialogue - comes five months after the disastrous summit in copenhagen last december , where countries merely agreed that global temperatures should rise by no more than 2 degrees celsius , but failed to specify any details on how this could be achieved and shared out between the nations .
developing countries have long demanded that richer countries must pay a bigger share in the fight against greenhosue gas emissions , as big industrial nations are the main polluters .
mexico is slated to host the next full-scale un climate summit at the resort of cancun in late november .
meeting designed to re-kindle confidence the petersberg gathering - at germany 's former hilltop government guesthouse when bonn was still the capital - is not expected to make any formal resolutions , but the germans and mexicans are hoping it will come up with ideas to clear the logjam on climate policies .
german environment minister norbert roettgen said the purpose of the meeting was " confidence-building " among emerging and industrial nations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is the world 's biggest polluter , along with the us " we have to get trust and flexibility back into the climate process , " he said .
the german environment minister also urged the european union to take on the pioneering role of developing and implementing low-carbon policies .
the two most important figures at the bonn talks are likely to be the chief us and chinese negotiators .
world leaders realized in copenhagen that climate talks would continue to be very difficult .
already , the president of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , has dampened expectations , telling the german newspaper hamburger abendblatt that there would probably not be any legally binding agreements made in cancun , but perhaps some progress in deciding who makes the sacrifices. gb / ng / dpa / epd / ap / afp editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , the city is home to a major solo exhibition of his works . olafur eliasson 's art has already been gracing berlin for weeks , though most people would not have realized it .
chalk lines trail through parks and disappear under bushes .
next to some trees and lampposts there are bicycles with mirror-covered wheels .
large logs that arrived with the tide on iceland 's shores lie around the city as if they had fallen there by accident . in addition to all this , a van with an attached mirror has been confronting passers-by , cars , trains , buildings and billboards with their own reflections - a process that was filmed and is now on display at the martin-gropius-bau hall in berlin . the exhibition is titled " innen stadt aussen " - which the curators have translated as " inner city out " but is also a play on words that could mean " inside instead of outside . " just like all other aspects of eliasson 's work , the focus of these exhibits is our own perception . deceptive impressions " i think we take what we see and perceive for granted , " said eliasson .
" we believe that sight is objective or physical and natural , or even a gift from god in some cases . " bildunterschrift : halogen lamps create cascaded images of the exhibition 's visitors eliasson , however , is convinced that our perception of the world is determined by culture - meaning that the same things can be seen in many different ways , and that sight can be deceiving .
his art aims to demonstrate this belief in an entertaining and comprehensible way , forcing us to consider the difference between reality and reflection and between truth and deception . the nature of reality eliasson belives that every artwork needs an observer .
according to daniel birnbaum , the curator of the exhibition , in the case of eliasson 's work " there are objects you can display in a gallery , but what really counts is the confrontation with them . " of course , it is also about what goes on in the mind of the beholder - like the moment he or she becomes confused when taking a glance out of the window of the exhibition hall , only to be confronted with an identical-looking building .
a mirror mounted outside is responsible for this illusion . bildunterschrift : light and reflections are a major theme at the exhibition actors and discoverers according to eliasson , the exhibition 's visitors are partly responsible for what they see . " we entrust the visitors with the responsibility to see the exhibition for themselves , " said eliasson .
" we do n't interpret it for them .
we really do n't attempt to patronize the people . " to eliasson , the exhibition 's visitors become something like actors and discoverers once they enter the building and decide to continue through one of the two doors .
to the right , they encounter a typical berlin sidewalk - a piece of the city inside the museum .
to the left , a path leads through thick fog that changes colors with each step , making the visitor feel isolated and lost in a public place . for curator daniel birnbaum , eliasson is an artist " who works in a simple , pragmatic , direct and honest manner . " " he does n't produce illusions , " added birnbaum .
" it 's rather about the construction of the human gaze . " bildunterschrift : the visitor can feel lost and vulnerable in colored fog optical adventures scientists are likely to appreciate this exhibition , as will children , art historians and lovers of simple shapes .
eliasson does n't just play with light refractions , mirrors and shadows , but also with geometrical shapes like triangles , circles , squares and spheres . he makes a transparent tube look like it is dancing in the light of a stroboscope , makes geodetic spheres glow , and manages to transform the atrium of the martin-gropius-bau building into a crystal wonderland .
the boundaries between the inside and the outside become blurred - and the visitor is awed . the exhibition olafur eliasson : innen stadt aussen , runs from april 28 through august 9 at the martin-gropius-bau in berlin . author : silke bartlick -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the legionaries thank the holy father and embrace his provisions with faith and obedience , " the group said on its website after the vatican announced the move . the roman catholic church and pope benedict xvi , in particular , are currently under increasing pressure to tighten up internal discipline , after a series of previously covered-up sex abuse cases have come to light across europe . founding father the order 's founder , marcial maciel , is alleged to have sexually abused numerous underage seminarians .
he also conceived three children with two women , the order recently said in an official apology . he died in 2008 , still a priest , despite being told to retire to a life of " prayer and penitence " by the pope in 2006 .
eight priests had accused maciel of molesting them as children years before this , but the order denied these claims . at the time , he was one of the most prominent persons to be disciplined for sexual misconduct in the church 's history . without addressing accusations that the church hierarchy was aware of and covered up maciel 's misconduct , the vatican condemned the legion founder 's " very serious and objectively immoral actions confirmed by incontestable testimonies " in its statement on saturday . the legion of christ has about 850 priests and 2,500 seminarians in 21 countries around the world .
it also runs a catholic university in rome . msh / reuters / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the legionaries thank the holy father and embrace his provisions with faith and obedience , " the group said on its website after the vatican announced the move . the roman catholic church and pope benedict xvi , in particular , are currently under increasing pressure to tighten up internal discipline , after a series of previously covered-up sex abuse cases have come to light across europe . founding father the order 's founder , marcial maciel , is alleged to have sexually abused numerous underage seminarians .
he also conceived three children with two women , the order recently said in an official apology . he died in 2008 , still a priest , despite being told to retire to a life of " prayer and penitence " by the pope in 2006 .
eight priests had accused maciel of molesting them as children years before this , but the order denied these claims . at the time , he was one of the most prominent persons to be disciplined for sexual misconduct in the church 's history . without addressing accusations that the church hierarchy was aware of and covered up maciel 's misconduct , the vatican condemned the legion founder 's " very serious and objectively immoral actions confirmed by incontestable testimonies " in its statement on saturday . the legion of christ has about 850 priests and 2,500 seminarians in 21 countries around the world .

he also conceived three children with two women , the order recently said in an official apology . he died in 2008 , still a priest , despite being told to retire to a life of " prayer and penitence " by the pope in 2006 .
eight priests had accused maciel of molesting them as children years before this , but the order denied these claims . at the time , he was one of the most prominent persons to be disciplined for sexual misconduct in the church 's history . without addressing accusations that the church hierarchy was aware of and covered up maciel 's misconduct , the vatican condemned the legion founder 's " very serious and objectively immoral actions confirmed by incontestable testimonies " in its statement on saturday . the legion of christ has about 850 priests and 2,500 seminarians in 21 countries around the world .
it also runs a catholic university in rome . msh / reuters / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 02.05.2010 scottish voters could prove decisive factor in british election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small country , big influence ?
the scots have their own devolved parliament , but they also elect the british government in london .
their votes play a key role in deciding who will rule the united kingdom . on may 6th , the people of the uk will be electing a new parliament .
that includes people north of the english border in scotland , the home country of prime minister gordon brown .
although they have their own additional devolved parliament in edinburgh , the scots also send mps to london . although it only accounts for 59 of the 650 seats , the vote in scotland could play a decisive role in determining the outcome of the general election .
edinburgh 's princes street is busy as usual .
the city 's main shopping street attracts locals and tourists alike .
amongst them is sheila gilmore .
the labour party candidate for edinburgh east is on her way to her next campaign appointment . the elections for the british parliament are very important to scotland , says gilmore .
" we do have our own devolved parliament that looks after our domestic issues , but the overall the funding package is determined by the uk government .
the economy , which is important to everybody in scotland , will be affected by who 's in government and the kind of policies they follow . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scotland has had its own devolved parliament since 1999 labour versus scottish nationalists ?
traditionally , scotland is considered a labour bastion , and gilmore , who 's seat has been labour for decades , is confident that 's the way it will stay .
but prime minister gordon brown 's party has lost support across the country – including scotland .
at the last election to the scottish parliament in 2007 , which is run on the basis of proportional representation instead of the uk 's " first-past-the-post " system , labour did n't win enough seats to form a government .
the country is now ruled by a minority adminsitration formed by the pro-independence scottish national party .
that gives the election a " different buzz from south of the border , " says eberhard bort from the school of governance at edinburgh university .
only 25 to 30 % of scots really want independence from the rest of the uk , he says .
but it seems the scots like devoloution - " especially with a nationalist government , " says bort with a smile .
the opinion polls indicate it 's unlikely that labour will win the uk election on may the 6th .
the best brown can hope for is a hung parliament , with labour winning most seats .
but for that , he must succeed here in scotland , according to political analyst bort .
chris harvie shares his view . the professor of politics sits in the scottish parliament for the scottish national party .
he says labour is dependent on a " substantial return " of labour seats in scotland .
" of the 59 seats , they would expect up to 45 to return labour candidates , " says harvie , himself a former labour man .
" if not , scotland has become a liability rather than an asset to labour . "
this could benefit his own party , says harvie .
snp leader and scottish firstminister alex salmond hopes his party can increase ist current 7 seats to 20 in the election and has been actively campaigning for a hung parliament , which would give a lot of bargaining power to small parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scottish national party leader alex salmond was voted first minister in 2007 .
the ghost of " maggie " thatcher in spite of the unpopularity of the present labour government , which can be attributed partly to the economic crisis , partly to britain 's role in iraq and afghanistan , the polls are not predicting a huge victory for the conservatives .
they too , badly need to win seats in scotland .
at the moment they have only one scottish constituency seat in the westminster parliament .
but in the scottish parliament , which operates on a system of proportional representation , they have been able to win 17 seats .
john lamont has one of them .
now , the young conservative hopes to win the seat in westminster for his constituency of berwickshire , roxburgh and selkirk in the scottish borders .
but the conservatives have an image problem .
lamont is convinced his party 's policies would go down well with the voters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in traditional scottish villages , support for the conservatives is minimal " but the conservative brand is perceived as anti-scotland , " he says , and people still mention mrs thatcher , who introduced some measures very unpoplar with the people of scotland , as a reason not to vote conservative .
" amazing , that was 20 years ago , " says lamont , " i was barely born then ! "
a major force across the uk - the " libdems " the other party playing a bigger role than ever before in this election , in scotland and across the uk , are the liberal democrats .
if neither labour nor conservatives gain an absolute majority , the libdems will become extremely influential in british politics , either as a potential coalition partner or in tolerating a minority government .
party leaders are trying hard not to be drawn on that issue .
" i do n't think it 's clever to speculate on what parliament will look like " , says tavish scott , head of the libdems in scotland .

the scots have their own devolved parliament , but they also elect the british government in london .
their votes play a key role in deciding who will rule the united kingdom . on may 6th , the people of the uk will be electing a new parliament .
that includes people north of the english border in scotland , the home country of prime minister gordon brown .
although they have their own additional devolved parliament in edinburgh , the scots also send mps to london . although it only accounts for 59 of the 650 seats , the vote in scotland could play a decisive role in determining the outcome of the general election .
edinburgh 's princes street is busy as usual .
the city 's main shopping street attracts locals and tourists alike .
amongst them is sheila gilmore .
the labour party candidate for edinburgh east is on her way to her next campaign appointment . the elections for the british parliament are very important to scotland , says gilmore .
" we do have our own devolved parliament that looks after our domestic issues , but the overall the funding package is determined by the uk government .
the economy , which is important to everybody in scotland , will be affected by who 's in government and the kind of policies they follow . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scotland has had its own devolved parliament since 1999 labour versus scottish nationalists ?
traditionally , scotland is considered a labour bastion , and gilmore , who 's seat has been labour for decades , is confident that 's the way it will stay .
but prime minister gordon brown 's party has lost support across the country – including scotland .
at the last election to the scottish parliament in 2007 , which is run on the basis of proportional representation instead of the uk 's " first-past-the-post " system , labour did n't win enough seats to form a government .
the country is now ruled by a minority adminsitration formed by the pro-independence scottish national party .
that gives the election a " different buzz from south of the border , " says eberhard bort from the school of governance at edinburgh university .
only 25 to 30 % of scots really want independence from the rest of the uk , he says .
but it seems the scots like devoloution - " especially with a nationalist government , " says bort with a smile .
the opinion polls indicate it 's unlikely that labour will win the uk election on may the 6th .
the best brown can hope for is a hung parliament , with labour winning most seats .
but for that , he must succeed here in scotland , according to political analyst bort .
chris harvie shares his view . the professor of politics sits in the scottish parliament for the scottish national party .
he says labour is dependent on a " substantial return " of labour seats in scotland .
" of the 59 seats , they would expect up to 45 to return labour candidates , " says harvie , himself a former labour man .
" if not , scotland has become a liability rather than an asset to labour . "
this could benefit his own party , says harvie .
snp leader and scottish firstminister alex salmond hopes his party can increase ist current 7 seats to 20 in the election and has been actively campaigning for a hung parliament , which would give a lot of bargaining power to small parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scottish national party leader alex salmond was voted first minister in 2007 .
the ghost of " maggie " thatcher in spite of the unpopularity of the present labour government , which can be attributed partly to the economic crisis , partly to britain 's role in iraq and afghanistan , the polls are not predicting a huge victory for the conservatives .
they too , badly need to win seats in scotland .
at the moment they have only one scottish constituency seat in the westminster parliament .
but in the scottish parliament , which operates on a system of proportional representation , they have been able to win 17 seats .
john lamont has one of them .
now , the young conservative hopes to win the seat in westminster for his constituency of berwickshire , roxburgh and selkirk in the scottish borders .
but the conservatives have an image problem .
lamont is convinced his party 's policies would go down well with the voters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in traditional scottish villages , support for the conservatives is minimal " but the conservative brand is perceived as anti-scotland , " he says , and people still mention mrs thatcher , who introduced some measures very unpoplar with the people of scotland , as a reason not to vote conservative .
" amazing , that was 20 years ago , " says lamont , " i was barely born then ! "
a major force across the uk - the " libdems " the other party playing a bigger role than ever before in this election , in scotland and across the uk , are the liberal democrats .
if neither labour nor conservatives gain an absolute majority , the libdems will become extremely influential in british politics , either as a potential coalition partner or in tolerating a minority government .
party leaders are trying hard not to be drawn on that issue .
" i do n't think it 's clever to speculate on what parliament will look like " , says tavish scott , head of the libdems in scotland .

now , the city is home to a major solo exhibition of his works . olafur eliasson 's art has already been gracing berlin for weeks , though most people would not have realized it .
chalk lines trail through parks and disappear under bushes .
next to some trees and lampposts there are bicycles with mirror-covered wheels .
large logs that arrived with the tide on iceland 's shores lie around the city as if they had fallen there by accident . in addition to all this , a van with an attached mirror has been confronting passers-by , cars , trains , buildings and billboards with their own reflections - a process that was filmed and is now on display at the martin-gropius-bau hall in berlin . the exhibition is titled " innen stadt aussen " - which the curators have translated as " inner city out " but is also a play on words that could mean " inside instead of outside . " just like all other aspects of eliasson 's work , the focus of these exhibits is our own perception . deceptive impressions " i think we take what we see and perceive for granted , " said eliasson .
" we believe that sight is objective or physical and natural , or even a gift from god in some cases . " bildunterschrift : halogen lamps create cascaded images of the exhibition 's visitors eliasson , however , is convinced that our perception of the world is determined by culture - meaning that the same things can be seen in many different ways , and that sight can be deceiving .
his art aims to demonstrate this belief in an entertaining and comprehensible way , forcing us to consider the difference between reality and reflection and between truth and deception . the nature of reality eliasson belives that every artwork needs an observer .
according to daniel birnbaum , the curator of the exhibition , in the case of eliasson 's work " there are objects you can display in a gallery , but what really counts is the confrontation with them . " of course , it is also about what goes on in the mind of the beholder - like the moment he or she becomes confused when taking a glance out of the window of the exhibition hall , only to be confronted with an identical-looking building .
a mirror mounted outside is responsible for this illusion . bildunterschrift : light and reflections are a major theme at the exhibition actors and discoverers according to eliasson , the exhibition 's visitors are partly responsible for what they see . " we entrust the visitors with the responsibility to see the exhibition for themselves , " said eliasson .
" we do n't interpret it for them .
we really do n't attempt to patronize the people . " to eliasson , the exhibition 's visitors become something like actors and discoverers once they enter the building and decide to continue through one of the two doors .
to the right , they encounter a typical berlin sidewalk - a piece of the city inside the museum .
to the left , a path leads through thick fog that changes colors with each step , making the visitor feel isolated and lost in a public place . for curator daniel birnbaum , eliasson is an artist " who works in a simple , pragmatic , direct and honest manner . " " he does n't produce illusions , " added birnbaum .
" it 's rather about the construction of the human gaze . " bildunterschrift : the visitor can feel lost and vulnerable in colored fog optical adventures scientists are likely to appreciate this exhibition , as will children , art historians and lovers of simple shapes .
eliasson does n't just play with light refractions , mirrors and shadows , but also with geometrical shapes like triangles , circles , squares and spheres . he makes a transparent tube look like it is dancing in the light of a stroboscope , makes geodetic spheres glow , and manages to transform the atrium of the martin-gropius-bau building into a crystal wonderland .
the boundaries between the inside and the outside become blurred - and the visitor is awed . the exhibition olafur eliasson : innen stadt aussen , runs from april 28 through august 9 at the martin-gropius-bau in berlin . author : silke bartlick -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the legionaries thank the holy father and embrace his provisions with faith and obedience , " the group said on its website after the vatican announced the move . the roman catholic church and pope benedict xvi , in particular , are currently under increasing pressure to tighten up internal discipline , after a series of previously covered-up sex abuse cases have come to light across europe . founding father the order 's founder , marcial maciel , is alleged to have sexually abused numerous underage seminarians .
he also conceived three children with two women , the order recently said in an official apology . he died in 2008 , still a priest , despite being told to retire to a life of " prayer and penitence " by the pope in 2006 .
eight priests had accused maciel of molesting them as children years before this , but the order denied these claims . at the time , he was one of the most prominent persons to be disciplined for sexual misconduct in the church 's history . without addressing accusations that the church hierarchy was aware of and covered up maciel 's misconduct , the vatican condemned the legion founder 's " very serious and objectively immoral actions confirmed by incontestable testimonies " in its statement on saturday . the legion of christ has about 850 priests and 2,500 seminarians in 21 countries around the world .

" one thing that did not work well in copenhagen is that a small circle met and the regional groups felt left out of the debate , " merkel said in bonn on sunday .
germany and mexico hope to get negotiations moving again and have invited representatives from developed and developing countries to bonn to flesh out common ground on environmental issues .
developed versus developing nations mexican president felipe calderon stressed that developing and developed countries must agree on the issue of finance for poorer countries , to enable them to fight climate change .
" this atmosphere of trust is something we really need to make use of for the fast-track financing , " he told ministers in bonn .
" 2010 is the year when we need to take action . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traffic is just one of many climate issues on the agenda the conference - dubbed the petersberg climate dialogue - comes five months after the disastrous summit in copenhagen last december , where countries merely agreed that global temperatures should rise by no more than 2 degrees celsius , but failed to specify any details on how this could be achieved and shared out between the nations .
developing countries have long demanded that richer countries must pay a bigger share in the fight against greenhosue gas emissions , as big industrial nations are the main polluters .
mexico is slated to host the next full-scale un climate summit at the resort of cancun in late november .
meeting designed to re-kindle confidence the petersberg gathering - at germany 's former hilltop government guesthouse when bonn was still the capital - is not expected to make any formal resolutions , but the germans and mexicans are hoping it will come up with ideas to clear the logjam on climate policies .
german environment minister norbert roettgen said the purpose of the meeting was " confidence-building " among emerging and industrial nations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is the world 's biggest polluter , along with the us " we have to get trust and flexibility back into the climate process , " he said .
the german environment minister also urged the european union to take on the pioneering role of developing and implementing low-carbon policies .
the two most important figures at the bonn talks are likely to be the chief us and chinese negotiators .
world leaders realized in copenhagen that climate talks would continue to be very difficult .
already , the president of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , has dampened expectations , telling the german newspaper hamburger abendblatt that there would probably not be any legally binding agreements made in cancun , but perhaps some progress in deciding who makes the sacrifices. gb / ng / dpa / epd / ap / afp editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 02.05.2010 danish-icelandic installation artist takes berlin by storm großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eliasson 's work is an adventure for the eyes olafur eliasson is a star on the art scene , with a well-established studio in berlin .
now , the city is home to a major solo exhibition of his works . olafur eliasson 's art has already been gracing berlin for weeks , though most people would not have realized it .
chalk lines trail through parks and disappear under bushes .
next to some trees and lampposts there are bicycles with mirror-covered wheels .
large logs that arrived with the tide on iceland 's shores lie around the city as if they had fallen there by accident . in addition to all this , a van with an attached mirror has been confronting passers-by , cars , trains , buildings and billboards with their own reflections - a process that was filmed and is now on display at the martin-gropius-bau hall in berlin . the exhibition is titled " innen stadt aussen " - which the curators have translated as " inner city out " but is also a play on words that could mean " inside instead of outside . " just like all other aspects of eliasson 's work , the focus of these exhibits is our own perception . deceptive impressions " i think we take what we see and perceive for granted , " said eliasson .
" we believe that sight is objective or physical and natural , or even a gift from god in some cases . " bildunterschrift : halogen lamps create cascaded images of the exhibition 's visitors eliasson , however , is convinced that our perception of the world is determined by culture - meaning that the same things can be seen in many different ways , and that sight can be deceiving .
his art aims to demonstrate this belief in an entertaining and comprehensible way , forcing us to consider the difference between reality and reflection and between truth and deception . the nature of reality eliasson belives that every artwork needs an observer .
according to daniel birnbaum , the curator of the exhibition , in the case of eliasson 's work " there are objects you can display in a gallery , but what really counts is the confrontation with them . " of course , it is also about what goes on in the mind of the beholder - like the moment he or she becomes confused when taking a glance out of the window of the exhibition hall , only to be confronted with an identical-looking building .
a mirror mounted outside is responsible for this illusion . bildunterschrift : light and reflections are a major theme at the exhibition actors and discoverers according to eliasson , the exhibition 's visitors are partly responsible for what they see . " we entrust the visitors with the responsibility to see the exhibition for themselves , " said eliasson .
" we do n't interpret it for them .
we really do n't attempt to patronize the people . " to eliasson , the exhibition 's visitors become something like actors and discoverers once they enter the building and decide to continue through one of the two doors .
to the right , they encounter a typical berlin sidewalk - a piece of the city inside the museum .
to the left , a path leads through thick fog that changes colors with each step , making the visitor feel isolated and lost in a public place . for curator daniel birnbaum , eliasson is an artist " who works in a simple , pragmatic , direct and honest manner . " " he does n't produce illusions , " added birnbaum .
" it 's rather about the construction of the human gaze . " bildunterschrift : the visitor can feel lost and vulnerable in colored fog optical adventures scientists are likely to appreciate this exhibition , as will children , art historians and lovers of simple shapes .
eliasson does n't just play with light refractions , mirrors and shadows , but also with geometrical shapes like triangles , circles , squares and spheres . he makes a transparent tube look like it is dancing in the light of a stroboscope , makes geodetic spheres glow , and manages to transform the atrium of the martin-gropius-bau building into a crystal wonderland .
the boundaries between the inside and the outside become blurred - and the visitor is awed . the exhibition olafur eliasson : innen stadt aussen , runs from april 28 through august 9 at the martin-gropius-bau in berlin . author : silke bartlick -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the scots have their own devolved parliament , but they also elect the british government in london .
their votes play a key role in deciding who will rule the united kingdom . on may 6th , the people of the uk will be electing a new parliament .
that includes people north of the english border in scotland , the home country of prime minister gordon brown .
although they have their own additional devolved parliament in edinburgh , the scots also send mps to london . although it only accounts for 59 of the 650 seats , the vote in scotland could play a decisive role in determining the outcome of the general election .
edinburgh 's princes street is busy as usual .
the city 's main shopping street attracts locals and tourists alike .
amongst them is sheila gilmore .
the labour party candidate for edinburgh east is on her way to her next campaign appointment . the elections for the british parliament are very important to scotland , says gilmore .
" we do have our own devolved parliament that looks after our domestic issues , but the overall the funding package is determined by the uk government .
the economy , which is important to everybody in scotland , will be affected by who 's in government and the kind of policies they follow . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scotland has had its own devolved parliament since 1999 labour versus scottish nationalists ?
traditionally , scotland is considered a labour bastion , and gilmore , who 's seat has been labour for decades , is confident that 's the way it will stay .
but prime minister gordon brown 's party has lost support across the country – including scotland .
at the last election to the scottish parliament in 2007 , which is run on the basis of proportional representation instead of the uk 's " first-past-the-post " system , labour did n't win enough seats to form a government .
the country is now ruled by a minority adminsitration formed by the pro-independence scottish national party .
that gives the election a " different buzz from south of the border , " says eberhard bort from the school of governance at edinburgh university .
only 25 to 30 % of scots really want independence from the rest of the uk , he says .
but it seems the scots like devoloution - " especially with a nationalist government , " says bort with a smile .
the opinion polls indicate it 's unlikely that labour will win the uk election on may the 6th .
the best brown can hope for is a hung parliament , with labour winning most seats .
but for that , he must succeed here in scotland , according to political analyst bort .
chris harvie shares his view . the professor of politics sits in the scottish parliament for the scottish national party .
he says labour is dependent on a " substantial return " of labour seats in scotland .
" of the 59 seats , they would expect up to 45 to return labour candidates , " says harvie , himself a former labour man .
" if not , scotland has become a liability rather than an asset to labour . "
this could benefit his own party , says harvie .
snp leader and scottish firstminister alex salmond hopes his party can increase ist current 7 seats to 20 in the election and has been actively campaigning for a hung parliament , which would give a lot of bargaining power to small parties .

at the moment they have only one scottish constituency seat in the westminster parliament .
but in the scottish parliament , which operates on a system of proportional representation , they have been able to win 17 seats .
john lamont has one of them .
now , the young conservative hopes to win the seat in westminster for his constituency of berwickshire , roxburgh and selkirk in the scottish borders .
but the conservatives have an image problem .
lamont is convinced his party 's policies would go down well with the voters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in traditional scottish villages , support for the conservatives is minimal " but the conservative brand is perceived as anti-scotland , " he says , and people still mention mrs thatcher , who introduced some measures very unpoplar with the people of scotland , as a reason not to vote conservative .

a major force across the uk - the " libdems " the other party playing a bigger role than ever before in this election , in scotland and across the uk , are the liberal democrats .
if neither labour nor conservatives gain an absolute majority , the libdems will become extremely influential in british politics , either as a potential coalition partner or in tolerating a minority government .
party leaders are trying hard not to be drawn on that issue .
" i do n't think it 's clever to speculate on what parliament will look like " , says tavish scott , head of the libdems in scotland .
" the number one need is to get the deficit under control and deal with the state of public finances , which are in an awful crisis in the uk . "
another of his party 's main aims is to " clean up " politics .
here , the liberal democrat hits a note that most voters are concerned about .
after numerous scandals , many people across the uk are getting tired of politics .
" i worry that the expenses scandal that has taken place in the house of commons over the last year or so has turned many people off politics , " says scott , " and that many people will say we 're all as bad as each other and i do n't want anything to do with any of you . "
he fears that could result in a low turnout .

the scots have their own devolved parliament , but they also elect the british government in london .
their votes play a key role in deciding who will rule the united kingdom . on may 6th , the people of the uk will be electing a new parliament .
that includes people north of the english border in scotland , the home country of prime minister gordon brown .
although they have their own additional devolved parliament in edinburgh , the scots also send mps to london . although it only accounts for 59 of the 650 seats , the vote in scotland could play a decisive role in determining the outcome of the general election .
edinburgh 's princes street is busy as usual .
the city 's main shopping street attracts locals and tourists alike .
amongst them is sheila gilmore .
the labour party candidate for edinburgh east is on her way to her next campaign appointment . the elections for the british parliament are very important to scotland , says gilmore .
" we do have our own devolved parliament that looks after our domestic issues , but the overall the funding package is determined by the uk government .
the economy , which is important to everybody in scotland , will be affected by who 's in government and the kind of policies they follow . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scotland has had its own devolved parliament since 1999 labour versus scottish nationalists ?
traditionally , scotland is considered a labour bastion , and gilmore , who 's seat has been labour for decades , is confident that 's the way it will stay .
but prime minister gordon brown 's party has lost support across the country – including scotland .
at the last election to the scottish parliament in 2007 , which is run on the basis of proportional representation instead of the uk 's " first-past-the-post " system , labour did n't win enough seats to form a government .
the country is now ruled by a minority adminsitration formed by the pro-independence scottish national party .
that gives the election a " different buzz from south of the border , " says eberhard bort from the school of governance at edinburgh university .
only 25 to 30 % of scots really want independence from the rest of the uk , he says .
but it seems the scots like devoloution - " especially with a nationalist government , " says bort with a smile .
the opinion polls indicate it 's unlikely that labour will win the uk election on may the 6th .
the best brown can hope for is a hung parliament , with labour winning most seats .
but for that , he must succeed here in scotland , according to political analyst bort .
chris harvie shares his view . the professor of politics sits in the scottish parliament for the scottish national party .
he says labour is dependent on a " substantial return " of labour seats in scotland .
" of the 59 seats , they would expect up to 45 to return labour candidates , " says harvie , himself a former labour man .
" if not , scotland has become a liability rather than an asset to labour . "
this could benefit his own party , says harvie .
snp leader and scottish firstminister alex salmond hopes his party can increase ist current 7 seats to 20 in the election and has been actively campaigning for a hung parliament , which would give a lot of bargaining power to small parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scottish national party leader alex salmond was voted first minister in 2007 .
the ghost of " maggie " thatcher in spite of the unpopularity of the present labour government , which can be attributed partly to the economic crisis , partly to britain 's role in iraq and afghanistan , the polls are not predicting a huge victory for the conservatives .
they too , badly need to win seats in scotland .
at the moment they have only one scottish constituency seat in the westminster parliament .
but in the scottish parliament , which operates on a system of proportional representation , they have been able to win 17 seats .
john lamont has one of them .
now , the young conservative hopes to win the seat in westminster for his constituency of berwickshire , roxburgh and selkirk in the scottish borders .
but the conservatives have an image problem .
lamont is convinced his party 's policies would go down well with the voters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in traditional scottish villages , support for the conservatives is minimal " but the conservative brand is perceived as anti-scotland , " he says , and people still mention mrs thatcher , who introduced some measures very unpoplar with the people of scotland , as a reason not to vote conservative .
" amazing , that was 20 years ago , " says lamont , " i was barely born then ! "
a major force across the uk - the " libdems " the other party playing a bigger role than ever before in this election , in scotland and across the uk , are the liberal democrats .
if neither labour nor conservatives gain an absolute majority , the libdems will become extremely influential in british politics , either as a potential coalition partner or in tolerating a minority government .
party leaders are trying hard not to be drawn on that issue .
" i do n't think it 's clever to speculate on what parliament will look like " , says tavish scott , head of the libdems in scotland .
" the number one need is to get the deficit under control and deal with the state of public finances , which are in an awful crisis in the uk . "
another of his party 's main aims is to " clean up " politics .
here , the liberal democrat hits a note that most voters are concerned about .
after numerous scandals , many people across the uk are getting tired of politics .
" i worry that the expenses scandal that has taken place in the house of commons over the last year or so has turned many people off politics , " says scott , " and that many people will say we 're all as bad as each other and i do n't want anything to do with any of you . "
he fears that could result in a low turnout .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scandals in london could affect the way the scottish capital votes talking to voters back out on princes street , it seems as if tavish scott could have hit the nail on the head .
" you vote for the party you always voted for , " says one passer-by .
" but when the policies come across , they 're all shouting the same sort of thing .
and lately , after all the scandals , you feel a bit disillusioned with them all . "
" well to be quite honest , there is n't much choosing between the parties , " adds a shopper .
" they 're all too busy doing their own thing .
i wish they would actually think of the public and what we want , instead of promising us everything , then , when they come into power , it 's just the same as ever . "

although they have their own additional devolved parliament in edinburgh , the scots also send mps to london . although it only accounts for 59 of the 650 seats , the vote in scotland could play a decisive role in determining the outcome of the general election .
edinburgh 's princes street is busy as usual .
the city 's main shopping street attracts locals and tourists alike .
amongst them is sheila gilmore .
the labour party candidate for edinburgh east is on her way to her next campaign appointment . the elections for the british parliament are very important to scotland , says gilmore .
" we do have our own devolved parliament that looks after our domestic issues , but the overall the funding package is determined by the uk government .
the economy , which is important to everybody in scotland , will be affected by who 's in government and the kind of policies they follow . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scotland has had its own devolved parliament since 1999 labour versus scottish nationalists ?
traditionally , scotland is considered a labour bastion , and gilmore , who 's seat has been labour for decades , is confident that 's the way it will stay .
but prime minister gordon brown 's party has lost support across the country – including scotland .
at the last election to the scottish parliament in 2007 , which is run on the basis of proportional representation instead of the uk 's " first-past-the-post " system , labour did n't win enough seats to form a government .
the country is now ruled by a minority adminsitration formed by the pro-independence scottish national party .
that gives the election a " different buzz from south of the border , " says eberhard bort from the school of governance at edinburgh university .
only 25 to 30 % of scots really want independence from the rest of the uk , he says .
but it seems the scots like devoloution - " especially with a nationalist government , " says bort with a smile .
the opinion polls indicate it 's unlikely that labour will win the uk election on may the 6th .
the best brown can hope for is a hung parliament , with labour winning most seats .
but for that , he must succeed here in scotland , according to political analyst bort .
chris harvie shares his view . the professor of politics sits in the scottish parliament for the scottish national party .
he says labour is dependent on a " substantial return " of labour seats in scotland .
" of the 59 seats , they would expect up to 45 to return labour candidates , " says harvie , himself a former labour man .
" if not , scotland has become a liability rather than an asset to labour . "
this could benefit his own party , says harvie .
snp leader and scottish firstminister alex salmond hopes his party can increase ist current 7 seats to 20 in the election and has been actively campaigning for a hung parliament , which would give a lot of bargaining power to small parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scottish national party leader alex salmond was voted first minister in 2007 .
the ghost of " maggie " thatcher in spite of the unpopularity of the present labour government , which can be attributed partly to the economic crisis , partly to britain 's role in iraq and afghanistan , the polls are not predicting a huge victory for the conservatives .
they too , badly need to win seats in scotland .
at the moment they have only one scottish constituency seat in the westminster parliament .
but in the scottish parliament , which operates on a system of proportional representation , they have been able to win 17 seats .
john lamont has one of them .
now , the young conservative hopes to win the seat in westminster for his constituency of berwickshire , roxburgh and selkirk in the scottish borders .
but the conservatives have an image problem .
lamont is convinced his party 's policies would go down well with the voters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in traditional scottish villages , support for the conservatives is minimal " but the conservative brand is perceived as anti-scotland , " he says , and people still mention mrs thatcher , who introduced some measures very unpoplar with the people of scotland , as a reason not to vote conservative .
" amazing , that was 20 years ago , " says lamont , " i was barely born then ! "
a major force across the uk - the " libdems " the other party playing a bigger role than ever before in this election , in scotland and across the uk , are the liberal democrats .
if neither labour nor conservatives gain an absolute majority , the libdems will become extremely influential in british politics , either as a potential coalition partner or in tolerating a minority government .
party leaders are trying hard not to be drawn on that issue .
" i do n't think it 's clever to speculate on what parliament will look like " , says tavish scott , head of the libdems in scotland .
" the number one need is to get the deficit under control and deal with the state of public finances , which are in an awful crisis in the uk . "
another of his party 's main aims is to " clean up " politics .
here , the liberal democrat hits a note that most voters are concerned about .
after numerous scandals , many people across the uk are getting tired of politics .
" i worry that the expenses scandal that has taken place in the house of commons over the last year or so has turned many people off politics , " says scott , " and that many people will say we 're all as bad as each other and i do n't want anything to do with any of you . "
he fears that could result in a low turnout .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scandals in london could affect the way the scottish capital votes talking to voters back out on princes street , it seems as if tavish scott could have hit the nail on the head .
" you vote for the party you always voted for , " says one passer-by .
" but when the policies come across , they 're all shouting the same sort of thing .
and lately , after all the scandals , you feel a bit disillusioned with them all . "
" well to be quite honest , there is n't much choosing between the parties , " adds a shopper .
" they 're all too busy doing their own thing .
i wish they would actually think of the public and what we want , instead of promising us everything , then , when they come into power , it 's just the same as ever . "

the aid package requires that athens implement tough austerity measures . eurozone finance ministers , in an emergency session on sunday , approved a loan package to save greece from defaulting on its debt .
eurogroup head jean-claude juncker said a total of 110 billion euros -lrb- $ 146 billion -rrb- would be spread out over three years .
up to 30 billion euros will be ready to be disbursed in 2010 . eurozone states are expected to give 80 billion euros while the rest is to be provided by the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- . it is by far the largest bailout ever assembled for a country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tough times ahead for papandreou 's greece juncker announced a fresh eu summit for may 7 to officially approve the bailout .
he stressed the help for athens was conditional on the greek government implementing strict financial reforms . he also said that at germany 's insistence , all ministers would discuss with their national banking sector the possibility of voluntary bank contributions to the aid package . international support eu president herman van rompuy welcomed the agreement . " i am convinced that this sound and ambitious program will enable greece to put right its economic and financial situation as well as its competitiveness , " he said in a statement . in exchange for financial aid from both the eu and the imf , athens has promised further austerity measures to get the country 's budget back into shape . greek prime minister george papandreou said the he would " do anything to avoid the country going bankrupt . " " it is an unprecedented support package for an unprecedented effort by the greek people , " a somber papandreou , wearing a dark purple tie , the color used for funerals in greece , told a televised cabinet meeting . eu commissioners for economic and monetary affairs olli rehn welcomed athens ' latest austerity efforts as a " very convincing and comprehensive program . " us president barack obama told papandreou in a telephone interview late on sunday that he welcomed greece 's ambitious reform programs and the support from the eu and the imf . germany 's merkel backs bailout much of sunday 's talks depended on the attitude of germany , which is expected to foot the largest chunk of the bill - around 22 billion euros . german chancellor angela merkel had been hesitant about rushing aid to greece because it is unpopular among germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will have to pay the biggest chunk of the bailout on sunday however , merkel got fully behind the measure , calling the greek austerity program very ambitious and saying there was no choice but to save greece . " i think this is the only way we can restore the stability of the euro , " merkel said .
