in december , the european court of human rights -lrb- echr -rrb- ruled that germany had violated the european human rights convention in the case of german inmate reinhard m. , who was convicted for attempted murder and had been kept in prison more than 10 years after his sentence .
the 52-year-old man had completed his five-year prison sentence in 1991 , but was not released , as he was deemed a danger to the public .
he was detained for the next 10 years , the maximum term for preventive detention at the time .
but a change in german legislation in 1998 meant that prisoners can now be detained indefinitely .
right to liberty the echr ruled that because reinhard m had been convicted before the change in the law in 1998 germany violated the ' right to liberty ' .
the court also stated that " there was no sufficient causal connection between his conviction and his continued deprivation of liberty . "
germany requested the case be referred to the echr 's grand chamber , which has now been refused , making the original court decision binding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 70 violent offenders in germany could benefit from the court ruling the echr can only tackle specific cases , but the ruling has already sparked a debate on how to protect the public from criminals convicted of murder , armed robbery , rape and other violent crimes .
" we need a comprehensive not an alarmist debate on the ramifications and options of today 's ruling -lsb- by the echr -rsb- , " justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger said in a statement on tuesday .
new framework the federal coalition agreement from last autumn calls for a reform of the current system , but the government has not released any details yet .
the bavarian justice minister , beate merk , however , has been vocal in calling for a complete overhaul of preventive detention in germany .
" a few band-aids here and there just will not do , " she said in a statement .
" we need a completely new system that can deal with violent offenders that are likely to reoffend and be a danger to the public even after they have served their sentence , " she added .
merk is adamant that some form of post-sentence detention is necessary , but she would like to see the sentence , ie the punishment , separated from the subsequent detention , with separate facilities and dedicated therapy options for violent criminals - one of the areas the echr had criticized as lacking in the current system .
longer sentences but some legal experts believe preventive detention is not the answer .
" the law has been extended in the past because of an unsubstantiated fear of crime , at a time when crime rates are going down in germany , and i do n't believe there is a need for it at all , " hermann kuehn , an expert in criminal law who runs his own law firm , told deutsche welle .
he would like to see longer sentences handed down instead .
currently , the maximum sentence is 15 years , unless a defendant is sentenced to life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's constitutional court endorsed retroactive preventive detention in 2004 " we could extend the fixed-term punishments to give courts the opportunity for a longer prison sentence and then leave it to the court to release him earlier if he is no longer a danger to society , " kuehn said .
he believes the power to release a potentially dangerous person should remain with the court , however .
he argues that leaving violent criminals to medical authorities for preventive detention by separating punishment from detention could be dangerous if you rely on medical staff alone to determine whether or not a detainee is a danger to society .

the decision has sparked a debate about how to protect the public from violent offenders . germany is under pressure to change its system of preventive detention , which allows for violent and repeat offenders to be detained indefinitely , even after they have served their sentence .
in december , the european court of human rights -lrb- echr -rrb- ruled that germany had violated the european human rights convention in the case of german inmate reinhard m. , who was convicted for attempted murder and had been kept in prison more than 10 years after his sentence .
the 52-year-old man had completed his five-year prison sentence in 1991 , but was not released , as he was deemed a danger to the public .
he was detained for the next 10 years , the maximum term for preventive detention at the time .
but a change in german legislation in 1998 meant that prisoners can now be detained indefinitely .
right to liberty the echr ruled that because reinhard m had been convicted before the change in the law in 1998 germany violated the ' right to liberty ' .
the court also stated that " there was no sufficient causal connection between his conviction and his continued deprivation of liberty . "
germany requested the case be referred to the echr 's grand chamber , which has now been refused , making the original court decision binding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 70 violent offenders in germany could benefit from the court ruling the echr can only tackle specific cases , but the ruling has already sparked a debate on how to protect the public from criminals convicted of murder , armed robbery , rape and other violent crimes .
" we need a comprehensive not an alarmist debate on the ramifications and options of today 's ruling -lsb- by the echr -rsb- , " justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger said in a statement on tuesday .
new framework the federal coalition agreement from last autumn calls for a reform of the current system , but the government has not released any details yet .
the bavarian justice minister , beate merk , however , has been vocal in calling for a complete overhaul of preventive detention in germany .
" a few band-aids here and there just will not do , " she said in a statement .
" we need a completely new system that can deal with violent offenders that are likely to reoffend and be a danger to the public even after they have served their sentence , " she added .
merk is adamant that some form of post-sentence detention is necessary , but she would like to see the sentence , ie the punishment , separated from the subsequent detention , with separate facilities and dedicated therapy options for violent criminals - one of the areas the echr had criticized as lacking in the current system .
longer sentences but some legal experts believe preventive detention is not the answer .
" the law has been extended in the past because of an unsubstantiated fear of crime , at a time when crime rates are going down in germany , and i do n't believe there is a need for it at all , " hermann kuehn , an expert in criminal law who runs his own law firm , told deutsche welle .
he would like to see longer sentences handed down instead .
currently , the maximum sentence is 15 years , unless a defendant is sentenced to life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's constitutional court endorsed retroactive preventive detention in 2004 " we could extend the fixed-term punishments to give courts the opportunity for a longer prison sentence and then leave it to the court to release him earlier if he is no longer a danger to society , " kuehn said .
he believes the power to release a potentially dangerous person should remain with the court , however .
he argues that leaving violent criminals to medical authorities for preventive detention by separating punishment from detention could be dangerous if you rely on medical staff alone to determine whether or not a detainee is a danger to society .

how will german film fare at the world 's most important movie market ?
dw spoke with mariette rissenbeek from the organization german film service + marketing . just 19 films are in the running for the coveted palme d 'or at this year 's cannes film festival 's main competition , but hundreds more features and dozens of shorts will be shown over the course of the festival , which runs through may 23 .
aside from the main competition - which generally highlights films by well-known directors - there are parallel selections .
these include " un certain regard , " a showcase for film from younger or more unusual directors , films shown out of competition , special screenings , and cannes classics , among others . there are also longstanding and independent festivals that run parallel to the official event , such as the highly regarded directors ' fortnight , organized by the association of french film directors . deutsche welle : ms. rissenbeek , over the years the cannes film festival has earned quite a reputation as a hub of hype , where seeing and being seen is of primary importance .
is the festival still meaningful in the world of film ? marianne rissenbeek : cannes is no doubt the most important festival for film - and the most important market for films - up to today .
i think it is still the leading film market .
and a lot of the films in the official program are rather author-driven .
so it 's not only about glitz and glamour , but about filmmaking . last year a german-language film " das weisse band " -lrb- " the white ribbon " -rrb- won the palme d 'or .
coming out after " the lives of others " won the oscar in 2007 , it seemed to signal a sort of renaissance in german art film .
this year , though , there is just one german film in competition - and in fact it is a german-ukrainian-dutch co-production - " my joy , " by sergei loznitsa .
are the tides turning for german film ? well , " my joy " is indeed a german production , which a german producer has developed .
he developed the script together with the director , so it 's not only a co-production with a financial commitment from germany .
there was creative input and engagement from germany .
i don ’ t think we feel neglected or ignored by the festival selection committee . bildunterschrift : germany 's offer in this year 's competition is ' my joy , ' a co-production with ukraine and the netherlands what else is germany showing at the festival , either out of competition , or on the sidelines as part of the un certain regard series , or as part of the directors ' fortnight ? in un certain regard there are two german films , one from christoph hochhaeusler , called " unter dir die stadt " -lrb- " the city below " -rrb- , and the other one , " life , above all , " is a production that was developed in germany .
even though the director , oliver schmitz , is south african-german , he has both nationalities .
and then in the directors ' fortnight there is a german film , " picco , " by philip koch .
so actually we feel there is quite a strong presence from germany . what are you most looking forward to seeing or experiencing at this year 's festival ? well of course , for us it is more important to see how german films will do .
it will be exciting to see how christoph hochhaeusler has developed - he was at cannes a few years ago with another film .
it will be interesting to see how his film is received this year .
and " picco , " by philip koch , is a first film , so that is exciting too .
it is very seldom that you gain access to cannes with your first film , and then to the directors ' fortnight … the film will get a lot of publicity , so that 's good . and then maybe you noticed that the directors ' cut of " the tin drum " by volker schloendorff will be shown , 30 years after it was premiered in cannes .
i look forward to seeing how audiences react to that . there are a lot of films from asia in competition this year - south korea , thailand , taiwan .
what do you make of that ?
does it indicate anything about the future of european versus asian film ? cannes always had an input from asia , there were always asian films in the program , from china , or taiwan … i do n't think it 's new .
this year maybe the films were more interesting from asia , so they chose more for competition , but i could n't really say if it means anything . we have organized screenings in the market of 28 films overall , many of which have already been premiered elsewhere .
they all have special attributes , so it 's hard to say which ones will be most successful . -lrb- … -rrb- it used to be that you were guaranteed a certain number of contracts if you came to cannes , but since the financial crisis two years ago , that 's not true anymore .

how will german film fare at the world 's most important movie market ?
dw spoke with mariette rissenbeek from the organization german film service + marketing . just 19 films are in the running for the coveted palme d 'or at this year 's cannes film festival 's main competition , but hundreds more features and dozens of shorts will be shown over the course of the festival , which runs through may 23 .
aside from the main competition - which generally highlights films by well-known directors - there are parallel selections .
these include " un certain regard , " a showcase for film from younger or more unusual directors , films shown out of competition , special screenings , and cannes classics , among others . there are also longstanding and independent festivals that run parallel to the official event , such as the highly regarded directors ' fortnight , organized by the association of french film directors . deutsche welle : ms. rissenbeek , over the years the cannes film festival has earned quite a reputation as a hub of hype , where seeing and being seen is of primary importance .
is the festival still meaningful in the world of film ? marianne rissenbeek : cannes is no doubt the most important festival for film - and the most important market for films - up to today .
i think it is still the leading film market .
and a lot of the films in the official program are rather author-driven .
so it 's not only about glitz and glamour , but about filmmaking . last year a german-language film " das weisse band " -lrb- " the white ribbon " -rrb- won the palme d 'or .
coming out after " the lives of others " won the oscar in 2007 , it seemed to signal a sort of renaissance in german art film .
this year , though , there is just one german film in competition - and in fact it is a german-ukrainian-dutch co-production - " my joy , " by sergei loznitsa .
are the tides turning for german film ? well , " my joy " is indeed a german production , which a german producer has developed .
he developed the script together with the director , so it 's not only a co-production with a financial commitment from germany .
there was creative input and engagement from germany .
i don ’ t think we feel neglected or ignored by the festival selection committee . bildunterschrift : germany 's offer in this year 's competition is ' my joy , ' a co-production with ukraine and the netherlands what else is germany showing at the festival , either out of competition , or on the sidelines as part of the un certain regard series , or as part of the directors ' fortnight ? in un certain regard there are two german films , one from christoph hochhaeusler , called " unter dir die stadt " -lrb- " the city below " -rrb- , and the other one , " life , above all , " is a production that was developed in germany .
even though the director , oliver schmitz , is south african-german , he has both nationalities .
and then in the directors ' fortnight there is a german film , " picco , " by philip koch .
so actually we feel there is quite a strong presence from germany . what are you most looking forward to seeing or experiencing at this year 's festival ? well of course , for us it is more important to see how german films will do .
it will be exciting to see how christoph hochhaeusler has developed - he was at cannes a few years ago with another film .
it will be interesting to see how his film is received this year .
and " picco , " by philip koch , is a first film , so that is exciting too .
it is very seldom that you gain access to cannes with your first film , and then to the directors ' fortnight … the film will get a lot of publicity , so that 's good . and then maybe you noticed that the directors ' cut of " the tin drum " by volker schloendorff will be shown , 30 years after it was premiered in cannes .
i look forward to seeing how audiences react to that . there are a lot of films from asia in competition this year - south korea , thailand , taiwan .
what do you make of that ?
does it indicate anything about the future of european versus asian film ? cannes always had an input from asia , there were always asian films in the program , from china , or taiwan … i do n't think it 's new .
this year maybe the films were more interesting from asia , so they chose more for competition , but i could n't really say if it means anything . we have organized screenings in the market of 28 films overall , many of which have already been premiered elsewhere .
they all have special attributes , so it 's hard to say which ones will be most successful . -lrb- … -rrb- it used to be that you were guaranteed a certain number of contracts if you came to cannes , but since the financial crisis two years ago , that 's not true anymore .

how will german film fare at the world 's most important movie market ?
dw spoke with mariette rissenbeek from the organization german film service + marketing . just 19 films are in the running for the coveted palme d 'or at this year 's cannes film festival 's main competition , but hundreds more features and dozens of shorts will be shown over the course of the festival , which runs through may 23 .
aside from the main competition - which generally highlights films by well-known directors - there are parallel selections .
these include " un certain regard , " a showcase for film from younger or more unusual directors , films shown out of competition , special screenings , and cannes classics , among others . there are also longstanding and independent festivals that run parallel to the official event , such as the highly regarded directors ' fortnight , organized by the association of french film directors . deutsche welle : ms. rissenbeek , over the years the cannes film festival has earned quite a reputation as a hub of hype , where seeing and being seen is of primary importance .
is the festival still meaningful in the world of film ? marianne rissenbeek : cannes is no doubt the most important festival for film - and the most important market for films - up to today .
i think it is still the leading film market .
and a lot of the films in the official program are rather author-driven .
so it 's not only about glitz and glamour , but about filmmaking . last year a german-language film " das weisse band " -lrb- " the white ribbon " -rrb- won the palme d 'or .
coming out after " the lives of others " won the oscar in 2007 , it seemed to signal a sort of renaissance in german art film .
this year , though , there is just one german film in competition - and in fact it is a german-ukrainian-dutch co-production - " my joy , " by sergei loznitsa .
are the tides turning for german film ? well , " my joy " is indeed a german production , which a german producer has developed .
he developed the script together with the director , so it 's not only a co-production with a financial commitment from germany .
there was creative input and engagement from germany .
i don ’ t think we feel neglected or ignored by the festival selection committee . bildunterschrift : germany 's offer in this year 's competition is ' my joy , ' a co-production with ukraine and the netherlands what else is germany showing at the festival , either out of competition , or on the sidelines as part of the un certain regard series , or as part of the directors ' fortnight ? in un certain regard there are two german films , one from christoph hochhaeusler , called " unter dir die stadt " -lrb- " the city below " -rrb- , and the other one , " life , above all , " is a production that was developed in germany .
even though the director , oliver schmitz , is south african-german , he has both nationalities .
and then in the directors ' fortnight there is a german film , " picco , " by philip koch .
so actually we feel there is quite a strong presence from germany . what are you most looking forward to seeing or experiencing at this year 's festival ? well of course , for us it is more important to see how german films will do .
it will be exciting to see how christoph hochhaeusler has developed - he was at cannes a few years ago with another film .
it will be interesting to see how his film is received this year .
and " picco , " by philip koch , is a first film , so that is exciting too .
it is very seldom that you gain access to cannes with your first film , and then to the directors ' fortnight … the film will get a lot of publicity , so that 's good . and then maybe you noticed that the directors ' cut of " the tin drum " by volker schloendorff will be shown , 30 years after it was premiered in cannes .
i look forward to seeing how audiences react to that . there are a lot of films from asia in competition this year - south korea , thailand , taiwan .
what do you make of that ?
does it indicate anything about the future of european versus asian film ? cannes always had an input from asia , there were always asian films in the program , from china , or taiwan … i do n't think it 's new .
this year maybe the films were more interesting from asia , so they chose more for competition , but i could n't really say if it means anything . we have organized screenings in the market of 28 films overall , many of which have already been premiered elsewhere .
they all have special attributes , so it 's hard to say which ones will be most successful . -lrb- … -rrb- it used to be that you were guaranteed a certain number of contracts if you came to cannes , but since the financial crisis two years ago , that 's not true anymore .
still , it is an important market . interview : jennifer abramsohn editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the win in hamburg was atletico 's first european trophy . the spanish capital 's perpetual bridesmaid club atletico madrid became the center of attention this wednesday , outlasting fulham in extra time and winning the inaugural europa league trophy .
diego forlan of uruguay scored both goals for atletico , and was set up on both occasions by his argentine strike partner sergio " kun " aguero .
four minutes from time in the second extra time period , forlan got a glancing heel to aguero 's cross from the left byline , which was enough to dribble in for a goal after a deflection off of defender brede hangeland 's thigh .
it was a scrappy ending to a scrappy game , but one which most observers , including atletico defender tomas ujfalusi , felt was deserved .
" we fought for 120 minutes , and got the goals we needed from our best player , " said the defender , who was returning to what was his home stadium for four years as a bundesliga player .
ujfalusi had never won a trophy in his career , which has taken him from olomouc in the czech republic to hamburg to florence to madrid , and was clearly moved after the match .
" it 's for moments like this that we play football .
it 's an unbelievable feeling , " he said .
bildunterschrift : fulham 's goalkeeper mark schwarzer was unlucky to lose his second european final the build-up the match did n't catch fire until the 32nd minute , and even then did n't do so with much elegance .
aguero scuffed his left-footed shot attempt from the edge of the penalty box .
luckily for him , though , forlan was streaking into the area just then , and stuck out his boot to one-time the ball for a 1-0 lead .
but the travelling fulham fans did n't have long to wait before their side had evened the score - in similarly disjointed fashion .
a slip from an atletico defender meant bobby zamora found himself free on the left wing , but a poor touch robbed him of the chance to shoot as he came inside .
zoltan gera , however , was in place to cross the ball back out to the wing , where simon davies was waiting and scored with a neat volley .
not long after halftime , fulham 's goal-scoring hero bobby zamora succumbed to the ankle injury that had kept him out of fabio capello 's provisional england squad at midweek , forcing him out of the game .
his replacement , clint dempsey nearly put fulham in front within minutes of entering , but saw his shot parried by the atletico keeper - and was subsequently called for offside .
as the match wore on , atletico began to dominate possession , but had little to show for it as they failed to put many shots on target .
extended play bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fulham picked up the pace in extra time the second half came to a close and the match entered extra time , but the spanish side 's control of the ball continued .
forlan and aguero nearly linked up for another go-ahead strike at the end of the first period , but this time it was the argentine on the end of the chance , and he pushed the ball wide .
fulham looked livelier in the second extra time , earning free kicks in dangerous positions through the enterprising runs of dempsey and gera , but it was atletico who tipped the game 's balance in their favor as the madrid side 's dynamic south american duo struck again to end the game .
the loss was a particularly bitter one for fulham 's goalkeeper , australia 's mark schwarzer .
in 2006 he had led middlesborough to the final of the uefa cup -lrb- the forerunner tournament to the europa league -rrb- , only to fall to sevilla .
" when you look at the goals , you 'll see how unlucky we were , " said schwarzer .
" we had the game in our hands , had our own chances , and hoped that would be enough .
but it did n't turn out that way . "

the win in hamburg was atletico 's first european trophy . the spanish capital 's perpetual bridesmaid club atletico madrid became the center of attention this wednesday , outlasting fulham in extra time and winning the inaugural europa league trophy .
diego forlan of uruguay scored both goals for atletico , and was set up on both occasions by his argentine strike partner sergio " kun " aguero .
four minutes from time in the second extra time period , forlan got a glancing heel to aguero 's cross from the left byline , which was enough to dribble in for a goal after a deflection off of defender brede hangeland 's thigh .
it was a scrappy ending to a scrappy game , but one which most observers , including atletico defender tomas ujfalusi , felt was deserved .
" we fought for 120 minutes , and got the goals we needed from our best player , " said the defender , who was returning to what was his home stadium for four years as a bundesliga player .
ujfalusi had never won a trophy in his career , which has taken him from olomouc in the czech republic to hamburg to florence to madrid , and was clearly moved after the match .
" it 's for moments like this that we play football .
it 's an unbelievable feeling , " he said .
bildunterschrift : fulham 's goalkeeper mark schwarzer was unlucky to lose his second european final the build-up the match did n't catch fire until the 32nd minute , and even then did n't do so with much elegance .
aguero scuffed his left-footed shot attempt from the edge of the penalty box .
luckily for him , though , forlan was streaking into the area just then , and stuck out his boot to one-time the ball for a 1-0 lead .
but the travelling fulham fans did n't have long to wait before their side had evened the score - in similarly disjointed fashion .
a slip from an atletico defender meant bobby zamora found himself free on the left wing , but a poor touch robbed him of the chance to shoot as he came inside .
zoltan gera , however , was in place to cross the ball back out to the wing , where simon davies was waiting and scored with a neat volley .
not long after halftime , fulham 's goal-scoring hero bobby zamora succumbed to the ankle injury that had kept him out of fabio capello 's provisional england squad at midweek , forcing him out of the game .
his replacement , clint dempsey nearly put fulham in front within minutes of entering , but saw his shot parried by the atletico keeper - and was subsequently called for offside .

the win in hamburg was atletico 's first european trophy . the spanish capital 's perpetual bridesmaid club atletico madrid became the center of attention this wednesday , outlasting fulham in extra time and winning the inaugural europa league trophy .
diego forlan of uruguay scored both goals for atletico , and was set up on both occasions by his argentine strike partner sergio " kun " aguero .
four minutes from time in the second extra time period , forlan got a glancing heel to aguero 's cross from the left byline , which was enough to dribble in for a goal after a deflection off of defender brede hangeland 's thigh .
it was a scrappy ending to a scrappy game , but one which most observers , including atletico defender tomas ujfalusi , felt was deserved .
" we fought for 120 minutes , and got the goals we needed from our best player , " said the defender , who was returning to what was his home stadium for four years as a bundesliga player .
ujfalusi had never won a trophy in his career , which has taken him from olomouc in the czech republic to hamburg to florence to madrid , and was clearly moved after the match .
" it 's for moments like this that we play football .
it 's an unbelievable feeling , " he said .
bildunterschrift : fulham 's goalkeeper mark schwarzer was unlucky to lose his second european final the build-up the match did n't catch fire until the 32nd minute , and even then did n't do so with much elegance .
aguero scuffed his left-footed shot attempt from the edge of the penalty box .
luckily for him , though , forlan was streaking into the area just then , and stuck out his boot to one-time the ball for a 1-0 lead .
but the travelling fulham fans did n't have long to wait before their side had evened the score - in similarly disjointed fashion .
a slip from an atletico defender meant bobby zamora found himself free on the left wing , but a poor touch robbed him of the chance to shoot as he came inside .
zoltan gera , however , was in place to cross the ball back out to the wing , where simon davies was waiting and scored with a neat volley .
not long after halftime , fulham 's goal-scoring hero bobby zamora succumbed to the ankle injury that had kept him out of fabio capello 's provisional england squad at midweek , forcing him out of the game .
his replacement , clint dempsey nearly put fulham in front within minutes of entering , but saw his shot parried by the atletico keeper - and was subsequently called for offside .
as the match wore on , atletico began to dominate possession , but had little to show for it as they failed to put many shots on target .
extended play bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fulham picked up the pace in extra time the second half came to a close and the match entered extra time , but the spanish side 's control of the ball continued .
forlan and aguero nearly linked up for another go-ahead strike at the end of the first period , but this time it was the argentine on the end of the chance , and he pushed the ball wide .
fulham looked livelier in the second extra time , earning free kicks in dangerous positions through the enterprising runs of dempsey and gera , but it was atletico who tipped the game 's balance in their favor as the madrid side 's dynamic south american duo struck again to end the game .
the loss was a particularly bitter one for fulham 's goalkeeper , australia 's mark schwarzer .
in 2006 he had led middlesborough to the final of the uefa cup -lrb- the forerunner tournament to the europa league -rrb- , only to fall to sevilla .
" when you look at the goals , you 'll see how unlucky we were , " said schwarzer .
" we had the game in our hands , had our own chances , and hoped that would be enough .
but it did n't turn out that way . "

brussels believes germany 's tough debt-reduction measures , enshrined in the constitution , could be a model for other eu states .
in the wednesday edition of the german weekly , die zeit , rehn said brussels should have greater powers and be able to monitor the national budgets of eu nations .
he said regulations must be put in place to make this possible .
" we want governments to send their budget outlines to brussels for review before they are approved by their national parliaments , " rehn said .
" we can then see early whether a country is adhering to the stability and growth pact .
if not , we would intervene , " he said .
berlin has rejected such measures , however , saying it would impact on its budget sovereignty .
many eurozone nations in trouble - in particular greece , spain , and portugal - have accumulated budget deficits vastly exceeding the three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- permitted by the stability and growth pact .
the pact is meant to ensure the stability of the economic and monetary union .
german debt-trimming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehn favors the german debt-reduction model rehn also told die zeit that he believed germany 's plans for debt reduction could serve as a model for other eu nations .
in 2009 , berlin passed a constitutional amendment making it illegal for the federal government to run structural deficits more than 0.35 percent of gdp per annum from 2016 , while from 2020 , germany 's federal states will not be allowed to run any deficit at all .
germany this year is expected to reach a record debt of more than five percent of gdp , but has plans to start reducing this from 2011 .
greece , which has a crippling budget deficit of nearly 14 percent of national income , this month became the first eu nation to receive billions of euros in a rescue package to prevent it from defaulting on its debts .
" it does n't touch greece alone , " rehn said in brussels earlier this month .
" it has to do with the eurozone as a whole . "
the eu commission has warned nations to rein in their spending , including france and italy , which until now have held back from introducing unpopular budget cuts .
750-billion-euro package the economic turbulence in some eu nations has led speculators and investors to target the euro , which has in the past weeks fallen to its lowest levels against the us dollar in more than 14 months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commission chief wants greater control over national budgets eu finance ministers on monday announced a rescue package of up to 500 billion euros -lrb- $ 632 billion -rrb- to protect the euro , as market speculators increasingly targeted the currency and began betting on its collapse . the international monetary fund is to provide a further 250 billion euros .
" we will defend the stability of the euro at any price , " rehn said earlier monday .
meanwhile , in a rare interview , john taylor , a hedge fund speculator who made big profits in 1992 when speculators bet against the british pound , told bloomberg tv that a fall in the value of the euro was inevitable .
" the euro is a poor design and ca n't continue like this .

micheal leister , a strategist at the westlb bank in dusseldorf , said hedge fund speculators may well make big profits by betting on currency fluctuations , but that they alone couldn ’ t shake the euro .

german chancellor angela merkel says its a good first step , but others say it goes too far . the european commission proposed that member countries submit their national budgets to brussels for " peer review " before they are sent on to their national parliaments .
" the package concerns the whole eu , but this specific proposal has more bite concerning the euro area countries , " european economic and monetary affairs commissioner olli rehn told reporters at a press conference in brussels .
the rules are aimed at avoiding a repeat of the greek debt crisis by preventing countries from over-spending .
the measures would apply to all members of the eu , not just the 16 nations that use the euro currency .
but many nations feel the eu is over-stepping its bounds by interfering in domestic politics .
france and sweden have both voiced their opposition to the measures . " that this should concern all countries is something we find a little strange , " swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt told a press conference in stockholm .
" this kind of discussion could perhaps be possible for -lrb- countries -rrb- with a budget policy that goes against the stability and growth pact , " he said . mixed message from berlin germany 's foreign minister , guido westerwelle , spoke out against the eu commission 's proposal , saying that national budgets belong to " the core of sovereignty . "
" the budget law is a matter of national parliaments .
the european commission does not determine the budget , that is the job of the german bundestag , the national parliament , " westerwelle told reporters in berlin .
however , chancellor angela merkel praised the eu 's attempts to crackdown on irresponsible spending , and said the budget measures did not necessarily usurp the powers of national parliaments . " i would say that the budgetary plans of the member states are not secret anyway , so the commission can already form an opinion about what governments put forward during budgetary debates , " merkel told reporters in berlin . sanctions possible european commission president jose manuel barosso was clear that he believed a unifying economic policy was inevitable for the euro 's survival .
" member states should have the courage to say whether they do want an economic union or not , because if they do not we better forget about a monetary union , " barosso said . bildunterschrift : the commission also threatened sanctions against countries that consistently breach the stability and growth pact , which stipulates that no country should run deficits higher than three per cent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
" let 's be clear - without sanctions it will not be enough for credibility , " he said .
barosso has said that cohesion funds could be withdrawn for countries that do n't comply , however , eurozone finance ministers would have to vote to approve any possible sanctions the eurozone is under pressure to strengthen its economic governance , after member state greece was forced to request 110 billion euros -lrb- $ 140-billion -rrb- from the eurozone countries and the imf to avoid defaulting on its debt. smh / afp / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german chancellor angela merkel says its a good first step , but others say it goes too far . the european commission proposed that member countries submit their national budgets to brussels for " peer review " before they are sent on to their national parliaments .
" the package concerns the whole eu , but this specific proposal has more bite concerning the euro area countries , " european economic and monetary affairs commissioner olli rehn told reporters at a press conference in brussels .
the rules are aimed at avoiding a repeat of the greek debt crisis by preventing countries from over-spending .
the measures would apply to all members of the eu , not just the 16 nations that use the euro currency .
but many nations feel the eu is over-stepping its bounds by interfering in domestic politics .
france and sweden have both voiced their opposition to the measures . " that this should concern all countries is something we find a little strange , " swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt told a press conference in stockholm .
" this kind of discussion could perhaps be possible for -lrb- countries -rrb- with a budget policy that goes against the stability and growth pact , " he said . mixed message from berlin germany 's foreign minister , guido westerwelle , spoke out against the eu commission 's proposal , saying that national budgets belong to " the core of sovereignty . "
" the budget law is a matter of national parliaments .
the european commission does not determine the budget , that is the job of the german bundestag , the national parliament , " westerwelle told reporters in berlin .
however , chancellor angela merkel praised the eu 's attempts to crackdown on irresponsible spending , and said the budget measures did not necessarily usurp the powers of national parliaments . " i would say that the budgetary plans of the member states are not secret anyway , so the commission can already form an opinion about what governments put forward during budgetary debates , " merkel told reporters in berlin . sanctions possible european commission president jose manuel barosso was clear that he believed a unifying economic policy was inevitable for the euro 's survival .
" member states should have the courage to say whether they do want an economic union or not , because if they do not we better forget about a monetary union , " barosso said . bildunterschrift : the commission also threatened sanctions against countries that consistently breach the stability and growth pact , which stipulates that no country should run deficits higher than three per cent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
" let 's be clear - without sanctions it will not be enough for credibility , " he said .
barosso has said that cohesion funds could be withdrawn for countries that do n't comply , however , eurozone finance ministers would have to vote to approve any possible sanctions the eurozone is under pressure to strengthen its economic governance , after member state greece was forced to request 110 billion euros -lrb- $ 140-billion -rrb- from the eurozone countries and the imf to avoid defaulting on its debt. smh / afp / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the talks would focus on efforts by both the eu and the us to have the other party stop providing aid to airbus and boeing , respectively .
eu trade commissioner karel de gucht told reporters the bloc could start talks " immediately , " as long as there were no preconditions for future european government aid for airbus 's new a350 plane .

the talks would focus on efforts by both the eu and the us to have the other party stop providing aid to airbus and boeing , respectively .
eu trade commissioner karel de gucht told reporters the bloc could start talks " immediately , " as long as there were no preconditions for future european government aid for airbus 's new a350 plane .
there are concerns that without state support airbus and boeing would struggle to develop large aircraft in the future .
at the heart of the dispute are subsidies paid by eu countries to airbus for the a350 .
germany alone pledged 1.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- to airbus for the new jetliner , which is seen as a possible future market rival for the boeing 787 dreamliner .
the us had filed a case with the world trade organization years ago which led to european governments being called on to stop providing such aid .
airbus argues the wto verdict does not apply to the a350 as it was handed down prior to the plane 's development .
the wto decision was only the first part of the long-running saga , with another ruling on a counter-complaint brought by the eu against us aid for boeing expected later this year .
us trade officials also said they were ready to hold talks , " but any productive discussions must necessarily address all wto-inconsistent subsidies to civil aircraft , " ustr spokeswoman nefeterius mcpherson said. dfm / afp / reuters editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german chancellor angela merkel phoned david cameron on wednesday to congratulate him , and invited him to visit germany soon for more comprehensive talks , according to a government spokesman in berlin .
in brussels , european union officials hope the liberal democrats ' presence in the new coalition will soften the tories ' traditionally euroskeptic stance , and help quieten hardline backbenchers within the center-right party .
european commission president jose manuel barroso also congratulated david cameron , saying his government faced difficult choices in difficult times .
" what i hope is that the british prime minister will of course defend -lsb- his country 's -rsb- national interests in the european setting , " barroso told reporters in brussels , saying he was not concerned by conservative election manifesto pledges to claw back powers from brussels .
uncertain stance but no one in brussels is quite certain how far the new british government will go in defending its national interests , especially now that the liberal democrats form a part of its leadership .
as the country grapples with a runaway national debt and budget deficit , many in brussels believe that europe is not the top priority for the new conservative-led government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has the reputation of being a reluctant eu member " cameron has far too much on his plate to think about picking a fight with europe , " the european policy center 's -lrb- epc -rrb- acting director of studies , john wyles , told deutsche welle .
" and providing there is nothing major in the policy pipeline here -lsb- in brussels -rsb- , he is certainly not going to be looking for a fight . "
wyles also expects the conservatives and liberal democrats not to fight over european policy in the short term , partly because the liberal democrats have been sufficiently vague on the issue in their manifesto .
the message filtering through to brussels from london , according to wyles , is that david cameron 's approach will be entirely pragmatic on europe and relatively low key .
and so far , the new british government has signaled it will be ' business as usual ' as far as the european union is concerned .
conservatives remain a concern still , eu officials are keeping a watchful eye on britain 's new foreign secretary , william hague , who has been playing down policy differences over the european union within the new coalition .
hague did rule out further european integration for britain , telling reporters it was a " red line " for his party , but he focussed more on the agreements reached in negotiations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservatives have no plans to join the single european currency " the liberal democrats have readily agreed with us that it will not be the policy of this government to join the euro or to propose to join the euro in its lifetime , " former conservative party leader hague said .
" look , all british governments sometimes face difficulties over european policy . "
cameron pulled his conservatives out of the main center-right grouping in the european parliament , the european people 's party , because hardline conservatives deemed the group too pro-european .
but the epc 's john wyles believes that while this sounded some alarm bells in brussels , it 's unwise to over-analyze the decision .
" that was just a piece of red meat that -lsb- cameron -rsb- felt he needed to toss to the euroskeptic majority in order to get elected , " wyles said .
" it was not well judged , and it has created a lot of resentment against the conservatives among the center-right in europe , but they will get over that - i think many of them have largely got over it already . "
some in brussels even believe the conservatives will find their way back to the european people 's party , but john wyles said that this is an unlikely scenario .
he believes the new prime minister will have to strike a balance on europe - keeping hardline euroskeptics on board , while simultaneously staying sufficiently pragmatic to further britain 's interests on the continent .

estonia is set to adopt the euro and plans to replace its currency , the kroon , on january 1 , 2011 .
the move would make the baltic country the 17th eurozone member . the european commission on wednesday said estonia 's economy is strong enough to join the euro zone .
estonia plans to switch to the shared european currency on january 1 , 2011 . the commission had examined estonia 's debt , deficit , inflation , and interest levels .
olli rehn , the eu commissioner for economic and budgetary affairs , said the country had achieved " a high degree of sustainable economic convergence " and was therefore ready to adopt the euro .
' prudent fiscal policy ' is key " to ensure that the adoption of the euro is a success , estonia must pursue its efforts to maintain a prudent fiscal policy stance , " he said .
he urged tallinn to " remain vigilant and react early and decisively " if problems emerge .
the commission 's positive assessment came in the wake of an enormous european bailout for greece , which shed new light on the importance of countries taking inflation-control measures .
countries are concerned that massive debt problems in the eurozone could make brussels wary of taking on a new member .
economic data adds up according to rehn , " the assessment and our proposal is also a strong signal about the euro area and to the eu more broadly , " testifying that sound economic policies such as those adopted by estonia " generate concrete results . "
estonia has had an average budget surplus of 1.8 percent of gross domestic product between 2002 to 2007 , deteriorating to a deficit of minus 2.7 percent in 2008 and minus 1.7 percent in 2009 as a result of the economic crisis .
that is still well within the eurozone 's threshold of 3 percent .
the brussels-based eu executive said the country 's " price performance -lsb- is -rsb- sustainable " as average inflation fell to minus 0.7 percent in the 12 months to march 2010 .
but it warned that " estonia " will need to remain vigilant to keep inflation at a low level . "
in order for estonia to be finally welcomed into the eurozone , wednesday 's approval will have to be confirmed by the eu 's finance ministers in july .
so far , no positive recommendation by the commission on eurozone enlargement has ever been contradicted by eu member states .
estonia shifted rapidly from a communist command economy to the free market after breaking from the crumbling soviet bloc in 1991 .
the 1.3-million-strong country had hoped to adopt the euro in 2007 , but failed to meet the inflation-control criteria at the time. jen / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

estonia is set to adopt the euro and plans to replace its currency , the kroon , on january 1 , 2011 .
the move would make the baltic country the 17th eurozone member . the european commission on wednesday said estonia 's economy is strong enough to join the euro zone .
estonia plans to switch to the shared european currency on january 1 , 2011 . the commission had examined estonia 's debt , deficit , inflation , and interest levels .
olli rehn , the eu commissioner for economic and budgetary affairs , said the country had achieved " a high degree of sustainable economic convergence " and was therefore ready to adopt the euro .
' prudent fiscal policy ' is key " to ensure that the adoption of the euro is a success , estonia must pursue its efforts to maintain a prudent fiscal policy stance , " he said .
he urged tallinn to " remain vigilant and react early and decisively " if problems emerge .
the commission 's positive assessment came in the wake of an enormous european bailout for greece , which shed new light on the importance of countries taking inflation-control measures .
countries are concerned that massive debt problems in the eurozone could make brussels wary of taking on a new member .
economic data adds up according to rehn , " the assessment and our proposal is also a strong signal about the euro area and to the eu more broadly , " testifying that sound economic policies such as those adopted by estonia " generate concrete results . "
estonia has had an average budget surplus of 1.8 percent of gross domestic product between 2002 to 2007 , deteriorating to a deficit of minus 2.7 percent in 2008 and minus 1.7 percent in 2009 as a result of the economic crisis .
that is still well within the eurozone 's threshold of 3 percent .
the brussels-based eu executive said the country 's " price performance -lsb- is -rsb- sustainable " as average inflation fell to minus 0.7 percent in the 12 months to march 2010 .
but it warned that " estonia " will need to remain vigilant to keep inflation at a low level . "
in order for estonia to be finally welcomed into the eurozone , wednesday 's approval will have to be confirmed by the eu 's finance ministers in july .
so far , no positive recommendation by the commission on eurozone enlargement has ever been contradicted by eu member states .
estonia shifted rapidly from a communist command economy to the free market after breaking from the crumbling soviet bloc in 1991 .

the commission 's positive assessment came in the wake of an enormous european bailout for greece , which shed new light on the importance of countries taking inflation-control measures .
countries are concerned that massive debt problems in the eurozone could make brussels wary of taking on a new member .
economic data adds up according to rehn , " the assessment and our proposal is also a strong signal about the euro area and to the eu more broadly , " testifying that sound economic policies such as those adopted by estonia " generate concrete results . "
estonia has had an average budget surplus of 1.8 percent of gross domestic product between 2002 to 2007 , deteriorating to a deficit of minus 2.7 percent in 2008 and minus 1.7 percent in 2009 as a result of the economic crisis .
that is still well within the eurozone 's threshold of 3 percent .
the brussels-based eu executive said the country 's " price performance -lsb- is -rsb- sustainable " as average inflation fell to minus 0.7 percent in the 12 months to march 2010 .
but it warned that " estonia " will need to remain vigilant to keep inflation at a low level . "
in order for estonia to be finally welcomed into the eurozone , wednesday 's approval will have to be confirmed by the eu 's finance ministers in july .
so far , no positive recommendation by the commission on eurozone enlargement has ever been contradicted by eu member states .
estonia shifted rapidly from a communist command economy to the free market after breaking from the crumbling soviet bloc in 1991 .
the 1.3-million-strong country had hoped to adopt the euro in 2007 , but failed to meet the inflation-control criteria at the time. jen / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german chancellor angela merkel phoned david cameron on wednesday to congratulate him , and invited him to visit germany soon for more comprehensive talks , according to a government spokesman in berlin .
in brussels , european union officials hope the liberal democrats ' presence in the new coalition will soften the tories ' traditionally euroskeptic stance , and help quieten hardline backbenchers within the center-right party .
european commission president jose manuel barroso also congratulated david cameron , saying his government faced difficult choices in difficult times .
" what i hope is that the british prime minister will of course defend -lsb- his country 's -rsb- national interests in the european setting , " barroso told reporters in brussels , saying he was not concerned by conservative election manifesto pledges to claw back powers from brussels .
uncertain stance but no one in brussels is quite certain how far the new british government will go in defending its national interests , especially now that the liberal democrats form a part of its leadership .
as the country grapples with a runaway national debt and budget deficit , many in brussels believe that europe is not the top priority for the new conservative-led government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has the reputation of being a reluctant eu member " cameron has far too much on his plate to think about picking a fight with europe , " the european policy center 's -lrb- epc -rrb- acting director of studies , john wyles , told deutsche welle .
" and providing there is nothing major in the policy pipeline here -lsb- in brussels -rsb- , he is certainly not going to be looking for a fight . "
wyles also expects the conservatives and liberal democrats not to fight over european policy in the short term , partly because the liberal democrats have been sufficiently vague on the issue in their manifesto .
the message filtering through to brussels from london , according to wyles , is that david cameron 's approach will be entirely pragmatic on europe and relatively low key .
and so far , the new british government has signaled it will be ' business as usual ' as far as the european union is concerned .
conservatives remain a concern still , eu officials are keeping a watchful eye on britain 's new foreign secretary , william hague , who has been playing down policy differences over the european union within the new coalition .
hague did rule out further european integration for britain , telling reporters it was a " red line " for his party , but he focussed more on the agreements reached in negotiations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservatives have no plans to join the single european currency " the liberal democrats have readily agreed with us that it will not be the policy of this government to join the euro or to propose to join the euro in its lifetime , " former conservative party leader hague said .
" look , all british governments sometimes face difficulties over european policy . "
cameron pulled his conservatives out of the main center-right grouping in the european parliament , the european people 's party , because hardline conservatives deemed the group too pro-european .
but the epc 's john wyles believes that while this sounded some alarm bells in brussels , it 's unwise to over-analyze the decision .
" that was just a piece of red meat that -lsb- cameron -rsb- felt he needed to toss to the euroskeptic majority in order to get elected , " wyles said .
" it was not well judged , and it has created a lot of resentment against the conservatives among the center-right in europe , but they will get over that - i think many of them have largely got over it already . "
some in brussels even believe the conservatives will find their way back to the european people 's party , but john wyles said that this is an unlikely scenario .
he believes the new prime minister will have to strike a balance on europe - keeping hardline euroskeptics on board , while simultaneously staying sufficiently pragmatic to further britain 's interests on the continent .

german chancellor angela merkel phoned david cameron on wednesday to congratulate him , and invited him to visit germany soon for more comprehensive talks , according to a government spokesman in berlin .
in brussels , european union officials hope the liberal democrats ' presence in the new coalition will soften the tories ' traditionally euroskeptic stance , and help quieten hardline backbenchers within the center-right party .
european commission president jose manuel barroso also congratulated david cameron , saying his government faced difficult choices in difficult times .
" what i hope is that the british prime minister will of course defend -lsb- his country 's -rsb- national interests in the european setting , " barroso told reporters in brussels , saying he was not concerned by conservative election manifesto pledges to claw back powers from brussels .
uncertain stance but no one in brussels is quite certain how far the new british government will go in defending its national interests , especially now that the liberal democrats form a part of its leadership .
as the country grapples with a runaway national debt and budget deficit , many in brussels believe that europe is not the top priority for the new conservative-led government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has the reputation of being a reluctant eu member " cameron has far too much on his plate to think about picking a fight with europe , " the european policy center 's -lrb- epc -rrb- acting director of studies , john wyles , told deutsche welle .
" and providing there is nothing major in the policy pipeline here -lsb- in brussels -rsb- , he is certainly not going to be looking for a fight . "
wyles also expects the conservatives and liberal democrats not to fight over european policy in the short term , partly because the liberal democrats have been sufficiently vague on the issue in their manifesto .
the message filtering through to brussels from london , according to wyles , is that david cameron 's approach will be entirely pragmatic on europe and relatively low key .
and so far , the new british government has signaled it will be ' business as usual ' as far as the european union is concerned .
conservatives remain a concern still , eu officials are keeping a watchful eye on britain 's new foreign secretary , william hague , who has been playing down policy differences over the european union within the new coalition .
hague did rule out further european integration for britain , telling reporters it was a " red line " for his party , but he focussed more on the agreements reached in negotiations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservatives have no plans to join the single european currency " the liberal democrats have readily agreed with us that it will not be the policy of this government to join the euro or to propose to join the euro in its lifetime , " former conservative party leader hague said .
" look , all british governments sometimes face difficulties over european policy . "
cameron pulled his conservatives out of the main center-right grouping in the european parliament , the european people 's party , because hardline conservatives deemed the group too pro-european .
but the epc 's john wyles believes that while this sounded some alarm bells in brussels , it 's unwise to over-analyze the decision .
" that was just a piece of red meat that -lsb- cameron -rsb- felt he needed to toss to the euroskeptic majority in order to get elected , " wyles said .
" it was not well judged , and it has created a lot of resentment against the conservatives among the center-right in europe , but they will get over that - i think many of them have largely got over it already . "
some in brussels even believe the conservatives will find their way back to the european people 's party , but john wyles said that this is an unlikely scenario .
he believes the new prime minister will have to strike a balance on europe - keeping hardline euroskeptics on board , while simultaneously staying sufficiently pragmatic to further britain 's interests on the continent .

" as we look toward a responsible , orderly transition in the international combat mission in afghanistan , we will not abandon the afghan people , " clinton said .
karzai , meanwhile , reiterated that his country would stick to its responsibility to further develop afghanistan 's civilian and democratic structures . the us commitment should serve as a reassurance to karzai , whose visit comes as relations between afghanistan and the west have cooled in recent months .
last month , following a visit by obama to kabul in late march , karzai slammed the un and the international community , accusing them of perpetrating a " vast fraud " in last year 's presidential elections as part of a conspiracy to undermine his victory .
he said western coalition troops risked being seen as invaders rather than saviours of his country .
while many observers put it down to an attempt by a politically weakened karzai to assert his legitimacy in afghanistan , the unusually harsh outburst sparked criticism in western capitals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us , nato and afghan forces are preparing for a major offensive in kandahar critical juncture " karzai 's visit to the us is highly significant .
it will help the us government show the political community in washington that it still has control over karzai .
it shows that karzai depends on the international community for his political survival .
and it also shows that the west has no viable alternative to karzai in afghanistan , " henning riecke , an analyst at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" from the afghan government point of view , this visit which takes place at a sensitive time , is extremely important , " waheed omar , karzai 's spokesman told reporters last week .
it comes amid a us military surge in afghanistan and ahead of a major offensive against militants in the southern afghan province of kandahar .
the talks in washington also take place amid mounting anger in afghanistan against rising civilian casualties and dwindling public support for the afghan mission in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say distinguishing between who 's moderate and who 's not in the taliban will be tricky tricky talks with the taliban a peace conference , or jirga , to forge a national consensus on how to reconcile with the taliban is to take place later this month in kabul .
the british newspaper the guardian reported recently that afghanistan is proposing to offer top taliban leaders exile if they agree to stop fighting against the government .
the newspaper refered to a document suggesting insurgent leaders could face " potential exile in a third country . "
it also calls for " deradicalisation " classes for insurgents and thousands of new manual jobs to be created for taliban fighters who lay down their arms .
plans to reach out to the taliban are n't now .
in a shift in strategy , most western nations now accept that any political solution to the afghanistan conflict must include moderate elements of the taliban .
earlier this year , german foreign minister guido westerwelle drummed up support for an " exit program " for taliban fighters funded by the international community .
but some point out that the country that finds it the hardest to embrace talks with the taliban is the us .
" the americans are ambivalent about bringing the taliban to the table due to their links with al qaeda .
it 's heightened after the botched bombing at times square , " fabrice pothier , head of carnegie europe , a forum for european policymakers and think-tanks , told deutsche welle . " any agreement with the taliban has to involve security guarantees on both sides - the taliban must sever links with al qaeda and the us must guarantee that taliban fighters wo n't be imprisoned or killed .
for the us president , justifying making a deal with the taliban is a hard sell at home . "
european involvement observers say that though european allies lack the political clout the us has in afghanistan , the talks in washington are being followed carefully across the atlantic .
" on hard political questions , europe is out of the picture in afghanistan .
we do n't have the same credibility as the us because we are n't taking the same risks as the us .
but at the same time , europe has a long-term interest in institution-building in afghanistan .
so the talks in the us remain important to europe 's future role -lrb- in afghanistan -rrb- , " pothier said .
many european governments are grappling with waning support at home for the war in afghanistan as troop casualties rise .
experts say it stands to reason that good ties between kabul and washington would help obama fulfill his pledge to start bringing us troops home in mid-2011 - and thus signal the way for an end in sight to the afghan engagement .
" when obama announced he would begin a partial withdrawal of troops in mid-2011 it was greeted with cheer in europe .
it was interpreted here as a possible end of the deployment .
but that 's not what it 's going to be .
we can expect some tough discussions and friction between the us and its european allies later in november this year when american generals review the success of the surge , " riecke said .
expert : west should rethink afghan policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising troop casualties have raised concerns in the west " western capitals keep making demands on kabul on corruption and governance .
but the fact is that much of the corruption is fuelled by international aid money .
the price per square meter of property in kabul is higher than in tokyo - it 's a bubble created by the west , " pothier said .
the expert pointed out that a host of events in afghanistan this year - the peace conference , a foreign donor nations meeting in july , parliamentary elections in september - offer a chance for the west to pursue a different script in afghanistan .
" the reality of the afghan state is that the western-backed karzai government in kabul has not percolated to the country 's provinces and districts .
karzai and his smart english-speaking ministers who travel the world have failed to deliver basic services to the majority of the afghan people , " porthier said .
" the west needs to take a hard look at what 's gone wrong and push for broader political change and reform in afghanistan . "

karzai , meanwhile , reiterated that his country would stick to its responsibility to further develop afghanistan 's civilian and democratic structures . the us commitment should serve as a reassurance to karzai , whose visit comes as relations between afghanistan and the west have cooled in recent months .
last month , following a visit by obama to kabul in late march , karzai slammed the un and the international community , accusing them of perpetrating a " vast fraud " in last year 's presidential elections as part of a conspiracy to undermine his victory .
he said western coalition troops risked being seen as invaders rather than saviours of his country .
while many observers put it down to an attempt by a politically weakened karzai to assert his legitimacy in afghanistan , the unusually harsh outburst sparked criticism in western capitals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us , nato and afghan forces are preparing for a major offensive in kandahar critical juncture " karzai 's visit to the us is highly significant .
it will help the us government show the political community in washington that it still has control over karzai .
it shows that karzai depends on the international community for his political survival .
and it also shows that the west has no viable alternative to karzai in afghanistan , " henning riecke , an analyst at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" from the afghan government point of view , this visit which takes place at a sensitive time , is extremely important , " waheed omar , karzai 's spokesman told reporters last week .
it comes amid a us military surge in afghanistan and ahead of a major offensive against militants in the southern afghan province of kandahar .
the talks in washington also take place amid mounting anger in afghanistan against rising civilian casualties and dwindling public support for the afghan mission in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say distinguishing between who 's moderate and who 's not in the taliban will be tricky tricky talks with the taliban a peace conference , or jirga , to forge a national consensus on how to reconcile with the taliban is to take place later this month in kabul .
the british newspaper the guardian reported recently that afghanistan is proposing to offer top taliban leaders exile if they agree to stop fighting against the government .
the newspaper refered to a document suggesting insurgent leaders could face " potential exile in a third country . "
it also calls for " deradicalisation " classes for insurgents and thousands of new manual jobs to be created for taliban fighters who lay down their arms .
plans to reach out to the taliban are n't now .
in a shift in strategy , most western nations now accept that any political solution to the afghanistan conflict must include moderate elements of the taliban .
earlier this year , german foreign minister guido westerwelle drummed up support for an " exit program " for taliban fighters funded by the international community .
but some point out that the country that finds it the hardest to embrace talks with the taliban is the us .
" the americans are ambivalent about bringing the taliban to the table due to their links with al qaeda .
it 's heightened after the botched bombing at times square , " fabrice pothier , head of carnegie europe , a forum for european policymakers and think-tanks , told deutsche welle . " any agreement with the taliban has to involve security guarantees on both sides - the taliban must sever links with al qaeda and the us must guarantee that taliban fighters wo n't be imprisoned or killed .
for the us president , justifying making a deal with the taliban is a hard sell at home . "
european involvement observers say that though european allies lack the political clout the us has in afghanistan , the talks in washington are being followed carefully across the atlantic .
" on hard political questions , europe is out of the picture in afghanistan .
we do n't have the same credibility as the us because we are n't taking the same risks as the us .
but at the same time , europe has a long-term interest in institution-building in afghanistan .
so the talks in the us remain important to europe 's future role -lrb- in afghanistan -rrb- , " pothier said .
many european governments are grappling with waning support at home for the war in afghanistan as troop casualties rise .
experts say it stands to reason that good ties between kabul and washington would help obama fulfill his pledge to start bringing us troops home in mid-2011 - and thus signal the way for an end in sight to the afghan engagement .
" when obama announced he would begin a partial withdrawal of troops in mid-2011 it was greeted with cheer in europe .
it was interpreted here as a possible end of the deployment .
but that 's not what it 's going to be .
we can expect some tough discussions and friction between the us and its european allies later in november this year when american generals review the success of the surge , " riecke said .
expert : west should rethink afghan policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising troop casualties have raised concerns in the west " western capitals keep making demands on kabul on corruption and governance .
but the fact is that much of the corruption is fuelled by international aid money .

the expert pointed out that a host of events in afghanistan this year - the peace conference , a foreign donor nations meeting in july , parliamentary elections in september - offer a chance for the west to pursue a different script in afghanistan .
" the reality of the afghan state is that the western-backed karzai government in kabul has not percolated to the country 's provinces and districts .
karzai and his smart english-speaking ministers who travel the world have failed to deliver basic services to the majority of the afghan people , " porthier said .
" the west needs to take a hard look at what 's gone wrong and push for broader political change and reform in afghanistan . "

" he also said the us has committed to reducing civilian casualties in afghanistan , an issue that has strained their relations in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan 's president hamid karzai , left , and secretary of state hillary clinton reassurance to provide security in the first of a series of meetings , afghan president hamid karzai on tuesday met us secretary of state hillary clinton who reassured him that the us would remain committed to providing security in afghanistan even after us troops have left . " as we look toward a responsible , orderly transition in the international combat mission in afghanistan , we will not abandon the afghan people , " clinton said .
karzai , meanwhile , reiterated that his country would stick to its responsibility to further develop afghanistan 's civilian and democratic structures . the us commitment should serve as a reassurance to karzai , whose visit comes as relations between afghanistan and the west have cooled in recent months .
last month , following a visit by obama to kabul in late march , karzai slammed the un and the international community , accusing them of perpetrating a " vast fraud " in last year 's presidential elections as part of a conspiracy to undermine his victory .
he said western coalition troops risked being seen as invaders rather than saviours of his country .
while many observers put it down to an attempt by a politically weakened karzai to assert his legitimacy in afghanistan , the unusually harsh outburst sparked criticism in western capitals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us , nato and afghan forces are preparing for a major offensive in kandahar critical juncture " karzai 's visit to the us is highly significant .
it will help the us government show the political community in washington that it still has control over karzai .
it shows that karzai depends on the international community for his political survival .
and it also shows that the west has no viable alternative to karzai in afghanistan , " henning riecke , an analyst at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" from the afghan government point of view , this visit which takes place at a sensitive time , is extremely important , " waheed omar , karzai 's spokesman told reporters last week .
it comes amid a us military surge in afghanistan and ahead of a major offensive against militants in the southern afghan province of kandahar .
the talks in washington also take place amid mounting anger in afghanistan against rising civilian casualties and dwindling public support for the afghan mission in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say distinguishing between who 's moderate and who 's not in the taliban will be tricky tricky talks with the taliban a peace conference , or jirga , to forge a national consensus on how to reconcile with the taliban is to take place later this month in kabul .
the british newspaper the guardian reported recently that afghanistan is proposing to offer top taliban leaders exile if they agree to stop fighting against the government .
the newspaper refered to a document suggesting insurgent leaders could face " potential exile in a third country . "
it also calls for " deradicalisation " classes for insurgents and thousands of new manual jobs to be created for taliban fighters who lay down their arms .
plans to reach out to the taliban are n't now .
in a shift in strategy , most western nations now accept that any political solution to the afghanistan conflict must include moderate elements of the taliban .
earlier this year , german foreign minister guido westerwelle drummed up support for an " exit program " for taliban fighters funded by the international community .
but some point out that the country that finds it the hardest to embrace talks with the taliban is the us .
" the americans are ambivalent about bringing the taliban to the table due to their links with al qaeda .
it 's heightened after the botched bombing at times square , " fabrice pothier , head of carnegie europe , a forum for european policymakers and think-tanks , told deutsche welle . " any agreement with the taliban has to involve security guarantees on both sides - the taliban must sever links with al qaeda and the us must guarantee that taliban fighters wo n't be imprisoned or killed .
for the us president , justifying making a deal with the taliban is a hard sell at home . "
european involvement observers say that though european allies lack the political clout the us has in afghanistan , the talks in washington are being followed carefully across the atlantic .
" on hard political questions , europe is out of the picture in afghanistan .
we do n't have the same credibility as the us because we are n't taking the same risks as the us .
but at the same time , europe has a long-term interest in institution-building in afghanistan .
so the talks in the us remain important to europe 's future role -lrb- in afghanistan -rrb- , " pothier said .
many european governments are grappling with waning support at home for the war in afghanistan as troop casualties rise .
experts say it stands to reason that good ties between kabul and washington would help obama fulfill his pledge to start bringing us troops home in mid-2011 - and thus signal the way for an end in sight to the afghan engagement .
" when obama announced he would begin a partial withdrawal of troops in mid-2011 it was greeted with cheer in europe .
it was interpreted here as a possible end of the deployment .
but that 's not what it 's going to be .
we can expect some tough discussions and friction between the us and its european allies later in november this year when american generals review the success of the surge , " riecke said .
expert : west should rethink afghan policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising troop casualties have raised concerns in the west " western capitals keep making demands on kabul on corruption and governance .
but the fact is that much of the corruption is fuelled by international aid money .
the price per square meter of property in kabul is higher than in tokyo - it 's a bubble created by the west , " pothier said .
the expert pointed out that a host of events in afghanistan this year - the peace conference , a foreign donor nations meeting in july , parliamentary elections in september - offer a chance for the west to pursue a different script in afghanistan .
" the reality of the afghan state is that the western-backed karzai government in kabul has not percolated to the country 's provinces and districts .
karzai and his smart english-speaking ministers who travel the world have failed to deliver basic services to the majority of the afghan people , " porthier said .
" the west needs to take a hard look at what 's gone wrong and push for broader political change and reform in afghanistan . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 12.05.2010 brussels to unveil plans for tougher rules to protect euro großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels wants greater powers to protect the euro the european commission is to unveil a new strategy for avoiding crises like the one that has shaken greece and led to massive speculation on the value of the euro . european commission president jose manuel barroso and eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner olli rehn are expected wednesday to outline plans that include strengthening eu budget rules and economic surveillance in the 16-nation eurozone .
brussels believes germany 's tough debt-reduction measures , enshrined in the constitution , could be a model for other eu states .
in the wednesday edition of the german weekly , die zeit , rehn said brussels should have greater powers and be able to monitor the national budgets of eu nations .
he said regulations must be put in place to make this possible .
" we want governments to send their budget outlines to brussels for review before they are approved by their national parliaments , " rehn said .
" we can then see early whether a country is adhering to the stability and growth pact .
if not , we would intervene , " he said .
berlin has rejected such measures , however , saying it would impact on its budget sovereignty .
many eurozone nations in trouble - in particular greece , spain , and portugal - have accumulated budget deficits vastly exceeding the three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- permitted by the stability and growth pact .
the pact is meant to ensure the stability of the economic and monetary union .
german debt-trimming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehn favors the german debt-reduction model rehn also told die zeit that he believed germany 's plans for debt reduction could serve as a model for other eu nations .
in 2009 , berlin passed a constitutional amendment making it illegal for the federal government to run structural deficits more than 0.35 percent of gdp per annum from 2016 , while from 2020 , germany 's federal states will not be allowed to run any deficit at all .
germany this year is expected to reach a record debt of more than five percent of gdp , but has plans to start reducing this from 2011 .
greece , which has a crippling budget deficit of nearly 14 percent of national income , this month became the first eu nation to receive billions of euros in a rescue package to prevent it from defaulting on its debts .
" it does n't touch greece alone , " rehn said in brussels earlier this month .
" it has to do with the eurozone as a whole . "
the eu commission has warned nations to rein in their spending , including france and italy , which until now have held back from introducing unpopular budget cuts .
750-billion-euro package the economic turbulence in some eu nations has led speculators and investors to target the euro , which has in the past weeks fallen to its lowest levels against the us dollar in more than 14 months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commission chief wants greater control over national budgets eu finance ministers on monday announced a rescue package of up to 500 billion euros -lrb- $ 632 billion -rrb- to protect the euro , as market speculators increasingly targeted the currency and began betting on its collapse . the international monetary fund is to provide a further 250 billion euros .
" we will defend the stability of the euro at any price , " rehn said earlier monday .
meanwhile , in a rare interview , john taylor , a hedge fund speculator who made big profits in 1992 when speculators bet against the british pound , told bloomberg tv that a fall in the value of the euro was inevitable .
" the euro is a poor design and ca n't continue like this .
it 's quite easy to see that the euro will become much weaker , " taylor told bloomberg tv .
micheal leister , a strategist at the westlb bank in dusseldorf , said hedge fund speculators may well make big profits by betting on currency fluctuations , but that they alone couldn ’ t shake the euro .
" in times like this , when investors start panicking and liquidity is getting tight , one can make massive profits .
but the jury is still out on whether that is the cause of all the current troubles . " wl / dpa / afp / reuters editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ecb president jean-claude trichet claims he had no other option . credibility is sacred to powerful monetary watchdogs like the us federal reserve , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- and germany 's bundesbank .
it 's something precious , central bankers are quick to admit , that is hard to earn but easy to lose .
perhaps no one knows that better than jean-claude trichet , an architect of the euro who oversaw the french central bank 's deliverance from political control in the 1990s .
the ecb president is waging the battle of his career to preserve the reputation of the bank , which he and his predecessor , former dutch central banker and european monetary institute president wim duisenberg , helped build .
the outcome is all but clear .
an unprecedented move to rescue the euro trichet has been under fire ever since eurozone finance ministers agreed over the weekend to launch an unprecedented aid package worth 750 billion euros -lrb- $ 1 trillion -rrb- .
the scheme is designed to rescue the euro as the effects of the greek fiscal crisis spill over into other indebted nations in the eurozone .
in a nutshell , it allows the ecb to buy government bonds issued by eurozone nations in financial trouble .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb president trichet is hearing plenty of criticism about the bank 's euro rescue move analysts argue the move has comprised the central bank 's independence ; the bank would effectively be buying government debt , giving governments a freer hand in raising money when it should actually be policing their efforts to do so .
trichet has vigorously defended the move .
at a press conference in basel , he said the central bank 's monetary policy was " hampered " and that a number of markets were " dysfunctional . "
and with an eye to critics , he said that the central bank has always been and will always be " fiercely and totally independent . "
critics , indeed , are in no short supply .
numerous monetary experts accuse the ecb 's 22-member council of bowing to political pressure from the european union and the 16 eurozone nations .
" significant stability risks " among the more outspoken and high-profile critics is bundesbank president alex weber , who is a leading candidate to succeed trichet next year .
in an interview with germany 's boersen zeitung , weber said that the purchase of government bonds " poses significant stability risks . "
he criticized the ecb council 's decision " even in this extraordinary situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans want the euro to remain a strong currency in a message to investors , david zervos , managing director of jefferies & co investment bank in new york , said that for all the attempts by the ecb to remain independent , it was unable " to push back on the eu power base in a crisis period . "
zervos warned that this development could make the eurozone " far less stable in any crisis times than a traditional national union . "
trichet realizes that ecb 's credibility is tightly linked to the bank 's independence and that any u-turns could soften the euro .
he knows all too well that if there 's anything europeans do n't want - especially many germans who still mourn the loss of their beloved deutschmark - it is a weak , suffering currency .
citizens of euro nations have every reason to be concerned : tuesday saw the euro retreat against the dollar as euphoria over the massive eurozone bailout announced on monday gave way to continuing doubts over the ability of euro nations to reduce their deficits .

german chancellor angela merkel says its a good first step , but others say it goes too far . the european commission proposed that member countries submit their national budgets to brussels for " peer review " before they are sent on to their national parliaments .
" the package concerns the whole eu , but this specific proposal has more bite concerning the euro area countries , " european economic and monetary affairs commissioner olli rehn told reporters at a press conference in brussels .
the rules are aimed at avoiding a repeat of the greek debt crisis by preventing countries from over-spending .
the measures would apply to all members of the eu , not just the 16 nations that use the euro currency .
but many nations feel the eu is over-stepping its bounds by interfering in domestic politics .
france and sweden have both voiced their opposition to the measures . " that this should concern all countries is something we find a little strange , " swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt told a press conference in stockholm .
" this kind of discussion could perhaps be possible for -lrb- countries -rrb- with a budget policy that goes against the stability and growth pact , " he said . mixed message from berlin germany 's foreign minister , guido westerwelle , spoke out against the eu commission 's proposal , saying that national budgets belong to " the core of sovereignty . "
" the budget law is a matter of national parliaments .
the european commission does not determine the budget , that is the job of the german bundestag , the national parliament , " westerwelle told reporters in berlin .
however , chancellor angela merkel praised the eu 's attempts to crackdown on irresponsible spending , and said the budget measures did not necessarily usurp the powers of national parliaments . " i would say that the budgetary plans of the member states are not secret anyway , so the commission can already form an opinion about what governments put forward during budgetary debates , " merkel told reporters in berlin . sanctions possible european commission president jose manuel barosso was clear that he believed a unifying economic policy was inevitable for the euro 's survival .
" member states should have the courage to say whether they do want an economic union or not , because if they do not we better forget about a monetary union , " barosso said . bildunterschrift : the commission also threatened sanctions against countries that consistently breach the stability and growth pact , which stipulates that no country should run deficits higher than three per cent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
" let 's be clear - without sanctions it will not be enough for credibility , " he said .
barosso has said that cohesion funds could be withdrawn for countries that do n't comply , however , eurozone finance ministers would have to vote to approve any possible sanctions the eurozone is under pressure to strengthen its economic governance , after member state greece was forced to request 110 billion euros -lrb- $ 140-billion -rrb- from the eurozone countries and the imf to avoid defaulting on its debt. smh / afp / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europa league -pipe- 12.05.2010 atletico madrid downs fulham in hamburg to lift europa league trophy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego forlan bagged both goals for atletico uruguay 's diego forlan was the hero , netting two goals in the spanish side 's 2-1 extra time win over london side fulham .
the win in hamburg was atletico 's first european trophy . the spanish capital 's perpetual bridesmaid club atletico madrid became the center of attention this wednesday , outlasting fulham in extra time and winning the inaugural europa league trophy .
diego forlan of uruguay scored both goals for atletico , and was set up on both occasions by his argentine strike partner sergio " kun " aguero .
four minutes from time in the second extra time period , forlan got a glancing heel to aguero 's cross from the left byline , which was enough to dribble in for a goal after a deflection off of defender brede hangeland 's thigh .
it was a scrappy ending to a scrappy game , but one which most observers , including atletico defender tomas ujfalusi , felt was deserved .
" we fought for 120 minutes , and got the goals we needed from our best player , " said the defender , who was returning to what was his home stadium for four years as a bundesliga player .
ujfalusi had never won a trophy in his career , which has taken him from olomouc in the czech republic to hamburg to florence to madrid , and was clearly moved after the match .
" it 's for moments like this that we play football .
it 's an unbelievable feeling , " he said .
bildunterschrift : fulham 's goalkeeper mark schwarzer was unlucky to lose his second european final the build-up the match did n't catch fire until the 32nd minute , and even then did n't do so with much elegance .
aguero scuffed his left-footed shot attempt from the edge of the penalty box .
luckily for him , though , forlan was streaking into the area just then , and stuck out his boot to one-time the ball for a 1-0 lead .
but the travelling fulham fans did n't have long to wait before their side had evened the score - in similarly disjointed fashion .
a slip from an atletico defender meant bobby zamora found himself free on the left wing , but a poor touch robbed him of the chance to shoot as he came inside .
zoltan gera , however , was in place to cross the ball back out to the wing , where simon davies was waiting and scored with a neat volley .
not long after halftime , fulham 's goal-scoring hero bobby zamora succumbed to the ankle injury that had kept him out of fabio capello 's provisional england squad at midweek , forcing him out of the game .
his replacement , clint dempsey nearly put fulham in front within minutes of entering , but saw his shot parried by the atletico keeper - and was subsequently called for offside .
as the match wore on , atletico began to dominate possession , but had little to show for it as they failed to put many shots on target .
extended play bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fulham picked up the pace in extra time the second half came to a close and the match entered extra time , but the spanish side 's control of the ball continued .
forlan and aguero nearly linked up for another go-ahead strike at the end of the first period , but this time it was the argentine on the end of the chance , and he pushed the ball wide .
fulham looked livelier in the second extra time , earning free kicks in dangerous positions through the enterprising runs of dempsey and gera , but it was atletico who tipped the game 's balance in their favor as the madrid side 's dynamic south american duo struck again to end the game .
the loss was a particularly bitter one for fulham 's goalkeeper , australia 's mark schwarzer .
in 2006 he had led middlesborough to the final of the uefa cup -lrb- the forerunner tournament to the europa league -rrb- , only to fall to sevilla .
" when you look at the goals , you 'll see how unlucky we were , " said schwarzer .
" we had the game in our hands , had our own chances , and hoped that would be enough .
but it did n't turn out that way . "

the talks would focus on efforts by both the eu and the us to have the other party stop providing aid to airbus and boeing , respectively .
eu trade commissioner karel de gucht told reporters the bloc could start talks " immediately , " as long as there were no preconditions for future european government aid for airbus 's new a350 plane .
there are concerns that without state support airbus and boeing would struggle to develop large aircraft in the future .
at the heart of the dispute are subsidies paid by eu countries to airbus for the a350 .
germany alone pledged 1.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- to airbus for the new jetliner , which is seen as a possible future market rival for the boeing 787 dreamliner .
the us had filed a case with the world trade organization years ago which led to european governments being called on to stop providing such aid .
airbus argues the wto verdict does not apply to the a350 as it was handed down prior to the plane 's development .
the wto decision was only the first part of the long-running saga , with another ruling on a counter-complaint brought by the eu against us aid for boeing expected later this year .
us trade officials also said they were ready to hold talks , " but any productive discussions must necessarily address all wto-inconsistent subsidies to civil aircraft , " ustr spokeswoman nefeterius mcpherson said. dfm / afp / reuters editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

brussels believes germany 's tough debt-reduction measures , enshrined in the constitution , could be a model for other eu states .
in the wednesday edition of the german weekly , die zeit , rehn said brussels should have greater powers and be able to monitor the national budgets of eu nations .
he said regulations must be put in place to make this possible .
" we want governments to send their budget outlines to brussels for review before they are approved by their national parliaments , " rehn said .
" we can then see early whether a country is adhering to the stability and growth pact .
if not , we would intervene , " he said .
berlin has rejected such measures , however , saying it would impact on its budget sovereignty .
many eurozone nations in trouble - in particular greece , spain , and portugal - have accumulated budget deficits vastly exceeding the three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- permitted by the stability and growth pact .
the pact is meant to ensure the stability of the economic and monetary union .

germany this year is expected to reach a record debt of more than five percent of gdp , but has plans to start reducing this from 2011 .
greece , which has a crippling budget deficit of nearly 14 percent of national income , this month became the first eu nation to receive billions of euros in a rescue package to prevent it from defaulting on its debts .
" it does n't touch greece alone , " rehn said in brussels earlier this month .
" it has to do with the eurozone as a whole . "
the eu commission has warned nations to rein in their spending , including france and italy , which until now have held back from introducing unpopular budget cuts .

brussels believes germany 's tough debt-reduction measures , enshrined in the constitution , could be a model for other eu states .
in the wednesday edition of the german weekly , die zeit , rehn said brussels should have greater powers and be able to monitor the national budgets of eu nations .
he said regulations must be put in place to make this possible .
" we want governments to send their budget outlines to brussels for review before they are approved by their national parliaments , " rehn said .
" we can then see early whether a country is adhering to the stability and growth pact .
if not , we would intervene , " he said .
berlin has rejected such measures , however , saying it would impact on its budget sovereignty .
many eurozone nations in trouble - in particular greece , spain , and portugal - have accumulated budget deficits vastly exceeding the three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- permitted by the stability and growth pact .
the pact is meant to ensure the stability of the economic and monetary union .
german debt-trimming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehn favors the german debt-reduction model rehn also told die zeit that he believed germany 's plans for debt reduction could serve as a model for other eu nations .
in 2009 , berlin passed a constitutional amendment making it illegal for the federal government to run structural deficits more than 0.35 percent of gdp per annum from 2016 , while from 2020 , germany 's federal states will not be allowed to run any deficit at all .
germany this year is expected to reach a record debt of more than five percent of gdp , but has plans to start reducing this from 2011 .
greece , which has a crippling budget deficit of nearly 14 percent of national income , this month became the first eu nation to receive billions of euros in a rescue package to prevent it from defaulting on its debts .
" it does n't touch greece alone , " rehn said in brussels earlier this month .
" it has to do with the eurozone as a whole . "
the eu commission has warned nations to rein in their spending , including france and italy , which until now have held back from introducing unpopular budget cuts .
750-billion-euro package the economic turbulence in some eu nations has led speculators and investors to target the euro , which has in the past weeks fallen to its lowest levels against the us dollar in more than 14 months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commission chief wants greater control over national budgets eu finance ministers on monday announced a rescue package of up to 500 billion euros -lrb- $ 632 billion -rrb- to protect the euro , as market speculators increasingly targeted the currency and began betting on its collapse . the international monetary fund is to provide a further 250 billion euros .
" we will defend the stability of the euro at any price , " rehn said earlier monday .
meanwhile , in a rare interview , john taylor , a hedge fund speculator who made big profits in 1992 when speculators bet against the british pound , told bloomberg tv that a fall in the value of the euro was inevitable .
" the euro is a poor design and ca n't continue like this .
it 's quite easy to see that the euro will become much weaker , " taylor told bloomberg tv .
micheal leister , a strategist at the westlb bank in dusseldorf , said hedge fund speculators may well make big profits by betting on currency fluctuations , but that they alone couldn ’ t shake the euro .
" in times like this , when investors start panicking and liquidity is getting tight , one can make massive profits .
but the jury is still out on whether that is the cause of all the current troubles . " wl / dpa / afp / reuters editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ecb president jean-claude trichet claims he had no other option . credibility is sacred to powerful monetary watchdogs like the us federal reserve , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- and germany 's bundesbank .
it 's something precious , central bankers are quick to admit , that is hard to earn but easy to lose .
perhaps no one knows that better than jean-claude trichet , an architect of the euro who oversaw the french central bank 's deliverance from political control in the 1990s .
the ecb president is waging the battle of his career to preserve the reputation of the bank , which he and his predecessor , former dutch central banker and european monetary institute president wim duisenberg , helped build .
the outcome is all but clear .
an unprecedented move to rescue the euro trichet has been under fire ever since eurozone finance ministers agreed over the weekend to launch an unprecedented aid package worth 750 billion euros -lrb- $ 1 trillion -rrb- .
the scheme is designed to rescue the euro as the effects of the greek fiscal crisis spill over into other indebted nations in the eurozone .
in a nutshell , it allows the ecb to buy government bonds issued by eurozone nations in financial trouble .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb president trichet is hearing plenty of criticism about the bank 's euro rescue move analysts argue the move has comprised the central bank 's independence ; the bank would effectively be buying government debt , giving governments a freer hand in raising money when it should actually be policing their efforts to do so .
trichet has vigorously defended the move .
at a press conference in basel , he said the central bank 's monetary policy was " hampered " and that a number of markets were " dysfunctional . "
and with an eye to critics , he said that the central bank has always been and will always be " fiercely and totally independent . "
critics , indeed , are in no short supply .
numerous monetary experts accuse the ecb 's 22-member council of bowing to political pressure from the european union and the 16 eurozone nations .
" significant stability risks " among the more outspoken and high-profile critics is bundesbank president alex weber , who is a leading candidate to succeed trichet next year .
in an interview with germany 's boersen zeitung , weber said that the purchase of government bonds " poses significant stability risks . "
he criticized the ecb council 's decision " even in this extraordinary situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans want the euro to remain a strong currency in a message to investors , david zervos , managing director of jefferies & co investment bank in new york , said that for all the attempts by the ecb to remain independent , it was unable " to push back on the eu power base in a crisis period . "
zervos warned that this development could make the eurozone " far less stable in any crisis times than a traditional national union . "
trichet realizes that ecb 's credibility is tightly linked to the bank 's independence and that any u-turns could soften the euro .
he knows all too well that if there 's anything europeans do n't want - especially many germans who still mourn the loss of their beloved deutschmark - it is a weak , suffering currency .
citizens of euro nations have every reason to be concerned : tuesday saw the euro retreat against the dollar as euphoria over the massive eurozone bailout announced on monday gave way to continuing doubts over the ability of euro nations to reduce their deficits .

in an interview with germany 's boersen zeitung , weber said that the purchase of government bonds " poses significant stability risks . "
he criticized the ecb council 's decision " even in this extraordinary situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans want the euro to remain a strong currency in a message to investors , david zervos , managing director of jefferies & co investment bank in new york , said that for all the attempts by the ecb to remain independent , it was unable " to push back on the eu power base in a crisis period . "
zervos warned that this development could make the eurozone " far less stable in any crisis times than a traditional national union . "
trichet realizes that ecb 's credibility is tightly linked to the bank 's independence and that any u-turns could soften the euro .
he knows all too well that if there 's anything europeans do n't want - especially many germans who still mourn the loss of their beloved deutschmark - it is a weak , suffering currency .
citizens of euro nations have every reason to be concerned : tuesday saw the euro retreat against the dollar as euphoria over the massive eurozone bailout announced on monday gave way to continuing doubts over the ability of euro nations to reduce their deficits .

ecb president jean-claude trichet claims he had no other option . credibility is sacred to powerful monetary watchdogs like the us federal reserve , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- and germany 's bundesbank .
it 's something precious , central bankers are quick to admit , that is hard to earn but easy to lose .
perhaps no one knows that better than jean-claude trichet , an architect of the euro who oversaw the french central bank 's deliverance from political control in the 1990s .
the ecb president is waging the battle of his career to preserve the reputation of the bank , which he and his predecessor , former dutch central banker and european monetary institute president wim duisenberg , helped build .
the outcome is all but clear .
an unprecedented move to rescue the euro trichet has been under fire ever since eurozone finance ministers agreed over the weekend to launch an unprecedented aid package worth 750 billion euros -lrb- $ 1 trillion -rrb- .
the scheme is designed to rescue the euro as the effects of the greek fiscal crisis spill over into other indebted nations in the eurozone .
in a nutshell , it allows the ecb to buy government bonds issued by eurozone nations in financial trouble .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb president trichet is hearing plenty of criticism about the bank 's euro rescue move analysts argue the move has comprised the central bank 's independence ; the bank would effectively be buying government debt , giving governments a freer hand in raising money when it should actually be policing their efforts to do so .
trichet has vigorously defended the move .
at a press conference in basel , he said the central bank 's monetary policy was " hampered " and that a number of markets were " dysfunctional . "
and with an eye to critics , he said that the central bank has always been and will always be " fiercely and totally independent . "
critics , indeed , are in no short supply .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 12.05.2010 ecb suffers credibility blow großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb fights claims of bowing to political pressure the credibility of the european central bank is on the line following a decision to intervene in financial markets under a eurozone rescue plan .
ecb president jean-claude trichet claims he had no other option . credibility is sacred to powerful monetary watchdogs like the us federal reserve , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- and germany 's bundesbank .
it 's something precious , central bankers are quick to admit , that is hard to earn but easy to lose .
perhaps no one knows that better than jean-claude trichet , an architect of the euro who oversaw the french central bank 's deliverance from political control in the 1990s .
the ecb president is waging the battle of his career to preserve the reputation of the bank , which he and his predecessor , former dutch central banker and european monetary institute president wim duisenberg , helped build .
the outcome is all but clear .
an unprecedented move to rescue the euro trichet has been under fire ever since eurozone finance ministers agreed over the weekend to launch an unprecedented aid package worth 750 billion euros -lrb- $ 1 trillion -rrb- .
the scheme is designed to rescue the euro as the effects of the greek fiscal crisis spill over into other indebted nations in the eurozone .
in a nutshell , it allows the ecb to buy government bonds issued by eurozone nations in financial trouble .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb president trichet is hearing plenty of criticism about the bank 's euro rescue move analysts argue the move has comprised the central bank 's independence ; the bank would effectively be buying government debt , giving governments a freer hand in raising money when it should actually be policing their efforts to do so .
trichet has vigorously defended the move .
at a press conference in basel , he said the central bank 's monetary policy was " hampered " and that a number of markets were " dysfunctional . "
and with an eye to critics , he said that the central bank has always been and will always be " fiercely and totally independent . "
critics , indeed , are in no short supply .
numerous monetary experts accuse the ecb 's 22-member council of bowing to political pressure from the european union and the 16 eurozone nations .
" significant stability risks " among the more outspoken and high-profile critics is bundesbank president alex weber , who is a leading candidate to succeed trichet next year .
in an interview with germany 's boersen zeitung , weber said that the purchase of government bonds " poses significant stability risks . "
he criticized the ecb council 's decision " even in this extraordinary situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans want the euro to remain a strong currency in a message to investors , david zervos , managing director of jefferies & co investment bank in new york , said that for all the attempts by the ecb to remain independent , it was unable " to push back on the eu power base in a crisis period . "
zervos warned that this development could make the eurozone " far less stable in any crisis times than a traditional national union . "
trichet realizes that ecb 's credibility is tightly linked to the bank 's independence and that any u-turns could soften the euro .
he knows all too well that if there 's anything europeans do n't want - especially many germans who still mourn the loss of their beloved deutschmark - it is a weak , suffering currency .
citizens of euro nations have every reason to be concerned : tuesday saw the euro retreat against the dollar as euphoria over the massive eurozone bailout announced on monday gave way to continuing doubts over the ability of euro nations to reduce their deficits .

estonia is set to adopt the euro and plans to replace its currency , the kroon , on january 1 , 2011 .
the move would make the baltic country the 17th eurozone member . the european commission on wednesday said estonia 's economy is strong enough to join the euro zone .
estonia plans to switch to the shared european currency on january 1 , 2011 . the commission had examined estonia 's debt , deficit , inflation , and interest levels .
olli rehn , the eu commissioner for economic and budgetary affairs , said the country had achieved " a high degree of sustainable economic convergence " and was therefore ready to adopt the euro .
' prudent fiscal policy ' is key " to ensure that the adoption of the euro is a success , estonia must pursue its efforts to maintain a prudent fiscal policy stance , " he said .
he urged tallinn to " remain vigilant and react early and decisively " if problems emerge .
the commission 's positive assessment came in the wake of an enormous european bailout for greece , which shed new light on the importance of countries taking inflation-control measures .
countries are concerned that massive debt problems in the eurozone could make brussels wary of taking on a new member .
economic data adds up according to rehn , " the assessment and our proposal is also a strong signal about the euro area and to the eu more broadly , " testifying that sound economic policies such as those adopted by estonia " generate concrete results . "
estonia has had an average budget surplus of 1.8 percent of gross domestic product between 2002 to 2007 , deteriorating to a deficit of minus 2.7 percent in 2008 and minus 1.7 percent in 2009 as a result of the economic crisis .
that is still well within the eurozone 's threshold of 3 percent .
the brussels-based eu executive said the country 's " price performance -lsb- is -rsb- sustainable " as average inflation fell to minus 0.7 percent in the 12 months to march 2010 .
but it warned that " estonia " will need to remain vigilant to keep inflation at a low level . "
in order for estonia to be finally welcomed into the eurozone , wednesday 's approval will have to be confirmed by the eu 's finance ministers in july .
so far , no positive recommendation by the commission on eurozone enlargement has ever been contradicted by eu member states .
estonia shifted rapidly from a communist command economy to the free market after breaking from the crumbling soviet bloc in 1991 .
the 1.3-million-strong country had hoped to adopt the euro in 2007 , but failed to meet the inflation-control criteria at the time. jen / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

estonia is set to adopt the euro and plans to replace its currency , the kroon , on january 1 , 2011 .
the move would make the baltic country the 17th eurozone member . the european commission on wednesday said estonia 's economy is strong enough to join the euro zone .
estonia plans to switch to the shared european currency on january 1 , 2011 . the commission had examined estonia 's debt , deficit , inflation , and interest levels .
olli rehn , the eu commissioner for economic and budgetary affairs , said the country had achieved " a high degree of sustainable economic convergence " and was therefore ready to adopt the euro .
' prudent fiscal policy ' is key " to ensure that the adoption of the euro is a success , estonia must pursue its efforts to maintain a prudent fiscal policy stance , " he said .
he urged tallinn to " remain vigilant and react early and decisively " if problems emerge .
the commission 's positive assessment came in the wake of an enormous european bailout for greece , which shed new light on the importance of countries taking inflation-control measures .
countries are concerned that massive debt problems in the eurozone could make brussels wary of taking on a new member .
economic data adds up according to rehn , " the assessment and our proposal is also a strong signal about the euro area and to the eu more broadly , " testifying that sound economic policies such as those adopted by estonia " generate concrete results . "
estonia has had an average budget surplus of 1.8 percent of gross domestic product between 2002 to 2007 , deteriorating to a deficit of minus 2.7 percent in 2008 and minus 1.7 percent in 2009 as a result of the economic crisis .
that is still well within the eurozone 's threshold of 3 percent .
the brussels-based eu executive said the country 's " price performance -lsb- is -rsb- sustainable " as average inflation fell to minus 0.7 percent in the 12 months to march 2010 .
but it warned that " estonia " will need to remain vigilant to keep inflation at a low level . "
in order for estonia to be finally welcomed into the eurozone , wednesday 's approval will have to be confirmed by the eu 's finance ministers in july .
so far , no positive recommendation by the commission on eurozone enlargement has ever been contradicted by eu member states .
estonia shifted rapidly from a communist command economy to the free market after breaking from the crumbling soviet bloc in 1991 .

the decision has sparked a debate about how to protect the public from violent offenders . germany is under pressure to change its system of preventive detention , which allows for violent and repeat offenders to be detained indefinitely , even after they have served their sentence .
in december , the european court of human rights -lrb- echr -rrb- ruled that germany had violated the european human rights convention in the case of german inmate reinhard m. , who was convicted for attempted murder and had been kept in prison more than 10 years after his sentence .
the 52-year-old man had completed his five-year prison sentence in 1991 , but was not released , as he was deemed a danger to the public .
he was detained for the next 10 years , the maximum term for preventive detention at the time .
but a change in german legislation in 1998 meant that prisoners can now be detained indefinitely .
right to liberty the echr ruled that because reinhard m had been convicted before the change in the law in 1998 germany violated the ' right to liberty ' .
the court also stated that " there was no sufficient causal connection between his conviction and his continued deprivation of liberty . "
germany requested the case be referred to the echr 's grand chamber , which has now been refused , making the original court decision binding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 70 violent offenders in germany could benefit from the court ruling the echr can only tackle specific cases , but the ruling has already sparked a debate on how to protect the public from criminals convicted of murder , armed robbery , rape and other violent crimes .
" we need a comprehensive not an alarmist debate on the ramifications and options of today 's ruling -lsb- by the echr -rsb- , " justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger said in a statement on tuesday .
new framework the federal coalition agreement from last autumn calls for a reform of the current system , but the government has not released any details yet .
the bavarian justice minister , beate merk , however , has been vocal in calling for a complete overhaul of preventive detention in germany .
" a few band-aids here and there just will not do , " she said in a statement .
" we need a completely new system that can deal with violent offenders that are likely to reoffend and be a danger to the public even after they have served their sentence , " she added .
merk is adamant that some form of post-sentence detention is necessary , but she would like to see the sentence , ie the punishment , separated from the subsequent detention , with separate facilities and dedicated therapy options for violent criminals - one of the areas the echr had criticized as lacking in the current system .
longer sentences but some legal experts believe preventive detention is not the answer .
" the law has been extended in the past because of an unsubstantiated fear of crime , at a time when crime rates are going down in germany , and i do n't believe there is a need for it at all , " hermann kuehn , an expert in criminal law who runs his own law firm , told deutsche welle .
he would like to see longer sentences handed down instead .
currently , the maximum sentence is 15 years , unless a defendant is sentenced to life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's constitutional court endorsed retroactive preventive detention in 2004 " we could extend the fixed-term punishments to give courts the opportunity for a longer prison sentence and then leave it to the court to release him earlier if he is no longer a danger to society , " kuehn said .
he believes the power to release a potentially dangerous person should remain with the court , however .
he argues that leaving violent criminals to medical authorities for preventive detention by separating punishment from detention could be dangerous if you rely on medical staff alone to determine whether or not a detainee is a danger to society .

the decision has sparked a debate about how to protect the public from violent offenders . germany is under pressure to change its system of preventive detention , which allows for violent and repeat offenders to be detained indefinitely , even after they have served their sentence .
in december , the european court of human rights -lrb- echr -rrb- ruled that germany had violated the european human rights convention in the case of german inmate reinhard m. , who was convicted for attempted murder and had been kept in prison more than 10 years after his sentence .
the 52-year-old man had completed his five-year prison sentence in 1991 , but was not released , as he was deemed a danger to the public .
he was detained for the next 10 years , the maximum term for preventive detention at the time .
but a change in german legislation in 1998 meant that prisoners can now be detained indefinitely .
right to liberty the echr ruled that because reinhard m had been convicted before the change in the law in 1998 germany violated the ' right to liberty ' .
the court also stated that " there was no sufficient causal connection between his conviction and his continued deprivation of liberty . "
germany requested the case be referred to the echr 's grand chamber , which has now been refused , making the original court decision binding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 70 violent offenders in germany could benefit from the court ruling the echr can only tackle specific cases , but the ruling has already sparked a debate on how to protect the public from criminals convicted of murder , armed robbery , rape and other violent crimes .
" we need a comprehensive not an alarmist debate on the ramifications and options of today 's ruling -lsb- by the echr -rsb- , " justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger said in a statement on tuesday .
new framework the federal coalition agreement from last autumn calls for a reform of the current system , but the government has not released any details yet .
the bavarian justice minister , beate merk , however , has been vocal in calling for a complete overhaul of preventive detention in germany .
" a few band-aids here and there just will not do , " she said in a statement .
" we need a completely new system that can deal with violent offenders that are likely to reoffend and be a danger to the public even after they have served their sentence , " she added .
merk is adamant that some form of post-sentence detention is necessary , but she would like to see the sentence , ie the punishment , separated from the subsequent detention , with separate facilities and dedicated therapy options for violent criminals - one of the areas the echr had criticized as lacking in the current system .
longer sentences but some legal experts believe preventive detention is not the answer .
" the law has been extended in the past because of an unsubstantiated fear of crime , at a time when crime rates are going down in germany , and i do n't believe there is a need for it at all , " hermann kuehn , an expert in criminal law who runs his own law firm , told deutsche welle .
he would like to see longer sentences handed down instead .
currently , the maximum sentence is 15 years , unless a defendant is sentenced to life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's constitutional court endorsed retroactive preventive detention in 2004 " we could extend the fixed-term punishments to give courts the opportunity for a longer prison sentence and then leave it to the court to release him earlier if he is no longer a danger to society , " kuehn said .
he believes the power to release a potentially dangerous person should remain with the court , however .
he argues that leaving violent criminals to medical authorities for preventive detention by separating punishment from detention could be dangerous if you rely on medical staff alone to determine whether or not a detainee is a danger to society .

german chancellor angela merkel says its a good first step , but others say it goes too far . the european commission proposed that member countries submit their national budgets to brussels for " peer review " before they are sent on to their national parliaments .
" the package concerns the whole eu , but this specific proposal has more bite concerning the euro area countries , " european economic and monetary affairs commissioner olli rehn told reporters at a press conference in brussels .
the rules are aimed at avoiding a repeat of the greek debt crisis by preventing countries from over-spending .
the measures would apply to all members of the eu , not just the 16 nations that use the euro currency .
but many nations feel the eu is over-stepping its bounds by interfering in domestic politics .
france and sweden have both voiced their opposition to the measures . " that this should concern all countries is something we find a little strange , " swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt told a press conference in stockholm .

however , chancellor angela merkel praised the eu 's attempts to crackdown on irresponsible spending , and said the budget measures did not necessarily usurp the powers of national parliaments . " i would say that the budgetary plans of the member states are not secret anyway , so the commission can already form an opinion about what governments put forward during budgetary debates , " merkel told reporters in berlin . sanctions possible european commission president jose manuel barosso was clear that he believed a unifying economic policy was inevitable for the euro 's survival .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 12.05.2010 obama , karzai reaffirm commitment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president barack obama , right , shakes hands with afghan president hamid karzai us president barack obama has praised the " broad and deepening " us partnership with afghanistan and reaffirmed the us commitment to build a secure and stable afghanistan .
he was speaking following his talks with afghan president hamid karzai in washington . president obama said relations between the two governments were " strong " and would endure and that the tensions had been exaggerated . " with respect to perceived tensions between the us government and the afghan government , a lot of them were simply overstated , " said obama . he said the two sides renewed their goal to defeat al qaeda and its extremist allies . for his part , karzai told reporters that he had " frank and productive " discussions with president obama and the relations between the united states and afghanistan were much stronger now .
" we are much more strongly related to each other today than we ever were before . " he also said the us has committed to reducing civilian casualties in afghanistan , an issue that has strained their relations in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan 's president hamid karzai , left , and secretary of state hillary clinton reassurance to provide security in the first of a series of meetings , afghan president hamid karzai on tuesday met us secretary of state hillary clinton who reassured him that the us would remain committed to providing security in afghanistan even after us troops have left . " as we look toward a responsible , orderly transition in the international combat mission in afghanistan , we will not abandon the afghan people , " clinton said .
karzai , meanwhile , reiterated that his country would stick to its responsibility to further develop afghanistan 's civilian and democratic structures . the us commitment should serve as a reassurance to karzai , whose visit comes as relations between afghanistan and the west have cooled in recent months .
last month , following a visit by obama to kabul in late march , karzai slammed the un and the international community , accusing them of perpetrating a " vast fraud " in last year 's presidential elections as part of a conspiracy to undermine his victory .
he said western coalition troops risked being seen as invaders rather than saviours of his country .
while many observers put it down to an attempt by a politically weakened karzai to assert his legitimacy in afghanistan , the unusually harsh outburst sparked criticism in western capitals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us , nato and afghan forces are preparing for a major offensive in kandahar critical juncture " karzai 's visit to the us is highly significant .
it will help the us government show the political community in washington that it still has control over karzai .
it shows that karzai depends on the international community for his political survival .
and it also shows that the west has no viable alternative to karzai in afghanistan , " henning riecke , an analyst at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" from the afghan government point of view , this visit which takes place at a sensitive time , is extremely important , " waheed omar , karzai 's spokesman told reporters last week .
it comes amid a us military surge in afghanistan and ahead of a major offensive against militants in the southern afghan province of kandahar .
the talks in washington also take place amid mounting anger in afghanistan against rising civilian casualties and dwindling public support for the afghan mission in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say distinguishing between who 's moderate and who 's not in the taliban will be tricky tricky talks with the taliban a peace conference , or jirga , to forge a national consensus on how to reconcile with the taliban is to take place later this month in kabul .
the british newspaper the guardian reported recently that afghanistan is proposing to offer top taliban leaders exile if they agree to stop fighting against the government .
the newspaper refered to a document suggesting insurgent leaders could face " potential exile in a third country . "
it also calls for " deradicalisation " classes for insurgents and thousands of new manual jobs to be created for taliban fighters who lay down their arms .
plans to reach out to the taliban are n't now .
in a shift in strategy , most western nations now accept that any political solution to the afghanistan conflict must include moderate elements of the taliban .
earlier this year , german foreign minister guido westerwelle drummed up support for an " exit program " for taliban fighters funded by the international community .
but some point out that the country that finds it the hardest to embrace talks with the taliban is the us .
" the americans are ambivalent about bringing the taliban to the table due to their links with al qaeda .
it 's heightened after the botched bombing at times square , " fabrice pothier , head of carnegie europe , a forum for european policymakers and think-tanks , told deutsche welle . " any agreement with the taliban has to involve security guarantees on both sides - the taliban must sever links with al qaeda and the us must guarantee that taliban fighters wo n't be imprisoned or killed .
for the us president , justifying making a deal with the taliban is a hard sell at home . "
european involvement observers say that though european allies lack the political clout the us has in afghanistan , the talks in washington are being followed carefully across the atlantic .
" on hard political questions , europe is out of the picture in afghanistan .
we do n't have the same credibility as the us because we are n't taking the same risks as the us .
but at the same time , europe has a long-term interest in institution-building in afghanistan .
so the talks in the us remain important to europe 's future role -lrb- in afghanistan -rrb- , " pothier said .
many european governments are grappling with waning support at home for the war in afghanistan as troop casualties rise .
experts say it stands to reason that good ties between kabul and washington would help obama fulfill his pledge to start bringing us troops home in mid-2011 - and thus signal the way for an end in sight to the afghan engagement .
" when obama announced he would begin a partial withdrawal of troops in mid-2011 it was greeted with cheer in europe .
it was interpreted here as a possible end of the deployment .
but that 's not what it 's going to be .
we can expect some tough discussions and friction between the us and its european allies later in november this year when american generals review the success of the surge , " riecke said .
expert : west should rethink afghan policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising troop casualties have raised concerns in the west " western capitals keep making demands on kabul on corruption and governance .
but the fact is that much of the corruption is fuelled by international aid money .
the price per square meter of property in kabul is higher than in tokyo - it 's a bubble created by the west , " pothier said .
the expert pointed out that a host of events in afghanistan this year - the peace conference , a foreign donor nations meeting in july , parliamentary elections in september - offer a chance for the west to pursue a different script in afghanistan .
" the reality of the afghan state is that the western-backed karzai government in kabul has not percolated to the country 's provinces and districts .
karzai and his smart english-speaking ministers who travel the world have failed to deliver basic services to the majority of the afghan people , " porthier said .
" the west needs to take a hard look at what 's gone wrong and push for broader political change and reform in afghanistan . "

" he also said the us has committed to reducing civilian casualties in afghanistan , an issue that has strained their relations in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan 's president hamid karzai , left , and secretary of state hillary clinton reassurance to provide security in the first of a series of meetings , afghan president hamid karzai on tuesday met us secretary of state hillary clinton who reassured him that the us would remain committed to providing security in afghanistan even after us troops have left . " as we look toward a responsible , orderly transition in the international combat mission in afghanistan , we will not abandon the afghan people , " clinton said .
karzai , meanwhile , reiterated that his country would stick to its responsibility to further develop afghanistan 's civilian and democratic structures . the us commitment should serve as a reassurance to karzai , whose visit comes as relations between afghanistan and the west have cooled in recent months .
last month , following a visit by obama to kabul in late march , karzai slammed the un and the international community , accusing them of perpetrating a " vast fraud " in last year 's presidential elections as part of a conspiracy to undermine his victory .
he said western coalition troops risked being seen as invaders rather than saviours of his country .
while many observers put it down to an attempt by a politically weakened karzai to assert his legitimacy in afghanistan , the unusually harsh outburst sparked criticism in western capitals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us , nato and afghan forces are preparing for a major offensive in kandahar critical juncture " karzai 's visit to the us is highly significant .
it will help the us government show the political community in washington that it still has control over karzai .
it shows that karzai depends on the international community for his political survival .
and it also shows that the west has no viable alternative to karzai in afghanistan , " henning riecke , an analyst at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" from the afghan government point of view , this visit which takes place at a sensitive time , is extremely important , " waheed omar , karzai 's spokesman told reporters last week .
it comes amid a us military surge in afghanistan and ahead of a major offensive against militants in the southern afghan province of kandahar .
the talks in washington also take place amid mounting anger in afghanistan against rising civilian casualties and dwindling public support for the afghan mission in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say distinguishing between who 's moderate and who 's not in the taliban will be tricky tricky talks with the taliban a peace conference , or jirga , to forge a national consensus on how to reconcile with the taliban is to take place later this month in kabul .
the british newspaper the guardian reported recently that afghanistan is proposing to offer top taliban leaders exile if they agree to stop fighting against the government .
the newspaper refered to a document suggesting insurgent leaders could face " potential exile in a third country . "
it also calls for " deradicalisation " classes for insurgents and thousands of new manual jobs to be created for taliban fighters who lay down their arms .
plans to reach out to the taliban are n't now .
in a shift in strategy , most western nations now accept that any political solution to the afghanistan conflict must include moderate elements of the taliban .
earlier this year , german foreign minister guido westerwelle drummed up support for an " exit program " for taliban fighters funded by the international community .
but some point out that the country that finds it the hardest to embrace talks with the taliban is the us .
" the americans are ambivalent about bringing the taliban to the table due to their links with al qaeda .
it 's heightened after the botched bombing at times square , " fabrice pothier , head of carnegie europe , a forum for european policymakers and think-tanks , told deutsche welle . " any agreement with the taliban has to involve security guarantees on both sides - the taliban must sever links with al qaeda and the us must guarantee that taliban fighters wo n't be imprisoned or killed .
for the us president , justifying making a deal with the taliban is a hard sell at home . "
european involvement observers say that though european allies lack the political clout the us has in afghanistan , the talks in washington are being followed carefully across the atlantic .
" on hard political questions , europe is out of the picture in afghanistan .
we do n't have the same credibility as the us because we are n't taking the same risks as the us .
but at the same time , europe has a long-term interest in institution-building in afghanistan .
so the talks in the us remain important to europe 's future role -lrb- in afghanistan -rrb- , " pothier said .
many european governments are grappling with waning support at home for the war in afghanistan as troop casualties rise .
experts say it stands to reason that good ties between kabul and washington would help obama fulfill his pledge to start bringing us troops home in mid-2011 - and thus signal the way for an end in sight to the afghan engagement .
" when obama announced he would begin a partial withdrawal of troops in mid-2011 it was greeted with cheer in europe .
it was interpreted here as a possible end of the deployment .
but that 's not what it 's going to be .
we can expect some tough discussions and friction between the us and its european allies later in november this year when american generals review the success of the surge , " riecke said .
expert : west should rethink afghan policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising troop casualties have raised concerns in the west " western capitals keep making demands on kabul on corruption and governance .
but the fact is that much of the corruption is fuelled by international aid money .
the price per square meter of property in kabul is higher than in tokyo - it 's a bubble created by the west , " pothier said .
the expert pointed out that a host of events in afghanistan this year - the peace conference , a foreign donor nations meeting in july , parliamentary elections in september - offer a chance for the west to pursue a different script in afghanistan .
" the reality of the afghan state is that the western-backed karzai government in kabul has not percolated to the country 's provinces and districts .
karzai and his smart english-speaking ministers who travel the world have failed to deliver basic services to the majority of the afghan people , " porthier said .
" the west needs to take a hard look at what 's gone wrong and push for broader political change and reform in afghanistan . "

" with respect to perceived tensions between the us government and the afghan government , a lot of them were simply overstated , " said obama . he said the two sides renewed their goal to defeat al qaeda and its extremist allies . for his part , karzai told reporters that he had " frank and productive " discussions with president obama and the relations between the united states and afghanistan were much stronger now .
" we are much more strongly related to each other today than we ever were before . " he also said the us has committed to reducing civilian casualties in afghanistan , an issue that has strained their relations in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan 's president hamid karzai , left , and secretary of state hillary clinton reassurance to provide security in the first of a series of meetings , afghan president hamid karzai on tuesday met us secretary of state hillary clinton who reassured him that the us would remain committed to providing security in afghanistan even after us troops have left . " as we look toward a responsible , orderly transition in the international combat mission in afghanistan , we will not abandon the afghan people , " clinton said .
karzai , meanwhile , reiterated that his country would stick to its responsibility to further develop afghanistan 's civilian and democratic structures . the us commitment should serve as a reassurance to karzai , whose visit comes as relations between afghanistan and the west have cooled in recent months .
last month , following a visit by obama to kabul in late march , karzai slammed the un and the international community , accusing them of perpetrating a " vast fraud " in last year 's presidential elections as part of a conspiracy to undermine his victory .
he said western coalition troops risked being seen as invaders rather than saviours of his country .
while many observers put it down to an attempt by a politically weakened karzai to assert his legitimacy in afghanistan , the unusually harsh outburst sparked criticism in western capitals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us , nato and afghan forces are preparing for a major offensive in kandahar critical juncture " karzai 's visit to the us is highly significant .
it will help the us government show the political community in washington that it still has control over karzai .
it shows that karzai depends on the international community for his political survival .
and it also shows that the west has no viable alternative to karzai in afghanistan , " henning riecke , an analyst at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" from the afghan government point of view , this visit which takes place at a sensitive time , is extremely important , " waheed omar , karzai 's spokesman told reporters last week .
it comes amid a us military surge in afghanistan and ahead of a major offensive against militants in the southern afghan province of kandahar .
the talks in washington also take place amid mounting anger in afghanistan against rising civilian casualties and dwindling public support for the afghan mission in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say distinguishing between who 's moderate and who 's not in the taliban will be tricky tricky talks with the taliban a peace conference , or jirga , to forge a national consensus on how to reconcile with the taliban is to take place later this month in kabul .
the british newspaper the guardian reported recently that afghanistan is proposing to offer top taliban leaders exile if they agree to stop fighting against the government .
the newspaper refered to a document suggesting insurgent leaders could face " potential exile in a third country . "
it also calls for " deradicalisation " classes for insurgents and thousands of new manual jobs to be created for taliban fighters who lay down their arms .
plans to reach out to the taliban are n't now .
in a shift in strategy , most western nations now accept that any political solution to the afghanistan conflict must include moderate elements of the taliban .
earlier this year , german foreign minister guido westerwelle drummed up support for an " exit program " for taliban fighters funded by the international community .
but some point out that the country that finds it the hardest to embrace talks with the taliban is the us .
" the americans are ambivalent about bringing the taliban to the table due to their links with al qaeda .
it 's heightened after the botched bombing at times square , " fabrice pothier , head of carnegie europe , a forum for european policymakers and think-tanks , told deutsche welle . " any agreement with the taliban has to involve security guarantees on both sides - the taliban must sever links with al qaeda and the us must guarantee that taliban fighters wo n't be imprisoned or killed .
for the us president , justifying making a deal with the taliban is a hard sell at home . "
european involvement observers say that though european allies lack the political clout the us has in afghanistan , the talks in washington are being followed carefully across the atlantic .
" on hard political questions , europe is out of the picture in afghanistan .
we do n't have the same credibility as the us because we are n't taking the same risks as the us .
but at the same time , europe has a long-term interest in institution-building in afghanistan .
so the talks in the us remain important to europe 's future role -lrb- in afghanistan -rrb- , " pothier said .
many european governments are grappling with waning support at home for the war in afghanistan as troop casualties rise .
experts say it stands to reason that good ties between kabul and washington would help obama fulfill his pledge to start bringing us troops home in mid-2011 - and thus signal the way for an end in sight to the afghan engagement .
" when obama announced he would begin a partial withdrawal of troops in mid-2011 it was greeted with cheer in europe .
it was interpreted here as a possible end of the deployment .
but that 's not what it 's going to be .
we can expect some tough discussions and friction between the us and its european allies later in november this year when american generals review the success of the surge , " riecke said .
expert : west should rethink afghan policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising troop casualties have raised concerns in the west " western capitals keep making demands on kabul on corruption and governance .
but the fact is that much of the corruption is fuelled by international aid money .
the price per square meter of property in kabul is higher than in tokyo - it 's a bubble created by the west , " pothier said .
the expert pointed out that a host of events in afghanistan this year - the peace conference , a foreign donor nations meeting in july , parliamentary elections in september - offer a chance for the west to pursue a different script in afghanistan .
" the reality of the afghan state is that the western-backed karzai government in kabul has not percolated to the country 's provinces and districts .
karzai and his smart english-speaking ministers who travel the world have failed to deliver basic services to the majority of the afghan people , " porthier said .
" the west needs to take a hard look at what 's gone wrong and push for broader political change and reform in afghanistan . "

german chancellor angela merkel phoned david cameron on wednesday to congratulate him , and invited him to visit germany soon for more comprehensive talks , according to a government spokesman in berlin .
in brussels , european union officials hope the liberal democrats ' presence in the new coalition will soften the tories ' traditionally euroskeptic stance , and help quieten hardline backbenchers within the center-right party .
european commission president jose manuel barroso also congratulated david cameron , saying his government faced difficult choices in difficult times .
" what i hope is that the british prime minister will of course defend -lsb- his country 's -rsb- national interests in the european setting , " barroso told reporters in brussels , saying he was not concerned by conservative election manifesto pledges to claw back powers from brussels .
uncertain stance but no one in brussels is quite certain how far the new british government will go in defending its national interests , especially now that the liberal democrats form a part of its leadership .
as the country grapples with a runaway national debt and budget deficit , many in brussels believe that europe is not the top priority for the new conservative-led government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has the reputation of being a reluctant eu member " cameron has far too much on his plate to think about picking a fight with europe , " the european policy center 's -lrb- epc -rrb- acting director of studies , john wyles , told deutsche welle .
" and providing there is nothing major in the policy pipeline here -lsb- in brussels -rsb- , he is certainly not going to be looking for a fight . "
wyles also expects the conservatives and liberal democrats not to fight over european policy in the short term , partly because the liberal democrats have been sufficiently vague on the issue in their manifesto .
the message filtering through to brussels from london , according to wyles , is that david cameron 's approach will be entirely pragmatic on europe and relatively low key .
and so far , the new british government has signaled it will be ' business as usual ' as far as the european union is concerned .
conservatives remain a concern still , eu officials are keeping a watchful eye on britain 's new foreign secretary , william hague , who has been playing down policy differences over the european union within the new coalition .
hague did rule out further european integration for britain , telling reporters it was a " red line " for his party , but he focussed more on the agreements reached in negotiations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservatives have no plans to join the single european currency " the liberal democrats have readily agreed with us that it will not be the policy of this government to join the euro or to propose to join the euro in its lifetime , " former conservative party leader hague said .
" look , all british governments sometimes face difficulties over european policy . "
cameron pulled his conservatives out of the main center-right grouping in the european parliament , the european people 's party , because hardline conservatives deemed the group too pro-european .
but the epc 's john wyles believes that while this sounded some alarm bells in brussels , it 's unwise to over-analyze the decision .
" that was just a piece of red meat that -lsb- cameron -rsb- felt he needed to toss to the euroskeptic majority in order to get elected , " wyles said .
" it was not well judged , and it has created a lot of resentment against the conservatives among the center-right in europe , but they will get over that - i think many of them have largely got over it already . "
some in brussels even believe the conservatives will find their way back to the european people 's party , but john wyles said that this is an unlikely scenario .
he believes the new prime minister will have to strike a balance on europe - keeping hardline euroskeptics on board , while simultaneously staying sufficiently pragmatic to further britain 's interests on the continent .

german chancellor angela merkel phoned david cameron on wednesday to congratulate him , and invited him to visit germany soon for more comprehensive talks , according to a government spokesman in berlin .
in brussels , european union officials hope the liberal democrats ' presence in the new coalition will soften the tories ' traditionally euroskeptic stance , and help quieten hardline backbenchers within the center-right party .
european commission president jose manuel barroso also congratulated david cameron , saying his government faced difficult choices in difficult times .
" what i hope is that the british prime minister will of course defend -lsb- his country 's -rsb- national interests in the european setting , " barroso told reporters in brussels , saying he was not concerned by conservative election manifesto pledges to claw back powers from brussels .
uncertain stance but no one in brussels is quite certain how far the new british government will go in defending its national interests , especially now that the liberal democrats form a part of its leadership .
as the country grapples with a runaway national debt and budget deficit , many in brussels believe that europe is not the top priority for the new conservative-led government .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europa league -pipe- 12.05.2010 atletico madrid downs fulham in hamburg to lift europa league trophy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego forlan bagged both goals for atletico uruguay 's diego forlan was the hero , netting two goals in the spanish side 's 2-1 extra time win over london side fulham .
the win in hamburg was atletico 's first european trophy . the spanish capital 's perpetual bridesmaid club atletico madrid became the center of attention this wednesday , outlasting fulham in extra time and winning the inaugural europa league trophy .
diego forlan of uruguay scored both goals for atletico , and was set up on both occasions by his argentine strike partner sergio " kun " aguero .
four minutes from time in the second extra time period , forlan got a glancing heel to aguero 's cross from the left byline , which was enough to dribble in for a goal after a deflection off of defender brede hangeland 's thigh .
it was a scrappy ending to a scrappy game , but one which most observers , including atletico defender tomas ujfalusi , felt was deserved .
" we fought for 120 minutes , and got the goals we needed from our best player , " said the defender , who was returning to what was his home stadium for four years as a bundesliga player .
ujfalusi had never won a trophy in his career , which has taken him from olomouc in the czech republic to hamburg to florence to madrid , and was clearly moved after the match .
" it 's for moments like this that we play football .
it 's an unbelievable feeling , " he said .
bildunterschrift : fulham 's goalkeeper mark schwarzer was unlucky to lose his second european final the build-up the match did n't catch fire until the 32nd minute , and even then did n't do so with much elegance .
aguero scuffed his left-footed shot attempt from the edge of the penalty box .
luckily for him , though , forlan was streaking into the area just then , and stuck out his boot to one-time the ball for a 1-0 lead .
but the travelling fulham fans did n't have long to wait before their side had evened the score - in similarly disjointed fashion .
a slip from an atletico defender meant bobby zamora found himself free on the left wing , but a poor touch robbed him of the chance to shoot as he came inside .
zoltan gera , however , was in place to cross the ball back out to the wing , where simon davies was waiting and scored with a neat volley .
not long after halftime , fulham 's goal-scoring hero bobby zamora succumbed to the ankle injury that had kept him out of fabio capello 's provisional england squad at midweek , forcing him out of the game .
his replacement , clint dempsey nearly put fulham in front within minutes of entering , but saw his shot parried by the atletico keeper - and was subsequently called for offside .
as the match wore on , atletico began to dominate possession , but had little to show for it as they failed to put many shots on target .
extended play bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fulham picked up the pace in extra time the second half came to a close and the match entered extra time , but the spanish side 's control of the ball continued .
forlan and aguero nearly linked up for another go-ahead strike at the end of the first period , but this time it was the argentine on the end of the chance , and he pushed the ball wide .
fulham looked livelier in the second extra time , earning free kicks in dangerous positions through the enterprising runs of dempsey and gera , but it was atletico who tipped the game 's balance in their favor as the madrid side 's dynamic south american duo struck again to end the game .
the loss was a particularly bitter one for fulham 's goalkeeper , australia 's mark schwarzer .
in 2006 he had led middlesborough to the final of the uefa cup -lrb- the forerunner tournament to the europa league -rrb- , only to fall to sevilla .
" when you look at the goals , you 'll see how unlucky we were , " said schwarzer .
" we had the game in our hands , had our own chances , and hoped that would be enough .
but it did n't turn out that way . "

the win in hamburg was atletico 's first european trophy . the spanish capital 's perpetual bridesmaid club atletico madrid became the center of attention this wednesday , outlasting fulham in extra time and winning the inaugural europa league trophy .
diego forlan of uruguay scored both goals for atletico , and was set up on both occasions by his argentine strike partner sergio " kun " aguero .
four minutes from time in the second extra time period , forlan got a glancing heel to aguero 's cross from the left byline , which was enough to dribble in for a goal after a deflection off of defender brede hangeland 's thigh .
it was a scrappy ending to a scrappy game , but one which most observers , including atletico defender tomas ujfalusi , felt was deserved .
" we fought for 120 minutes , and got the goals we needed from our best player , " said the defender , who was returning to what was his home stadium for four years as a bundesliga player .
ujfalusi had never won a trophy in his career , which has taken him from olomouc in the czech republic to hamburg to florence to madrid , and was clearly moved after the match .
" it 's for moments like this that we play football .
it 's an unbelievable feeling , " he said .
bildunterschrift : fulham 's goalkeeper mark schwarzer was unlucky to lose his second european final the build-up the match did n't catch fire until the 32nd minute , and even then did n't do so with much elegance .
aguero scuffed his left-footed shot attempt from the edge of the penalty box .
luckily for him , though , forlan was streaking into the area just then , and stuck out his boot to one-time the ball for a 1-0 lead .
but the travelling fulham fans did n't have long to wait before their side had evened the score - in similarly disjointed fashion .
a slip from an atletico defender meant bobby zamora found himself free on the left wing , but a poor touch robbed him of the chance to shoot as he came inside .
zoltan gera , however , was in place to cross the ball back out to the wing , where simon davies was waiting and scored with a neat volley .
not long after halftime , fulham 's goal-scoring hero bobby zamora succumbed to the ankle injury that had kept him out of fabio capello 's provisional england squad at midweek , forcing him out of the game .
his replacement , clint dempsey nearly put fulham in front within minutes of entering , but saw his shot parried by the atletico keeper - and was subsequently called for offside .
as the match wore on , atletico began to dominate possession , but had little to show for it as they failed to put many shots on target .
extended play bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fulham picked up the pace in extra time the second half came to a close and the match entered extra time , but the spanish side 's control of the ball continued .
forlan and aguero nearly linked up for another go-ahead strike at the end of the first period , but this time it was the argentine on the end of the chance , and he pushed the ball wide .
fulham looked livelier in the second extra time , earning free kicks in dangerous positions through the enterprising runs of dempsey and gera , but it was atletico who tipped the game 's balance in their favor as the madrid side 's dynamic south american duo struck again to end the game .
the loss was a particularly bitter one for fulham 's goalkeeper , australia 's mark schwarzer .
in 2006 he had led middlesborough to the final of the uefa cup -lrb- the forerunner tournament to the europa league -rrb- , only to fall to sevilla .
" when you look at the goals , you 'll see how unlucky we were , " said schwarzer .
" we had the game in our hands , had our own chances , and hoped that would be enough .
but it did n't turn out that way . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 12.05.2010 brussels to unveil plans for tougher rules to protect euro großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels wants greater powers to protect the euro the european commission is to unveil a new strategy for avoiding crises like the one that has shaken greece and led to massive speculation on the value of the euro . european commission president jose manuel barroso and eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner olli rehn are expected wednesday to outline plans that include strengthening eu budget rules and economic surveillance in the 16-nation eurozone .
brussels believes germany 's tough debt-reduction measures , enshrined in the constitution , could be a model for other eu states .
in the wednesday edition of the german weekly , die zeit , rehn said brussels should have greater powers and be able to monitor the national budgets of eu nations .
he said regulations must be put in place to make this possible .
" we want governments to send their budget outlines to brussels for review before they are approved by their national parliaments , " rehn said .
" we can then see early whether a country is adhering to the stability and growth pact .
if not , we would intervene , " he said .
berlin has rejected such measures , however , saying it would impact on its budget sovereignty .
many eurozone nations in trouble - in particular greece , spain , and portugal - have accumulated budget deficits vastly exceeding the three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- permitted by the stability and growth pact .
the pact is meant to ensure the stability of the economic and monetary union .
german debt-trimming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehn favors the german debt-reduction model rehn also told die zeit that he believed germany 's plans for debt reduction could serve as a model for other eu nations .
in 2009 , berlin passed a constitutional amendment making it illegal for the federal government to run structural deficits more than 0.35 percent of gdp per annum from 2016 , while from 2020 , germany 's federal states will not be allowed to run any deficit at all .
germany this year is expected to reach a record debt of more than five percent of gdp , but has plans to start reducing this from 2011 .
greece , which has a crippling budget deficit of nearly 14 percent of national income , this month became the first eu nation to receive billions of euros in a rescue package to prevent it from defaulting on its debts .
" it does n't touch greece alone , " rehn said in brussels earlier this month .
" it has to do with the eurozone as a whole . "
the eu commission has warned nations to rein in their spending , including france and italy , which until now have held back from introducing unpopular budget cuts .
750-billion-euro package the economic turbulence in some eu nations has led speculators and investors to target the euro , which has in the past weeks fallen to its lowest levels against the us dollar in more than 14 months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commission chief wants greater control over national budgets eu finance ministers on monday announced a rescue package of up to 500 billion euros -lrb- $ 632 billion -rrb- to protect the euro , as market speculators increasingly targeted the currency and began betting on its collapse . the international monetary fund is to provide a further 250 billion euros .
" we will defend the stability of the euro at any price , " rehn said earlier monday .
meanwhile , in a rare interview , john taylor , a hedge fund speculator who made big profits in 1992 when speculators bet against the british pound , told bloomberg tv that a fall in the value of the euro was inevitable .
" the euro is a poor design and ca n't continue like this .
it 's quite easy to see that the euro will become much weaker , " taylor told bloomberg tv .
micheal leister , a strategist at the westlb bank in dusseldorf , said hedge fund speculators may well make big profits by betting on currency fluctuations , but that they alone couldn ’ t shake the euro .
" in times like this , when investors start panicking and liquidity is getting tight , one can make massive profits .
but the jury is still out on whether that is the cause of all the current troubles . " wl / dpa / afp / reuters editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

how will german film fare at the world 's most important movie market ?
dw spoke with mariette rissenbeek from the organization german film service + marketing . just 19 films are in the running for the coveted palme d 'or at this year 's cannes film festival 's main competition , but hundreds more features and dozens of shorts will be shown over the course of the festival , which runs through may 23 .
aside from the main competition - which generally highlights films by well-known directors - there are parallel selections .
these include " un certain regard , " a showcase for film from younger or more unusual directors , films shown out of competition , special screenings , and cannes classics , among others . there are also longstanding and independent festivals that run parallel to the official event , such as the highly regarded directors ' fortnight , organized by the association of french film directors . deutsche welle : ms. rissenbeek , over the years the cannes film festival has earned quite a reputation as a hub of hype , where seeing and being seen is of primary importance .
is the festival still meaningful in the world of film ? marianne rissenbeek : cannes is no doubt the most important festival for film - and the most important market for films - up to today .
i think it is still the leading film market .
and a lot of the films in the official program are rather author-driven .
so it 's not only about glitz and glamour , but about filmmaking . last year a german-language film " das weisse band " -lrb- " the white ribbon " -rrb- won the palme d 'or .
coming out after " the lives of others " won the oscar in 2007 , it seemed to signal a sort of renaissance in german art film .
this year , though , there is just one german film in competition - and in fact it is a german-ukrainian-dutch co-production - " my joy , " by sergei loznitsa .
are the tides turning for german film ? well , " my joy " is indeed a german production , which a german producer has developed .
he developed the script together with the director , so it 's not only a co-production with a financial commitment from germany .
there was creative input and engagement from germany .
i don ’ t think we feel neglected or ignored by the festival selection committee . bildunterschrift : germany 's offer in this year 's competition is ' my joy , ' a co-production with ukraine and the netherlands what else is germany showing at the festival , either out of competition , or on the sidelines as part of the un certain regard series , or as part of the directors ' fortnight ? in un certain regard there are two german films , one from christoph hochhaeusler , called " unter dir die stadt " -lrb- " the city below " -rrb- , and the other one , " life , above all , " is a production that was developed in germany .
even though the director , oliver schmitz , is south african-german , he has both nationalities .
and then in the directors ' fortnight there is a german film , " picco , " by philip koch .
so actually we feel there is quite a strong presence from germany . what are you most looking forward to seeing or experiencing at this year 's festival ? well of course , for us it is more important to see how german films will do .
it will be exciting to see how christoph hochhaeusler has developed - he was at cannes a few years ago with another film .
it will be interesting to see how his film is received this year .
and " picco , " by philip koch , is a first film , so that is exciting too .
it is very seldom that you gain access to cannes with your first film , and then to the directors ' fortnight … the film will get a lot of publicity , so that 's good . and then maybe you noticed that the directors ' cut of " the tin drum " by volker schloendorff will be shown , 30 years after it was premiered in cannes .
i look forward to seeing how audiences react to that . there are a lot of films from asia in competition this year - south korea , thailand , taiwan .
what do you make of that ?
does it indicate anything about the future of european versus asian film ? cannes always had an input from asia , there were always asian films in the program , from china , or taiwan … i do n't think it 's new .
this year maybe the films were more interesting from asia , so they chose more for competition , but i could n't really say if it means anything . we have organized screenings in the market of 28 films overall , many of which have already been premiered elsewhere .
they all have special attributes , so it 's hard to say which ones will be most successful . -lrb- … -rrb- it used to be that you were guaranteed a certain number of contracts if you came to cannes , but since the financial crisis two years ago , that 's not true anymore .

how will german film fare at the world 's most important movie market ?
dw spoke with mariette rissenbeek from the organization german film service + marketing . just 19 films are in the running for the coveted palme d 'or at this year 's cannes film festival 's main competition , but hundreds more features and dozens of shorts will be shown over the course of the festival , which runs through may 23 .
aside from the main competition - which generally highlights films by well-known directors - there are parallel selections .
these include " un certain regard , " a showcase for film from younger or more unusual directors , films shown out of competition , special screenings , and cannes classics , among others . there are also longstanding and independent festivals that run parallel to the official event , such as the highly regarded directors ' fortnight , organized by the association of french film directors . deutsche welle : ms. rissenbeek , over the years the cannes film festival has earned quite a reputation as a hub of hype , where seeing and being seen is of primary importance .
is the festival still meaningful in the world of film ? marianne rissenbeek : cannes is no doubt the most important festival for film - and the most important market for films - up to today .
i think it is still the leading film market .
and a lot of the films in the official program are rather author-driven .
so it 's not only about glitz and glamour , but about filmmaking . last year a german-language film " das weisse band " -lrb- " the white ribbon " -rrb- won the palme d 'or .
coming out after " the lives of others " won the oscar in 2007 , it seemed to signal a sort of renaissance in german art film .
this year , though , there is just one german film in competition - and in fact it is a german-ukrainian-dutch co-production - " my joy , " by sergei loznitsa .
are the tides turning for german film ? well , " my joy " is indeed a german production , which a german producer has developed .
he developed the script together with the director , so it 's not only a co-production with a financial commitment from germany .
there was creative input and engagement from germany .
i don ’ t think we feel neglected or ignored by the festival selection committee . bildunterschrift : germany 's offer in this year 's competition is ' my joy , ' a co-production with ukraine and the netherlands what else is germany showing at the festival , either out of competition , or on the sidelines as part of the un certain regard series , or as part of the directors ' fortnight ? in un certain regard there are two german films , one from christoph hochhaeusler , called " unter dir die stadt " -lrb- " the city below " -rrb- , and the other one , " life , above all , " is a production that was developed in germany .
even though the director , oliver schmitz , is south african-german , he has both nationalities .
and then in the directors ' fortnight there is a german film , " picco , " by philip koch .
so actually we feel there is quite a strong presence from germany . what are you most looking forward to seeing or experiencing at this year 's festival ? well of course , for us it is more important to see how german films will do .
it will be exciting to see how christoph hochhaeusler has developed - he was at cannes a few years ago with another film .
it will be interesting to see how his film is received this year .
and " picco , " by philip koch , is a first film , so that is exciting too .
it is very seldom that you gain access to cannes with your first film , and then to the directors ' fortnight … the film will get a lot of publicity , so that 's good . and then maybe you noticed that the directors ' cut of " the tin drum " by volker schloendorff will be shown , 30 years after it was premiered in cannes .
i look forward to seeing how audiences react to that . there are a lot of films from asia in competition this year - south korea , thailand , taiwan .
what do you make of that ?
does it indicate anything about the future of european versus asian film ? cannes always had an input from asia , there were always asian films in the program , from china , or taiwan … i do n't think it 's new .
this year maybe the films were more interesting from asia , so they chose more for competition , but i could n't really say if it means anything . we have organized screenings in the market of 28 films overall , many of which have already been premiered elsewhere .
they all have special attributes , so it 's hard to say which ones will be most successful . -lrb- … -rrb- it used to be that you were guaranteed a certain number of contracts if you came to cannes , but since the financial crisis two years ago , that 's not true anymore .
still , it is an important market . interview : jennifer abramsohn editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

brussels believes germany 's tough debt-reduction measures , enshrined in the constitution , could be a model for other eu states .
in the wednesday edition of the german weekly , die zeit , rehn said brussels should have greater powers and be able to monitor the national budgets of eu nations .
he said regulations must be put in place to make this possible .
" we want governments to send their budget outlines to brussels for review before they are approved by their national parliaments , " rehn said .
" we can then see early whether a country is adhering to the stability and growth pact .
if not , we would intervene , " he said .
berlin has rejected such measures , however , saying it would impact on its budget sovereignty .
many eurozone nations in trouble - in particular greece , spain , and portugal - have accumulated budget deficits vastly exceeding the three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- permitted by the stability and growth pact .
the pact is meant to ensure the stability of the economic and monetary union .
german debt-trimming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehn favors the german debt-reduction model rehn also told die zeit that he believed germany 's plans for debt reduction could serve as a model for other eu nations .
in 2009 , berlin passed a constitutional amendment making it illegal for the federal government to run structural deficits more than 0.35 percent of gdp per annum from 2016 , while from 2020 , germany 's federal states will not be allowed to run any deficit at all .
germany this year is expected to reach a record debt of more than five percent of gdp , but has plans to start reducing this from 2011 .
greece , which has a crippling budget deficit of nearly 14 percent of national income , this month became the first eu nation to receive billions of euros in a rescue package to prevent it from defaulting on its debts .
" it does n't touch greece alone , " rehn said in brussels earlier this month .
" it has to do with the eurozone as a whole . "
the eu commission has warned nations to rein in their spending , including france and italy , which until now have held back from introducing unpopular budget cuts .
750-billion-euro package the economic turbulence in some eu nations has led speculators and investors to target the euro , which has in the past weeks fallen to its lowest levels against the us dollar in more than 14 months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commission chief wants greater control over national budgets eu finance ministers on monday announced a rescue package of up to 500 billion euros -lrb- $ 632 billion -rrb- to protect the euro , as market speculators increasingly targeted the currency and began betting on its collapse . the international monetary fund is to provide a further 250 billion euros .
" we will defend the stability of the euro at any price , " rehn said earlier monday .
meanwhile , in a rare interview , john taylor , a hedge fund speculator who made big profits in 1992 when speculators bet against the british pound , told bloomberg tv that a fall in the value of the euro was inevitable .
" the euro is a poor design and ca n't continue like this .
it 's quite easy to see that the euro will become much weaker , " taylor told bloomberg tv .
micheal leister , a strategist at the westlb bank in dusseldorf , said hedge fund speculators may well make big profits by betting on currency fluctuations , but that they alone couldn ’ t shake the euro .

analyst forecasts had predicted growth would remain stagnant .
the federal statistics office in wiesbaden also revised 2009 figures for economic activity , saying it had expanded 0.2 percent in the last quarter of 2009 .
that put full-year contraction lower than expected : 4.9 percent , down from an earlier-reported 5.0 percent .
the statisticians attributed the slow gain in momentum overall in germany to an especially cold winter , which hampered construction activity .
exports and investments in industrial equipment had nonetheless provided engines for growth , the report said .

estonia is set to adopt the euro and plans to replace its currency , the kroon , on january 1 , 2011 .
the move would make the baltic country the 17th eurozone member . the european commission on wednesday said estonia 's economy is strong enough to join the euro zone .
estonia plans to switch to the shared european currency on january 1 , 2011 . the commission had examined estonia 's debt , deficit , inflation , and interest levels .
olli rehn , the eu commissioner for economic and budgetary affairs , said the country had achieved " a high degree of sustainable economic convergence " and was therefore ready to adopt the euro .
' prudent fiscal policy ' is key " to ensure that the adoption of the euro is a success , estonia must pursue its efforts to maintain a prudent fiscal policy stance , " he said .
he urged tallinn to " remain vigilant and react early and decisively " if problems emerge .
the commission 's positive assessment came in the wake of an enormous european bailout for greece , which shed new light on the importance of countries taking inflation-control measures .
countries are concerned that massive debt problems in the eurozone could make brussels wary of taking on a new member .
economic data adds up according to rehn , " the assessment and our proposal is also a strong signal about the euro area and to the eu more broadly , " testifying that sound economic policies such as those adopted by estonia " generate concrete results . "
estonia has had an average budget surplus of 1.8 percent of gross domestic product between 2002 to 2007 , deteriorating to a deficit of minus 2.7 percent in 2008 and minus 1.7 percent in 2009 as a result of the economic crisis .
that is still well within the eurozone 's threshold of 3 percent .
the brussels-based eu executive said the country 's " price performance -lsb- is -rsb- sustainable " as average inflation fell to minus 0.7 percent in the 12 months to march 2010 .
but it warned that " estonia " will need to remain vigilant to keep inflation at a low level . "
in order for estonia to be finally welcomed into the eurozone , wednesday 's approval will have to be confirmed by the eu 's finance ministers in july .

the win in hamburg was atletico 's first european trophy . the spanish capital 's perpetual bridesmaid club atletico madrid became the center of attention this wednesday , outlasting fulham in extra time and winning the inaugural europa league trophy .
diego forlan of uruguay scored both goals for atletico , and was set up on both occasions by his argentine strike partner sergio " kun " aguero .
four minutes from time in the second extra time period , forlan got a glancing heel to aguero 's cross from the left byline , which was enough to dribble in for a goal after a deflection off of defender brede hangeland 's thigh .
it was a scrappy ending to a scrappy game , but one which most observers , including atletico defender tomas ujfalusi , felt was deserved .
" we fought for 120 minutes , and got the goals we needed from our best player , " said the defender , who was returning to what was his home stadium for four years as a bundesliga player .
ujfalusi had never won a trophy in his career , which has taken him from olomouc in the czech republic to hamburg to florence to madrid , and was clearly moved after the match .
" it 's for moments like this that we play football .
it 's an unbelievable feeling , " he said .
bildunterschrift : fulham 's goalkeeper mark schwarzer was unlucky to lose his second european final the build-up the match did n't catch fire until the 32nd minute , and even then did n't do so with much elegance .
aguero scuffed his left-footed shot attempt from the edge of the penalty box .
luckily for him , though , forlan was streaking into the area just then , and stuck out his boot to one-time the ball for a 1-0 lead .
but the travelling fulham fans did n't have long to wait before their side had evened the score - in similarly disjointed fashion .
a slip from an atletico defender meant bobby zamora found himself free on the left wing , but a poor touch robbed him of the chance to shoot as he came inside .
zoltan gera , however , was in place to cross the ball back out to the wing , where simon davies was waiting and scored with a neat volley .
not long after halftime , fulham 's goal-scoring hero bobby zamora succumbed to the ankle injury that had kept him out of fabio capello 's provisional england squad at midweek , forcing him out of the game .
his replacement , clint dempsey nearly put fulham in front within minutes of entering , but saw his shot parried by the atletico keeper - and was subsequently called for offside .
as the match wore on , atletico began to dominate possession , but had little to show for it as they failed to put many shots on target .
extended play bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fulham picked up the pace in extra time the second half came to a close and the match entered extra time , but the spanish side 's control of the ball continued .
forlan and aguero nearly linked up for another go-ahead strike at the end of the first period , but this time it was the argentine on the end of the chance , and he pushed the ball wide .
fulham looked livelier in the second extra time , earning free kicks in dangerous positions through the enterprising runs of dempsey and gera , but it was atletico who tipped the game 's balance in their favor as the madrid side 's dynamic south american duo struck again to end the game .
the loss was a particularly bitter one for fulham 's goalkeeper , australia 's mark schwarzer .
in 2006 he had led middlesborough to the final of the uefa cup -lrb- the forerunner tournament to the europa league -rrb- , only to fall to sevilla .
" when you look at the goals , you 'll see how unlucky we were , " said schwarzer .
" we had the game in our hands , had our own chances , and hoped that would be enough .
but it did n't turn out that way . "

the win in hamburg was atletico 's first european trophy . the spanish capital 's perpetual bridesmaid club atletico madrid became the center of attention this wednesday , outlasting fulham in extra time and winning the inaugural europa league trophy .
diego forlan of uruguay scored both goals for atletico , and was set up on both occasions by his argentine strike partner sergio " kun " aguero .
four minutes from time in the second extra time period , forlan got a glancing heel to aguero 's cross from the left byline , which was enough to dribble in for a goal after a deflection off of defender brede hangeland 's thigh .
it was a scrappy ending to a scrappy game , but one which most observers , including atletico defender tomas ujfalusi , felt was deserved .
" we fought for 120 minutes , and got the goals we needed from our best player , " said the defender , who was returning to what was his home stadium for four years as a bundesliga player .
ujfalusi had never won a trophy in his career , which has taken him from olomouc in the czech republic to hamburg to florence to madrid , and was clearly moved after the match .
" it 's for moments like this that we play football .
it 's an unbelievable feeling , " he said .
bildunterschrift : fulham 's goalkeeper mark schwarzer was unlucky to lose his second european final the build-up the match did n't catch fire until the 32nd minute , and even then did n't do so with much elegance .
aguero scuffed his left-footed shot attempt from the edge of the penalty box .
luckily for him , though , forlan was streaking into the area just then , and stuck out his boot to one-time the ball for a 1-0 lead .
but the travelling fulham fans did n't have long to wait before their side had evened the score - in similarly disjointed fashion .
a slip from an atletico defender meant bobby zamora found himself free on the left wing , but a poor touch robbed him of the chance to shoot as he came inside .
zoltan gera , however , was in place to cross the ball back out to the wing , where simon davies was waiting and scored with a neat volley .
not long after halftime , fulham 's goal-scoring hero bobby zamora succumbed to the ankle injury that had kept him out of fabio capello 's provisional england squad at midweek , forcing him out of the game .
his replacement , clint dempsey nearly put fulham in front within minutes of entering , but saw his shot parried by the atletico keeper - and was subsequently called for offside .
as the match wore on , atletico began to dominate possession , but had little to show for it as they failed to put many shots on target .
extended play bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fulham picked up the pace in extra time the second half came to a close and the match entered extra time , but the spanish side 's control of the ball continued .
forlan and aguero nearly linked up for another go-ahead strike at the end of the first period , but this time it was the argentine on the end of the chance , and he pushed the ball wide .
fulham looked livelier in the second extra time , earning free kicks in dangerous positions through the enterprising runs of dempsey and gera , but it was atletico who tipped the game 's balance in their favor as the madrid side 's dynamic south american duo struck again to end the game .
the loss was a particularly bitter one for fulham 's goalkeeper , australia 's mark schwarzer .
in 2006 he had led middlesborough to the final of the uefa cup -lrb- the forerunner tournament to the europa league -rrb- , only to fall to sevilla .
" when you look at the goals , you 'll see how unlucky we were , " said schwarzer .
" we had the game in our hands , had our own chances , and hoped that would be enough .
but it did n't turn out that way . "

german chancellor angela merkel phoned david cameron on wednesday to congratulate him , and invited him to visit germany soon for more comprehensive talks , according to a government spokesman in berlin .
in brussels , european union officials hope the liberal democrats ' presence in the new coalition will soften the tories ' traditionally euroskeptic stance , and help quieten hardline backbenchers within the center-right party .
european commission president jose manuel barroso also congratulated david cameron , saying his government faced difficult choices in difficult times .
" what i hope is that the british prime minister will of course defend -lsb- his country 's -rsb- national interests in the european setting , " barroso told reporters in brussels , saying he was not concerned by conservative election manifesto pledges to claw back powers from brussels .
uncertain stance but no one in brussels is quite certain how far the new british government will go in defending its national interests , especially now that the liberal democrats form a part of its leadership .
as the country grapples with a runaway national debt and budget deficit , many in brussels believe that europe is not the top priority for the new conservative-led government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has the reputation of being a reluctant eu member " cameron has far too much on his plate to think about picking a fight with europe , " the european policy center 's -lrb- epc -rrb- acting director of studies , john wyles , told deutsche welle .
" and providing there is nothing major in the policy pipeline here -lsb- in brussels -rsb- , he is certainly not going to be looking for a fight . "
wyles also expects the conservatives and liberal democrats not to fight over european policy in the short term , partly because the liberal democrats have been sufficiently vague on the issue in their manifesto .
the message filtering through to brussels from london , according to wyles , is that david cameron 's approach will be entirely pragmatic on europe and relatively low key .
and so far , the new british government has signaled it will be ' business as usual ' as far as the european union is concerned .
conservatives remain a concern still , eu officials are keeping a watchful eye on britain 's new foreign secretary , william hague , who has been playing down policy differences over the european union within the new coalition .
hague did rule out further european integration for britain , telling reporters it was a " red line " for his party , but he focussed more on the agreements reached in negotiations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservatives have no plans to join the single european currency " the liberal democrats have readily agreed with us that it will not be the policy of this government to join the euro or to propose to join the euro in its lifetime , " former conservative party leader hague said .
" look , all british governments sometimes face difficulties over european policy . "
cameron pulled his conservatives out of the main center-right grouping in the european parliament , the european people 's party , because hardline conservatives deemed the group too pro-european .
but the epc 's john wyles believes that while this sounded some alarm bells in brussels , it 's unwise to over-analyze the decision .
" that was just a piece of red meat that -lsb- cameron -rsb- felt he needed to toss to the euroskeptic majority in order to get elected , " wyles said .
" it was not well judged , and it has created a lot of resentment against the conservatives among the center-right in europe , but they will get over that - i think many of them have largely got over it already . "
some in brussels even believe the conservatives will find their way back to the european people 's party , but john wyles said that this is an unlikely scenario .
he believes the new prime minister will have to strike a balance on europe - keeping hardline euroskeptics on board , while simultaneously staying sufficiently pragmatic to further britain 's interests on the continent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 12.05.2010 obama , karzai reaffirm commitment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president barack obama , right , shakes hands with afghan president hamid karzai us president barack obama has praised the " broad and deepening " us partnership with afghanistan and reaffirmed the us commitment to build a secure and stable afghanistan .
he was speaking following his talks with afghan president hamid karzai in washington . president obama said relations between the two governments were " strong " and would endure and that the tensions had been exaggerated . " with respect to perceived tensions between the us government and the afghan government , a lot of them were simply overstated , " said obama . he said the two sides renewed their goal to defeat al qaeda and its extremist allies . for his part , karzai told reporters that he had " frank and productive " discussions with president obama and the relations between the united states and afghanistan were much stronger now .
" we are much more strongly related to each other today than we ever were before . " he also said the us has committed to reducing civilian casualties in afghanistan , an issue that has strained their relations in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan 's president hamid karzai , left , and secretary of state hillary clinton reassurance to provide security in the first of a series of meetings , afghan president hamid karzai on tuesday met us secretary of state hillary clinton who reassured him that the us would remain committed to providing security in afghanistan even after us troops have left . " as we look toward a responsible , orderly transition in the international combat mission in afghanistan , we will not abandon the afghan people , " clinton said .
karzai , meanwhile , reiterated that his country would stick to its responsibility to further develop afghanistan 's civilian and democratic structures . the us commitment should serve as a reassurance to karzai , whose visit comes as relations between afghanistan and the west have cooled in recent months .
last month , following a visit by obama to kabul in late march , karzai slammed the un and the international community , accusing them of perpetrating a " vast fraud " in last year 's presidential elections as part of a conspiracy to undermine his victory .
he said western coalition troops risked being seen as invaders rather than saviours of his country .
while many observers put it down to an attempt by a politically weakened karzai to assert his legitimacy in afghanistan , the unusually harsh outburst sparked criticism in western capitals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us , nato and afghan forces are preparing for a major offensive in kandahar critical juncture " karzai 's visit to the us is highly significant .
it will help the us government show the political community in washington that it still has control over karzai .
it shows that karzai depends on the international community for his political survival .
and it also shows that the west has no viable alternative to karzai in afghanistan , " henning riecke , an analyst at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" from the afghan government point of view , this visit which takes place at a sensitive time , is extremely important , " waheed omar , karzai 's spokesman told reporters last week .
it comes amid a us military surge in afghanistan and ahead of a major offensive against militants in the southern afghan province of kandahar .
the talks in washington also take place amid mounting anger in afghanistan against rising civilian casualties and dwindling public support for the afghan mission in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say distinguishing between who 's moderate and who 's not in the taliban will be tricky tricky talks with the taliban a peace conference , or jirga , to forge a national consensus on how to reconcile with the taliban is to take place later this month in kabul .
the british newspaper the guardian reported recently that afghanistan is proposing to offer top taliban leaders exile if they agree to stop fighting against the government .
the newspaper refered to a document suggesting insurgent leaders could face " potential exile in a third country . "
it also calls for " deradicalisation " classes for insurgents and thousands of new manual jobs to be created for taliban fighters who lay down their arms .
plans to reach out to the taliban are n't now .
in a shift in strategy , most western nations now accept that any political solution to the afghanistan conflict must include moderate elements of the taliban .
earlier this year , german foreign minister guido westerwelle drummed up support for an " exit program " for taliban fighters funded by the international community .
but some point out that the country that finds it the hardest to embrace talks with the taliban is the us .
" the americans are ambivalent about bringing the taliban to the table due to their links with al qaeda .
it 's heightened after the botched bombing at times square , " fabrice pothier , head of carnegie europe , a forum for european policymakers and think-tanks , told deutsche welle . " any agreement with the taliban has to involve security guarantees on both sides - the taliban must sever links with al qaeda and the us must guarantee that taliban fighters wo n't be imprisoned or killed .
for the us president , justifying making a deal with the taliban is a hard sell at home . "
european involvement observers say that though european allies lack the political clout the us has in afghanistan , the talks in washington are being followed carefully across the atlantic .
" on hard political questions , europe is out of the picture in afghanistan .
we do n't have the same credibility as the us because we are n't taking the same risks as the us .
but at the same time , europe has a long-term interest in institution-building in afghanistan .
so the talks in the us remain important to europe 's future role -lrb- in afghanistan -rrb- , " pothier said .
many european governments are grappling with waning support at home for the war in afghanistan as troop casualties rise .
experts say it stands to reason that good ties between kabul and washington would help obama fulfill his pledge to start bringing us troops home in mid-2011 - and thus signal the way for an end in sight to the afghan engagement .
" when obama announced he would begin a partial withdrawal of troops in mid-2011 it was greeted with cheer in europe .
it was interpreted here as a possible end of the deployment .
but that 's not what it 's going to be .
we can expect some tough discussions and friction between the us and its european allies later in november this year when american generals review the success of the surge , " riecke said .
expert : west should rethink afghan policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising troop casualties have raised concerns in the west " western capitals keep making demands on kabul on corruption and governance .
but the fact is that much of the corruption is fuelled by international aid money .
the price per square meter of property in kabul is higher than in tokyo - it 's a bubble created by the west , " pothier said .
the expert pointed out that a host of events in afghanistan this year - the peace conference , a foreign donor nations meeting in july , parliamentary elections in september - offer a chance for the west to pursue a different script in afghanistan .
" the reality of the afghan state is that the western-backed karzai government in kabul has not percolated to the country 's provinces and districts .
karzai and his smart english-speaking ministers who travel the world have failed to deliver basic services to the majority of the afghan people , " porthier said .
" the west needs to take a hard look at what 's gone wrong and push for broader political change and reform in afghanistan . "

" he also said the us has committed to reducing civilian casualties in afghanistan , an issue that has strained their relations in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan 's president hamid karzai , left , and secretary of state hillary clinton reassurance to provide security in the first of a series of meetings , afghan president hamid karzai on tuesday met us secretary of state hillary clinton who reassured him that the us would remain committed to providing security in afghanistan even after us troops have left . " as we look toward a responsible , orderly transition in the international combat mission in afghanistan , we will not abandon the afghan people , " clinton said .
karzai , meanwhile , reiterated that his country would stick to its responsibility to further develop afghanistan 's civilian and democratic structures . the us commitment should serve as a reassurance to karzai , whose visit comes as relations between afghanistan and the west have cooled in recent months .
last month , following a visit by obama to kabul in late march , karzai slammed the un and the international community , accusing them of perpetrating a " vast fraud " in last year 's presidential elections as part of a conspiracy to undermine his victory .
he said western coalition troops risked being seen as invaders rather than saviours of his country .
while many observers put it down to an attempt by a politically weakened karzai to assert his legitimacy in afghanistan , the unusually harsh outburst sparked criticism in western capitals .

and it also shows that the west has no viable alternative to karzai in afghanistan , " henning riecke , an analyst at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" from the afghan government point of view , this visit which takes place at a sensitive time , is extremely important , " waheed omar , karzai 's spokesman told reporters last week .

the british newspaper the guardian reported recently that afghanistan is proposing to offer top taliban leaders exile if they agree to stop fighting against the government .
the newspaper refered to a document suggesting insurgent leaders could face " potential exile in a third country . "

many european governments are grappling with waning support at home for the war in afghanistan as troop casualties rise .
experts say it stands to reason that good ties between kabul and washington would help obama fulfill his pledge to start bringing us troops home in mid-2011 - and thus signal the way for an end in sight to the afghan engagement .

he was speaking following his talks with afghan president hamid karzai in washington . president obama said relations between the two governments were " strong " and would endure and that the tensions had been exaggerated . " with respect to perceived tensions between the us government and the afghan government , a lot of them were simply overstated , " said obama . he said the two sides renewed their goal to defeat al qaeda and its extremist allies . for his part , karzai told reporters that he had " frank and productive " discussions with president obama and the relations between the united states and afghanistan were much stronger now .
" we are much more strongly related to each other today than we ever were before . " he also said the us has committed to reducing civilian casualties in afghanistan , an issue that has strained their relations in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan 's president hamid karzai , left , and secretary of state hillary clinton reassurance to provide security in the first of a series of meetings , afghan president hamid karzai on tuesday met us secretary of state hillary clinton who reassured him that the us would remain committed to providing security in afghanistan even after us troops have left . " as we look toward a responsible , orderly transition in the international combat mission in afghanistan , we will not abandon the afghan people , " clinton said .
karzai , meanwhile , reiterated that his country would stick to its responsibility to further develop afghanistan 's civilian and democratic structures . the us commitment should serve as a reassurance to karzai , whose visit comes as relations between afghanistan and the west have cooled in recent months .
last month , following a visit by obama to kabul in late march , karzai slammed the un and the international community , accusing them of perpetrating a " vast fraud " in last year 's presidential elections as part of a conspiracy to undermine his victory .
he said western coalition troops risked being seen as invaders rather than saviours of his country .
while many observers put it down to an attempt by a politically weakened karzai to assert his legitimacy in afghanistan , the unusually harsh outburst sparked criticism in western capitals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us , nato and afghan forces are preparing for a major offensive in kandahar critical juncture " karzai 's visit to the us is highly significant .
it will help the us government show the political community in washington that it still has control over karzai .
it shows that karzai depends on the international community for his political survival .
and it also shows that the west has no viable alternative to karzai in afghanistan , " henning riecke , an analyst at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" from the afghan government point of view , this visit which takes place at a sensitive time , is extremely important , " waheed omar , karzai 's spokesman told reporters last week .
it comes amid a us military surge in afghanistan and ahead of a major offensive against militants in the southern afghan province of kandahar .
the talks in washington also take place amid mounting anger in afghanistan against rising civilian casualties and dwindling public support for the afghan mission in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say distinguishing between who 's moderate and who 's not in the taliban will be tricky tricky talks with the taliban a peace conference , or jirga , to forge a national consensus on how to reconcile with the taliban is to take place later this month in kabul .
the british newspaper the guardian reported recently that afghanistan is proposing to offer top taliban leaders exile if they agree to stop fighting against the government .
the newspaper refered to a document suggesting insurgent leaders could face " potential exile in a third country . "
it also calls for " deradicalisation " classes for insurgents and thousands of new manual jobs to be created for taliban fighters who lay down their arms .
plans to reach out to the taliban are n't now .
in a shift in strategy , most western nations now accept that any political solution to the afghanistan conflict must include moderate elements of the taliban .
earlier this year , german foreign minister guido westerwelle drummed up support for an " exit program " for taliban fighters funded by the international community .
but some point out that the country that finds it the hardest to embrace talks with the taliban is the us .
" the americans are ambivalent about bringing the taliban to the table due to their links with al qaeda .
it 's heightened after the botched bombing at times square , " fabrice pothier , head of carnegie europe , a forum for european policymakers and think-tanks , told deutsche welle . " any agreement with the taliban has to involve security guarantees on both sides - the taliban must sever links with al qaeda and the us must guarantee that taliban fighters wo n't be imprisoned or killed .
for the us president , justifying making a deal with the taliban is a hard sell at home . "
european involvement observers say that though european allies lack the political clout the us has in afghanistan , the talks in washington are being followed carefully across the atlantic .
" on hard political questions , europe is out of the picture in afghanistan .
we do n't have the same credibility as the us because we are n't taking the same risks as the us .
but at the same time , europe has a long-term interest in institution-building in afghanistan .
so the talks in the us remain important to europe 's future role -lrb- in afghanistan -rrb- , " pothier said .
many european governments are grappling with waning support at home for the war in afghanistan as troop casualties rise .
experts say it stands to reason that good ties between kabul and washington would help obama fulfill his pledge to start bringing us troops home in mid-2011 - and thus signal the way for an end in sight to the afghan engagement .
" when obama announced he would begin a partial withdrawal of troops in mid-2011 it was greeted with cheer in europe .
it was interpreted here as a possible end of the deployment .
but that 's not what it 's going to be .
we can expect some tough discussions and friction between the us and its european allies later in november this year when american generals review the success of the surge , " riecke said .
expert : west should rethink afghan policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising troop casualties have raised concerns in the west " western capitals keep making demands on kabul on corruption and governance .
but the fact is that much of the corruption is fuelled by international aid money .
the price per square meter of property in kabul is higher than in tokyo - it 's a bubble created by the west , " pothier said .
the expert pointed out that a host of events in afghanistan this year - the peace conference , a foreign donor nations meeting in july , parliamentary elections in september - offer a chance for the west to pursue a different script in afghanistan .
" the reality of the afghan state is that the western-backed karzai government in kabul has not percolated to the country 's provinces and districts .
karzai and his smart english-speaking ministers who travel the world have failed to deliver basic services to the majority of the afghan people , " porthier said .
" the west needs to take a hard look at what 's gone wrong and push for broader political change and reform in afghanistan . "

he was speaking following his talks with afghan president hamid karzai in washington . president obama said relations between the two governments were " strong " and would endure and that the tensions had been exaggerated . " with respect to perceived tensions between the us government and the afghan government , a lot of them were simply overstated , " said obama . he said the two sides renewed their goal to defeat al qaeda and its extremist allies . for his part , karzai told reporters that he had " frank and productive " discussions with president obama and the relations between the united states and afghanistan were much stronger now .
" we are much more strongly related to each other today than we ever were before . " he also said the us has committed to reducing civilian casualties in afghanistan , an issue that has strained their relations in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan 's president hamid karzai , left , and secretary of state hillary clinton reassurance to provide security in the first of a series of meetings , afghan president hamid karzai on tuesday met us secretary of state hillary clinton who reassured him that the us would remain committed to providing security in afghanistan even after us troops have left . " as we look toward a responsible , orderly transition in the international combat mission in afghanistan , we will not abandon the afghan people , " clinton said .
karzai , meanwhile , reiterated that his country would stick to its responsibility to further develop afghanistan 's civilian and democratic structures . the us commitment should serve as a reassurance to karzai , whose visit comes as relations between afghanistan and the west have cooled in recent months .
last month , following a visit by obama to kabul in late march , karzai slammed the un and the international community , accusing them of perpetrating a " vast fraud " in last year 's presidential elections as part of a conspiracy to undermine his victory .
he said western coalition troops risked being seen as invaders rather than saviours of his country .
while many observers put it down to an attempt by a politically weakened karzai to assert his legitimacy in afghanistan , the unusually harsh outburst sparked criticism in western capitals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us , nato and afghan forces are preparing for a major offensive in kandahar critical juncture " karzai 's visit to the us is highly significant .
it will help the us government show the political community in washington that it still has control over karzai .
it shows that karzai depends on the international community for his political survival .
and it also shows that the west has no viable alternative to karzai in afghanistan , " henning riecke , an analyst at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" from the afghan government point of view , this visit which takes place at a sensitive time , is extremely important , " waheed omar , karzai 's spokesman told reporters last week .
it comes amid a us military surge in afghanistan and ahead of a major offensive against militants in the southern afghan province of kandahar .
the talks in washington also take place amid mounting anger in afghanistan against rising civilian casualties and dwindling public support for the afghan mission in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say distinguishing between who 's moderate and who 's not in the taliban will be tricky tricky talks with the taliban a peace conference , or jirga , to forge a national consensus on how to reconcile with the taliban is to take place later this month in kabul .
the british newspaper the guardian reported recently that afghanistan is proposing to offer top taliban leaders exile if they agree to stop fighting against the government .
the newspaper refered to a document suggesting insurgent leaders could face " potential exile in a third country . "
it also calls for " deradicalisation " classes for insurgents and thousands of new manual jobs to be created for taliban fighters who lay down their arms .
plans to reach out to the taliban are n't now .
in a shift in strategy , most western nations now accept that any political solution to the afghanistan conflict must include moderate elements of the taliban .
earlier this year , german foreign minister guido westerwelle drummed up support for an " exit program " for taliban fighters funded by the international community .
but some point out that the country that finds it the hardest to embrace talks with the taliban is the us .
" the americans are ambivalent about bringing the taliban to the table due to their links with al qaeda .
it 's heightened after the botched bombing at times square , " fabrice pothier , head of carnegie europe , a forum for european policymakers and think-tanks , told deutsche welle . " any agreement with the taliban has to involve security guarantees on both sides - the taliban must sever links with al qaeda and the us must guarantee that taliban fighters wo n't be imprisoned or killed .
for the us president , justifying making a deal with the taliban is a hard sell at home . "
european involvement observers say that though european allies lack the political clout the us has in afghanistan , the talks in washington are being followed carefully across the atlantic .
" on hard political questions , europe is out of the picture in afghanistan .
we do n't have the same credibility as the us because we are n't taking the same risks as the us .
but at the same time , europe has a long-term interest in institution-building in afghanistan .
so the talks in the us remain important to europe 's future role -lrb- in afghanistan -rrb- , " pothier said .
many european governments are grappling with waning support at home for the war in afghanistan as troop casualties rise .
experts say it stands to reason that good ties between kabul and washington would help obama fulfill his pledge to start bringing us troops home in mid-2011 - and thus signal the way for an end in sight to the afghan engagement .
" when obama announced he would begin a partial withdrawal of troops in mid-2011 it was greeted with cheer in europe .
it was interpreted here as a possible end of the deployment .
but that 's not what it 's going to be .
we can expect some tough discussions and friction between the us and its european allies later in november this year when american generals review the success of the surge , " riecke said .
expert : west should rethink afghan policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising troop casualties have raised concerns in the west " western capitals keep making demands on kabul on corruption and governance .
but the fact is that much of the corruption is fuelled by international aid money .
the price per square meter of property in kabul is higher than in tokyo - it 's a bubble created by the west , " pothier said .
the expert pointed out that a host of events in afghanistan this year - the peace conference , a foreign donor nations meeting in july , parliamentary elections in september - offer a chance for the west to pursue a different script in afghanistan .
" the reality of the afghan state is that the western-backed karzai government in kabul has not percolated to the country 's provinces and districts .
karzai and his smart english-speaking ministers who travel the world have failed to deliver basic services to the majority of the afghan people , " porthier said .
" the west needs to take a hard look at what 's gone wrong and push for broader political change and reform in afghanistan . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de justice -pipe- 12.05.2010 european court ruling sparks german debate over violent criminals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's system of preventive detention has been criticized in strasbourg the european court of human rights has upheld a ruling that declared the preventive detention of an inmate in germany unlawful .
the decision has sparked a debate about how to protect the public from violent offenders . germany is under pressure to change its system of preventive detention , which allows for violent and repeat offenders to be detained indefinitely , even after they have served their sentence .
in december , the european court of human rights -lrb- echr -rrb- ruled that germany had violated the european human rights convention in the case of german inmate reinhard m. , who was convicted for attempted murder and had been kept in prison more than 10 years after his sentence .
the 52-year-old man had completed his five-year prison sentence in 1991 , but was not released , as he was deemed a danger to the public .
he was detained for the next 10 years , the maximum term for preventive detention at the time .
but a change in german legislation in 1998 meant that prisoners can now be detained indefinitely .
right to liberty the echr ruled that because reinhard m had been convicted before the change in the law in 1998 germany violated the ' right to liberty ' .
the court also stated that " there was no sufficient causal connection between his conviction and his continued deprivation of liberty . "
germany requested the case be referred to the echr 's grand chamber , which has now been refused , making the original court decision binding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 70 violent offenders in germany could benefit from the court ruling the echr can only tackle specific cases , but the ruling has already sparked a debate on how to protect the public from criminals convicted of murder , armed robbery , rape and other violent crimes .
" we need a comprehensive not an alarmist debate on the ramifications and options of today 's ruling -lsb- by the echr -rsb- , " justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger said in a statement on tuesday .
new framework the federal coalition agreement from last autumn calls for a reform of the current system , but the government has not released any details yet .
the bavarian justice minister , beate merk , however , has been vocal in calling for a complete overhaul of preventive detention in germany .
" a few band-aids here and there just will not do , " she said in a statement .
" we need a completely new system that can deal with violent offenders that are likely to reoffend and be a danger to the public even after they have served their sentence , " she added .
merk is adamant that some form of post-sentence detention is necessary , but she would like to see the sentence , ie the punishment , separated from the subsequent detention , with separate facilities and dedicated therapy options for violent criminals - one of the areas the echr had criticized as lacking in the current system .

" the law has been extended in the past because of an unsubstantiated fear of crime , at a time when crime rates are going down in germany , and i do n't believe there is a need for it at all , " hermann kuehn , an expert in criminal law who runs his own law firm , told deutsche welle .
he would like to see longer sentences handed down instead .
currently , the maximum sentence is 15 years , unless a defendant is sentenced to life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's constitutional court endorsed retroactive preventive detention in 2004 " we could extend the fixed-term punishments to give courts the opportunity for a longer prison sentence and then leave it to the court to release him earlier if he is no longer a danger to society , " kuehn said .
he believes the power to release a potentially dangerous person should remain with the court , however .
he argues that leaving violent criminals to medical authorities for preventive detention by separating punishment from detention could be dangerous if you rely on medical staff alone to determine whether or not a detainee is a danger to society .

the decision has sparked a debate about how to protect the public from violent offenders . germany is under pressure to change its system of preventive detention , which allows for violent and repeat offenders to be detained indefinitely , even after they have served their sentence .
in december , the european court of human rights -lrb- echr -rrb- ruled that germany had violated the european human rights convention in the case of german inmate reinhard m. , who was convicted for attempted murder and had been kept in prison more than 10 years after his sentence .
the 52-year-old man had completed his five-year prison sentence in 1991 , but was not released , as he was deemed a danger to the public .
he was detained for the next 10 years , the maximum term for preventive detention at the time .
but a change in german legislation in 1998 meant that prisoners can now be detained indefinitely .
right to liberty the echr ruled that because reinhard m had been convicted before the change in the law in 1998 germany violated the ' right to liberty ' .
the court also stated that " there was no sufficient causal connection between his conviction and his continued deprivation of liberty . "
germany requested the case be referred to the echr 's grand chamber , which has now been refused , making the original court decision binding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 70 violent offenders in germany could benefit from the court ruling the echr can only tackle specific cases , but the ruling has already sparked a debate on how to protect the public from criminals convicted of murder , armed robbery , rape and other violent crimes .
" we need a comprehensive not an alarmist debate on the ramifications and options of today 's ruling -lsb- by the echr -rsb- , " justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger said in a statement on tuesday .
new framework the federal coalition agreement from last autumn calls for a reform of the current system , but the government has not released any details yet .
the bavarian justice minister , beate merk , however , has been vocal in calling for a complete overhaul of preventive detention in germany .
" a few band-aids here and there just will not do , " she said in a statement .
" we need a completely new system that can deal with violent offenders that are likely to reoffend and be a danger to the public even after they have served their sentence , " she added .
merk is adamant that some form of post-sentence detention is necessary , but she would like to see the sentence , ie the punishment , separated from the subsequent detention , with separate facilities and dedicated therapy options for violent criminals - one of the areas the echr had criticized as lacking in the current system .
longer sentences but some legal experts believe preventive detention is not the answer .

in december , the european court of human rights -lrb- echr -rrb- ruled that germany had violated the european human rights convention in the case of german inmate reinhard m. , who was convicted for attempted murder and had been kept in prison more than 10 years after his sentence .
the 52-year-old man had completed his five-year prison sentence in 1991 , but was not released , as he was deemed a danger to the public .
he was detained for the next 10 years , the maximum term for preventive detention at the time .
but a change in german legislation in 1998 meant that prisoners can now be detained indefinitely .
right to liberty the echr ruled that because reinhard m had been convicted before the change in the law in 1998 germany violated the ' right to liberty ' .
the court also stated that " there was no sufficient causal connection between his conviction and his continued deprivation of liberty . "
germany requested the case be referred to the echr 's grand chamber , which has now been refused , making the original court decision binding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 70 violent offenders in germany could benefit from the court ruling the echr can only tackle specific cases , but the ruling has already sparked a debate on how to protect the public from criminals convicted of murder , armed robbery , rape and other violent crimes .
" we need a comprehensive not an alarmist debate on the ramifications and options of today 's ruling -lsb- by the echr -rsb- , " justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger said in a statement on tuesday .
new framework the federal coalition agreement from last autumn calls for a reform of the current system , but the government has not released any details yet .
the bavarian justice minister , beate merk , however , has been vocal in calling for a complete overhaul of preventive detention in germany .
" a few band-aids here and there just will not do , " she said in a statement .
" we need a completely new system that can deal with violent offenders that are likely to reoffend and be a danger to the public even after they have served their sentence , " she added .
merk is adamant that some form of post-sentence detention is necessary , but she would like to see the sentence , ie the punishment , separated from the subsequent detention , with separate facilities and dedicated therapy options for violent criminals - one of the areas the echr had criticized as lacking in the current system .
longer sentences but some legal experts believe preventive detention is not the answer .
" the law has been extended in the past because of an unsubstantiated fear of crime , at a time when crime rates are going down in germany , and i do n't believe there is a need for it at all , " hermann kuehn , an expert in criminal law who runs his own law firm , told deutsche welle .
he would like to see longer sentences handed down instead .
currently , the maximum sentence is 15 years , unless a defendant is sentenced to life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's constitutional court endorsed retroactive preventive detention in 2004 " we could extend the fixed-term punishments to give courts the opportunity for a longer prison sentence and then leave it to the court to release him earlier if he is no longer a danger to society , " kuehn said .
he believes the power to release a potentially dangerous person should remain with the court , however .
he argues that leaving violent criminals to medical authorities for preventive detention by separating punishment from detention could be dangerous if you rely on medical staff alone to determine whether or not a detainee is a danger to society .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europa league -pipe- 12.05.2010 atletico madrid downs fulham in hamburg to lift europa league trophy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego forlan bagged both goals for atletico uruguay 's diego forlan was the hero , netting two goals in the spanish side 's 2-1 extra time win over london side fulham .
the win in hamburg was atletico 's first european trophy . the spanish capital 's perpetual bridesmaid club atletico madrid became the center of attention this wednesday , outlasting fulham in extra time and winning the inaugural europa league trophy .
diego forlan of uruguay scored both goals for atletico , and was set up on both occasions by his argentine strike partner sergio " kun " aguero .
four minutes from time in the second extra time period , forlan got a glancing heel to aguero 's cross from the left byline , which was enough to dribble in for a goal after a deflection off of defender brede hangeland 's thigh .
it was a scrappy ending to a scrappy game , but one which most observers , including atletico defender tomas ujfalusi , felt was deserved .
" we fought for 120 minutes , and got the goals we needed from our best player , " said the defender , who was returning to what was his home stadium for four years as a bundesliga player .
ujfalusi had never won a trophy in his career , which has taken him from olomouc in the czech republic to hamburg to florence to madrid , and was clearly moved after the match .
" it 's for moments like this that we play football .
it 's an unbelievable feeling , " he said .
bildunterschrift : fulham 's goalkeeper mark schwarzer was unlucky to lose his second european final the build-up the match did n't catch fire until the 32nd minute , and even then did n't do so with much elegance .
aguero scuffed his left-footed shot attempt from the edge of the penalty box .
luckily for him , though , forlan was streaking into the area just then , and stuck out his boot to one-time the ball for a 1-0 lead .
but the travelling fulham fans did n't have long to wait before their side had evened the score - in similarly disjointed fashion .
a slip from an atletico defender meant bobby zamora found himself free on the left wing , but a poor touch robbed him of the chance to shoot as he came inside .
zoltan gera , however , was in place to cross the ball back out to the wing , where simon davies was waiting and scored with a neat volley .
not long after halftime , fulham 's goal-scoring hero bobby zamora succumbed to the ankle injury that had kept him out of fabio capello 's provisional england squad at midweek , forcing him out of the game .
his replacement , clint dempsey nearly put fulham in front within minutes of entering , but saw his shot parried by the atletico keeper - and was subsequently called for offside .
as the match wore on , atletico began to dominate possession , but had little to show for it as they failed to put many shots on target .
extended play bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fulham picked up the pace in extra time the second half came to a close and the match entered extra time , but the spanish side 's control of the ball continued .
forlan and aguero nearly linked up for another go-ahead strike at the end of the first period , but this time it was the argentine on the end of the chance , and he pushed the ball wide .
fulham looked livelier in the second extra time , earning free kicks in dangerous positions through the enterprising runs of dempsey and gera , but it was atletico who tipped the game 's balance in their favor as the madrid side 's dynamic south american duo struck again to end the game .
the loss was a particularly bitter one for fulham 's goalkeeper , australia 's mark schwarzer .
in 2006 he had led middlesborough to the final of the uefa cup -lrb- the forerunner tournament to the europa league -rrb- , only to fall to sevilla .
" when you look at the goals , you 'll see how unlucky we were , " said schwarzer .
" we had the game in our hands , had our own chances , and hoped that would be enough .
but it did n't turn out that way . "

the win in hamburg was atletico 's first european trophy . the spanish capital 's perpetual bridesmaid club atletico madrid became the center of attention this wednesday , outlasting fulham in extra time and winning the inaugural europa league trophy .
diego forlan of uruguay scored both goals for atletico , and was set up on both occasions by his argentine strike partner sergio " kun " aguero .
four minutes from time in the second extra time period , forlan got a glancing heel to aguero 's cross from the left byline , which was enough to dribble in for a goal after a deflection off of defender brede hangeland 's thigh .
it was a scrappy ending to a scrappy game , but one which most observers , including atletico defender tomas ujfalusi , felt was deserved .
" we fought for 120 minutes , and got the goals we needed from our best player , " said the defender , who was returning to what was his home stadium for four years as a bundesliga player .
ujfalusi had never won a trophy in his career , which has taken him from olomouc in the czech republic to hamburg to florence to madrid , and was clearly moved after the match .
" it 's for moments like this that we play football .
it 's an unbelievable feeling , " he said .
bildunterschrift : fulham 's goalkeeper mark schwarzer was unlucky to lose his second european final the build-up the match did n't catch fire until the 32nd minute , and even then did n't do so with much elegance .
aguero scuffed his left-footed shot attempt from the edge of the penalty box .
luckily for him , though , forlan was streaking into the area just then , and stuck out his boot to one-time the ball for a 1-0 lead .
but the travelling fulham fans did n't have long to wait before their side had evened the score - in similarly disjointed fashion .
a slip from an atletico defender meant bobby zamora found himself free on the left wing , but a poor touch robbed him of the chance to shoot as he came inside .
zoltan gera , however , was in place to cross the ball back out to the wing , where simon davies was waiting and scored with a neat volley .
not long after halftime , fulham 's goal-scoring hero bobby zamora succumbed to the ankle injury that had kept him out of fabio capello 's provisional england squad at midweek , forcing him out of the game .
his replacement , clint dempsey nearly put fulham in front within minutes of entering , but saw his shot parried by the atletico keeper - and was subsequently called for offside .
as the match wore on , atletico began to dominate possession , but had little to show for it as they failed to put many shots on target .
extended play bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fulham picked up the pace in extra time the second half came to a close and the match entered extra time , but the spanish side 's control of the ball continued .
forlan and aguero nearly linked up for another go-ahead strike at the end of the first period , but this time it was the argentine on the end of the chance , and he pushed the ball wide .
fulham looked livelier in the second extra time , earning free kicks in dangerous positions through the enterprising runs of dempsey and gera , but it was atletico who tipped the game 's balance in their favor as the madrid side 's dynamic south american duo struck again to end the game .
the loss was a particularly bitter one for fulham 's goalkeeper , australia 's mark schwarzer .
in 2006 he had led middlesborough to the final of the uefa cup -lrb- the forerunner tournament to the europa league -rrb- , only to fall to sevilla .
" when you look at the goals , you 'll see how unlucky we were , " said schwarzer .
" we had the game in our hands , had our own chances , and hoped that would be enough .
but it did n't turn out that way . "

ecb president jean-claude trichet claims he had no other option . credibility is sacred to powerful monetary watchdogs like the us federal reserve , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- and germany 's bundesbank .
it 's something precious , central bankers are quick to admit , that is hard to earn but easy to lose .
perhaps no one knows that better than jean-claude trichet , an architect of the euro who oversaw the french central bank 's deliverance from political control in the 1990s .
the ecb president is waging the battle of his career to preserve the reputation of the bank , which he and his predecessor , former dutch central banker and european monetary institute president wim duisenberg , helped build .
the outcome is all but clear .
an unprecedented move to rescue the euro trichet has been under fire ever since eurozone finance ministers agreed over the weekend to launch an unprecedented aid package worth 750 billion euros -lrb- $ 1 trillion -rrb- .
the scheme is designed to rescue the euro as the effects of the greek fiscal crisis spill over into other indebted nations in the eurozone .
in a nutshell , it allows the ecb to buy government bonds issued by eurozone nations in financial trouble .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb president trichet is hearing plenty of criticism about the bank 's euro rescue move analysts argue the move has comprised the central bank 's independence ; the bank would effectively be buying government debt , giving governments a freer hand in raising money when it should actually be policing their efforts to do so .
trichet has vigorously defended the move .
at a press conference in basel , he said the central bank 's monetary policy was " hampered " and that a number of markets were " dysfunctional . "
and with an eye to critics , he said that the central bank has always been and will always be " fiercely and totally independent . "
critics , indeed , are in no short supply .
numerous monetary experts accuse the ecb 's 22-member council of bowing to political pressure from the european union and the 16 eurozone nations .
" significant stability risks " among the more outspoken and high-profile critics is bundesbank president alex weber , who is a leading candidate to succeed trichet next year .
in an interview with germany 's boersen zeitung , weber said that the purchase of government bonds " poses significant stability risks . "
he criticized the ecb council 's decision " even in this extraordinary situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans want the euro to remain a strong currency in a message to investors , david zervos , managing director of jefferies & co investment bank in new york , said that for all the attempts by the ecb to remain independent , it was unable " to push back on the eu power base in a crisis period . "
zervos warned that this development could make the eurozone " far less stable in any crisis times than a traditional national union . "
trichet realizes that ecb 's credibility is tightly linked to the bank 's independence and that any u-turns could soften the euro .
he knows all too well that if there 's anything europeans do n't want - especially many germans who still mourn the loss of their beloved deutschmark - it is a weak , suffering currency .
citizens of euro nations have every reason to be concerned : tuesday saw the euro retreat against the dollar as euphoria over the massive eurozone bailout announced on monday gave way to continuing doubts over the ability of euro nations to reduce their deficits .

and with an eye to critics , he said that the central bank has always been and will always be " fiercely and totally independent . "
critics , indeed , are in no short supply .
numerous monetary experts accuse the ecb 's 22-member council of bowing to political pressure from the european union and the 16 eurozone nations .
" significant stability risks " among the more outspoken and high-profile critics is bundesbank president alex weber , who is a leading candidate to succeed trichet next year .
in an interview with germany 's boersen zeitung , weber said that the purchase of government bonds " poses significant stability risks . "
he criticized the ecb council 's decision " even in this extraordinary situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans want the euro to remain a strong currency in a message to investors , david zervos , managing director of jefferies & co investment bank in new york , said that for all the attempts by the ecb to remain independent , it was unable " to push back on the eu power base in a crisis period . "
zervos warned that this development could make the eurozone " far less stable in any crisis times than a traditional national union . "
trichet realizes that ecb 's credibility is tightly linked to the bank 's independence and that any u-turns could soften the euro .
he knows all too well that if there 's anything europeans do n't want - especially many germans who still mourn the loss of their beloved deutschmark - it is a weak , suffering currency .
citizens of euro nations have every reason to be concerned : tuesday saw the euro retreat against the dollar as euphoria over the massive eurozone bailout announced on monday gave way to continuing doubts over the ability of euro nations to reduce their deficits .

ecb president jean-claude trichet claims he had no other option . credibility is sacred to powerful monetary watchdogs like the us federal reserve , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- and germany 's bundesbank .
it 's something precious , central bankers are quick to admit , that is hard to earn but easy to lose .
perhaps no one knows that better than jean-claude trichet , an architect of the euro who oversaw the french central bank 's deliverance from political control in the 1990s .
the ecb president is waging the battle of his career to preserve the reputation of the bank , which he and his predecessor , former dutch central banker and european monetary institute president wim duisenberg , helped build .
the outcome is all but clear .
an unprecedented move to rescue the euro trichet has been under fire ever since eurozone finance ministers agreed over the weekend to launch an unprecedented aid package worth 750 billion euros -lrb- $ 1 trillion -rrb- .
the scheme is designed to rescue the euro as the effects of the greek fiscal crisis spill over into other indebted nations in the eurozone .
in a nutshell , it allows the ecb to buy government bonds issued by eurozone nations in financial trouble .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb president trichet is hearing plenty of criticism about the bank 's euro rescue move analysts argue the move has comprised the central bank 's independence ; the bank would effectively be buying government debt , giving governments a freer hand in raising money when it should actually be policing their efforts to do so .

more than 700 representatives have attended the 12th asia-pacific conference of german business in singapore . at the asia-pacific conference two years ago , juergen hambrecht , the chairman of the asia-pacific committee of german business complained that only ten percent of german exports went to asia .
but the percentage has increased in the meantime : " the numbers have , of course , changed tremendously during the crisis , but one thing is clear : asia has remained calm , " says hambrecht .
" the exports to asia have clearly not decreased , compared to the average .
actually , since the last asia-pacific conference , there has been an increase from ten to over 16 percent . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singapore will host the asia-pacific conference of german business from may 13-15 juergen hambrecht is also the chairman of basf , the world 's largest chemical company , located in ludwigshafen .
in the 1990s he served as the head of basf 's east asia operations in hong kong and has since remained a fan of asia . germany in asia the asian development bank predicts asia 's economy will grow 7.5 percent this year .
as an exporting nation , the german economy is well positioned in asia , juergen hambrecht believes .
german machinery , automobiles and chemical products enjoy a good reputation .
but above all , german innovations have great prospects there and promise sustainable growth : " for example , energy-efficient construction , electric vehicles , lightweight materials for cars , light materials for other devices , for household appliances , simply as a whole : resource-efficient products , " he says . china and india have also recognized that growth at the expense of the environment will not be sustainable and that renewable energy and greater energy efficiency are crucial .
with its leading environmental technology , german industry can be an ideal partner for them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers producing volkswagen jetta at a plant in changchun , china not optimal conditions despite the potential , german business in asia has not been optimal .
companies complain about protectionism , especially in china , which has intensified since the crisis .
juergen hambrecht also mentions different industrial standards , especially in china . another obstacle is the lack of protection of intellectual property .
but hambrecht dismisses the widespread prejudice : " the major allegation was that a lot of plagiarism was happening in china which is not at all true , " he says .
" intellectual property is an issue worldwide and not just in china .
china has learned that intellectual property is valuable and it is quite interesting that most patents are filed today in china . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens staff in their training centre in singapore gradual change despite the progress in this area , china remains a difficult partner politically .
juergen hambrecht is , however , committed to the policy of " change through trade " : " we would like vietnam or china tomorrow to look like germany today .
and that is not going to be possible .
it was a very long process for us too and every country has to go through this process .
if we are able to move forward with our trade or even local production this can be the strongest impetus for change . " most of the some 4,000 german companies currently active in china would probably agree .
around 2000 companies from germany have invested in india .
even in other asian countries , many medium and small-sized german companies are trying their luck . author : danhong zhang / du editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the win in hamburg was atletico 's first european trophy . the spanish capital 's perpetual bridesmaid club atletico madrid became the center of attention this wednesday , outlasting fulham in extra time and winning the inaugural europa league trophy .
diego forlan of uruguay scored both goals for atletico , and was set up on both occasions by his argentine strike partner sergio " kun " aguero .
four minutes from time in the second extra time period , forlan got a glancing heel to aguero 's cross from the left byline , which was enough to dribble in for a goal after a deflection off of defender brede hangeland 's thigh .
it was a scrappy ending to a scrappy game , but one which most observers , including atletico defender tomas ujfalusi , felt was deserved .
" we fought for 120 minutes , and got the goals we needed from our best player , " said the defender , who was returning to what was his home stadium for four years as a bundesliga player .
ujfalusi had never won a trophy in his career , which has taken him from olomouc in the czech republic to hamburg to florence to madrid , and was clearly moved after the match .
" it 's for moments like this that we play football .
it 's an unbelievable feeling , " he said .
bildunterschrift : fulham 's goalkeeper mark schwarzer was unlucky to lose his second european final the build-up the match did n't catch fire until the 32nd minute , and even then did n't do so with much elegance .
aguero scuffed his left-footed shot attempt from the edge of the penalty box .
luckily for him , though , forlan was streaking into the area just then , and stuck out his boot to one-time the ball for a 1-0 lead .
but the travelling fulham fans did n't have long to wait before their side had evened the score - in similarly disjointed fashion .
a slip from an atletico defender meant bobby zamora found himself free on the left wing , but a poor touch robbed him of the chance to shoot as he came inside .
zoltan gera , however , was in place to cross the ball back out to the wing , where simon davies was waiting and scored with a neat volley .
not long after halftime , fulham 's goal-scoring hero bobby zamora succumbed to the ankle injury that had kept him out of fabio capello 's provisional england squad at midweek , forcing him out of the game .
his replacement , clint dempsey nearly put fulham in front within minutes of entering , but saw his shot parried by the atletico keeper - and was subsequently called for offside .
as the match wore on , atletico began to dominate possession , but had little to show for it as they failed to put many shots on target .
extended play bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fulham picked up the pace in extra time the second half came to a close and the match entered extra time , but the spanish side 's control of the ball continued .
forlan and aguero nearly linked up for another go-ahead strike at the end of the first period , but this time it was the argentine on the end of the chance , and he pushed the ball wide .
fulham looked livelier in the second extra time , earning free kicks in dangerous positions through the enterprising runs of dempsey and gera , but it was atletico who tipped the game 's balance in their favor as the madrid side 's dynamic south american duo struck again to end the game .
the loss was a particularly bitter one for fulham 's goalkeeper , australia 's mark schwarzer .
in 2006 he had led middlesborough to the final of the uefa cup -lrb- the forerunner tournament to the europa league -rrb- , only to fall to sevilla .
" when you look at the goals , you 'll see how unlucky we were , " said schwarzer .
" we had the game in our hands , had our own chances , and hoped that would be enough .
but it did n't turn out that way . "

german chancellor angela merkel says its a good first step , but others say it goes too far . the european commission proposed that member countries submit their national budgets to brussels for " peer review " before they are sent on to their national parliaments .
" the package concerns the whole eu , but this specific proposal has more bite concerning the euro area countries , " european economic and monetary affairs commissioner olli rehn told reporters at a press conference in brussels .
the rules are aimed at avoiding a repeat of the greek debt crisis by preventing countries from over-spending .
the measures would apply to all members of the eu , not just the 16 nations that use the euro currency .
but many nations feel the eu is over-stepping its bounds by interfering in domestic politics .
france and sweden have both voiced their opposition to the measures . " that this should concern all countries is something we find a little strange , " swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt told a press conference in stockholm .
" this kind of discussion could perhaps be possible for -lrb- countries -rrb- with a budget policy that goes against the stability and growth pact , " he said . mixed message from berlin germany 's foreign minister , guido westerwelle , spoke out against the eu commission 's proposal , saying that national budgets belong to " the core of sovereignty . "
" the budget law is a matter of national parliaments .
the european commission does not determine the budget , that is the job of the german bundestag , the national parliament , " westerwelle told reporters in berlin .
however , chancellor angela merkel praised the eu 's attempts to crackdown on irresponsible spending , and said the budget measures did not necessarily usurp the powers of national parliaments . " i would say that the budgetary plans of the member states are not secret anyway , so the commission can already form an opinion about what governments put forward during budgetary debates , " merkel told reporters in berlin . sanctions possible european commission president jose manuel barosso was clear that he believed a unifying economic policy was inevitable for the euro 's survival .
" member states should have the courage to say whether they do want an economic union or not , because if they do not we better forget about a monetary union , " barosso said . bildunterschrift : the commission also threatened sanctions against countries that consistently breach the stability and growth pact , which stipulates that no country should run deficits higher than three per cent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
" let 's be clear - without sanctions it will not be enough for credibility , " he said .
barosso has said that cohesion funds could be withdrawn for countries that do n't comply , however , eurozone finance ministers would have to vote to approve any possible sanctions the eurozone is under pressure to strengthen its economic governance , after member state greece was forced to request 110 billion euros -lrb- $ 140-billion -rrb- from the eurozone countries and the imf to avoid defaulting on its debt. smh / afp / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german chancellor angela merkel says its a good first step , but others say it goes too far . the european commission proposed that member countries submit their national budgets to brussels for " peer review " before they are sent on to their national parliaments .
" the package concerns the whole eu , but this specific proposal has more bite concerning the euro area countries , " european economic and monetary affairs commissioner olli rehn told reporters at a press conference in brussels .
the rules are aimed at avoiding a repeat of the greek debt crisis by preventing countries from over-spending .
the measures would apply to all members of the eu , not just the 16 nations that use the euro currency .
but many nations feel the eu is over-stepping its bounds by interfering in domestic politics .
france and sweden have both voiced their opposition to the measures . " that this should concern all countries is something we find a little strange , " swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt told a press conference in stockholm .
" this kind of discussion could perhaps be possible for -lrb- countries -rrb- with a budget policy that goes against the stability and growth pact , " he said . mixed message from berlin germany 's foreign minister , guido westerwelle , spoke out against the eu commission 's proposal , saying that national budgets belong to " the core of sovereignty . "
" the budget law is a matter of national parliaments .
the european commission does not determine the budget , that is the job of the german bundestag , the national parliament , " westerwelle told reporters in berlin .
however , chancellor angela merkel praised the eu 's attempts to crackdown on irresponsible spending , and said the budget measures did not necessarily usurp the powers of national parliaments . " i would say that the budgetary plans of the member states are not secret anyway , so the commission can already form an opinion about what governments put forward during budgetary debates , " merkel told reporters in berlin . sanctions possible european commission president jose manuel barosso was clear that he believed a unifying economic policy was inevitable for the euro 's survival .
" member states should have the courage to say whether they do want an economic union or not , because if they do not we better forget about a monetary union , " barosso said . bildunterschrift : the commission also threatened sanctions against countries that consistently breach the stability and growth pact , which stipulates that no country should run deficits higher than three per cent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
" let 's be clear - without sanctions it will not be enough for credibility , " he said .
barosso has said that cohesion funds could be withdrawn for countries that do n't comply , however , eurozone finance ministers would have to vote to approve any possible sanctions the eurozone is under pressure to strengthen its economic governance , after member state greece was forced to request 110 billion euros -lrb- $ 140-billion -rrb- from the eurozone countries and the imf to avoid defaulting on its debt. smh / afp / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decision has sparked a debate about how to protect the public from violent offenders . germany is under pressure to change its system of preventive detention , which allows for violent and repeat offenders to be detained indefinitely , even after they have served their sentence .
in december , the european court of human rights -lrb- echr -rrb- ruled that germany had violated the european human rights convention in the case of german inmate reinhard m. , who was convicted for attempted murder and had been kept in prison more than 10 years after his sentence .
the 52-year-old man had completed his five-year prison sentence in 1991 , but was not released , as he was deemed a danger to the public .
he was detained for the next 10 years , the maximum term for preventive detention at the time .
but a change in german legislation in 1998 meant that prisoners can now be detained indefinitely .
right to liberty the echr ruled that because reinhard m had been convicted before the change in the law in 1998 germany violated the ' right to liberty ' .
the court also stated that " there was no sufficient causal connection between his conviction and his continued deprivation of liberty . "
germany requested the case be referred to the echr 's grand chamber , which has now been refused , making the original court decision binding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 70 violent offenders in germany could benefit from the court ruling the echr can only tackle specific cases , but the ruling has already sparked a debate on how to protect the public from criminals convicted of murder , armed robbery , rape and other violent crimes .
" we need a comprehensive not an alarmist debate on the ramifications and options of today 's ruling -lsb- by the echr -rsb- , " justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger said in a statement on tuesday .
new framework the federal coalition agreement from last autumn calls for a reform of the current system , but the government has not released any details yet .
the bavarian justice minister , beate merk , however , has been vocal in calling for a complete overhaul of preventive detention in germany .
" a few band-aids here and there just will not do , " she said in a statement .
" we need a completely new system that can deal with violent offenders that are likely to reoffend and be a danger to the public even after they have served their sentence , " she added .
merk is adamant that some form of post-sentence detention is necessary , but she would like to see the sentence , ie the punishment , separated from the subsequent detention , with separate facilities and dedicated therapy options for violent criminals - one of the areas the echr had criticized as lacking in the current system .
longer sentences but some legal experts believe preventive detention is not the answer .
" the law has been extended in the past because of an unsubstantiated fear of crime , at a time when crime rates are going down in germany , and i do n't believe there is a need for it at all , " hermann kuehn , an expert in criminal law who runs his own law firm , told deutsche welle .
he would like to see longer sentences handed down instead .
currently , the maximum sentence is 15 years , unless a defendant is sentenced to life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's constitutional court endorsed retroactive preventive detention in 2004 " we could extend the fixed-term punishments to give courts the opportunity for a longer prison sentence and then leave it to the court to release him earlier if he is no longer a danger to society , " kuehn said .
he believes the power to release a potentially dangerous person should remain with the court , however .
he argues that leaving violent criminals to medical authorities for preventive detention by separating punishment from detention could be dangerous if you rely on medical staff alone to determine whether or not a detainee is a danger to society .

estonia is set to adopt the euro and plans to replace its currency , the kroon , on january 1 , 2011 .
the move would make the baltic country the 17th eurozone member . the european commission on wednesday said estonia 's economy is strong enough to join the euro zone .
estonia plans to switch to the shared european currency on january 1 , 2011 . the commission had examined estonia 's debt , deficit , inflation , and interest levels .
olli rehn , the eu commissioner for economic and budgetary affairs , said the country had achieved " a high degree of sustainable economic convergence " and was therefore ready to adopt the euro .
' prudent fiscal policy ' is key " to ensure that the adoption of the euro is a success , estonia must pursue its efforts to maintain a prudent fiscal policy stance , " he said .
he urged tallinn to " remain vigilant and react early and decisively " if problems emerge .
the commission 's positive assessment came in the wake of an enormous european bailout for greece , which shed new light on the importance of countries taking inflation-control measures .
countries are concerned that massive debt problems in the eurozone could make brussels wary of taking on a new member .
economic data adds up according to rehn , " the assessment and our proposal is also a strong signal about the euro area and to the eu more broadly , " testifying that sound economic policies such as those adopted by estonia " generate concrete results . "
estonia has had an average budget surplus of 1.8 percent of gross domestic product between 2002 to 2007 , deteriorating to a deficit of minus 2.7 percent in 2008 and minus 1.7 percent in 2009 as a result of the economic crisis .
that is still well within the eurozone 's threshold of 3 percent .
the brussels-based eu executive said the country 's " price performance -lsb- is -rsb- sustainable " as average inflation fell to minus 0.7 percent in the 12 months to march 2010 .
but it warned that " estonia " will need to remain vigilant to keep inflation at a low level . "
in order for estonia to be finally welcomed into the eurozone , wednesday 's approval will have to be confirmed by the eu 's finance ministers in july .
so far , no positive recommendation by the commission on eurozone enlargement has ever been contradicted by eu member states .
estonia shifted rapidly from a communist command economy to the free market after breaking from the crumbling soviet bloc in 1991 .
the 1.3-million-strong country had hoped to adopt the euro in 2007 , but failed to meet the inflation-control criteria at the time. jen / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

brussels believes germany 's tough debt-reduction measures , enshrined in the constitution , could be a model for other eu states .
in the wednesday edition of the german weekly , die zeit , rehn said brussels should have greater powers and be able to monitor the national budgets of eu nations .
he said regulations must be put in place to make this possible .
" we want governments to send their budget outlines to brussels for review before they are approved by their national parliaments , " rehn said .
" we can then see early whether a country is adhering to the stability and growth pact .
if not , we would intervene , " he said .
berlin has rejected such measures , however , saying it would impact on its budget sovereignty .
many eurozone nations in trouble - in particular greece , spain , and portugal - have accumulated budget deficits vastly exceeding the three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- permitted by the stability and growth pact .
the pact is meant to ensure the stability of the economic and monetary union .
german debt-trimming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehn favors the german debt-reduction model rehn also told die zeit that he believed germany 's plans for debt reduction could serve as a model for other eu nations .
in 2009 , berlin passed a constitutional amendment making it illegal for the federal government to run structural deficits more than 0.35 percent of gdp per annum from 2016 , while from 2020 , germany 's federal states will not be allowed to run any deficit at all .
germany this year is expected to reach a record debt of more than five percent of gdp , but has plans to start reducing this from 2011 .
greece , which has a crippling budget deficit of nearly 14 percent of national income , this month became the first eu nation to receive billions of euros in a rescue package to prevent it from defaulting on its debts .
" it does n't touch greece alone , " rehn said in brussels earlier this month .
" it has to do with the eurozone as a whole . "
the eu commission has warned nations to rein in their spending , including france and italy , which until now have held back from introducing unpopular budget cuts .
750-billion-euro package the economic turbulence in some eu nations has led speculators and investors to target the euro , which has in the past weeks fallen to its lowest levels against the us dollar in more than 14 months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commission chief wants greater control over national budgets eu finance ministers on monday announced a rescue package of up to 500 billion euros -lrb- $ 632 billion -rrb- to protect the euro , as market speculators increasingly targeted the currency and began betting on its collapse . the international monetary fund is to provide a further 250 billion euros .
" we will defend the stability of the euro at any price , " rehn said earlier monday .
meanwhile , in a rare interview , john taylor , a hedge fund speculator who made big profits in 1992 when speculators bet against the british pound , told bloomberg tv that a fall in the value of the euro was inevitable .
" the euro is a poor design and ca n't continue like this .
it 's quite easy to see that the euro will become much weaker , " taylor told bloomberg tv .

german chancellor angela merkel phoned david cameron on wednesday to congratulate him , and invited him to visit germany soon for more comprehensive talks , according to a government spokesman in berlin .
in brussels , european union officials hope the liberal democrats ' presence in the new coalition will soften the tories ' traditionally euroskeptic stance , and help quieten hardline backbenchers within the center-right party .
european commission president jose manuel barroso also congratulated david cameron , saying his government faced difficult choices in difficult times .
" what i hope is that the british prime minister will of course defend -lsb- his country 's -rsb- national interests in the european setting , " barroso told reporters in brussels , saying he was not concerned by conservative election manifesto pledges to claw back powers from brussels .
uncertain stance but no one in brussels is quite certain how far the new british government will go in defending its national interests , especially now that the liberal democrats form a part of its leadership .
as the country grapples with a runaway national debt and budget deficit , many in brussels believe that europe is not the top priority for the new conservative-led government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has the reputation of being a reluctant eu member " cameron has far too much on his plate to think about picking a fight with europe , " the european policy center 's -lrb- epc -rrb- acting director of studies , john wyles , told deutsche welle .
" and providing there is nothing major in the policy pipeline here -lsb- in brussels -rsb- , he is certainly not going to be looking for a fight . "
wyles also expects the conservatives and liberal democrats not to fight over european policy in the short term , partly because the liberal democrats have been sufficiently vague on the issue in their manifesto .
the message filtering through to brussels from london , according to wyles , is that david cameron 's approach will be entirely pragmatic on europe and relatively low key .
and so far , the new british government has signaled it will be ' business as usual ' as far as the european union is concerned .
conservatives remain a concern still , eu officials are keeping a watchful eye on britain 's new foreign secretary , william hague , who has been playing down policy differences over the european union within the new coalition .
hague did rule out further european integration for britain , telling reporters it was a " red line " for his party , but he focussed more on the agreements reached in negotiations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservatives have no plans to join the single european currency " the liberal democrats have readily agreed with us that it will not be the policy of this government to join the euro or to propose to join the euro in its lifetime , " former conservative party leader hague said .
" look , all british governments sometimes face difficulties over european policy . "
cameron pulled his conservatives out of the main center-right grouping in the european parliament , the european people 's party , because hardline conservatives deemed the group too pro-european .
but the epc 's john wyles believes that while this sounded some alarm bells in brussels , it 's unwise to over-analyze the decision .
" that was just a piece of red meat that -lsb- cameron -rsb- felt he needed to toss to the euroskeptic majority in order to get elected , " wyles said .
" it was not well judged , and it has created a lot of resentment against the conservatives among the center-right in europe , but they will get over that - i think many of them have largely got over it already . "
some in brussels even believe the conservatives will find their way back to the european people 's party , but john wyles said that this is an unlikely scenario .
he believes the new prime minister will have to strike a balance on europe - keeping hardline euroskeptics on board , while simultaneously staying sufficiently pragmatic to further britain 's interests on the continent .

more than 700 representatives have attended the 12th asia-pacific conference of german business in singapore . at the asia-pacific conference two years ago , juergen hambrecht , the chairman of the asia-pacific committee of german business complained that only ten percent of german exports went to asia .
but the percentage has increased in the meantime : " the numbers have , of course , changed tremendously during the crisis , but one thing is clear : asia has remained calm , " says hambrecht .
" the exports to asia have clearly not decreased , compared to the average .
actually , since the last asia-pacific conference , there has been an increase from ten to over 16 percent . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singapore will host the asia-pacific conference of german business from may 13-15 juergen hambrecht is also the chairman of basf , the world 's largest chemical company , located in ludwigshafen .
in the 1990s he served as the head of basf 's east asia operations in hong kong and has since remained a fan of asia . germany in asia the asian development bank predicts asia 's economy will grow 7.5 percent this year .
as an exporting nation , the german economy is well positioned in asia , juergen hambrecht believes .
german machinery , automobiles and chemical products enjoy a good reputation .
but above all , german innovations have great prospects there and promise sustainable growth : " for example , energy-efficient construction , electric vehicles , lightweight materials for cars , light materials for other devices , for household appliances , simply as a whole : resource-efficient products , " he says . china and india have also recognized that growth at the expense of the environment will not be sustainable and that renewable energy and greater energy efficiency are crucial .
with its leading environmental technology , german industry can be an ideal partner for them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers producing volkswagen jetta at a plant in changchun , china not optimal conditions despite the potential , german business in asia has not been optimal .
companies complain about protectionism , especially in china , which has intensified since the crisis .
juergen hambrecht also mentions different industrial standards , especially in china . another obstacle is the lack of protection of intellectual property .
but hambrecht dismisses the widespread prejudice : " the major allegation was that a lot of plagiarism was happening in china which is not at all true , " he says .
" intellectual property is an issue worldwide and not just in china .
china has learned that intellectual property is valuable and it is quite interesting that most patents are filed today in china . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens staff in their training centre in singapore gradual change despite the progress in this area , china remains a difficult partner politically .
juergen hambrecht is , however , committed to the policy of " change through trade " : " we would like vietnam or china tomorrow to look like germany today .
and that is not going to be possible .
it was a very long process for us too and every country has to go through this process .
if we are able to move forward with our trade or even local production this can be the strongest impetus for change . " most of the some 4,000 german companies currently active in china would probably agree .
around 2000 companies from germany have invested in india .
even in other asian countries , many medium and small-sized german companies are trying their luck . author : danhong zhang / du editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the win in hamburg was atletico 's first european trophy . the spanish capital 's perpetual bridesmaid club atletico madrid became the center of attention this wednesday , outlasting fulham in extra time and winning the inaugural europa league trophy .
diego forlan of uruguay scored both goals for atletico , and was set up on both occasions by his argentine strike partner sergio " kun " aguero .
four minutes from time in the second extra time period , forlan got a glancing heel to aguero 's cross from the left byline , which was enough to dribble in for a goal after a deflection off of defender brede hangeland 's thigh .
it was a scrappy ending to a scrappy game , but one which most observers , including atletico defender tomas ujfalusi , felt was deserved .
" we fought for 120 minutes , and got the goals we needed from our best player , " said the defender , who was returning to what was his home stadium for four years as a bundesliga player .
ujfalusi had never won a trophy in his career , which has taken him from olomouc in the czech republic to hamburg to florence to madrid , and was clearly moved after the match .
" it 's for moments like this that we play football .
it 's an unbelievable feeling , " he said .
bildunterschrift : fulham 's goalkeeper mark schwarzer was unlucky to lose his second european final the build-up the match did n't catch fire until the 32nd minute , and even then did n't do so with much elegance .
aguero scuffed his left-footed shot attempt from the edge of the penalty box .
luckily for him , though , forlan was streaking into the area just then , and stuck out his boot to one-time the ball for a 1-0 lead .
but the travelling fulham fans did n't have long to wait before their side had evened the score - in similarly disjointed fashion .
a slip from an atletico defender meant bobby zamora found himself free on the left wing , but a poor touch robbed him of the chance to shoot as he came inside .
zoltan gera , however , was in place to cross the ball back out to the wing , where simon davies was waiting and scored with a neat volley .
not long after halftime , fulham 's goal-scoring hero bobby zamora succumbed to the ankle injury that had kept him out of fabio capello 's provisional england squad at midweek , forcing him out of the game .
his replacement , clint dempsey nearly put fulham in front within minutes of entering , but saw his shot parried by the atletico keeper - and was subsequently called for offside .
as the match wore on , atletico began to dominate possession , but had little to show for it as they failed to put many shots on target .
extended play bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fulham picked up the pace in extra time the second half came to a close and the match entered extra time , but the spanish side 's control of the ball continued .
forlan and aguero nearly linked up for another go-ahead strike at the end of the first period , but this time it was the argentine on the end of the chance , and he pushed the ball wide .
fulham looked livelier in the second extra time , earning free kicks in dangerous positions through the enterprising runs of dempsey and gera , but it was atletico who tipped the game 's balance in their favor as the madrid side 's dynamic south american duo struck again to end the game .
the loss was a particularly bitter one for fulham 's goalkeeper , australia 's mark schwarzer .
in 2006 he had led middlesborough to the final of the uefa cup -lrb- the forerunner tournament to the europa league -rrb- , only to fall to sevilla .
" when you look at the goals , you 'll see how unlucky we were , " said schwarzer .
" we had the game in our hands , had our own chances , and hoped that would be enough .
but it did n't turn out that way . "

german chancellor angela merkel phoned david cameron on wednesday to congratulate him , and invited him to visit germany soon for more comprehensive talks , according to a government spokesman in berlin .
in brussels , european union officials hope the liberal democrats ' presence in the new coalition will soften the tories ' traditionally euroskeptic stance , and help quieten hardline backbenchers within the center-right party .
european commission president jose manuel barroso also congratulated david cameron , saying his government faced difficult choices in difficult times .
" what i hope is that the british prime minister will of course defend -lsb- his country 's -rsb- national interests in the european setting , " barroso told reporters in brussels , saying he was not concerned by conservative election manifesto pledges to claw back powers from brussels .
uncertain stance but no one in brussels is quite certain how far the new british government will go in defending its national interests , especially now that the liberal democrats form a part of its leadership .
as the country grapples with a runaway national debt and budget deficit , many in brussels believe that europe is not the top priority for the new conservative-led government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has the reputation of being a reluctant eu member " cameron has far too much on his plate to think about picking a fight with europe , " the european policy center 's -lrb- epc -rrb- acting director of studies , john wyles , told deutsche welle .
" and providing there is nothing major in the policy pipeline here -lsb- in brussels -rsb- , he is certainly not going to be looking for a fight . "
wyles also expects the conservatives and liberal democrats not to fight over european policy in the short term , partly because the liberal democrats have been sufficiently vague on the issue in their manifesto .
the message filtering through to brussels from london , according to wyles , is that david cameron 's approach will be entirely pragmatic on europe and relatively low key .
and so far , the new british government has signaled it will be ' business as usual ' as far as the european union is concerned .
conservatives remain a concern still , eu officials are keeping a watchful eye on britain 's new foreign secretary , william hague , who has been playing down policy differences over the european union within the new coalition .
hague did rule out further european integration for britain , telling reporters it was a " red line " for his party , but he focussed more on the agreements reached in negotiations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservatives have no plans to join the single european currency " the liberal democrats have readily agreed with us that it will not be the policy of this government to join the euro or to propose to join the euro in its lifetime , " former conservative party leader hague said .
" look , all british governments sometimes face difficulties over european policy . "
cameron pulled his conservatives out of the main center-right grouping in the european parliament , the european people 's party , because hardline conservatives deemed the group too pro-european .
but the epc 's john wyles believes that while this sounded some alarm bells in brussels , it 's unwise to over-analyze the decision .
" that was just a piece of red meat that -lsb- cameron -rsb- felt he needed to toss to the euroskeptic majority in order to get elected , " wyles said .
" it was not well judged , and it has created a lot of resentment against the conservatives among the center-right in europe , but they will get over that - i think many of them have largely got over it already . "
some in brussels even believe the conservatives will find their way back to the european people 's party , but john wyles said that this is an unlikely scenario .
he believes the new prime minister will have to strike a balance on europe - keeping hardline euroskeptics on board , while simultaneously staying sufficiently pragmatic to further britain 's interests on the continent .

ecb president jean-claude trichet claims he had no other option . credibility is sacred to powerful monetary watchdogs like the us federal reserve , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- and germany 's bundesbank .
it 's something precious , central bankers are quick to admit , that is hard to earn but easy to lose .
perhaps no one knows that better than jean-claude trichet , an architect of the euro who oversaw the french central bank 's deliverance from political control in the 1990s .
the ecb president is waging the battle of his career to preserve the reputation of the bank , which he and his predecessor , former dutch central banker and european monetary institute president wim duisenberg , helped build .
the outcome is all but clear .
an unprecedented move to rescue the euro trichet has been under fire ever since eurozone finance ministers agreed over the weekend to launch an unprecedented aid package worth 750 billion euros -lrb- $ 1 trillion -rrb- .
the scheme is designed to rescue the euro as the effects of the greek fiscal crisis spill over into other indebted nations in the eurozone .
in a nutshell , it allows the ecb to buy government bonds issued by eurozone nations in financial trouble .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb president trichet is hearing plenty of criticism about the bank 's euro rescue move analysts argue the move has comprised the central bank 's independence ; the bank would effectively be buying government debt , giving governments a freer hand in raising money when it should actually be policing their efforts to do so .
trichet has vigorously defended the move .
at a press conference in basel , he said the central bank 's monetary policy was " hampered " and that a number of markets were " dysfunctional . "
and with an eye to critics , he said that the central bank has always been and will always be " fiercely and totally independent . "
critics , indeed , are in no short supply .
numerous monetary experts accuse the ecb 's 22-member council of bowing to political pressure from the european union and the 16 eurozone nations .
" significant stability risks " among the more outspoken and high-profile critics is bundesbank president alex weber , who is a leading candidate to succeed trichet next year .
in an interview with germany 's boersen zeitung , weber said that the purchase of government bonds " poses significant stability risks . "
he criticized the ecb council 's decision " even in this extraordinary situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans want the euro to remain a strong currency in a message to investors , david zervos , managing director of jefferies & co investment bank in new york , said that for all the attempts by the ecb to remain independent , it was unable " to push back on the eu power base in a crisis period . "
zervos warned that this development could make the eurozone " far less stable in any crisis times than a traditional national union . "
trichet realizes that ecb 's credibility is tightly linked to the bank 's independence and that any u-turns could soften the euro .
he knows all too well that if there 's anything europeans do n't want - especially many germans who still mourn the loss of their beloved deutschmark - it is a weak , suffering currency .
citizens of euro nations have every reason to be concerned : tuesday saw the euro retreat against the dollar as euphoria over the massive eurozone bailout announced on monday gave way to continuing doubts over the ability of euro nations to reduce their deficits .

analyst forecasts had predicted growth would remain stagnant .
the federal statistics office in wiesbaden also revised 2009 figures for economic activity , saying it had expanded 0.2 percent in the last quarter of 2009 .
that put full-year contraction lower than expected : 4.9 percent , down from an earlier-reported 5.0 percent .
the statisticians attributed the slow gain in momentum overall in germany to an especially cold winter , which hampered construction activity .
exports and investments in industrial equipment had nonetheless provided engines for growth , the report said .
and data for industrial orders and production in march point to a solid rebound in that sector .

how will german film fare at the world 's most important movie market ?
dw spoke with mariette rissenbeek from the organization german film service + marketing . just 19 films are in the running for the coveted palme d 'or at this year 's cannes film festival 's main competition , but hundreds more features and dozens of shorts will be shown over the course of the festival , which runs through may 23 .
aside from the main competition - which generally highlights films by well-known directors - there are parallel selections .
these include " un certain regard , " a showcase for film from younger or more unusual directors , films shown out of competition , special screenings , and cannes classics , among others . there are also longstanding and independent festivals that run parallel to the official event , such as the highly regarded directors ' fortnight , organized by the association of french film directors . deutsche welle : ms. rissenbeek , over the years the cannes film festival has earned quite a reputation as a hub of hype , where seeing and being seen is of primary importance .
is the festival still meaningful in the world of film ? marianne rissenbeek : cannes is no doubt the most important festival for film - and the most important market for films - up to today .
i think it is still the leading film market .
and a lot of the films in the official program are rather author-driven .
so it 's not only about glitz and glamour , but about filmmaking . last year a german-language film " das weisse band " -lrb- " the white ribbon " -rrb- won the palme d 'or .
coming out after " the lives of others " won the oscar in 2007 , it seemed to signal a sort of renaissance in german art film .
this year , though , there is just one german film in competition - and in fact it is a german-ukrainian-dutch co-production - " my joy , " by sergei loznitsa .
are the tides turning for german film ? well , " my joy " is indeed a german production , which a german producer has developed .
he developed the script together with the director , so it 's not only a co-production with a financial commitment from germany .
there was creative input and engagement from germany .
i don ’ t think we feel neglected or ignored by the festival selection committee . bildunterschrift : germany 's offer in this year 's competition is ' my joy , ' a co-production with ukraine and the netherlands what else is germany showing at the festival , either out of competition , or on the sidelines as part of the un certain regard series , or as part of the directors ' fortnight ? in un certain regard there are two german films , one from christoph hochhaeusler , called " unter dir die stadt " -lrb- " the city below " -rrb- , and the other one , " life , above all , " is a production that was developed in germany .
even though the director , oliver schmitz , is south african-german , he has both nationalities .
and then in the directors ' fortnight there is a german film , " picco , " by philip koch .
so actually we feel there is quite a strong presence from germany . what are you most looking forward to seeing or experiencing at this year 's festival ? well of course , for us it is more important to see how german films will do .
it will be exciting to see how christoph hochhaeusler has developed - he was at cannes a few years ago with another film .
it will be interesting to see how his film is received this year .
and " picco , " by philip koch , is a first film , so that is exciting too .
it is very seldom that you gain access to cannes with your first film , and then to the directors ' fortnight … the film will get a lot of publicity , so that 's good . and then maybe you noticed that the directors ' cut of " the tin drum " by volker schloendorff will be shown , 30 years after it was premiered in cannes .
i look forward to seeing how audiences react to that . there are a lot of films from asia in competition this year - south korea , thailand , taiwan .
what do you make of that ?
does it indicate anything about the future of european versus asian film ? cannes always had an input from asia , there were always asian films in the program , from china , or taiwan … i do n't think it 's new .
this year maybe the films were more interesting from asia , so they chose more for competition , but i could n't really say if it means anything . we have organized screenings in the market of 28 films overall , many of which have already been premiered elsewhere .
they all have special attributes , so it 's hard to say which ones will be most successful . -lrb- … -rrb- it used to be that you were guaranteed a certain number of contracts if you came to cannes , but since the financial crisis two years ago , that 's not true anymore .
still , it is an important market . interview : jennifer abramsohn editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

brussels believes germany 's tough debt-reduction measures , enshrined in the constitution , could be a model for other eu states .
in the wednesday edition of the german weekly , die zeit , rehn said brussels should have greater powers and be able to monitor the national budgets of eu nations .
he said regulations must be put in place to make this possible .
" we want governments to send their budget outlines to brussels for review before they are approved by their national parliaments , " rehn said .
" we can then see early whether a country is adhering to the stability and growth pact .
if not , we would intervene , " he said .
berlin has rejected such measures , however , saying it would impact on its budget sovereignty .
many eurozone nations in trouble - in particular greece , spain , and portugal - have accumulated budget deficits vastly exceeding the three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- permitted by the stability and growth pact .
the pact is meant to ensure the stability of the economic and monetary union .
german debt-trimming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehn favors the german debt-reduction model rehn also told die zeit that he believed germany 's plans for debt reduction could serve as a model for other eu nations .
in 2009 , berlin passed a constitutional amendment making it illegal for the federal government to run structural deficits more than 0.35 percent of gdp per annum from 2016 , while from 2020 , germany 's federal states will not be allowed to run any deficit at all .
germany this year is expected to reach a record debt of more than five percent of gdp , but has plans to start reducing this from 2011 .
greece , which has a crippling budget deficit of nearly 14 percent of national income , this month became the first eu nation to receive billions of euros in a rescue package to prevent it from defaulting on its debts .
" it does n't touch greece alone , " rehn said in brussels earlier this month .
" it has to do with the eurozone as a whole . "
the eu commission has warned nations to rein in their spending , including france and italy , which until now have held back from introducing unpopular budget cuts .
750-billion-euro package the economic turbulence in some eu nations has led speculators and investors to target the euro , which has in the past weeks fallen to its lowest levels against the us dollar in more than 14 months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commission chief wants greater control over national budgets eu finance ministers on monday announced a rescue package of up to 500 billion euros -lrb- $ 632 billion -rrb- to protect the euro , as market speculators increasingly targeted the currency and began betting on its collapse . the international monetary fund is to provide a further 250 billion euros .
" we will defend the stability of the euro at any price , " rehn said earlier monday .
meanwhile , in a rare interview , john taylor , a hedge fund speculator who made big profits in 1992 when speculators bet against the british pound , told bloomberg tv that a fall in the value of the euro was inevitable .
" the euro is a poor design and ca n't continue like this .
it 's quite easy to see that the euro will become much weaker , " taylor told bloomberg tv .
micheal leister , a strategist at the westlb bank in dusseldorf , said hedge fund speculators may well make big profits by betting on currency fluctuations , but that they alone couldn ’ t shake the euro .

in 2009 , berlin passed a constitutional amendment making it illegal for the federal government to run structural deficits more than 0.35 percent of gdp per annum from 2016 , while from 2020 , germany 's federal states will not be allowed to run any deficit at all .
germany this year is expected to reach a record debt of more than five percent of gdp , but has plans to start reducing this from 2011 .
greece , which has a crippling budget deficit of nearly 14 percent of national income , this month became the first eu nation to receive billions of euros in a rescue package to prevent it from defaulting on its debts .
" it does n't touch greece alone , " rehn said in brussels earlier this month .
" it has to do with the eurozone as a whole . "
the eu commission has warned nations to rein in their spending , including france and italy , which until now have held back from introducing unpopular budget cuts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europa league -pipe- 12.05.2010 atletico madrid downs fulham in hamburg to lift europa league trophy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego forlan bagged both goals for atletico uruguay 's diego forlan was the hero , netting two goals in the spanish side 's 2-1 extra time win over london side fulham .
the win in hamburg was atletico 's first european trophy . the spanish capital 's perpetual bridesmaid club atletico madrid became the center of attention this wednesday , outlasting fulham in extra time and winning the inaugural europa league trophy .
diego forlan of uruguay scored both goals for atletico , and was set up on both occasions by his argentine strike partner sergio " kun " aguero .
four minutes from time in the second extra time period , forlan got a glancing heel to aguero 's cross from the left byline , which was enough to dribble in for a goal after a deflection off of defender brede hangeland 's thigh .
it was a scrappy ending to a scrappy game , but one which most observers , including atletico defender tomas ujfalusi , felt was deserved .
" we fought for 120 minutes , and got the goals we needed from our best player , " said the defender , who was returning to what was his home stadium for four years as a bundesliga player .
ujfalusi had never won a trophy in his career , which has taken him from olomouc in the czech republic to hamburg to florence to madrid , and was clearly moved after the match .
" it 's for moments like this that we play football .
it 's an unbelievable feeling , " he said .
bildunterschrift : fulham 's goalkeeper mark schwarzer was unlucky to lose his second european final the build-up the match did n't catch fire until the 32nd minute , and even then did n't do so with much elegance .
aguero scuffed his left-footed shot attempt from the edge of the penalty box .
luckily for him , though , forlan was streaking into the area just then , and stuck out his boot to one-time the ball for a 1-0 lead .
but the travelling fulham fans did n't have long to wait before their side had evened the score - in similarly disjointed fashion .
a slip from an atletico defender meant bobby zamora found himself free on the left wing , but a poor touch robbed him of the chance to shoot as he came inside .
zoltan gera , however , was in place to cross the ball back out to the wing , where simon davies was waiting and scored with a neat volley .
not long after halftime , fulham 's goal-scoring hero bobby zamora succumbed to the ankle injury that had kept him out of fabio capello 's provisional england squad at midweek , forcing him out of the game .
his replacement , clint dempsey nearly put fulham in front within minutes of entering , but saw his shot parried by the atletico keeper - and was subsequently called for offside .
as the match wore on , atletico began to dominate possession , but had little to show for it as they failed to put many shots on target .
extended play bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fulham picked up the pace in extra time the second half came to a close and the match entered extra time , but the spanish side 's control of the ball continued .
forlan and aguero nearly linked up for another go-ahead strike at the end of the first period , but this time it was the argentine on the end of the chance , and he pushed the ball wide .
fulham looked livelier in the second extra time , earning free kicks in dangerous positions through the enterprising runs of dempsey and gera , but it was atletico who tipped the game 's balance in their favor as the madrid side 's dynamic south american duo struck again to end the game .
the loss was a particularly bitter one for fulham 's goalkeeper , australia 's mark schwarzer .
in 2006 he had led middlesborough to the final of the uefa cup -lrb- the forerunner tournament to the europa league -rrb- , only to fall to sevilla .
" when you look at the goals , you 'll see how unlucky we were , " said schwarzer .
" we had the game in our hands , had our own chances , and hoped that would be enough .
but it did n't turn out that way . "

the win in hamburg was atletico 's first european trophy . the spanish capital 's perpetual bridesmaid club atletico madrid became the center of attention this wednesday , outlasting fulham in extra time and winning the inaugural europa league trophy .
diego forlan of uruguay scored both goals for atletico , and was set up on both occasions by his argentine strike partner sergio " kun " aguero .
four minutes from time in the second extra time period , forlan got a glancing heel to aguero 's cross from the left byline , which was enough to dribble in for a goal after a deflection off of defender brede hangeland 's thigh .
it was a scrappy ending to a scrappy game , but one which most observers , including atletico defender tomas ujfalusi , felt was deserved .
" we fought for 120 minutes , and got the goals we needed from our best player , " said the defender , who was returning to what was his home stadium for four years as a bundesliga player .
ujfalusi had never won a trophy in his career , which has taken him from olomouc in the czech republic to hamburg to florence to madrid , and was clearly moved after the match .
" it 's for moments like this that we play football .
it 's an unbelievable feeling , " he said .
bildunterschrift : fulham 's goalkeeper mark schwarzer was unlucky to lose his second european final the build-up the match did n't catch fire until the 32nd minute , and even then did n't do so with much elegance .
aguero scuffed his left-footed shot attempt from the edge of the penalty box .
luckily for him , though , forlan was streaking into the area just then , and stuck out his boot to one-time the ball for a 1-0 lead .
but the travelling fulham fans did n't have long to wait before their side had evened the score - in similarly disjointed fashion .
a slip from an atletico defender meant bobby zamora found himself free on the left wing , but a poor touch robbed him of the chance to shoot as he came inside .
zoltan gera , however , was in place to cross the ball back out to the wing , where simon davies was waiting and scored with a neat volley .
not long after halftime , fulham 's goal-scoring hero bobby zamora succumbed to the ankle injury that had kept him out of fabio capello 's provisional england squad at midweek , forcing him out of the game .
his replacement , clint dempsey nearly put fulham in front within minutes of entering , but saw his shot parried by the atletico keeper - and was subsequently called for offside .
as the match wore on , atletico began to dominate possession , but had little to show for it as they failed to put many shots on target .
extended play bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fulham picked up the pace in extra time the second half came to a close and the match entered extra time , but the spanish side 's control of the ball continued .
forlan and aguero nearly linked up for another go-ahead strike at the end of the first period , but this time it was the argentine on the end of the chance , and he pushed the ball wide .
fulham looked livelier in the second extra time , earning free kicks in dangerous positions through the enterprising runs of dempsey and gera , but it was atletico who tipped the game 's balance in their favor as the madrid side 's dynamic south american duo struck again to end the game .
the loss was a particularly bitter one for fulham 's goalkeeper , australia 's mark schwarzer .
in 2006 he had led middlesborough to the final of the uefa cup -lrb- the forerunner tournament to the europa league -rrb- , only to fall to sevilla .
" when you look at the goals , you 'll see how unlucky we were , " said schwarzer .
" we had the game in our hands , had our own chances , and hoped that would be enough .
but it did n't turn out that way . "

it was a scrappy ending to a scrappy game , but one which most observers , including atletico defender tomas ujfalusi , felt was deserved .
" we fought for 120 minutes , and got the goals we needed from our best player , " said the defender , who was returning to what was his home stadium for four years as a bundesliga player .
ujfalusi had never won a trophy in his career , which has taken him from olomouc in the czech republic to hamburg to florence to madrid , and was clearly moved after the match .
" it 's for moments like this that we play football .
it 's an unbelievable feeling , " he said .
bildunterschrift : fulham 's goalkeeper mark schwarzer was unlucky to lose his second european final the build-up the match did n't catch fire until the 32nd minute , and even then did n't do so with much elegance .
aguero scuffed his left-footed shot attempt from the edge of the penalty box .
luckily for him , though , forlan was streaking into the area just then , and stuck out his boot to one-time the ball for a 1-0 lead .
but the travelling fulham fans did n't have long to wait before their side had evened the score - in similarly disjointed fashion .
a slip from an atletico defender meant bobby zamora found himself free on the left wing , but a poor touch robbed him of the chance to shoot as he came inside .
zoltan gera , however , was in place to cross the ball back out to the wing , where simon davies was waiting and scored with a neat volley .
not long after halftime , fulham 's goal-scoring hero bobby zamora succumbed to the ankle injury that had kept him out of fabio capello 's provisional england squad at midweek , forcing him out of the game .
his replacement , clint dempsey nearly put fulham in front within minutes of entering , but saw his shot parried by the atletico keeper - and was subsequently called for offside .
as the match wore on , atletico began to dominate possession , but had little to show for it as they failed to put many shots on target .
extended play bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fulham picked up the pace in extra time the second half came to a close and the match entered extra time , but the spanish side 's control of the ball continued .
forlan and aguero nearly linked up for another go-ahead strike at the end of the first period , but this time it was the argentine on the end of the chance , and he pushed the ball wide .
fulham looked livelier in the second extra time , earning free kicks in dangerous positions through the enterprising runs of dempsey and gera , but it was atletico who tipped the game 's balance in their favor as the madrid side 's dynamic south american duo struck again to end the game .
the loss was a particularly bitter one for fulham 's goalkeeper , australia 's mark schwarzer .
in 2006 he had led middlesborough to the final of the uefa cup -lrb- the forerunner tournament to the europa league -rrb- , only to fall to sevilla .
" when you look at the goals , you 'll see how unlucky we were , " said schwarzer .
" we had the game in our hands , had our own chances , and hoped that would be enough .
but it did n't turn out that way . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 12.05.2010 eu officials expect pragmatism on europe from new british government großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's new leaders have very different views on the eu european leaders have congratulated conservative party leader david cameron on taking office as british prime minister , saying they do n't fear a more euroskeptic course from the new leadership . european leaders congratulated conservative party leader david cameron on his first full day of work as britain 's new prime minister .
german chancellor angela merkel phoned david cameron on wednesday to congratulate him , and invited him to visit germany soon for more comprehensive talks , according to a government spokesman in berlin .
in brussels , european union officials hope the liberal democrats ' presence in the new coalition will soften the tories ' traditionally euroskeptic stance , and help quieten hardline backbenchers within the center-right party .
european commission president jose manuel barroso also congratulated david cameron , saying his government faced difficult choices in difficult times .
" what i hope is that the british prime minister will of course defend -lsb- his country 's -rsb- national interests in the european setting , " barroso told reporters in brussels , saying he was not concerned by conservative election manifesto pledges to claw back powers from brussels .
uncertain stance but no one in brussels is quite certain how far the new british government will go in defending its national interests , especially now that the liberal democrats form a part of its leadership .
as the country grapples with a runaway national debt and budget deficit , many in brussels believe that europe is not the top priority for the new conservative-led government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has the reputation of being a reluctant eu member " cameron has far too much on his plate to think about picking a fight with europe , " the european policy center 's -lrb- epc -rrb- acting director of studies , john wyles , told deutsche welle .
" and providing there is nothing major in the policy pipeline here -lsb- in brussels -rsb- , he is certainly not going to be looking for a fight . "
wyles also expects the conservatives and liberal democrats not to fight over european policy in the short term , partly because the liberal democrats have been sufficiently vague on the issue in their manifesto .
the message filtering through to brussels from london , according to wyles , is that david cameron 's approach will be entirely pragmatic on europe and relatively low key .
and so far , the new british government has signaled it will be ' business as usual ' as far as the european union is concerned .
conservatives remain a concern still , eu officials are keeping a watchful eye on britain 's new foreign secretary , william hague , who has been playing down policy differences over the european union within the new coalition .
hague did rule out further european integration for britain , telling reporters it was a " red line " for his party , but he focussed more on the agreements reached in negotiations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservatives have no plans to join the single european currency " the liberal democrats have readily agreed with us that it will not be the policy of this government to join the euro or to propose to join the euro in its lifetime , " former conservative party leader hague said .
" look , all british governments sometimes face difficulties over european policy . "
cameron pulled his conservatives out of the main center-right grouping in the european parliament , the european people 's party , because hardline conservatives deemed the group too pro-european .
but the epc 's john wyles believes that while this sounded some alarm bells in brussels , it 's unwise to over-analyze the decision .
" that was just a piece of red meat that -lsb- cameron -rsb- felt he needed to toss to the euroskeptic majority in order to get elected , " wyles said .
" it was not well judged , and it has created a lot of resentment against the conservatives among the center-right in europe , but they will get over that - i think many of them have largely got over it already . "
some in brussels even believe the conservatives will find their way back to the european people 's party , but john wyles said that this is an unlikely scenario .
he believes the new prime minister will have to strike a balance on europe - keeping hardline euroskeptics on board , while simultaneously staying sufficiently pragmatic to further britain 's interests on the continent .

" what i hope is that the british prime minister will of course defend -lsb- his country 's -rsb- national interests in the european setting , " barroso told reporters in brussels , saying he was not concerned by conservative election manifesto pledges to claw back powers from brussels .
uncertain stance but no one in brussels is quite certain how far the new british government will go in defending its national interests , especially now that the liberal democrats form a part of its leadership .
as the country grapples with a runaway national debt and budget deficit , many in brussels believe that europe is not the top priority for the new conservative-led government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has the reputation of being a reluctant eu member " cameron has far too much on his plate to think about picking a fight with europe , " the european policy center 's -lrb- epc -rrb- acting director of studies , john wyles , told deutsche welle .
" and providing there is nothing major in the policy pipeline here -lsb- in brussels -rsb- , he is certainly not going to be looking for a fight . "
wyles also expects the conservatives and liberal democrats not to fight over european policy in the short term , partly because the liberal democrats have been sufficiently vague on the issue in their manifesto .
the message filtering through to brussels from london , according to wyles , is that david cameron 's approach will be entirely pragmatic on europe and relatively low key .
and so far , the new british government has signaled it will be ' business as usual ' as far as the european union is concerned .
conservatives remain a concern still , eu officials are keeping a watchful eye on britain 's new foreign secretary , william hague , who has been playing down policy differences over the european union within the new coalition .
hague did rule out further european integration for britain , telling reporters it was a " red line " for his party , but he focussed more on the agreements reached in negotiations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservatives have no plans to join the single european currency " the liberal democrats have readily agreed with us that it will not be the policy of this government to join the euro or to propose to join the euro in its lifetime , " former conservative party leader hague said .
" look , all british governments sometimes face difficulties over european policy . "
cameron pulled his conservatives out of the main center-right grouping in the european parliament , the european people 's party , because hardline conservatives deemed the group too pro-european .
but the epc 's john wyles believes that while this sounded some alarm bells in brussels , it 's unwise to over-analyze the decision .
" that was just a piece of red meat that -lsb- cameron -rsb- felt he needed to toss to the euroskeptic majority in order to get elected , " wyles said .
" it was not well judged , and it has created a lot of resentment against the conservatives among the center-right in europe , but they will get over that - i think many of them have largely got over it already . "
some in brussels even believe the conservatives will find their way back to the european people 's party , but john wyles said that this is an unlikely scenario .
he believes the new prime minister will have to strike a balance on europe - keeping hardline euroskeptics on board , while simultaneously staying sufficiently pragmatic to further britain 's interests on the continent .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservatives have no plans to join the single european currency " the liberal democrats have readily agreed with us that it will not be the policy of this government to join the euro or to propose to join the euro in its lifetime , " former conservative party leader hague said .
" look , all british governments sometimes face difficulties over european policy . "
cameron pulled his conservatives out of the main center-right grouping in the european parliament , the european people 's party , because hardline conservatives deemed the group too pro-european .
but the epc 's john wyles believes that while this sounded some alarm bells in brussels , it 's unwise to over-analyze the decision .
" that was just a piece of red meat that -lsb- cameron -rsb- felt he needed to toss to the euroskeptic majority in order to get elected , " wyles said .
" it was not well judged , and it has created a lot of resentment against the conservatives among the center-right in europe , but they will get over that - i think many of them have largely got over it already . "
some in brussels even believe the conservatives will find their way back to the european people 's party , but john wyles said that this is an unlikely scenario .
he believes the new prime minister will have to strike a balance on europe - keeping hardline euroskeptics on board , while simultaneously staying sufficiently pragmatic to further britain 's interests on the continent .

he was speaking following his talks with afghan president hamid karzai in washington . president obama said relations between the two governments were " strong " and would endure and that the tensions had been exaggerated . " with respect to perceived tensions between the us government and the afghan government , a lot of them were simply overstated , " said obama . he said the two sides renewed their goal to defeat al qaeda and its extremist allies . for his part , karzai told reporters that he had " frank and productive " discussions with president obama and the relations between the united states and afghanistan were much stronger now .
" we are much more strongly related to each other today than we ever were before . " he also said the us has committed to reducing civilian casualties in afghanistan , an issue that has strained their relations in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan 's president hamid karzai , left , and secretary of state hillary clinton reassurance to provide security in the first of a series of meetings , afghan president hamid karzai on tuesday met us secretary of state hillary clinton who reassured him that the us would remain committed to providing security in afghanistan even after us troops have left . " as we look toward a responsible , orderly transition in the international combat mission in afghanistan , we will not abandon the afghan people , " clinton said .
karzai , meanwhile , reiterated that his country would stick to its responsibility to further develop afghanistan 's civilian and democratic structures . the us commitment should serve as a reassurance to karzai , whose visit comes as relations between afghanistan and the west have cooled in recent months .
last month , following a visit by obama to kabul in late march , karzai slammed the un and the international community , accusing them of perpetrating a " vast fraud " in last year 's presidential elections as part of a conspiracy to undermine his victory .
he said western coalition troops risked being seen as invaders rather than saviours of his country .
while many observers put it down to an attempt by a politically weakened karzai to assert his legitimacy in afghanistan , the unusually harsh outburst sparked criticism in western capitals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us , nato and afghan forces are preparing for a major offensive in kandahar critical juncture " karzai 's visit to the us is highly significant .
it will help the us government show the political community in washington that it still has control over karzai .
it shows that karzai depends on the international community for his political survival .
and it also shows that the west has no viable alternative to karzai in afghanistan , " henning riecke , an analyst at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" from the afghan government point of view , this visit which takes place at a sensitive time , is extremely important , " waheed omar , karzai 's spokesman told reporters last week .
it comes amid a us military surge in afghanistan and ahead of a major offensive against militants in the southern afghan province of kandahar .
the talks in washington also take place amid mounting anger in afghanistan against rising civilian casualties and dwindling public support for the afghan mission in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say distinguishing between who 's moderate and who 's not in the taliban will be tricky tricky talks with the taliban a peace conference , or jirga , to forge a national consensus on how to reconcile with the taliban is to take place later this month in kabul .
the british newspaper the guardian reported recently that afghanistan is proposing to offer top taliban leaders exile if they agree to stop fighting against the government .
the newspaper refered to a document suggesting insurgent leaders could face " potential exile in a third country . "
it also calls for " deradicalisation " classes for insurgents and thousands of new manual jobs to be created for taliban fighters who lay down their arms .
plans to reach out to the taliban are n't now .
in a shift in strategy , most western nations now accept that any political solution to the afghanistan conflict must include moderate elements of the taliban .
earlier this year , german foreign minister guido westerwelle drummed up support for an " exit program " for taliban fighters funded by the international community .
but some point out that the country that finds it the hardest to embrace talks with the taliban is the us .
" the americans are ambivalent about bringing the taliban to the table due to their links with al qaeda .
it 's heightened after the botched bombing at times square , " fabrice pothier , head of carnegie europe , a forum for european policymakers and think-tanks , told deutsche welle . " any agreement with the taliban has to involve security guarantees on both sides - the taliban must sever links with al qaeda and the us must guarantee that taliban fighters wo n't be imprisoned or killed .
for the us president , justifying making a deal with the taliban is a hard sell at home . "
european involvement observers say that though european allies lack the political clout the us has in afghanistan , the talks in washington are being followed carefully across the atlantic .
" on hard political questions , europe is out of the picture in afghanistan .
we do n't have the same credibility as the us because we are n't taking the same risks as the us .
but at the same time , europe has a long-term interest in institution-building in afghanistan .
so the talks in the us remain important to europe 's future role -lrb- in afghanistan -rrb- , " pothier said .
many european governments are grappling with waning support at home for the war in afghanistan as troop casualties rise .
experts say it stands to reason that good ties between kabul and washington would help obama fulfill his pledge to start bringing us troops home in mid-2011 - and thus signal the way for an end in sight to the afghan engagement .
" when obama announced he would begin a partial withdrawal of troops in mid-2011 it was greeted with cheer in europe .
it was interpreted here as a possible end of the deployment .
but that 's not what it 's going to be .
we can expect some tough discussions and friction between the us and its european allies later in november this year when american generals review the success of the surge , " riecke said .
expert : west should rethink afghan policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising troop casualties have raised concerns in the west " western capitals keep making demands on kabul on corruption and governance .
but the fact is that much of the corruption is fuelled by international aid money .
the price per square meter of property in kabul is higher than in tokyo - it 's a bubble created by the west , " pothier said .
the expert pointed out that a host of events in afghanistan this year - the peace conference , a foreign donor nations meeting in july , parliamentary elections in september - offer a chance for the west to pursue a different script in afghanistan .
" the reality of the afghan state is that the western-backed karzai government in kabul has not percolated to the country 's provinces and districts .
karzai and his smart english-speaking ministers who travel the world have failed to deliver basic services to the majority of the afghan people , " porthier said .
" the west needs to take a hard look at what 's gone wrong and push for broader political change and reform in afghanistan . "

he was speaking following his talks with afghan president hamid karzai in washington . president obama said relations between the two governments were " strong " and would endure and that the tensions had been exaggerated . " with respect to perceived tensions between the us government and the afghan government , a lot of them were simply overstated , " said obama . he said the two sides renewed their goal to defeat al qaeda and its extremist allies . for his part , karzai told reporters that he had " frank and productive " discussions with president obama and the relations between the united states and afghanistan were much stronger now .
" we are much more strongly related to each other today than we ever were before . " he also said the us has committed to reducing civilian casualties in afghanistan , an issue that has strained their relations in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan 's president hamid karzai , left , and secretary of state hillary clinton reassurance to provide security in the first of a series of meetings , afghan president hamid karzai on tuesday met us secretary of state hillary clinton who reassured him that the us would remain committed to providing security in afghanistan even after us troops have left . " as we look toward a responsible , orderly transition in the international combat mission in afghanistan , we will not abandon the afghan people , " clinton said .
karzai , meanwhile , reiterated that his country would stick to its responsibility to further develop afghanistan 's civilian and democratic structures . the us commitment should serve as a reassurance to karzai , whose visit comes as relations between afghanistan and the west have cooled in recent months .
last month , following a visit by obama to kabul in late march , karzai slammed the un and the international community , accusing them of perpetrating a " vast fraud " in last year 's presidential elections as part of a conspiracy to undermine his victory .
he said western coalition troops risked being seen as invaders rather than saviours of his country .
while many observers put it down to an attempt by a politically weakened karzai to assert his legitimacy in afghanistan , the unusually harsh outburst sparked criticism in western capitals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us , nato and afghan forces are preparing for a major offensive in kandahar critical juncture " karzai 's visit to the us is highly significant .
it will help the us government show the political community in washington that it still has control over karzai .
it shows that karzai depends on the international community for his political survival .
and it also shows that the west has no viable alternative to karzai in afghanistan , " henning riecke , an analyst at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" from the afghan government point of view , this visit which takes place at a sensitive time , is extremely important , " waheed omar , karzai 's spokesman told reporters last week .
it comes amid a us military surge in afghanistan and ahead of a major offensive against militants in the southern afghan province of kandahar .
the talks in washington also take place amid mounting anger in afghanistan against rising civilian casualties and dwindling public support for the afghan mission in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say distinguishing between who 's moderate and who 's not in the taliban will be tricky tricky talks with the taliban a peace conference , or jirga , to forge a national consensus on how to reconcile with the taliban is to take place later this month in kabul .
the british newspaper the guardian reported recently that afghanistan is proposing to offer top taliban leaders exile if they agree to stop fighting against the government .
the newspaper refered to a document suggesting insurgent leaders could face " potential exile in a third country . "
it also calls for " deradicalisation " classes for insurgents and thousands of new manual jobs to be created for taliban fighters who lay down their arms .
plans to reach out to the taliban are n't now .
in a shift in strategy , most western nations now accept that any political solution to the afghanistan conflict must include moderate elements of the taliban .
earlier this year , german foreign minister guido westerwelle drummed up support for an " exit program " for taliban fighters funded by the international community .
but some point out that the country that finds it the hardest to embrace talks with the taliban is the us .
" the americans are ambivalent about bringing the taliban to the table due to their links with al qaeda .
it 's heightened after the botched bombing at times square , " fabrice pothier , head of carnegie europe , a forum for european policymakers and think-tanks , told deutsche welle . " any agreement with the taliban has to involve security guarantees on both sides - the taliban must sever links with al qaeda and the us must guarantee that taliban fighters wo n't be imprisoned or killed .
for the us president , justifying making a deal with the taliban is a hard sell at home . "
european involvement observers say that though european allies lack the political clout the us has in afghanistan , the talks in washington are being followed carefully across the atlantic .
" on hard political questions , europe is out of the picture in afghanistan .
we do n't have the same credibility as the us because we are n't taking the same risks as the us .
but at the same time , europe has a long-term interest in institution-building in afghanistan .
so the talks in the us remain important to europe 's future role -lrb- in afghanistan -rrb- , " pothier said .
many european governments are grappling with waning support at home for the war in afghanistan as troop casualties rise .
experts say it stands to reason that good ties between kabul and washington would help obama fulfill his pledge to start bringing us troops home in mid-2011 - and thus signal the way for an end in sight to the afghan engagement .
" when obama announced he would begin a partial withdrawal of troops in mid-2011 it was greeted with cheer in europe .
it was interpreted here as a possible end of the deployment .
but that 's not what it 's going to be .
we can expect some tough discussions and friction between the us and its european allies later in november this year when american generals review the success of the surge , " riecke said .
expert : west should rethink afghan policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising troop casualties have raised concerns in the west " western capitals keep making demands on kabul on corruption and governance .
but the fact is that much of the corruption is fuelled by international aid money .
the price per square meter of property in kabul is higher than in tokyo - it 's a bubble created by the west , " pothier said .
the expert pointed out that a host of events in afghanistan this year - the peace conference , a foreign donor nations meeting in july , parliamentary elections in september - offer a chance for the west to pursue a different script in afghanistan .
" the reality of the afghan state is that the western-backed karzai government in kabul has not percolated to the country 's provinces and districts .
karzai and his smart english-speaking ministers who travel the world have failed to deliver basic services to the majority of the afghan people , " porthier said .
" the west needs to take a hard look at what 's gone wrong and push for broader political change and reform in afghanistan . "

he was speaking following his talks with afghan president hamid karzai in washington . president obama said relations between the two governments were " strong " and would endure and that the tensions had been exaggerated . " with respect to perceived tensions between the us government and the afghan government , a lot of them were simply overstated , " said obama . he said the two sides renewed their goal to defeat al qaeda and its extremist allies . for his part , karzai told reporters that he had " frank and productive " discussions with president obama and the relations between the united states and afghanistan were much stronger now .
" we are much more strongly related to each other today than we ever were before . " he also said the us has committed to reducing civilian casualties in afghanistan , an issue that has strained their relations in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan 's president hamid karzai , left , and secretary of state hillary clinton reassurance to provide security in the first of a series of meetings , afghan president hamid karzai on tuesday met us secretary of state hillary clinton who reassured him that the us would remain committed to providing security in afghanistan even after us troops have left . " as we look toward a responsible , orderly transition in the international combat mission in afghanistan , we will not abandon the afghan people , " clinton said .
karzai , meanwhile , reiterated that his country would stick to its responsibility to further develop afghanistan 's civilian and democratic structures . the us commitment should serve as a reassurance to karzai , whose visit comes as relations between afghanistan and the west have cooled in recent months .
last month , following a visit by obama to kabul in late march , karzai slammed the un and the international community , accusing them of perpetrating a " vast fraud " in last year 's presidential elections as part of a conspiracy to undermine his victory .
he said western coalition troops risked being seen as invaders rather than saviours of his country .
while many observers put it down to an attempt by a politically weakened karzai to assert his legitimacy in afghanistan , the unusually harsh outburst sparked criticism in western capitals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us , nato and afghan forces are preparing for a major offensive in kandahar critical juncture " karzai 's visit to the us is highly significant .
it will help the us government show the political community in washington that it still has control over karzai .
it shows that karzai depends on the international community for his political survival .
and it also shows that the west has no viable alternative to karzai in afghanistan , " henning riecke , an analyst at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" from the afghan government point of view , this visit which takes place at a sensitive time , is extremely important , " waheed omar , karzai 's spokesman told reporters last week .
it comes amid a us military surge in afghanistan and ahead of a major offensive against militants in the southern afghan province of kandahar .
the talks in washington also take place amid mounting anger in afghanistan against rising civilian casualties and dwindling public support for the afghan mission in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say distinguishing between who 's moderate and who 's not in the taliban will be tricky tricky talks with the taliban a peace conference , or jirga , to forge a national consensus on how to reconcile with the taliban is to take place later this month in kabul .
the british newspaper the guardian reported recently that afghanistan is proposing to offer top taliban leaders exile if they agree to stop fighting against the government .
the newspaper refered to a document suggesting insurgent leaders could face " potential exile in a third country . "
it also calls for " deradicalisation " classes for insurgents and thousands of new manual jobs to be created for taliban fighters who lay down their arms .
plans to reach out to the taliban are n't now .
in a shift in strategy , most western nations now accept that any political solution to the afghanistan conflict must include moderate elements of the taliban .
earlier this year , german foreign minister guido westerwelle drummed up support for an " exit program " for taliban fighters funded by the international community .
but some point out that the country that finds it the hardest to embrace talks with the taliban is the us .
" the americans are ambivalent about bringing the taliban to the table due to their links with al qaeda .
it 's heightened after the botched bombing at times square , " fabrice pothier , head of carnegie europe , a forum for european policymakers and think-tanks , told deutsche welle . " any agreement with the taliban has to involve security guarantees on both sides - the taliban must sever links with al qaeda and the us must guarantee that taliban fighters wo n't be imprisoned or killed .
for the us president , justifying making a deal with the taliban is a hard sell at home . "
european involvement observers say that though european allies lack the political clout the us has in afghanistan , the talks in washington are being followed carefully across the atlantic .
" on hard political questions , europe is out of the picture in afghanistan .
we do n't have the same credibility as the us because we are n't taking the same risks as the us .
but at the same time , europe has a long-term interest in institution-building in afghanistan .
so the talks in the us remain important to europe 's future role -lrb- in afghanistan -rrb- , " pothier said .
many european governments are grappling with waning support at home for the war in afghanistan as troop casualties rise .
experts say it stands to reason that good ties between kabul and washington would help obama fulfill his pledge to start bringing us troops home in mid-2011 - and thus signal the way for an end in sight to the afghan engagement .
" when obama announced he would begin a partial withdrawal of troops in mid-2011 it was greeted with cheer in europe .
it was interpreted here as a possible end of the deployment .
but that 's not what it 's going to be .
we can expect some tough discussions and friction between the us and its european allies later in november this year when american generals review the success of the surge , " riecke said .
expert : west should rethink afghan policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising troop casualties have raised concerns in the west " western capitals keep making demands on kabul on corruption and governance .
but the fact is that much of the corruption is fuelled by international aid money .
the price per square meter of property in kabul is higher than in tokyo - it 's a bubble created by the west , " pothier said .
the expert pointed out that a host of events in afghanistan this year - the peace conference , a foreign donor nations meeting in july , parliamentary elections in september - offer a chance for the west to pursue a different script in afghanistan .

" i would say that the budgetary plans of the member states are not secret anyway , so the commission can already form an opinion about what governments put forward during budgetary debates , " merkel told reporters in berlin . sanctions possible european commission president jose manuel barosso was clear that he believed a unifying economic policy was inevitable for the euro 's survival .

the decision has sparked a debate about how to protect the public from violent offenders . germany is under pressure to change its system of preventive detention , which allows for violent and repeat offenders to be detained indefinitely , even after they have served their sentence .
in december , the european court of human rights -lrb- echr -rrb- ruled that germany had violated the european human rights convention in the case of german inmate reinhard m. , who was convicted for attempted murder and had been kept in prison more than 10 years after his sentence .
the 52-year-old man had completed his five-year prison sentence in 1991 , but was not released , as he was deemed a danger to the public .
he was detained for the next 10 years , the maximum term for preventive detention at the time .
but a change in german legislation in 1998 meant that prisoners can now be detained indefinitely .
right to liberty the echr ruled that because reinhard m had been convicted before the change in the law in 1998 germany violated the ' right to liberty ' .
the court also stated that " there was no sufficient causal connection between his conviction and his continued deprivation of liberty . "
germany requested the case be referred to the echr 's grand chamber , which has now been refused , making the original court decision binding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 70 violent offenders in germany could benefit from the court ruling the echr can only tackle specific cases , but the ruling has already sparked a debate on how to protect the public from criminals convicted of murder , armed robbery , rape and other violent crimes .
" we need a comprehensive not an alarmist debate on the ramifications and options of today 's ruling -lsb- by the echr -rsb- , " justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger said in a statement on tuesday .
new framework the federal coalition agreement from last autumn calls for a reform of the current system , but the government has not released any details yet .
the bavarian justice minister , beate merk , however , has been vocal in calling for a complete overhaul of preventive detention in germany .
" a few band-aids here and there just will not do , " she said in a statement .
" we need a completely new system that can deal with violent offenders that are likely to reoffend and be a danger to the public even after they have served their sentence , " she added .
merk is adamant that some form of post-sentence detention is necessary , but she would like to see the sentence , ie the punishment , separated from the subsequent detention , with separate facilities and dedicated therapy options for violent criminals - one of the areas the echr had criticized as lacking in the current system .
longer sentences but some legal experts believe preventive detention is not the answer .
" the law has been extended in the past because of an unsubstantiated fear of crime , at a time when crime rates are going down in germany , and i do n't believe there is a need for it at all , " hermann kuehn , an expert in criminal law who runs his own law firm , told deutsche welle .
he would like to see longer sentences handed down instead .
currently , the maximum sentence is 15 years , unless a defendant is sentenced to life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's constitutional court endorsed retroactive preventive detention in 2004 " we could extend the fixed-term punishments to give courts the opportunity for a longer prison sentence and then leave it to the court to release him earlier if he is no longer a danger to society , " kuehn said .
he believes the power to release a potentially dangerous person should remain with the court , however .
he argues that leaving violent criminals to medical authorities for preventive detention by separating punishment from detention could be dangerous if you rely on medical staff alone to determine whether or not a detainee is a danger to society .

the decision has sparked a debate about how to protect the public from violent offenders . germany is under pressure to change its system of preventive detention , which allows for violent and repeat offenders to be detained indefinitely , even after they have served their sentence .
in december , the european court of human rights -lrb- echr -rrb- ruled that germany had violated the european human rights convention in the case of german inmate reinhard m. , who was convicted for attempted murder and had been kept in prison more than 10 years after his sentence .
the 52-year-old man had completed his five-year prison sentence in 1991 , but was not released , as he was deemed a danger to the public .
he was detained for the next 10 years , the maximum term for preventive detention at the time .
but a change in german legislation in 1998 meant that prisoners can now be detained indefinitely .
right to liberty the echr ruled that because reinhard m had been convicted before the change in the law in 1998 germany violated the ' right to liberty ' .
the court also stated that " there was no sufficient causal connection between his conviction and his continued deprivation of liberty . "
germany requested the case be referred to the echr 's grand chamber , which has now been refused , making the original court decision binding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 70 violent offenders in germany could benefit from the court ruling the echr can only tackle specific cases , but the ruling has already sparked a debate on how to protect the public from criminals convicted of murder , armed robbery , rape and other violent crimes .
" we need a comprehensive not an alarmist debate on the ramifications and options of today 's ruling -lsb- by the echr -rsb- , " justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger said in a statement on tuesday .
new framework the federal coalition agreement from last autumn calls for a reform of the current system , but the government has not released any details yet .
the bavarian justice minister , beate merk , however , has been vocal in calling for a complete overhaul of preventive detention in germany .
" a few band-aids here and there just will not do , " she said in a statement .
" we need a completely new system that can deal with violent offenders that are likely to reoffend and be a danger to the public even after they have served their sentence , " she added .
merk is adamant that some form of post-sentence detention is necessary , but she would like to see the sentence , ie the punishment , separated from the subsequent detention , with separate facilities and dedicated therapy options for violent criminals - one of the areas the echr had criticized as lacking in the current system .
longer sentences but some legal experts believe preventive detention is not the answer .
" the law has been extended in the past because of an unsubstantiated fear of crime , at a time when crime rates are going down in germany , and i do n't believe there is a need for it at all , " hermann kuehn , an expert in criminal law who runs his own law firm , told deutsche welle .
he would like to see longer sentences handed down instead .
currently , the maximum sentence is 15 years , unless a defendant is sentenced to life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's constitutional court endorsed retroactive preventive detention in 2004 " we could extend the fixed-term punishments to give courts the opportunity for a longer prison sentence and then leave it to the court to release him earlier if he is no longer a danger to society , " kuehn said .
he believes the power to release a potentially dangerous person should remain with the court , however .
he argues that leaving violent criminals to medical authorities for preventive detention by separating punishment from detention could be dangerous if you rely on medical staff alone to determine whether or not a detainee is a danger to society .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 70 violent offenders in germany could benefit from the court ruling the echr can only tackle specific cases , but the ruling has already sparked a debate on how to protect the public from criminals convicted of murder , armed robbery , rape and other violent crimes .
" we need a comprehensive not an alarmist debate on the ramifications and options of today 's ruling -lsb- by the echr -rsb- , " justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger said in a statement on tuesday .
new framework the federal coalition agreement from last autumn calls for a reform of the current system , but the government has not released any details yet .
the bavarian justice minister , beate merk , however , has been vocal in calling for a complete overhaul of preventive detention in germany .
" a few band-aids here and there just will not do , " she said in a statement .
" we need a completely new system that can deal with violent offenders that are likely to reoffend and be a danger to the public even after they have served their sentence , " she added .
merk is adamant that some form of post-sentence detention is necessary , but she would like to see the sentence , ie the punishment , separated from the subsequent detention , with separate facilities and dedicated therapy options for violent criminals - one of the areas the echr had criticized as lacking in the current system .
longer sentences but some legal experts believe preventive detention is not the answer .
" the law has been extended in the past because of an unsubstantiated fear of crime , at a time when crime rates are going down in germany , and i do n't believe there is a need for it at all , " hermann kuehn , an expert in criminal law who runs his own law firm , told deutsche welle .
he would like to see longer sentences handed down instead .
currently , the maximum sentence is 15 years , unless a defendant is sentenced to life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's constitutional court endorsed retroactive preventive detention in 2004 " we could extend the fixed-term punishments to give courts the opportunity for a longer prison sentence and then leave it to the court to release him earlier if he is no longer a danger to society , " kuehn said .
he believes the power to release a potentially dangerous person should remain with the court , however .
he argues that leaving violent criminals to medical authorities for preventive detention by separating punishment from detention could be dangerous if you rely on medical staff alone to determine whether or not a detainee is a danger to society .

estonia is set to adopt the euro and plans to replace its currency , the kroon , on january 1 , 2011 .
the move would make the baltic country the 17th eurozone member . the european commission on wednesday said estonia 's economy is strong enough to join the euro zone .
estonia plans to switch to the shared european currency on january 1 , 2011 . the commission had examined estonia 's debt , deficit , inflation , and interest levels .
olli rehn , the eu commissioner for economic and budgetary affairs , said the country had achieved " a high degree of sustainable economic convergence " and was therefore ready to adopt the euro .
' prudent fiscal policy ' is key " to ensure that the adoption of the euro is a success , estonia must pursue its efforts to maintain a prudent fiscal policy stance , " he said .
he urged tallinn to " remain vigilant and react early and decisively " if problems emerge .
the commission 's positive assessment came in the wake of an enormous european bailout for greece , which shed new light on the importance of countries taking inflation-control measures .
countries are concerned that massive debt problems in the eurozone could make brussels wary of taking on a new member .
economic data adds up according to rehn , " the assessment and our proposal is also a strong signal about the euro area and to the eu more broadly , " testifying that sound economic policies such as those adopted by estonia " generate concrete results . "
estonia has had an average budget surplus of 1.8 percent of gross domestic product between 2002 to 2007 , deteriorating to a deficit of minus 2.7 percent in 2008 and minus 1.7 percent in 2009 as a result of the economic crisis .
that is still well within the eurozone 's threshold of 3 percent .
the brussels-based eu executive said the country 's " price performance -lsb- is -rsb- sustainable " as average inflation fell to minus 0.7 percent in the 12 months to march 2010 .
but it warned that " estonia " will need to remain vigilant to keep inflation at a low level . "
in order for estonia to be finally welcomed into the eurozone , wednesday 's approval will have to be confirmed by the eu 's finance ministers in july .
so far , no positive recommendation by the commission on eurozone enlargement has ever been contradicted by eu member states .
estonia shifted rapidly from a communist command economy to the free market after breaking from the crumbling soviet bloc in 1991 .
the 1.3-million-strong country had hoped to adopt the euro in 2007 , but failed to meet the inflation-control criteria at the time. jen / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ecb president jean-claude trichet claims he had no other option . credibility is sacred to powerful monetary watchdogs like the us federal reserve , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- and germany 's bundesbank .
it 's something precious , central bankers are quick to admit , that is hard to earn but easy to lose .
perhaps no one knows that better than jean-claude trichet , an architect of the euro who oversaw the french central bank 's deliverance from political control in the 1990s .
the ecb president is waging the battle of his career to preserve the reputation of the bank , which he and his predecessor , former dutch central banker and european monetary institute president wim duisenberg , helped build .
the outcome is all but clear .
an unprecedented move to rescue the euro trichet has been under fire ever since eurozone finance ministers agreed over the weekend to launch an unprecedented aid package worth 750 billion euros -lrb- $ 1 trillion -rrb- .
the scheme is designed to rescue the euro as the effects of the greek fiscal crisis spill over into other indebted nations in the eurozone .
in a nutshell , it allows the ecb to buy government bonds issued by eurozone nations in financial trouble .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb president trichet is hearing plenty of criticism about the bank 's euro rescue move analysts argue the move has comprised the central bank 's independence ; the bank would effectively be buying government debt , giving governments a freer hand in raising money when it should actually be policing their efforts to do so .
trichet has vigorously defended the move .
at a press conference in basel , he said the central bank 's monetary policy was " hampered " and that a number of markets were " dysfunctional . "
and with an eye to critics , he said that the central bank has always been and will always be " fiercely and totally independent . "
critics , indeed , are in no short supply .
numerous monetary experts accuse the ecb 's 22-member council of bowing to political pressure from the european union and the 16 eurozone nations .
" significant stability risks " among the more outspoken and high-profile critics is bundesbank president alex weber , who is a leading candidate to succeed trichet next year .
in an interview with germany 's boersen zeitung , weber said that the purchase of government bonds " poses significant stability risks . "
he criticized the ecb council 's decision " even in this extraordinary situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans want the euro to remain a strong currency in a message to investors , david zervos , managing director of jefferies & co investment bank in new york , said that for all the attempts by the ecb to remain independent , it was unable " to push back on the eu power base in a crisis period . "
zervos warned that this development could make the eurozone " far less stable in any crisis times than a traditional national union . "
trichet realizes that ecb 's credibility is tightly linked to the bank 's independence and that any u-turns could soften the euro .
he knows all too well that if there 's anything europeans do n't want - especially many germans who still mourn the loss of their beloved deutschmark - it is a weak , suffering currency .
citizens of euro nations have every reason to be concerned : tuesday saw the euro retreat against the dollar as euphoria over the massive eurozone bailout announced on monday gave way to continuing doubts over the ability of euro nations to reduce their deficits .

ecb president jean-claude trichet claims he had no other option . credibility is sacred to powerful monetary watchdogs like the us federal reserve , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- and germany 's bundesbank .
it 's something precious , central bankers are quick to admit , that is hard to earn but easy to lose .
perhaps no one knows that better than jean-claude trichet , an architect of the euro who oversaw the french central bank 's deliverance from political control in the 1990s .
the ecb president is waging the battle of his career to preserve the reputation of the bank , which he and his predecessor , former dutch central banker and european monetary institute president wim duisenberg , helped build .
the outcome is all but clear .
an unprecedented move to rescue the euro trichet has been under fire ever since eurozone finance ministers agreed over the weekend to launch an unprecedented aid package worth 750 billion euros -lrb- $ 1 trillion -rrb- .
the scheme is designed to rescue the euro as the effects of the greek fiscal crisis spill over into other indebted nations in the eurozone .
in a nutshell , it allows the ecb to buy government bonds issued by eurozone nations in financial trouble .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb president trichet is hearing plenty of criticism about the bank 's euro rescue move analysts argue the move has comprised the central bank 's independence ; the bank would effectively be buying government debt , giving governments a freer hand in raising money when it should actually be policing their efforts to do so .
trichet has vigorously defended the move .
at a press conference in basel , he said the central bank 's monetary policy was " hampered " and that a number of markets were " dysfunctional . "
and with an eye to critics , he said that the central bank has always been and will always be " fiercely and totally independent . "
critics , indeed , are in no short supply .
numerous monetary experts accuse the ecb 's 22-member council of bowing to political pressure from the european union and the 16 eurozone nations .
" significant stability risks " among the more outspoken and high-profile critics is bundesbank president alex weber , who is a leading candidate to succeed trichet next year .
in an interview with germany 's boersen zeitung , weber said that the purchase of government bonds " poses significant stability risks . "
he criticized the ecb council 's decision " even in this extraordinary situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans want the euro to remain a strong currency in a message to investors , david zervos , managing director of jefferies & co investment bank in new york , said that for all the attempts by the ecb to remain independent , it was unable " to push back on the eu power base in a crisis period . "
zervos warned that this development could make the eurozone " far less stable in any crisis times than a traditional national union . "
trichet realizes that ecb 's credibility is tightly linked to the bank 's independence and that any u-turns could soften the euro .
he knows all too well that if there 's anything europeans do n't want - especially many germans who still mourn the loss of their beloved deutschmark - it is a weak , suffering currency .
citizens of euro nations have every reason to be concerned : tuesday saw the euro retreat against the dollar as euphoria over the massive eurozone bailout announced on monday gave way to continuing doubts over the ability of euro nations to reduce their deficits .

analyst forecasts had predicted growth would remain stagnant .
the federal statistics office in wiesbaden also revised 2009 figures for economic activity , saying it had expanded 0.2 percent in the last quarter of 2009 .
that put full-year contraction lower than expected : 4.9 percent , down from an earlier-reported 5.0 percent .
the statisticians attributed the slow gain in momentum overall in germany to an especially cold winter , which hampered construction activity .
exports and investments in industrial equipment had nonetheless provided engines for growth , the report said .
and data for industrial orders and production in march point to a solid rebound in that sector .
the government forecasts growth of 1.4 percent for 2010 overall. jen / afp / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the talks would focus on efforts by both the eu and the us to have the other party stop providing aid to airbus and boeing , respectively .
eu trade commissioner karel de gucht told reporters the bloc could start talks " immediately , " as long as there were no preconditions for future european government aid for airbus 's new a350 plane .
there are concerns that without state support airbus and boeing would struggle to develop large aircraft in the future .
at the heart of the dispute are subsidies paid by eu countries to airbus for the a350 .
germany alone pledged 1.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- to airbus for the new jetliner , which is seen as a possible future market rival for the boeing 787 dreamliner .
the us had filed a case with the world trade organization years ago which led to european governments being called on to stop providing such aid .
airbus argues the wto verdict does not apply to the a350 as it was handed down prior to the plane 's development .
the wto decision was only the first part of the long-running saga , with another ruling on a counter-complaint brought by the eu against us aid for boeing expected later this year .
us trade officials also said they were ready to hold talks , " but any productive discussions must necessarily address all wto-inconsistent subsidies to civil aircraft , " ustr spokeswoman nefeterius mcpherson said. dfm / afp / reuters editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 12.05.2010 cannes is ' more than glitz and glamour , ' german promoter says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at this year 's festival , 16 films are in competition the 63rd edition of the cannes film festival opens on may 12 .
how will german film fare at the world 's most important movie market ?
dw spoke with mariette rissenbeek from the organization german film service + marketing . just 19 films are in the running for the coveted palme d 'or at this year 's cannes film festival 's main competition , but hundreds more features and dozens of shorts will be shown over the course of the festival , which runs through may 23 .
aside from the main competition - which generally highlights films by well-known directors - there are parallel selections .
these include " un certain regard , " a showcase for film from younger or more unusual directors , films shown out of competition , special screenings , and cannes classics , among others . there are also longstanding and independent festivals that run parallel to the official event , such as the highly regarded directors ' fortnight , organized by the association of french film directors . deutsche welle : ms. rissenbeek , over the years the cannes film festival has earned quite a reputation as a hub of hype , where seeing and being seen is of primary importance .
is the festival still meaningful in the world of film ? marianne rissenbeek : cannes is no doubt the most important festival for film - and the most important market for films - up to today .
i think it is still the leading film market .
and a lot of the films in the official program are rather author-driven .
so it 's not only about glitz and glamour , but about filmmaking . last year a german-language film " das weisse band " -lrb- " the white ribbon " -rrb- won the palme d 'or .
coming out after " the lives of others " won the oscar in 2007 , it seemed to signal a sort of renaissance in german art film .
this year , though , there is just one german film in competition - and in fact it is a german-ukrainian-dutch co-production - " my joy , " by sergei loznitsa .
are the tides turning for german film ? well , " my joy " is indeed a german production , which a german producer has developed .
he developed the script together with the director , so it 's not only a co-production with a financial commitment from germany .
there was creative input and engagement from germany .
i don ’ t think we feel neglected or ignored by the festival selection committee . bildunterschrift : germany 's offer in this year 's competition is ' my joy , ' a co-production with ukraine and the netherlands what else is germany showing at the festival , either out of competition , or on the sidelines as part of the un certain regard series , or as part of the directors ' fortnight ? in un certain regard there are two german films , one from christoph hochhaeusler , called " unter dir die stadt " -lrb- " the city below " -rrb- , and the other one , " life , above all , " is a production that was developed in germany .
even though the director , oliver schmitz , is south african-german , he has both nationalities .
and then in the directors ' fortnight there is a german film , " picco , " by philip koch .
so actually we feel there is quite a strong presence from germany . what are you most looking forward to seeing or experiencing at this year 's festival ? well of course , for us it is more important to see how german films will do .
it will be exciting to see how christoph hochhaeusler has developed - he was at cannes a few years ago with another film .
it will be interesting to see how his film is received this year .
and " picco , " by philip koch , is a first film , so that is exciting too .
it is very seldom that you gain access to cannes with your first film , and then to the directors ' fortnight … the film will get a lot of publicity , so that 's good . and then maybe you noticed that the directors ' cut of " the tin drum " by volker schloendorff will be shown , 30 years after it was premiered in cannes .
i look forward to seeing how audiences react to that . there are a lot of films from asia in competition this year - south korea , thailand , taiwan .
what do you make of that ?
does it indicate anything about the future of european versus asian film ? cannes always had an input from asia , there were always asian films in the program , from china , or taiwan … i do n't think it 's new .
this year maybe the films were more interesting from asia , so they chose more for competition , but i could n't really say if it means anything . we have organized screenings in the market of 28 films overall , many of which have already been premiered elsewhere .
they all have special attributes , so it 's hard to say which ones will be most successful . -lrb- … -rrb- it used to be that you were guaranteed a certain number of contracts if you came to cannes , but since the financial crisis two years ago , that 's not true anymore .

dw spoke with mariette rissenbeek from the organization german film service + marketing . just 19 films are in the running for the coveted palme d 'or at this year 's cannes film festival 's main competition , but hundreds more features and dozens of shorts will be shown over the course of the festival , which runs through may 23 .
aside from the main competition - which generally highlights films by well-known directors - there are parallel selections .
these include " un certain regard , " a showcase for film from younger or more unusual directors , films shown out of competition , special screenings , and cannes classics , among others . there are also longstanding and independent festivals that run parallel to the official event , such as the highly regarded directors ' fortnight , organized by the association of french film directors . deutsche welle : ms. rissenbeek , over the years the cannes film festival has earned quite a reputation as a hub of hype , where seeing and being seen is of primary importance .

german chancellor angela merkel says its a good first step , but others say it goes too far . the european commission proposed that member countries submit their national budgets to brussels for " peer review " before they are sent on to their national parliaments .
" the package concerns the whole eu , but this specific proposal has more bite concerning the euro area countries , " european economic and monetary affairs commissioner olli rehn told reporters at a press conference in brussels .
the rules are aimed at avoiding a repeat of the greek debt crisis by preventing countries from over-spending .
the measures would apply to all members of the eu , not just the 16 nations that use the euro currency .
but many nations feel the eu is over-stepping its bounds by interfering in domestic politics .
france and sweden have both voiced their opposition to the measures . " that this should concern all countries is something we find a little strange , " swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt told a press conference in stockholm .
" this kind of discussion could perhaps be possible for -lrb- countries -rrb- with a budget policy that goes against the stability and growth pact , " he said . mixed message from berlin germany 's foreign minister , guido westerwelle , spoke out against the eu commission 's proposal , saying that national budgets belong to " the core of sovereignty . "
" the budget law is a matter of national parliaments .
the european commission does not determine the budget , that is the job of the german bundestag , the national parliament , " westerwelle told reporters in berlin .
however , chancellor angela merkel praised the eu 's attempts to crackdown on irresponsible spending , and said the budget measures did not necessarily usurp the powers of national parliaments . " i would say that the budgetary plans of the member states are not secret anyway , so the commission can already form an opinion about what governments put forward during budgetary debates , " merkel told reporters in berlin . sanctions possible european commission president jose manuel barosso was clear that he believed a unifying economic policy was inevitable for the euro 's survival .
" member states should have the courage to say whether they do want an economic union or not , because if they do not we better forget about a monetary union , " barosso said . bildunterschrift : the commission also threatened sanctions against countries that consistently breach the stability and growth pact , which stipulates that no country should run deficits higher than three per cent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
" let 's be clear - without sanctions it will not be enough for credibility , " he said .
barosso has said that cohesion funds could be withdrawn for countries that do n't comply , however , eurozone finance ministers would have to vote to approve any possible sanctions the eurozone is under pressure to strengthen its economic governance , after member state greece was forced to request 110 billion euros -lrb- $ 140-billion -rrb- from the eurozone countries and the imf to avoid defaulting on its debt. smh / afp / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decision has sparked a debate about how to protect the public from violent offenders . germany is under pressure to change its system of preventive detention , which allows for violent and repeat offenders to be detained indefinitely , even after they have served their sentence .
in december , the european court of human rights -lrb- echr -rrb- ruled that germany had violated the european human rights convention in the case of german inmate reinhard m. , who was convicted for attempted murder and had been kept in prison more than 10 years after his sentence .
the 52-year-old man had completed his five-year prison sentence in 1991 , but was not released , as he was deemed a danger to the public .
he was detained for the next 10 years , the maximum term for preventive detention at the time .
but a change in german legislation in 1998 meant that prisoners can now be detained indefinitely .
right to liberty the echr ruled that because reinhard m had been convicted before the change in the law in 1998 germany violated the ' right to liberty ' .
the court also stated that " there was no sufficient causal connection between his conviction and his continued deprivation of liberty . "
germany requested the case be referred to the echr 's grand chamber , which has now been refused , making the original court decision binding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 70 violent offenders in germany could benefit from the court ruling the echr can only tackle specific cases , but the ruling has already sparked a debate on how to protect the public from criminals convicted of murder , armed robbery , rape and other violent crimes .
" we need a comprehensive not an alarmist debate on the ramifications and options of today 's ruling -lsb- by the echr -rsb- , " justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger said in a statement on tuesday .
new framework the federal coalition agreement from last autumn calls for a reform of the current system , but the government has not released any details yet .
the bavarian justice minister , beate merk , however , has been vocal in calling for a complete overhaul of preventive detention in germany .
" a few band-aids here and there just will not do , " she said in a statement .
" we need a completely new system that can deal with violent offenders that are likely to reoffend and be a danger to the public even after they have served their sentence , " she added .
merk is adamant that some form of post-sentence detention is necessary , but she would like to see the sentence , ie the punishment , separated from the subsequent detention , with separate facilities and dedicated therapy options for violent criminals - one of the areas the echr had criticized as lacking in the current system .
longer sentences but some legal experts believe preventive detention is not the answer .
" the law has been extended in the past because of an unsubstantiated fear of crime , at a time when crime rates are going down in germany , and i do n't believe there is a need for it at all , " hermann kuehn , an expert in criminal law who runs his own law firm , told deutsche welle .
he would like to see longer sentences handed down instead .
currently , the maximum sentence is 15 years , unless a defendant is sentenced to life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's constitutional court endorsed retroactive preventive detention in 2004 " we could extend the fixed-term punishments to give courts the opportunity for a longer prison sentence and then leave it to the court to release him earlier if he is no longer a danger to society , " kuehn said .
he believes the power to release a potentially dangerous person should remain with the court , however .
he argues that leaving violent criminals to medical authorities for preventive detention by separating punishment from detention could be dangerous if you rely on medical staff alone to determine whether or not a detainee is a danger to society .

" we need a completely new system that can deal with violent offenders that are likely to reoffend and be a danger to the public even after they have served their sentence , " she added .
merk is adamant that some form of post-sentence detention is necessary , but she would like to see the sentence , ie the punishment , separated from the subsequent detention , with separate facilities and dedicated therapy options for violent criminals - one of the areas the echr had criticized as lacking in the current system .
longer sentences but some legal experts believe preventive detention is not the answer .
" the law has been extended in the past because of an unsubstantiated fear of crime , at a time when crime rates are going down in germany , and i do n't believe there is a need for it at all , " hermann kuehn , an expert in criminal law who runs his own law firm , told deutsche welle .
he would like to see longer sentences handed down instead .
currently , the maximum sentence is 15 years , unless a defendant is sentenced to life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's constitutional court endorsed retroactive preventive detention in 2004 " we could extend the fixed-term punishments to give courts the opportunity for a longer prison sentence and then leave it to the court to release him earlier if he is no longer a danger to society , " kuehn said .
he believes the power to release a potentially dangerous person should remain with the court , however .
he argues that leaving violent criminals to medical authorities for preventive detention by separating punishment from detention could be dangerous if you rely on medical staff alone to determine whether or not a detainee is a danger to society .

the decision has sparked a debate about how to protect the public from violent offenders . germany is under pressure to change its system of preventive detention , which allows for violent and repeat offenders to be detained indefinitely , even after they have served their sentence .
in december , the european court of human rights -lrb- echr -rrb- ruled that germany had violated the european human rights convention in the case of german inmate reinhard m. , who was convicted for attempted murder and had been kept in prison more than 10 years after his sentence .
the 52-year-old man had completed his five-year prison sentence in 1991 , but was not released , as he was deemed a danger to the public .
he was detained for the next 10 years , the maximum term for preventive detention at the time .
but a change in german legislation in 1998 meant that prisoners can now be detained indefinitely .
right to liberty the echr ruled that because reinhard m had been convicted before the change in the law in 1998 germany violated the ' right to liberty ' .
the court also stated that " there was no sufficient causal connection between his conviction and his continued deprivation of liberty . "
germany requested the case be referred to the echr 's grand chamber , which has now been refused , making the original court decision binding .

estonia is set to adopt the euro and plans to replace its currency , the kroon , on january 1 , 2011 .
the move would make the baltic country the 17th eurozone member . the european commission on wednesday said estonia 's economy is strong enough to join the euro zone .
estonia plans to switch to the shared european currency on january 1 , 2011 . the commission had examined estonia 's debt , deficit , inflation , and interest levels .
olli rehn , the eu commissioner for economic and budgetary affairs , said the country had achieved " a high degree of sustainable economic convergence " and was therefore ready to adopt the euro .
' prudent fiscal policy ' is key " to ensure that the adoption of the euro is a success , estonia must pursue its efforts to maintain a prudent fiscal policy stance , " he said .
he urged tallinn to " remain vigilant and react early and decisively " if problems emerge .
the commission 's positive assessment came in the wake of an enormous european bailout for greece , which shed new light on the importance of countries taking inflation-control measures .
countries are concerned that massive debt problems in the eurozone could make brussels wary of taking on a new member .
economic data adds up according to rehn , " the assessment and our proposal is also a strong signal about the euro area and to the eu more broadly , " testifying that sound economic policies such as those adopted by estonia " generate concrete results . "
estonia has had an average budget surplus of 1.8 percent of gross domestic product between 2002 to 2007 , deteriorating to a deficit of minus 2.7 percent in 2008 and minus 1.7 percent in 2009 as a result of the economic crisis .
that is still well within the eurozone 's threshold of 3 percent .
the brussels-based eu executive said the country 's " price performance -lsb- is -rsb- sustainable " as average inflation fell to minus 0.7 percent in the 12 months to march 2010 .
but it warned that " estonia " will need to remain vigilant to keep inflation at a low level . "
in order for estonia to be finally welcomed into the eurozone , wednesday 's approval will have to be confirmed by the eu 's finance ministers in july .
so far , no positive recommendation by the commission on eurozone enlargement has ever been contradicted by eu member states .
estonia shifted rapidly from a communist command economy to the free market after breaking from the crumbling soviet bloc in 1991 .
the 1.3-million-strong country had hoped to adopt the euro in 2007 , but failed to meet the inflation-control criteria at the time. jen / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the talks would focus on efforts by both the eu and the us to have the other party stop providing aid to airbus and boeing , respectively .
eu trade commissioner karel de gucht told reporters the bloc could start talks " immediately , " as long as there were no preconditions for future european government aid for airbus 's new a350 plane .
there are concerns that without state support airbus and boeing would struggle to develop large aircraft in the future .
at the heart of the dispute are subsidies paid by eu countries to airbus for the a350 .
germany alone pledged 1.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- to airbus for the new jetliner , which is seen as a possible future market rival for the boeing 787 dreamliner .
the us had filed a case with the world trade organization years ago which led to european governments being called on to stop providing such aid .
airbus argues the wto verdict does not apply to the a350 as it was handed down prior to the plane 's development .
the wto decision was only the first part of the long-running saga , with another ruling on a counter-complaint brought by the eu against us aid for boeing expected later this year .
us trade officials also said they were ready to hold talks , " but any productive discussions must necessarily address all wto-inconsistent subsidies to civil aircraft , " ustr spokeswoman nefeterius mcpherson said. dfm / afp / reuters editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

brussels believes germany 's tough debt-reduction measures , enshrined in the constitution , could be a model for other eu states .
in the wednesday edition of the german weekly , die zeit , rehn said brussels should have greater powers and be able to monitor the national budgets of eu nations .
he said regulations must be put in place to make this possible .
" we want governments to send their budget outlines to brussels for review before they are approved by their national parliaments , " rehn said .
" we can then see early whether a country is adhering to the stability and growth pact .
if not , we would intervene , " he said .
berlin has rejected such measures , however , saying it would impact on its budget sovereignty .
many eurozone nations in trouble - in particular greece , spain , and portugal - have accumulated budget deficits vastly exceeding the three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- permitted by the stability and growth pact .
the pact is meant to ensure the stability of the economic and monetary union .
german debt-trimming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehn favors the german debt-reduction model rehn also told die zeit that he believed germany 's plans for debt reduction could serve as a model for other eu nations .
in 2009 , berlin passed a constitutional amendment making it illegal for the federal government to run structural deficits more than 0.35 percent of gdp per annum from 2016 , while from 2020 , germany 's federal states will not be allowed to run any deficit at all .
germany this year is expected to reach a record debt of more than five percent of gdp , but has plans to start reducing this from 2011 .
greece , which has a crippling budget deficit of nearly 14 percent of national income , this month became the first eu nation to receive billions of euros in a rescue package to prevent it from defaulting on its debts .
" it does n't touch greece alone , " rehn said in brussels earlier this month .
" it has to do with the eurozone as a whole . "
the eu commission has warned nations to rein in their spending , including france and italy , which until now have held back from introducing unpopular budget cuts .
750-billion-euro package the economic turbulence in some eu nations has led speculators and investors to target the euro , which has in the past weeks fallen to its lowest levels against the us dollar in more than 14 months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commission chief wants greater control over national budgets eu finance ministers on monday announced a rescue package of up to 500 billion euros -lrb- $ 632 billion -rrb- to protect the euro , as market speculators increasingly targeted the currency and began betting on its collapse . the international monetary fund is to provide a further 250 billion euros .
" we will defend the stability of the euro at any price , " rehn said earlier monday .
meanwhile , in a rare interview , john taylor , a hedge fund speculator who made big profits in 1992 when speculators bet against the british pound , told bloomberg tv that a fall in the value of the euro was inevitable .
" the euro is a poor design and ca n't continue like this .
it 's quite easy to see that the euro will become much weaker , " taylor told bloomberg tv .
micheal leister , a strategist at the westlb bank in dusseldorf , said hedge fund speculators may well make big profits by betting on currency fluctuations , but that they alone couldn ’ t shake the euro .

germany this year is expected to reach a record debt of more than five percent of gdp , but has plans to start reducing this from 2011 .
greece , which has a crippling budget deficit of nearly 14 percent of national income , this month became the first eu nation to receive billions of euros in a rescue package to prevent it from defaulting on its debts .
" it does n't touch greece alone , " rehn said in brussels earlier this month .

brussels believes germany 's tough debt-reduction measures , enshrined in the constitution , could be a model for other eu states .
in the wednesday edition of the german weekly , die zeit , rehn said brussels should have greater powers and be able to monitor the national budgets of eu nations .
he said regulations must be put in place to make this possible .
" we want governments to send their budget outlines to brussels for review before they are approved by their national parliaments , " rehn said .
" we can then see early whether a country is adhering to the stability and growth pact .
if not , we would intervene , " he said .
berlin has rejected such measures , however , saying it would impact on its budget sovereignty .
many eurozone nations in trouble - in particular greece , spain , and portugal - have accumulated budget deficits vastly exceeding the three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- permitted by the stability and growth pact .
the pact is meant to ensure the stability of the economic and monetary union .

how will german film fare at the world 's most important movie market ?
dw spoke with mariette rissenbeek from the organization german film service + marketing . just 19 films are in the running for the coveted palme d 'or at this year 's cannes film festival 's main competition , but hundreds more features and dozens of shorts will be shown over the course of the festival , which runs through may 23 .
aside from the main competition - which generally highlights films by well-known directors - there are parallel selections .
these include " un certain regard , " a showcase for film from younger or more unusual directors , films shown out of competition , special screenings , and cannes classics , among others . there are also longstanding and independent festivals that run parallel to the official event , such as the highly regarded directors ' fortnight , organized by the association of french film directors . deutsche welle : ms. rissenbeek , over the years the cannes film festival has earned quite a reputation as a hub of hype , where seeing and being seen is of primary importance .
is the festival still meaningful in the world of film ? marianne rissenbeek : cannes is no doubt the most important festival for film - and the most important market for films - up to today .
i think it is still the leading film market .
and a lot of the films in the official program are rather author-driven .
so it 's not only about glitz and glamour , but about filmmaking . last year a german-language film " das weisse band " -lrb- " the white ribbon " -rrb- won the palme d 'or .
coming out after " the lives of others " won the oscar in 2007 , it seemed to signal a sort of renaissance in german art film .
this year , though , there is just one german film in competition - and in fact it is a german-ukrainian-dutch co-production - " my joy , " by sergei loznitsa .
are the tides turning for german film ? well , " my joy " is indeed a german production , which a german producer has developed .
he developed the script together with the director , so it 's not only a co-production with a financial commitment from germany .

even though the director , oliver schmitz , is south african-german , he has both nationalities .
and then in the directors ' fortnight there is a german film , " picco , " by philip koch .
so actually we feel there is quite a strong presence from germany . what are you most looking forward to seeing or experiencing at this year 's festival ? well of course , for us it is more important to see how german films will do .
it will be exciting to see how christoph hochhaeusler has developed - he was at cannes a few years ago with another film .

the win in hamburg was atletico 's first european trophy . the spanish capital 's perpetual bridesmaid club atletico madrid became the center of attention this wednesday , outlasting fulham in extra time and winning the inaugural europa league trophy .
diego forlan of uruguay scored both goals for atletico , and was set up on both occasions by his argentine strike partner sergio " kun " aguero .
four minutes from time in the second extra time period , forlan got a glancing heel to aguero 's cross from the left byline , which was enough to dribble in for a goal after a deflection off of defender brede hangeland 's thigh .
it was a scrappy ending to a scrappy game , but one which most observers , including atletico defender tomas ujfalusi , felt was deserved .
" we fought for 120 minutes , and got the goals we needed from our best player , " said the defender , who was returning to what was his home stadium for four years as a bundesliga player .
ujfalusi had never won a trophy in his career , which has taken him from olomouc in the czech republic to hamburg to florence to madrid , and was clearly moved after the match .
" it 's for moments like this that we play football .
it 's an unbelievable feeling , " he said .
bildunterschrift : fulham 's goalkeeper mark schwarzer was unlucky to lose his second european final the build-up the match did n't catch fire until the 32nd minute , and even then did n't do so with much elegance .
aguero scuffed his left-footed shot attempt from the edge of the penalty box .
luckily for him , though , forlan was streaking into the area just then , and stuck out his boot to one-time the ball for a 1-0 lead .
but the travelling fulham fans did n't have long to wait before their side had evened the score - in similarly disjointed fashion .
a slip from an atletico defender meant bobby zamora found himself free on the left wing , but a poor touch robbed him of the chance to shoot as he came inside .
zoltan gera , however , was in place to cross the ball back out to the wing , where simon davies was waiting and scored with a neat volley .
not long after halftime , fulham 's goal-scoring hero bobby zamora succumbed to the ankle injury that had kept him out of fabio capello 's provisional england squad at midweek , forcing him out of the game .
his replacement , clint dempsey nearly put fulham in front within minutes of entering , but saw his shot parried by the atletico keeper - and was subsequently called for offside .
as the match wore on , atletico began to dominate possession , but had little to show for it as they failed to put many shots on target .

fulham looked livelier in the second extra time , earning free kicks in dangerous positions through the enterprising runs of dempsey and gera , but it was atletico who tipped the game 's balance in their favor as the madrid side 's dynamic south american duo struck again to end the game .
the loss was a particularly bitter one for fulham 's goalkeeper , australia 's mark schwarzer .
in 2006 he had led middlesborough to the final of the uefa cup -lrb- the forerunner tournament to the europa league -rrb- , only to fall to sevilla .
" when you look at the goals , you 'll see how unlucky we were , " said schwarzer .
" we had the game in our hands , had our own chances , and hoped that would be enough .
but it did n't turn out that way . "

the win in hamburg was atletico 's first european trophy . the spanish capital 's perpetual bridesmaid club atletico madrid became the center of attention this wednesday , outlasting fulham in extra time and winning the inaugural europa league trophy .
diego forlan of uruguay scored both goals for atletico , and was set up on both occasions by his argentine strike partner sergio " kun " aguero .
four minutes from time in the second extra time period , forlan got a glancing heel to aguero 's cross from the left byline , which was enough to dribble in for a goal after a deflection off of defender brede hangeland 's thigh .
it was a scrappy ending to a scrappy game , but one which most observers , including atletico defender tomas ujfalusi , felt was deserved .
" we fought for 120 minutes , and got the goals we needed from our best player , " said the defender , who was returning to what was his home stadium for four years as a bundesliga player .
ujfalusi had never won a trophy in his career , which has taken him from olomouc in the czech republic to hamburg to florence to madrid , and was clearly moved after the match .
" it 's for moments like this that we play football .
it 's an unbelievable feeling , " he said .
bildunterschrift : fulham 's goalkeeper mark schwarzer was unlucky to lose his second european final the build-up the match did n't catch fire until the 32nd minute , and even then did n't do so with much elegance .
aguero scuffed his left-footed shot attempt from the edge of the penalty box .
luckily for him , though , forlan was streaking into the area just then , and stuck out his boot to one-time the ball for a 1-0 lead .
but the travelling fulham fans did n't have long to wait before their side had evened the score - in similarly disjointed fashion .

the win in hamburg was atletico 's first european trophy . the spanish capital 's perpetual bridesmaid club atletico madrid became the center of attention this wednesday , outlasting fulham in extra time and winning the inaugural europa league trophy .
diego forlan of uruguay scored both goals for atletico , and was set up on both occasions by his argentine strike partner sergio " kun " aguero .
four minutes from time in the second extra time period , forlan got a glancing heel to aguero 's cross from the left byline , which was enough to dribble in for a goal after a deflection off of defender brede hangeland 's thigh .
it was a scrappy ending to a scrappy game , but one which most observers , including atletico defender tomas ujfalusi , felt was deserved .
" we fought for 120 minutes , and got the goals we needed from our best player , " said the defender , who was returning to what was his home stadium for four years as a bundesliga player .
ujfalusi had never won a trophy in his career , which has taken him from olomouc in the czech republic to hamburg to florence to madrid , and was clearly moved after the match .
" it 's for moments like this that we play football .
it 's an unbelievable feeling , " he said .
bildunterschrift : fulham 's goalkeeper mark schwarzer was unlucky to lose his second european final the build-up the match did n't catch fire until the 32nd minute , and even then did n't do so with much elegance .
aguero scuffed his left-footed shot attempt from the edge of the penalty box .
luckily for him , though , forlan was streaking into the area just then , and stuck out his boot to one-time the ball for a 1-0 lead .
but the travelling fulham fans did n't have long to wait before their side had evened the score - in similarly disjointed fashion .
a slip from an atletico defender meant bobby zamora found himself free on the left wing , but a poor touch robbed him of the chance to shoot as he came inside .
zoltan gera , however , was in place to cross the ball back out to the wing , where simon davies was waiting and scored with a neat volley .
not long after halftime , fulham 's goal-scoring hero bobby zamora succumbed to the ankle injury that had kept him out of fabio capello 's provisional england squad at midweek , forcing him out of the game .
his replacement , clint dempsey nearly put fulham in front within minutes of entering , but saw his shot parried by the atletico keeper - and was subsequently called for offside .
as the match wore on , atletico began to dominate possession , but had little to show for it as they failed to put many shots on target .
extended play bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fulham picked up the pace in extra time the second half came to a close and the match entered extra time , but the spanish side 's control of the ball continued .
forlan and aguero nearly linked up for another go-ahead strike at the end of the first period , but this time it was the argentine on the end of the chance , and he pushed the ball wide .
fulham looked livelier in the second extra time , earning free kicks in dangerous positions through the enterprising runs of dempsey and gera , but it was atletico who tipped the game 's balance in their favor as the madrid side 's dynamic south american duo struck again to end the game .
the loss was a particularly bitter one for fulham 's goalkeeper , australia 's mark schwarzer .
in 2006 he had led middlesborough to the final of the uefa cup -lrb- the forerunner tournament to the europa league -rrb- , only to fall to sevilla .
" when you look at the goals , you 'll see how unlucky we were , " said schwarzer .
" we had the game in our hands , had our own chances , and hoped that would be enough .
but it did n't turn out that way . "

german chancellor angela merkel phoned david cameron on wednesday to congratulate him , and invited him to visit germany soon for more comprehensive talks , according to a government spokesman in berlin .
in brussels , european union officials hope the liberal democrats ' presence in the new coalition will soften the tories ' traditionally euroskeptic stance , and help quieten hardline backbenchers within the center-right party .
european commission president jose manuel barroso also congratulated david cameron , saying his government faced difficult choices in difficult times .
" what i hope is that the british prime minister will of course defend -lsb- his country 's -rsb- national interests in the european setting , " barroso told reporters in brussels , saying he was not concerned by conservative election manifesto pledges to claw back powers from brussels .
uncertain stance but no one in brussels is quite certain how far the new british government will go in defending its national interests , especially now that the liberal democrats form a part of its leadership .
as the country grapples with a runaway national debt and budget deficit , many in brussels believe that europe is not the top priority for the new conservative-led government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has the reputation of being a reluctant eu member " cameron has far too much on his plate to think about picking a fight with europe , " the european policy center 's -lrb- epc -rrb- acting director of studies , john wyles , told deutsche welle .
" and providing there is nothing major in the policy pipeline here -lsb- in brussels -rsb- , he is certainly not going to be looking for a fight . "
wyles also expects the conservatives and liberal democrats not to fight over european policy in the short term , partly because the liberal democrats have been sufficiently vague on the issue in their manifesto .
the message filtering through to brussels from london , according to wyles , is that david cameron 's approach will be entirely pragmatic on europe and relatively low key .
and so far , the new british government has signaled it will be ' business as usual ' as far as the european union is concerned .
conservatives remain a concern still , eu officials are keeping a watchful eye on britain 's new foreign secretary , william hague , who has been playing down policy differences over the european union within the new coalition .
hague did rule out further european integration for britain , telling reporters it was a " red line " for his party , but he focussed more on the agreements reached in negotiations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservatives have no plans to join the single european currency " the liberal democrats have readily agreed with us that it will not be the policy of this government to join the euro or to propose to join the euro in its lifetime , " former conservative party leader hague said .
" look , all british governments sometimes face difficulties over european policy . "
cameron pulled his conservatives out of the main center-right grouping in the european parliament , the european people 's party , because hardline conservatives deemed the group too pro-european .
but the epc 's john wyles believes that while this sounded some alarm bells in brussels , it 's unwise to over-analyze the decision .
" that was just a piece of red meat that -lsb- cameron -rsb- felt he needed to toss to the euroskeptic majority in order to get elected , " wyles said .
" it was not well judged , and it has created a lot of resentment against the conservatives among the center-right in europe , but they will get over that - i think many of them have largely got over it already . "
some in brussels even believe the conservatives will find their way back to the european people 's party , but john wyles said that this is an unlikely scenario .
he believes the new prime minister will have to strike a balance on europe - keeping hardline euroskeptics on board , while simultaneously staying sufficiently pragmatic to further britain 's interests on the continent .

german chancellor angela merkel phoned david cameron on wednesday to congratulate him , and invited him to visit germany soon for more comprehensive talks , according to a government spokesman in berlin .
in brussels , european union officials hope the liberal democrats ' presence in the new coalition will soften the tories ' traditionally euroskeptic stance , and help quieten hardline backbenchers within the center-right party .
european commission president jose manuel barroso also congratulated david cameron , saying his government faced difficult choices in difficult times .
" what i hope is that the british prime minister will of course defend -lsb- his country 's -rsb- national interests in the european setting , " barroso told reporters in brussels , saying he was not concerned by conservative election manifesto pledges to claw back powers from brussels .
uncertain stance but no one in brussels is quite certain how far the new british government will go in defending its national interests , especially now that the liberal democrats form a part of its leadership .
as the country grapples with a runaway national debt and budget deficit , many in brussels believe that europe is not the top priority for the new conservative-led government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has the reputation of being a reluctant eu member " cameron has far too much on his plate to think about picking a fight with europe , " the european policy center 's -lrb- epc -rrb- acting director of studies , john wyles , told deutsche welle .
" and providing there is nothing major in the policy pipeline here -lsb- in brussels -rsb- , he is certainly not going to be looking for a fight . "
wyles also expects the conservatives and liberal democrats not to fight over european policy in the short term , partly because the liberal democrats have been sufficiently vague on the issue in their manifesto .
the message filtering through to brussels from london , according to wyles , is that david cameron 's approach will be entirely pragmatic on europe and relatively low key .
and so far , the new british government has signaled it will be ' business as usual ' as far as the european union is concerned .
conservatives remain a concern still , eu officials are keeping a watchful eye on britain 's new foreign secretary , william hague , who has been playing down policy differences over the european union within the new coalition .
hague did rule out further european integration for britain , telling reporters it was a " red line " for his party , but he focussed more on the agreements reached in negotiations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservatives have no plans to join the single european currency " the liberal democrats have readily agreed with us that it will not be the policy of this government to join the euro or to propose to join the euro in its lifetime , " former conservative party leader hague said .
" look , all british governments sometimes face difficulties over european policy . "
cameron pulled his conservatives out of the main center-right grouping in the european parliament , the european people 's party , because hardline conservatives deemed the group too pro-european .
but the epc 's john wyles believes that while this sounded some alarm bells in brussels , it 's unwise to over-analyze the decision .
" that was just a piece of red meat that -lsb- cameron -rsb- felt he needed to toss to the euroskeptic majority in order to get elected , " wyles said .
" it was not well judged , and it has created a lot of resentment against the conservatives among the center-right in europe , but they will get over that - i think many of them have largely got over it already . "
some in brussels even believe the conservatives will find their way back to the european people 's party , but john wyles said that this is an unlikely scenario .
he believes the new prime minister will have to strike a balance on europe - keeping hardline euroskeptics on board , while simultaneously staying sufficiently pragmatic to further britain 's interests on the continent .

he was speaking following his talks with afghan president hamid karzai in washington . president obama said relations between the two governments were " strong " and would endure and that the tensions had been exaggerated . " with respect to perceived tensions between the us government and the afghan government , a lot of them were simply overstated , " said obama . he said the two sides renewed their goal to defeat al qaeda and its extremist allies . for his part , karzai told reporters that he had " frank and productive " discussions with president obama and the relations between the united states and afghanistan were much stronger now .
" we are much more strongly related to each other today than we ever were before . " he also said the us has committed to reducing civilian casualties in afghanistan , an issue that has strained their relations in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan 's president hamid karzai , left , and secretary of state hillary clinton reassurance to provide security in the first of a series of meetings , afghan president hamid karzai on tuesday met us secretary of state hillary clinton who reassured him that the us would remain committed to providing security in afghanistan even after us troops have left . " as we look toward a responsible , orderly transition in the international combat mission in afghanistan , we will not abandon the afghan people , " clinton said .
karzai , meanwhile , reiterated that his country would stick to its responsibility to further develop afghanistan 's civilian and democratic structures . the us commitment should serve as a reassurance to karzai , whose visit comes as relations between afghanistan and the west have cooled in recent months .
last month , following a visit by obama to kabul in late march , karzai slammed the un and the international community , accusing them of perpetrating a " vast fraud " in last year 's presidential elections as part of a conspiracy to undermine his victory .
he said western coalition troops risked being seen as invaders rather than saviours of his country .
while many observers put it down to an attempt by a politically weakened karzai to assert his legitimacy in afghanistan , the unusually harsh outburst sparked criticism in western capitals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us , nato and afghan forces are preparing for a major offensive in kandahar critical juncture " karzai 's visit to the us is highly significant .
it will help the us government show the political community in washington that it still has control over karzai .
it shows that karzai depends on the international community for his political survival .
and it also shows that the west has no viable alternative to karzai in afghanistan , " henning riecke , an analyst at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" from the afghan government point of view , this visit which takes place at a sensitive time , is extremely important , " waheed omar , karzai 's spokesman told reporters last week .

the british newspaper the guardian reported recently that afghanistan is proposing to offer top taliban leaders exile if they agree to stop fighting against the government .
the newspaper refered to a document suggesting insurgent leaders could face " potential exile in a third country . "
it also calls for " deradicalisation " classes for insurgents and thousands of new manual jobs to be created for taliban fighters who lay down their arms .
plans to reach out to the taliban are n't now .
in a shift in strategy , most western nations now accept that any political solution to the afghanistan conflict must include moderate elements of the taliban .
earlier this year , german foreign minister guido westerwelle drummed up support for an " exit program " for taliban fighters funded by the international community .

european involvement observers say that though european allies lack the political clout the us has in afghanistan , the talks in washington are being followed carefully across the atlantic .
" on hard political questions , europe is out of the picture in afghanistan .
we do n't have the same credibility as the us because we are n't taking the same risks as the us .
but at the same time , europe has a long-term interest in institution-building in afghanistan .
so the talks in the us remain important to europe 's future role -lrb- in afghanistan -rrb- , " pothier said .
many european governments are grappling with waning support at home for the war in afghanistan as troop casualties rise .
experts say it stands to reason that good ties between kabul and washington would help obama fulfill his pledge to start bringing us troops home in mid-2011 - and thus signal the way for an end in sight to the afghan engagement .
" when obama announced he would begin a partial withdrawal of troops in mid-2011 it was greeted with cheer in europe .
it was interpreted here as a possible end of the deployment .
but that 's not what it 's going to be .
we can expect some tough discussions and friction between the us and its european allies later in november this year when american generals review the success of the surge , " riecke said .

the expert pointed out that a host of events in afghanistan this year - the peace conference , a foreign donor nations meeting in july , parliamentary elections in september - offer a chance for the west to pursue a different script in afghanistan .

he was speaking following his talks with afghan president hamid karzai in washington . president obama said relations between the two governments were " strong " and would endure and that the tensions had been exaggerated . " with respect to perceived tensions between the us government and the afghan government , a lot of them were simply overstated , " said obama . he said the two sides renewed their goal to defeat al qaeda and its extremist allies . for his part , karzai told reporters that he had " frank and productive " discussions with president obama and the relations between the united states and afghanistan were much stronger now .
" we are much more strongly related to each other today than we ever were before . " he also said the us has committed to reducing civilian casualties in afghanistan , an issue that has strained their relations in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan 's president hamid karzai , left , and secretary of state hillary clinton reassurance to provide security in the first of a series of meetings , afghan president hamid karzai on tuesday met us secretary of state hillary clinton who reassured him that the us would remain committed to providing security in afghanistan even after us troops have left . " as we look toward a responsible , orderly transition in the international combat mission in afghanistan , we will not abandon the afghan people , " clinton said .
karzai , meanwhile , reiterated that his country would stick to its responsibility to further develop afghanistan 's civilian and democratic structures . the us commitment should serve as a reassurance to karzai , whose visit comes as relations between afghanistan and the west have cooled in recent months .
last month , following a visit by obama to kabul in late march , karzai slammed the un and the international community , accusing them of perpetrating a " vast fraud " in last year 's presidential elections as part of a conspiracy to undermine his victory .
he said western coalition troops risked being seen as invaders rather than saviours of his country .
while many observers put it down to an attempt by a politically weakened karzai to assert his legitimacy in afghanistan , the unusually harsh outburst sparked criticism in western capitals .

" the americans are ambivalent about bringing the taliban to the table due to their links with al qaeda .
it 's heightened after the botched bombing at times square , " fabrice pothier , head of carnegie europe , a forum for european policymakers and think-tanks , told deutsche welle . " any agreement with the taliban has to involve security guarantees on both sides - the taliban must sever links with al qaeda and the us must guarantee that taliban fighters wo n't be imprisoned or killed .
for the us president , justifying making a deal with the taliban is a hard sell at home . "
european involvement observers say that though european allies lack the political clout the us has in afghanistan , the talks in washington are being followed carefully across the atlantic .
" on hard political questions , europe is out of the picture in afghanistan .
we do n't have the same credibility as the us because we are n't taking the same risks as the us .

many european governments are grappling with waning support at home for the war in afghanistan as troop casualties rise .
experts say it stands to reason that good ties between kabul and washington would help obama fulfill his pledge to start bringing us troops home in mid-2011 - and thus signal the way for an end in sight to the afghan engagement .
" when obama announced he would begin a partial withdrawal of troops in mid-2011 it was greeted with cheer in europe .
it was interpreted here as a possible end of the deployment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 12.05.2010 obama , karzai reaffirm commitment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president barack obama , right , shakes hands with afghan president hamid karzai us president barack obama has praised the " broad and deepening " us partnership with afghanistan and reaffirmed the us commitment to build a secure and stable afghanistan .
he was speaking following his talks with afghan president hamid karzai in washington . president obama said relations between the two governments were " strong " and would endure and that the tensions had been exaggerated . " with respect to perceived tensions between the us government and the afghan government , a lot of them were simply overstated , " said obama . he said the two sides renewed their goal to defeat al qaeda and its extremist allies . for his part , karzai told reporters that he had " frank and productive " discussions with president obama and the relations between the united states and afghanistan were much stronger now .
" we are much more strongly related to each other today than we ever were before . " he also said the us has committed to reducing civilian casualties in afghanistan , an issue that has strained their relations in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan 's president hamid karzai , left , and secretary of state hillary clinton reassurance to provide security in the first of a series of meetings , afghan president hamid karzai on tuesday met us secretary of state hillary clinton who reassured him that the us would remain committed to providing security in afghanistan even after us troops have left . " as we look toward a responsible , orderly transition in the international combat mission in afghanistan , we will not abandon the afghan people , " clinton said .
karzai , meanwhile , reiterated that his country would stick to its responsibility to further develop afghanistan 's civilian and democratic structures . the us commitment should serve as a reassurance to karzai , whose visit comes as relations between afghanistan and the west have cooled in recent months .
last month , following a visit by obama to kabul in late march , karzai slammed the un and the international community , accusing them of perpetrating a " vast fraud " in last year 's presidential elections as part of a conspiracy to undermine his victory .
he said western coalition troops risked being seen as invaders rather than saviours of his country .
while many observers put it down to an attempt by a politically weakened karzai to assert his legitimacy in afghanistan , the unusually harsh outburst sparked criticism in western capitals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us , nato and afghan forces are preparing for a major offensive in kandahar critical juncture " karzai 's visit to the us is highly significant .
it will help the us government show the political community in washington that it still has control over karzai .
it shows that karzai depends on the international community for his political survival .
and it also shows that the west has no viable alternative to karzai in afghanistan , " henning riecke , an analyst at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" from the afghan government point of view , this visit which takes place at a sensitive time , is extremely important , " waheed omar , karzai 's spokesman told reporters last week .
it comes amid a us military surge in afghanistan and ahead of a major offensive against militants in the southern afghan province of kandahar .
the talks in washington also take place amid mounting anger in afghanistan against rising civilian casualties and dwindling public support for the afghan mission in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say distinguishing between who 's moderate and who 's not in the taliban will be tricky tricky talks with the taliban a peace conference , or jirga , to forge a national consensus on how to reconcile with the taliban is to take place later this month in kabul .
the british newspaper the guardian reported recently that afghanistan is proposing to offer top taliban leaders exile if they agree to stop fighting against the government .
the newspaper refered to a document suggesting insurgent leaders could face " potential exile in a third country . "
it also calls for " deradicalisation " classes for insurgents and thousands of new manual jobs to be created for taliban fighters who lay down their arms .
plans to reach out to the taliban are n't now .
in a shift in strategy , most western nations now accept that any political solution to the afghanistan conflict must include moderate elements of the taliban .
earlier this year , german foreign minister guido westerwelle drummed up support for an " exit program " for taliban fighters funded by the international community .
but some point out that the country that finds it the hardest to embrace talks with the taliban is the us .
" the americans are ambivalent about bringing the taliban to the table due to their links with al qaeda .

ecb president jean-claude trichet claims he had no other option . credibility is sacred to powerful monetary watchdogs like the us federal reserve , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- and germany 's bundesbank .
it 's something precious , central bankers are quick to admit , that is hard to earn but easy to lose .
perhaps no one knows that better than jean-claude trichet , an architect of the euro who oversaw the french central bank 's deliverance from political control in the 1990s .
the ecb president is waging the battle of his career to preserve the reputation of the bank , which he and his predecessor , former dutch central banker and european monetary institute president wim duisenberg , helped build .
the outcome is all but clear .
an unprecedented move to rescue the euro trichet has been under fire ever since eurozone finance ministers agreed over the weekend to launch an unprecedented aid package worth 750 billion euros -lrb- $ 1 trillion -rrb- .
the scheme is designed to rescue the euro as the effects of the greek fiscal crisis spill over into other indebted nations in the eurozone .
in a nutshell , it allows the ecb to buy government bonds issued by eurozone nations in financial trouble .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb president trichet is hearing plenty of criticism about the bank 's euro rescue move analysts argue the move has comprised the central bank 's independence ; the bank would effectively be buying government debt , giving governments a freer hand in raising money when it should actually be policing their efforts to do so .
trichet has vigorously defended the move .
at a press conference in basel , he said the central bank 's monetary policy was " hampered " and that a number of markets were " dysfunctional . "
and with an eye to critics , he said that the central bank has always been and will always be " fiercely and totally independent . "
critics , indeed , are in no short supply .
numerous monetary experts accuse the ecb 's 22-member council of bowing to political pressure from the european union and the 16 eurozone nations .
" significant stability risks " among the more outspoken and high-profile critics is bundesbank president alex weber , who is a leading candidate to succeed trichet next year .
in an interview with germany 's boersen zeitung , weber said that the purchase of government bonds " poses significant stability risks . "
he criticized the ecb council 's decision " even in this extraordinary situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans want the euro to remain a strong currency in a message to investors , david zervos , managing director of jefferies & co investment bank in new york , said that for all the attempts by the ecb to remain independent , it was unable " to push back on the eu power base in a crisis period . "
zervos warned that this development could make the eurozone " far less stable in any crisis times than a traditional national union . "
trichet realizes that ecb 's credibility is tightly linked to the bank 's independence and that any u-turns could soften the euro .
he knows all too well that if there 's anything europeans do n't want - especially many germans who still mourn the loss of their beloved deutschmark - it is a weak , suffering currency .
citizens of euro nations have every reason to be concerned : tuesday saw the euro retreat against the dollar as euphoria over the massive eurozone bailout announced on monday gave way to continuing doubts over the ability of euro nations to reduce their deficits .

"
zervos warned that this development could make the eurozone " far less stable in any crisis times than a traditional national union . "
trichet realizes that ecb 's credibility is tightly linked to the bank 's independence and that any u-turns could soften the euro .

estonia is set to adopt the euro and plans to replace its currency , the kroon , on january 1 , 2011 .
the move would make the baltic country the 17th eurozone member . the european commission on wednesday said estonia 's economy is strong enough to join the euro zone .
estonia plans to switch to the shared european currency on january 1 , 2011 . the commission had examined estonia 's debt , deficit , inflation , and interest levels .
olli rehn , the eu commissioner for economic and budgetary affairs , said the country had achieved " a high degree of sustainable economic convergence " and was therefore ready to adopt the euro .
' prudent fiscal policy ' is key " to ensure that the adoption of the euro is a success , estonia must pursue its efforts to maintain a prudent fiscal policy stance , " he said .
he urged tallinn to " remain vigilant and react early and decisively " if problems emerge .
the commission 's positive assessment came in the wake of an enormous european bailout for greece , which shed new light on the importance of countries taking inflation-control measures .
countries are concerned that massive debt problems in the eurozone could make brussels wary of taking on a new member .
economic data adds up according to rehn , " the assessment and our proposal is also a strong signal about the euro area and to the eu more broadly , " testifying that sound economic policies such as those adopted by estonia " generate concrete results . "
estonia has had an average budget surplus of 1.8 percent of gross domestic product between 2002 to 2007 , deteriorating to a deficit of minus 2.7 percent in 2008 and minus 1.7 percent in 2009 as a result of the economic crisis .
that is still well within the eurozone 's threshold of 3 percent .
the brussels-based eu executive said the country 's " price performance -lsb- is -rsb- sustainable " as average inflation fell to minus 0.7 percent in the 12 months to march 2010 .
but it warned that " estonia " will need to remain vigilant to keep inflation at a low level . "
in order for estonia to be finally welcomed into the eurozone , wednesday 's approval will have to be confirmed by the eu 's finance ministers in july .
so far , no positive recommendation by the commission on eurozone enlargement has ever been contradicted by eu member states .
estonia shifted rapidly from a communist command economy to the free market after breaking from the crumbling soviet bloc in 1991 .
the 1.3-million-strong country had hoped to adopt the euro in 2007 , but failed to meet the inflation-control criteria at the time. jen / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

estonia is set to adopt the euro and plans to replace its currency , the kroon , on january 1 , 2011 .
the move would make the baltic country the 17th eurozone member . the european commission on wednesday said estonia 's economy is strong enough to join the euro zone .
estonia plans to switch to the shared european currency on january 1 , 2011 . the commission had examined estonia 's debt , deficit , inflation , and interest levels .
olli rehn , the eu commissioner for economic and budgetary affairs , said the country had achieved " a high degree of sustainable economic convergence " and was therefore ready to adopt the euro .
' prudent fiscal policy ' is key " to ensure that the adoption of the euro is a success , estonia must pursue its efforts to maintain a prudent fiscal policy stance , " he said .
he urged tallinn to " remain vigilant and react early and decisively " if problems emerge .
the commission 's positive assessment came in the wake of an enormous european bailout for greece , which shed new light on the importance of countries taking inflation-control measures .
countries are concerned that massive debt problems in the eurozone could make brussels wary of taking on a new member .
economic data adds up according to rehn , " the assessment and our proposal is also a strong signal about the euro area and to the eu more broadly , " testifying that sound economic policies such as those adopted by estonia " generate concrete results . "
estonia has had an average budget surplus of 1.8 percent of gross domestic product between 2002 to 2007 , deteriorating to a deficit of minus 2.7 percent in 2008 and minus 1.7 percent in 2009 as a result of the economic crisis .
that is still well within the eurozone 's threshold of 3 percent .
the brussels-based eu executive said the country 's " price performance -lsb- is -rsb- sustainable " as average inflation fell to minus 0.7 percent in the 12 months to march 2010 .
but it warned that " estonia " will need to remain vigilant to keep inflation at a low level . "
in order for estonia to be finally welcomed into the eurozone , wednesday 's approval will have to be confirmed by the eu 's finance ministers in july .
so far , no positive recommendation by the commission on eurozone enlargement has ever been contradicted by eu member states .
estonia shifted rapidly from a communist command economy to the free market after breaking from the crumbling soviet bloc in 1991 .
the 1.3-million-strong country had hoped to adopt the euro in 2007 , but failed to meet the inflation-control criteria at the time. jen / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german chancellor angela merkel says its a good first step , but others say it goes too far . the european commission proposed that member countries submit their national budgets to brussels for " peer review " before they are sent on to their national parliaments .
" the package concerns the whole eu , but this specific proposal has more bite concerning the euro area countries , " european economic and monetary affairs commissioner olli rehn told reporters at a press conference in brussels .

german chancellor angela merkel says its a good first step , but others say it goes too far . the european commission proposed that member countries submit their national budgets to brussels for " peer review " before they are sent on to their national parliaments .
" the package concerns the whole eu , but this specific proposal has more bite concerning the euro area countries , " european economic and monetary affairs commissioner olli rehn told reporters at a press conference in brussels .
the rules are aimed at avoiding a repeat of the greek debt crisis by preventing countries from over-spending .
the measures would apply to all members of the eu , not just the 16 nations that use the euro currency .
but many nations feel the eu is over-stepping its bounds by interfering in domestic politics .
france and sweden have both voiced their opposition to the measures . " that this should concern all countries is something we find a little strange , " swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt told a press conference in stockholm .
" this kind of discussion could perhaps be possible for -lrb- countries -rrb- with a budget policy that goes against the stability and growth pact , " he said . mixed message from berlin germany 's foreign minister , guido westerwelle , spoke out against the eu commission 's proposal , saying that national budgets belong to " the core of sovereignty . "
" the budget law is a matter of national parliaments .
the european commission does not determine the budget , that is the job of the german bundestag , the national parliament , " westerwelle told reporters in berlin .
however , chancellor angela merkel praised the eu 's attempts to crackdown on irresponsible spending , and said the budget measures did not necessarily usurp the powers of national parliaments . " i would say that the budgetary plans of the member states are not secret anyway , so the commission can already form an opinion about what governments put forward during budgetary debates , " merkel told reporters in berlin . sanctions possible european commission president jose manuel barosso was clear that he believed a unifying economic policy was inevitable for the euro 's survival .
" member states should have the courage to say whether they do want an economic union or not , because if they do not we better forget about a monetary union , " barosso said . bildunterschrift : the commission also threatened sanctions against countries that consistently breach the stability and growth pact , which stipulates that no country should run deficits higher than three per cent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
" let 's be clear - without sanctions it will not be enough for credibility , " he said .
barosso has said that cohesion funds could be withdrawn for countries that do n't comply , however , eurozone finance ministers would have to vote to approve any possible sanctions the eurozone is under pressure to strengthen its economic governance , after member state greece was forced to request 110 billion euros -lrb- $ 140-billion -rrb- from the eurozone countries and the imf to avoid defaulting on its debt. smh / afp / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 12.05.2010 cannes is ' more than glitz and glamour , ' german promoter says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at this year 's festival , 16 films are in competition the 63rd edition of the cannes film festival opens on may 12 .
how will german film fare at the world 's most important movie market ?
dw spoke with mariette rissenbeek from the organization german film service + marketing . just 19 films are in the running for the coveted palme d 'or at this year 's cannes film festival 's main competition , but hundreds more features and dozens of shorts will be shown over the course of the festival , which runs through may 23 .
aside from the main competition - which generally highlights films by well-known directors - there are parallel selections .
these include " un certain regard , " a showcase for film from younger or more unusual directors , films shown out of competition , special screenings , and cannes classics , among others . there are also longstanding and independent festivals that run parallel to the official event , such as the highly regarded directors ' fortnight , organized by the association of french film directors . deutsche welle : ms. rissenbeek , over the years the cannes film festival has earned quite a reputation as a hub of hype , where seeing and being seen is of primary importance .
is the festival still meaningful in the world of film ? marianne rissenbeek : cannes is no doubt the most important festival for film - and the most important market for films - up to today .
i think it is still the leading film market .
and a lot of the films in the official program are rather author-driven .
so it 's not only about glitz and glamour , but about filmmaking . last year a german-language film " das weisse band " -lrb- " the white ribbon " -rrb- won the palme d 'or .
coming out after " the lives of others " won the oscar in 2007 , it seemed to signal a sort of renaissance in german art film .
this year , though , there is just one german film in competition - and in fact it is a german-ukrainian-dutch co-production - " my joy , " by sergei loznitsa .
are the tides turning for german film ? well , " my joy " is indeed a german production , which a german producer has developed .
he developed the script together with the director , so it 's not only a co-production with a financial commitment from germany .
there was creative input and engagement from germany .
i don ’ t think we feel neglected or ignored by the festival selection committee . bildunterschrift : germany 's offer in this year 's competition is ' my joy , ' a co-production with ukraine and the netherlands what else is germany showing at the festival , either out of competition , or on the sidelines as part of the un certain regard series , or as part of the directors ' fortnight ? in un certain regard there are two german films , one from christoph hochhaeusler , called " unter dir die stadt " -lrb- " the city below " -rrb- , and the other one , " life , above all , " is a production that was developed in germany .
even though the director , oliver schmitz , is south african-german , he has both nationalities .
and then in the directors ' fortnight there is a german film , " picco , " by philip koch .
so actually we feel there is quite a strong presence from germany . what are you most looking forward to seeing or experiencing at this year 's festival ? well of course , for us it is more important to see how german films will do .
it will be exciting to see how christoph hochhaeusler has developed - he was at cannes a few years ago with another film .
it will be interesting to see how his film is received this year .
and " picco , " by philip koch , is a first film , so that is exciting too .
it is very seldom that you gain access to cannes with your first film , and then to the directors ' fortnight … the film will get a lot of publicity , so that 's good . and then maybe you noticed that the directors ' cut of " the tin drum " by volker schloendorff will be shown , 30 years after it was premiered in cannes .
i look forward to seeing how audiences react to that . there are a lot of films from asia in competition this year - south korea , thailand , taiwan .
what do you make of that ?
does it indicate anything about the future of european versus asian film ? cannes always had an input from asia , there were always asian films in the program , from china , or taiwan … i do n't think it 's new .
this year maybe the films were more interesting from asia , so they chose more for competition , but i could n't really say if it means anything . we have organized screenings in the market of 28 films overall , many of which have already been premiered elsewhere .
they all have special attributes , so it 's hard to say which ones will be most successful . -lrb- … -rrb- it used to be that you were guaranteed a certain number of contracts if you came to cannes , but since the financial crisis two years ago , that 's not true anymore .
still , it is an important market . interview : jennifer abramsohn editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

estonia is set to adopt the euro and plans to replace its currency , the kroon , on january 1 , 2011 .
the move would make the baltic country the 17th eurozone member . the european commission on wednesday said estonia 's economy is strong enough to join the euro zone .
estonia plans to switch to the shared european currency on january 1 , 2011 . the commission had examined estonia 's debt , deficit , inflation , and interest levels .
olli rehn , the eu commissioner for economic and budgetary affairs , said the country had achieved " a high degree of sustainable economic convergence " and was therefore ready to adopt the euro .
' prudent fiscal policy ' is key " to ensure that the adoption of the euro is a success , estonia must pursue its efforts to maintain a prudent fiscal policy stance , " he said .
he urged tallinn to " remain vigilant and react early and decisively " if problems emerge .
the commission 's positive assessment came in the wake of an enormous european bailout for greece , which shed new light on the importance of countries taking inflation-control measures .
countries are concerned that massive debt problems in the eurozone could make brussels wary of taking on a new member .
economic data adds up according to rehn , " the assessment and our proposal is also a strong signal about the euro area and to the eu more broadly , " testifying that sound economic policies such as those adopted by estonia " generate concrete results . "
estonia has had an average budget surplus of 1.8 percent of gross domestic product between 2002 to 2007 , deteriorating to a deficit of minus 2.7 percent in 2008 and minus 1.7 percent in 2009 as a result of the economic crisis .
that is still well within the eurozone 's threshold of 3 percent .
the brussels-based eu executive said the country 's " price performance -lsb- is -rsb- sustainable " as average inflation fell to minus 0.7 percent in the 12 months to march 2010 .
but it warned that " estonia " will need to remain vigilant to keep inflation at a low level . "
in order for estonia to be finally welcomed into the eurozone , wednesday 's approval will have to be confirmed by the eu 's finance ministers in july .
so far , no positive recommendation by the commission on eurozone enlargement has ever been contradicted by eu member states .
estonia shifted rapidly from a communist command economy to the free market after breaking from the crumbling soviet bloc in 1991 .

more than 700 representatives have attended the 12th asia-pacific conference of german business in singapore . at the asia-pacific conference two years ago , juergen hambrecht , the chairman of the asia-pacific committee of german business complained that only ten percent of german exports went to asia .
but the percentage has increased in the meantime : " the numbers have , of course , changed tremendously during the crisis , but one thing is clear : asia has remained calm , " says hambrecht .
" the exports to asia have clearly not decreased , compared to the average .
actually , since the last asia-pacific conference , there has been an increase from ten to over 16 percent . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singapore will host the asia-pacific conference of german business from may 13-15 juergen hambrecht is also the chairman of basf , the world 's largest chemical company , located in ludwigshafen .
in the 1990s he served as the head of basf 's east asia operations in hong kong and has since remained a fan of asia . germany in asia the asian development bank predicts asia 's economy will grow 7.5 percent this year .
as an exporting nation , the german economy is well positioned in asia , juergen hambrecht believes .
german machinery , automobiles and chemical products enjoy a good reputation .
but above all , german innovations have great prospects there and promise sustainable growth : " for example , energy-efficient construction , electric vehicles , lightweight materials for cars , light materials for other devices , for household appliances , simply as a whole : resource-efficient products , " he says . china and india have also recognized that growth at the expense of the environment will not be sustainable and that renewable energy and greater energy efficiency are crucial .
with its leading environmental technology , german industry can be an ideal partner for them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers producing volkswagen jetta at a plant in changchun , china not optimal conditions despite the potential , german business in asia has not been optimal .
companies complain about protectionism , especially in china , which has intensified since the crisis .
juergen hambrecht also mentions different industrial standards , especially in china . another obstacle is the lack of protection of intellectual property .
but hambrecht dismisses the widespread prejudice : " the major allegation was that a lot of plagiarism was happening in china which is not at all true , " he says .
" intellectual property is an issue worldwide and not just in china .
china has learned that intellectual property is valuable and it is quite interesting that most patents are filed today in china . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens staff in their training centre in singapore gradual change despite the progress in this area , china remains a difficult partner politically .
juergen hambrecht is , however , committed to the policy of " change through trade " : " we would like vietnam or china tomorrow to look like germany today .
and that is not going to be possible .
it was a very long process for us too and every country has to go through this process .
if we are able to move forward with our trade or even local production this can be the strongest impetus for change . " most of the some 4,000 german companies currently active in china would probably agree .
around 2000 companies from germany have invested in india .
even in other asian countries , many medium and small-sized german companies are trying their luck . author : danhong zhang / du editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

estonia is set to adopt the euro and plans to replace its currency , the kroon , on january 1 , 2011 .
the move would make the baltic country the 17th eurozone member . the european commission on wednesday said estonia 's economy is strong enough to join the euro zone .
estonia plans to switch to the shared european currency on january 1 , 2011 . the commission had examined estonia 's debt , deficit , inflation , and interest levels .
olli rehn , the eu commissioner for economic and budgetary affairs , said the country had achieved " a high degree of sustainable economic convergence " and was therefore ready to adopt the euro .
' prudent fiscal policy ' is key " to ensure that the adoption of the euro is a success , estonia must pursue its efforts to maintain a prudent fiscal policy stance , " he said .
he urged tallinn to " remain vigilant and react early and decisively " if problems emerge .
the commission 's positive assessment came in the wake of an enormous european bailout for greece , which shed new light on the importance of countries taking inflation-control measures .
countries are concerned that massive debt problems in the eurozone could make brussels wary of taking on a new member .
economic data adds up according to rehn , " the assessment and our proposal is also a strong signal about the euro area and to the eu more broadly , " testifying that sound economic policies such as those adopted by estonia " generate concrete results . "
estonia has had an average budget surplus of 1.8 percent of gross domestic product between 2002 to 2007 , deteriorating to a deficit of minus 2.7 percent in 2008 and minus 1.7 percent in 2009 as a result of the economic crisis .
that is still well within the eurozone 's threshold of 3 percent .
the brussels-based eu executive said the country 's " price performance -lsb- is -rsb- sustainable " as average inflation fell to minus 0.7 percent in the 12 months to march 2010 .
but it warned that " estonia " will need to remain vigilant to keep inflation at a low level . "
in order for estonia to be finally welcomed into the eurozone , wednesday 's approval will have to be confirmed by the eu 's finance ministers in july .
so far , no positive recommendation by the commission on eurozone enlargement has ever been contradicted by eu member states .
estonia shifted rapidly from a communist command economy to the free market after breaking from the crumbling soviet bloc in 1991 .
the 1.3-million-strong country had hoped to adopt the euro in 2007 , but failed to meet the inflation-control criteria at the time. jen / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he was speaking following his talks with afghan president hamid karzai in washington . president obama said relations between the two governments were " strong " and would endure and that the tensions had been exaggerated . " with respect to perceived tensions between the us government and the afghan government , a lot of them were simply overstated , " said obama . he said the two sides renewed their goal to defeat al qaeda and its extremist allies . for his part , karzai told reporters that he had " frank and productive " discussions with president obama and the relations between the united states and afghanistan were much stronger now .
" we are much more strongly related to each other today than we ever were before . " he also said the us has committed to reducing civilian casualties in afghanistan , an issue that has strained their relations in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan 's president hamid karzai , left , and secretary of state hillary clinton reassurance to provide security in the first of a series of meetings , afghan president hamid karzai on tuesday met us secretary of state hillary clinton who reassured him that the us would remain committed to providing security in afghanistan even after us troops have left . " as we look toward a responsible , orderly transition in the international combat mission in afghanistan , we will not abandon the afghan people , " clinton said .
karzai , meanwhile , reiterated that his country would stick to its responsibility to further develop afghanistan 's civilian and democratic structures . the us commitment should serve as a reassurance to karzai , whose visit comes as relations between afghanistan and the west have cooled in recent months .
last month , following a visit by obama to kabul in late march , karzai slammed the un and the international community , accusing them of perpetrating a " vast fraud " in last year 's presidential elections as part of a conspiracy to undermine his victory .
he said western coalition troops risked being seen as invaders rather than saviours of his country .
while many observers put it down to an attempt by a politically weakened karzai to assert his legitimacy in afghanistan , the unusually harsh outburst sparked criticism in western capitals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us , nato and afghan forces are preparing for a major offensive in kandahar critical juncture " karzai 's visit to the us is highly significant .
it will help the us government show the political community in washington that it still has control over karzai .
it shows that karzai depends on the international community for his political survival .
and it also shows that the west has no viable alternative to karzai in afghanistan , " henning riecke , an analyst at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" from the afghan government point of view , this visit which takes place at a sensitive time , is extremely important , " waheed omar , karzai 's spokesman told reporters last week .
it comes amid a us military surge in afghanistan and ahead of a major offensive against militants in the southern afghan province of kandahar .
the talks in washington also take place amid mounting anger in afghanistan against rising civilian casualties and dwindling public support for the afghan mission in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say distinguishing between who 's moderate and who 's not in the taliban will be tricky tricky talks with the taliban a peace conference , or jirga , to forge a national consensus on how to reconcile with the taliban is to take place later this month in kabul .
the british newspaper the guardian reported recently that afghanistan is proposing to offer top taliban leaders exile if they agree to stop fighting against the government .
the newspaper refered to a document suggesting insurgent leaders could face " potential exile in a third country . "
it also calls for " deradicalisation " classes for insurgents and thousands of new manual jobs to be created for taliban fighters who lay down their arms .
plans to reach out to the taliban are n't now .
in a shift in strategy , most western nations now accept that any political solution to the afghanistan conflict must include moderate elements of the taliban .
earlier this year , german foreign minister guido westerwelle drummed up support for an " exit program " for taliban fighters funded by the international community .
but some point out that the country that finds it the hardest to embrace talks with the taliban is the us .
" the americans are ambivalent about bringing the taliban to the table due to their links with al qaeda .
it 's heightened after the botched bombing at times square , " fabrice pothier , head of carnegie europe , a forum for european policymakers and think-tanks , told deutsche welle . " any agreement with the taliban has to involve security guarantees on both sides - the taliban must sever links with al qaeda and the us must guarantee that taliban fighters wo n't be imprisoned or killed .
for the us president , justifying making a deal with the taliban is a hard sell at home . "
european involvement observers say that though european allies lack the political clout the us has in afghanistan , the talks in washington are being followed carefully across the atlantic .
" on hard political questions , europe is out of the picture in afghanistan .
we do n't have the same credibility as the us because we are n't taking the same risks as the us .
but at the same time , europe has a long-term interest in institution-building in afghanistan .
so the talks in the us remain important to europe 's future role -lrb- in afghanistan -rrb- , " pothier said .
many european governments are grappling with waning support at home for the war in afghanistan as troop casualties rise .
experts say it stands to reason that good ties between kabul and washington would help obama fulfill his pledge to start bringing us troops home in mid-2011 - and thus signal the way for an end in sight to the afghan engagement .
" when obama announced he would begin a partial withdrawal of troops in mid-2011 it was greeted with cheer in europe .
it was interpreted here as a possible end of the deployment .
but that 's not what it 's going to be .
we can expect some tough discussions and friction between the us and its european allies later in november this year when american generals review the success of the surge , " riecke said .
expert : west should rethink afghan policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising troop casualties have raised concerns in the west " western capitals keep making demands on kabul on corruption and governance .
but the fact is that much of the corruption is fuelled by international aid money .
the price per square meter of property in kabul is higher than in tokyo - it 's a bubble created by the west , " pothier said .
the expert pointed out that a host of events in afghanistan this year - the peace conference , a foreign donor nations meeting in july , parliamentary elections in september - offer a chance for the west to pursue a different script in afghanistan .
" the reality of the afghan state is that the western-backed karzai government in kabul has not percolated to the country 's provinces and districts .
karzai and his smart english-speaking ministers who travel the world have failed to deliver basic services to the majority of the afghan people , " porthier said .
" the west needs to take a hard look at what 's gone wrong and push for broader political change and reform in afghanistan . "

analyst forecasts had predicted growth would remain stagnant .
the federal statistics office in wiesbaden also revised 2009 figures for economic activity , saying it had expanded 0.2 percent in the last quarter of 2009 .
that put full-year contraction lower than expected : 4.9 percent , down from an earlier-reported 5.0 percent .
the statisticians attributed the slow gain in momentum overall in germany to an especially cold winter , which hampered construction activity .
exports and investments in industrial equipment had nonetheless provided engines for growth , the report said .
and data for industrial orders and production in march point to a solid rebound in that sector .

estonia has had an average budget surplus of 1.8 percent of gross domestic product between 2002 to 2007 , deteriorating to a deficit of minus 2.7 percent in 2008 and minus 1.7 percent in 2009 as a result of the economic crisis .
that is still well within the eurozone 's threshold of 3 percent .
the brussels-based eu executive said the country 's " price performance -lsb- is -rsb- sustainable " as average inflation fell to minus 0.7 percent in the 12 months to march 2010 .
but it warned that " estonia " will need to remain vigilant to keep inflation at a low level . "
in order for estonia to be finally welcomed into the eurozone , wednesday 's approval will have to be confirmed by the eu 's finance ministers in july .
so far , no positive recommendation by the commission on eurozone enlargement has ever been contradicted by eu member states .
estonia shifted rapidly from a communist command economy to the free market after breaking from the crumbling soviet bloc in 1991 .
the 1.3-million-strong country had hoped to adopt the euro in 2007 , but failed to meet the inflation-control criteria at the time. jen / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

how will german film fare at the world 's most important movie market ?
dw spoke with mariette rissenbeek from the organization german film service + marketing . just 19 films are in the running for the coveted palme d 'or at this year 's cannes film festival 's main competition , but hundreds more features and dozens of shorts will be shown over the course of the festival , which runs through may 23 .
aside from the main competition - which generally highlights films by well-known directors - there are parallel selections .
these include " un certain regard , " a showcase for film from younger or more unusual directors , films shown out of competition , special screenings , and cannes classics , among others . there are also longstanding and independent festivals that run parallel to the official event , such as the highly regarded directors ' fortnight , organized by the association of french film directors . deutsche welle : ms. rissenbeek , over the years the cannes film festival has earned quite a reputation as a hub of hype , where seeing and being seen is of primary importance .
is the festival still meaningful in the world of film ? marianne rissenbeek : cannes is no doubt the most important festival for film - and the most important market for films - up to today .
i think it is still the leading film market .
and a lot of the films in the official program are rather author-driven .
so it 's not only about glitz and glamour , but about filmmaking . last year a german-language film " das weisse band " -lrb- " the white ribbon " -rrb- won the palme d 'or .
coming out after " the lives of others " won the oscar in 2007 , it seemed to signal a sort of renaissance in german art film .
this year , though , there is just one german film in competition - and in fact it is a german-ukrainian-dutch co-production - " my joy , " by sergei loznitsa .
are the tides turning for german film ? well , " my joy " is indeed a german production , which a german producer has developed .
he developed the script together with the director , so it 's not only a co-production with a financial commitment from germany .
there was creative input and engagement from germany .
i don ’ t think we feel neglected or ignored by the festival selection committee . bildunterschrift : germany 's offer in this year 's competition is ' my joy , ' a co-production with ukraine and the netherlands what else is germany showing at the festival , either out of competition , or on the sidelines as part of the un certain regard series , or as part of the directors ' fortnight ? in un certain regard there are two german films , one from christoph hochhaeusler , called " unter dir die stadt " -lrb- " the city below " -rrb- , and the other one , " life , above all , " is a production that was developed in germany .
even though the director , oliver schmitz , is south african-german , he has both nationalities .
and then in the directors ' fortnight there is a german film , " picco , " by philip koch .
so actually we feel there is quite a strong presence from germany . what are you most looking forward to seeing or experiencing at this year 's festival ? well of course , for us it is more important to see how german films will do .
it will be exciting to see how christoph hochhaeusler has developed - he was at cannes a few years ago with another film .
it will be interesting to see how his film is received this year .
and " picco , " by philip koch , is a first film , so that is exciting too .
it is very seldom that you gain access to cannes with your first film , and then to the directors ' fortnight … the film will get a lot of publicity , so that 's good . and then maybe you noticed that the directors ' cut of " the tin drum " by volker schloendorff will be shown , 30 years after it was premiered in cannes .
i look forward to seeing how audiences react to that . there are a lot of films from asia in competition this year - south korea , thailand , taiwan .
what do you make of that ?
does it indicate anything about the future of european versus asian film ? cannes always had an input from asia , there were always asian films in the program , from china , or taiwan … i do n't think it 's new .
this year maybe the films were more interesting from asia , so they chose more for competition , but i could n't really say if it means anything . we have organized screenings in the market of 28 films overall , many of which have already been premiered elsewhere .

the decision has sparked a debate about how to protect the public from violent offenders . germany is under pressure to change its system of preventive detention , which allows for violent and repeat offenders to be detained indefinitely , even after they have served their sentence .
in december , the european court of human rights -lrb- echr -rrb- ruled that germany had violated the european human rights convention in the case of german inmate reinhard m. , who was convicted for attempted murder and had been kept in prison more than 10 years after his sentence .
the 52-year-old man had completed his five-year prison sentence in 1991 , but was not released , as he was deemed a danger to the public .
he was detained for the next 10 years , the maximum term for preventive detention at the time .
but a change in german legislation in 1998 meant that prisoners can now be detained indefinitely .
right to liberty the echr ruled that because reinhard m had been convicted before the change in the law in 1998 germany violated the ' right to liberty ' .
the court also stated that " there was no sufficient causal connection between his conviction and his continued deprivation of liberty . "
germany requested the case be referred to the echr 's grand chamber , which has now been refused , making the original court decision binding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 70 violent offenders in germany could benefit from the court ruling the echr can only tackle specific cases , but the ruling has already sparked a debate on how to protect the public from criminals convicted of murder , armed robbery , rape and other violent crimes .
" we need a comprehensive not an alarmist debate on the ramifications and options of today 's ruling -lsb- by the echr -rsb- , " justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger said in a statement on tuesday .
new framework the federal coalition agreement from last autumn calls for a reform of the current system , but the government has not released any details yet .
the bavarian justice minister , beate merk , however , has been vocal in calling for a complete overhaul of preventive detention in germany .

he would like to see longer sentences handed down instead .

he believes the power to release a potentially dangerous person should remain with the court , however .
he argues that leaving violent criminals to medical authorities for preventive detention by separating punishment from detention could be dangerous if you rely on medical staff alone to determine whether or not a detainee is a danger to society .

how will german film fare at the world 's most important movie market ?
dw spoke with mariette rissenbeek from the organization german film service + marketing . just 19 films are in the running for the coveted palme d 'or at this year 's cannes film festival 's main competition , but hundreds more features and dozens of shorts will be shown over the course of the festival , which runs through may 23 .
aside from the main competition - which generally highlights films by well-known directors - there are parallel selections .
these include " un certain regard , " a showcase for film from younger or more unusual directors , films shown out of competition , special screenings , and cannes classics , among others . there are also longstanding and independent festivals that run parallel to the official event , such as the highly regarded directors ' fortnight , organized by the association of french film directors . deutsche welle : ms. rissenbeek , over the years the cannes film festival has earned quite a reputation as a hub of hype , where seeing and being seen is of primary importance .
is the festival still meaningful in the world of film ? marianne rissenbeek : cannes is no doubt the most important festival for film - and the most important market for films - up to today .
i think it is still the leading film market .
and a lot of the films in the official program are rather author-driven .
so it 's not only about glitz and glamour , but about filmmaking . last year a german-language film " das weisse band " -lrb- " the white ribbon " -rrb- won the palme d 'or .
coming out after " the lives of others " won the oscar in 2007 , it seemed to signal a sort of renaissance in german art film .
this year , though , there is just one german film in competition - and in fact it is a german-ukrainian-dutch co-production - " my joy , " by sergei loznitsa .
are the tides turning for german film ? well , " my joy " is indeed a german production , which a german producer has developed .
he developed the script together with the director , so it 's not only a co-production with a financial commitment from germany .
there was creative input and engagement from germany .
i don ’ t think we feel neglected or ignored by the festival selection committee . bildunterschrift : germany 's offer in this year 's competition is ' my joy , ' a co-production with ukraine and the netherlands what else is germany showing at the festival , either out of competition , or on the sidelines as part of the un certain regard series , or as part of the directors ' fortnight ? in un certain regard there are two german films , one from christoph hochhaeusler , called " unter dir die stadt " -lrb- " the city below " -rrb- , and the other one , " life , above all , " is a production that was developed in germany .
even though the director , oliver schmitz , is south african-german , he has both nationalities .
and then in the directors ' fortnight there is a german film , " picco , " by philip koch .
so actually we feel there is quite a strong presence from germany . what are you most looking forward to seeing or experiencing at this year 's festival ? well of course , for us it is more important to see how german films will do .
it will be exciting to see how christoph hochhaeusler has developed - he was at cannes a few years ago with another film .
it will be interesting to see how his film is received this year .
and " picco , " by philip koch , is a first film , so that is exciting too .
it is very seldom that you gain access to cannes with your first film , and then to the directors ' fortnight … the film will get a lot of publicity , so that 's good . and then maybe you noticed that the directors ' cut of " the tin drum " by volker schloendorff will be shown , 30 years after it was premiered in cannes .
i look forward to seeing how audiences react to that . there are a lot of films from asia in competition this year - south korea , thailand , taiwan .
what do you make of that ?
does it indicate anything about the future of european versus asian film ? cannes always had an input from asia , there were always asian films in the program , from china , or taiwan … i do n't think it 's new .
this year maybe the films were more interesting from asia , so they chose more for competition , but i could n't really say if it means anything . we have organized screenings in the market of 28 films overall , many of which have already been premiered elsewhere .
they all have special attributes , so it 's hard to say which ones will be most successful . -lrb- … -rrb- it used to be that you were guaranteed a certain number of contracts if you came to cannes , but since the financial crisis two years ago , that 's not true anymore .
still , it is an important market . interview : jennifer abramsohn editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german chancellor angela merkel phoned david cameron on wednesday to congratulate him , and invited him to visit germany soon for more comprehensive talks , according to a government spokesman in berlin .
in brussels , european union officials hope the liberal democrats ' presence in the new coalition will soften the tories ' traditionally euroskeptic stance , and help quieten hardline backbenchers within the center-right party .
european commission president jose manuel barroso also congratulated david cameron , saying his government faced difficult choices in difficult times .
" what i hope is that the british prime minister will of course defend -lsb- his country 's -rsb- national interests in the european setting , " barroso told reporters in brussels , saying he was not concerned by conservative election manifesto pledges to claw back powers from brussels .
uncertain stance but no one in brussels is quite certain how far the new british government will go in defending its national interests , especially now that the liberal democrats form a part of its leadership .
as the country grapples with a runaway national debt and budget deficit , many in brussels believe that europe is not the top priority for the new conservative-led government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has the reputation of being a reluctant eu member " cameron has far too much on his plate to think about picking a fight with europe , " the european policy center 's -lrb- epc -rrb- acting director of studies , john wyles , told deutsche welle .
" and providing there is nothing major in the policy pipeline here -lsb- in brussels -rsb- , he is certainly not going to be looking for a fight . "
wyles also expects the conservatives and liberal democrats not to fight over european policy in the short term , partly because the liberal democrats have been sufficiently vague on the issue in their manifesto .
the message filtering through to brussels from london , according to wyles , is that david cameron 's approach will be entirely pragmatic on europe and relatively low key .
and so far , the new british government has signaled it will be ' business as usual ' as far as the european union is concerned .
conservatives remain a concern still , eu officials are keeping a watchful eye on britain 's new foreign secretary , william hague , who has been playing down policy differences over the european union within the new coalition .
hague did rule out further european integration for britain , telling reporters it was a " red line " for his party , but he focussed more on the agreements reached in negotiations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservatives have no plans to join the single european currency " the liberal democrats have readily agreed with us that it will not be the policy of this government to join the euro or to propose to join the euro in its lifetime , " former conservative party leader hague said .
" look , all british governments sometimes face difficulties over european policy . "
cameron pulled his conservatives out of the main center-right grouping in the european parliament , the european people 's party , because hardline conservatives deemed the group too pro-european .
but the epc 's john wyles believes that while this sounded some alarm bells in brussels , it 's unwise to over-analyze the decision .
" that was just a piece of red meat that -lsb- cameron -rsb- felt he needed to toss to the euroskeptic majority in order to get elected , " wyles said .
" it was not well judged , and it has created a lot of resentment against the conservatives among the center-right in europe , but they will get over that - i think many of them have largely got over it already . "
some in brussels even believe the conservatives will find their way back to the european people 's party , but john wyles said that this is an unlikely scenario .
he believes the new prime minister will have to strike a balance on europe - keeping hardline euroskeptics on board , while simultaneously staying sufficiently pragmatic to further britain 's interests on the continent .

the decision has sparked a debate about how to protect the public from violent offenders . germany is under pressure to change its system of preventive detention , which allows for violent and repeat offenders to be detained indefinitely , even after they have served their sentence .
in december , the european court of human rights -lrb- echr -rrb- ruled that germany had violated the european human rights convention in the case of german inmate reinhard m. , who was convicted for attempted murder and had been kept in prison more than 10 years after his sentence .
the 52-year-old man had completed his five-year prison sentence in 1991 , but was not released , as he was deemed a danger to the public .
he was detained for the next 10 years , the maximum term for preventive detention at the time .
but a change in german legislation in 1998 meant that prisoners can now be detained indefinitely .
right to liberty the echr ruled that because reinhard m had been convicted before the change in the law in 1998 germany violated the ' right to liberty ' .
the court also stated that " there was no sufficient causal connection between his conviction and his continued deprivation of liberty . "
germany requested the case be referred to the echr 's grand chamber , which has now been refused , making the original court decision binding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 70 violent offenders in germany could benefit from the court ruling the echr can only tackle specific cases , but the ruling has already sparked a debate on how to protect the public from criminals convicted of murder , armed robbery , rape and other violent crimes .
" we need a comprehensive not an alarmist debate on the ramifications and options of today 's ruling -lsb- by the echr -rsb- , " justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger said in a statement on tuesday .
new framework the federal coalition agreement from last autumn calls for a reform of the current system , but the government has not released any details yet .
the bavarian justice minister , beate merk , however , has been vocal in calling for a complete overhaul of preventive detention in germany .
" a few band-aids here and there just will not do , " she said in a statement .
" we need a completely new system that can deal with violent offenders that are likely to reoffend and be a danger to the public even after they have served their sentence , " she added .
merk is adamant that some form of post-sentence detention is necessary , but she would like to see the sentence , ie the punishment , separated from the subsequent detention , with separate facilities and dedicated therapy options for violent criminals - one of the areas the echr had criticized as lacking in the current system .
longer sentences but some legal experts believe preventive detention is not the answer .
" the law has been extended in the past because of an unsubstantiated fear of crime , at a time when crime rates are going down in germany , and i do n't believe there is a need for it at all , " hermann kuehn , an expert in criminal law who runs his own law firm , told deutsche welle .
he would like to see longer sentences handed down instead .
currently , the maximum sentence is 15 years , unless a defendant is sentenced to life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's constitutional court endorsed retroactive preventive detention in 2004 " we could extend the fixed-term punishments to give courts the opportunity for a longer prison sentence and then leave it to the court to release him earlier if he is no longer a danger to society , " kuehn said .
he believes the power to release a potentially dangerous person should remain with the court , however .
he argues that leaving violent criminals to medical authorities for preventive detention by separating punishment from detention could be dangerous if you rely on medical staff alone to determine whether or not a detainee is a danger to society .

more than 700 representatives have attended the 12th asia-pacific conference of german business in singapore . at the asia-pacific conference two years ago , juergen hambrecht , the chairman of the asia-pacific committee of german business complained that only ten percent of german exports went to asia .
but the percentage has increased in the meantime : " the numbers have , of course , changed tremendously during the crisis , but one thing is clear : asia has remained calm , " says hambrecht .
" the exports to asia have clearly not decreased , compared to the average .
actually , since the last asia-pacific conference , there has been an increase from ten to over 16 percent . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singapore will host the asia-pacific conference of german business from may 13-15 juergen hambrecht is also the chairman of basf , the world 's largest chemical company , located in ludwigshafen .
in the 1990s he served as the head of basf 's east asia operations in hong kong and has since remained a fan of asia . germany in asia the asian development bank predicts asia 's economy will grow 7.5 percent this year .
as an exporting nation , the german economy is well positioned in asia , juergen hambrecht believes .
german machinery , automobiles and chemical products enjoy a good reputation .
but above all , german innovations have great prospects there and promise sustainable growth : " for example , energy-efficient construction , electric vehicles , lightweight materials for cars , light materials for other devices , for household appliances , simply as a whole : resource-efficient products , " he says . china and india have also recognized that growth at the expense of the environment will not be sustainable and that renewable energy and greater energy efficiency are crucial .
with its leading environmental technology , german industry can be an ideal partner for them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers producing volkswagen jetta at a plant in changchun , china not optimal conditions despite the potential , german business in asia has not been optimal .
companies complain about protectionism , especially in china , which has intensified since the crisis .
juergen hambrecht also mentions different industrial standards , especially in china . another obstacle is the lack of protection of intellectual property .
but hambrecht dismisses the widespread prejudice : " the major allegation was that a lot of plagiarism was happening in china which is not at all true , " he says .
" intellectual property is an issue worldwide and not just in china .
china has learned that intellectual property is valuable and it is quite interesting that most patents are filed today in china . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens staff in their training centre in singapore gradual change despite the progress in this area , china remains a difficult partner politically .
juergen hambrecht is , however , committed to the policy of " change through trade " : " we would like vietnam or china tomorrow to look like germany today .
and that is not going to be possible .
it was a very long process for us too and every country has to go through this process .
if we are able to move forward with our trade or even local production this can be the strongest impetus for change . " most of the some 4,000 german companies currently active in china would probably agree .
around 2000 companies from germany have invested in india .
even in other asian countries , many medium and small-sized german companies are trying their luck . author : danhong zhang / du editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german chancellor angela merkel phoned david cameron on wednesday to congratulate him , and invited him to visit germany soon for more comprehensive talks , according to a government spokesman in berlin .
in brussels , european union officials hope the liberal democrats ' presence in the new coalition will soften the tories ' traditionally euroskeptic stance , and help quieten hardline backbenchers within the center-right party .
european commission president jose manuel barroso also congratulated david cameron , saying his government faced difficult choices in difficult times .
" what i hope is that the british prime minister will of course defend -lsb- his country 's -rsb- national interests in the european setting , " barroso told reporters in brussels , saying he was not concerned by conservative election manifesto pledges to claw back powers from brussels .
uncertain stance but no one in brussels is quite certain how far the new british government will go in defending its national interests , especially now that the liberal democrats form a part of its leadership .
as the country grapples with a runaway national debt and budget deficit , many in brussels believe that europe is not the top priority for the new conservative-led government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has the reputation of being a reluctant eu member " cameron has far too much on his plate to think about picking a fight with europe , " the european policy center 's -lrb- epc -rrb- acting director of studies , john wyles , told deutsche welle .
" and providing there is nothing major in the policy pipeline here -lsb- in brussels -rsb- , he is certainly not going to be looking for a fight . "
wyles also expects the conservatives and liberal democrats not to fight over european policy in the short term , partly because the liberal democrats have been sufficiently vague on the issue in their manifesto .
the message filtering through to brussels from london , according to wyles , is that david cameron 's approach will be entirely pragmatic on europe and relatively low key .
and so far , the new british government has signaled it will be ' business as usual ' as far as the european union is concerned .
conservatives remain a concern still , eu officials are keeping a watchful eye on britain 's new foreign secretary , william hague , who has been playing down policy differences over the european union within the new coalition .
hague did rule out further european integration for britain , telling reporters it was a " red line " for his party , but he focussed more on the agreements reached in negotiations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservatives have no plans to join the single european currency " the liberal democrats have readily agreed with us that it will not be the policy of this government to join the euro or to propose to join the euro in its lifetime , " former conservative party leader hague said .
" look , all british governments sometimes face difficulties over european policy . "
cameron pulled his conservatives out of the main center-right grouping in the european parliament , the european people 's party , because hardline conservatives deemed the group too pro-european .
but the epc 's john wyles believes that while this sounded some alarm bells in brussels , it 's unwise to over-analyze the decision .
" that was just a piece of red meat that -lsb- cameron -rsb- felt he needed to toss to the euroskeptic majority in order to get elected , " wyles said .
" it was not well judged , and it has created a lot of resentment against the conservatives among the center-right in europe , but they will get over that - i think many of them have largely got over it already . "
some in brussels even believe the conservatives will find their way back to the european people 's party , but john wyles said that this is an unlikely scenario .
he believes the new prime minister will have to strike a balance on europe - keeping hardline euroskeptics on board , while simultaneously staying sufficiently pragmatic to further britain 's interests on the continent .

he was speaking following his talks with afghan president hamid karzai in washington . president obama said relations between the two governments were " strong " and would endure and that the tensions had been exaggerated . " with respect to perceived tensions between the us government and the afghan government , a lot of them were simply overstated , " said obama . he said the two sides renewed their goal to defeat al qaeda and its extremist allies . for his part , karzai told reporters that he had " frank and productive " discussions with president obama and the relations between the united states and afghanistan were much stronger now .
" we are much more strongly related to each other today than we ever were before . " he also said the us has committed to reducing civilian casualties in afghanistan , an issue that has strained their relations in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan 's president hamid karzai , left , and secretary of state hillary clinton reassurance to provide security in the first of a series of meetings , afghan president hamid karzai on tuesday met us secretary of state hillary clinton who reassured him that the us would remain committed to providing security in afghanistan even after us troops have left . " as we look toward a responsible , orderly transition in the international combat mission in afghanistan , we will not abandon the afghan people , " clinton said .
karzai , meanwhile , reiterated that his country would stick to its responsibility to further develop afghanistan 's civilian and democratic structures . the us commitment should serve as a reassurance to karzai , whose visit comes as relations between afghanistan and the west have cooled in recent months .
last month , following a visit by obama to kabul in late march , karzai slammed the un and the international community , accusing them of perpetrating a " vast fraud " in last year 's presidential elections as part of a conspiracy to undermine his victory .
he said western coalition troops risked being seen as invaders rather than saviours of his country .
while many observers put it down to an attempt by a politically weakened karzai to assert his legitimacy in afghanistan , the unusually harsh outburst sparked criticism in western capitals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us , nato and afghan forces are preparing for a major offensive in kandahar critical juncture " karzai 's visit to the us is highly significant .
it will help the us government show the political community in washington that it still has control over karzai .
it shows that karzai depends on the international community for his political survival .
and it also shows that the west has no viable alternative to karzai in afghanistan , " henning riecke , an analyst at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" from the afghan government point of view , this visit which takes place at a sensitive time , is extremely important , " waheed omar , karzai 's spokesman told reporters last week .
it comes amid a us military surge in afghanistan and ahead of a major offensive against militants in the southern afghan province of kandahar .
the talks in washington also take place amid mounting anger in afghanistan against rising civilian casualties and dwindling public support for the afghan mission in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say distinguishing between who 's moderate and who 's not in the taliban will be tricky tricky talks with the taliban a peace conference , or jirga , to forge a national consensus on how to reconcile with the taliban is to take place later this month in kabul .
the british newspaper the guardian reported recently that afghanistan is proposing to offer top taliban leaders exile if they agree to stop fighting against the government .
the newspaper refered to a document suggesting insurgent leaders could face " potential exile in a third country . "
it also calls for " deradicalisation " classes for insurgents and thousands of new manual jobs to be created for taliban fighters who lay down their arms .
plans to reach out to the taliban are n't now .
in a shift in strategy , most western nations now accept that any political solution to the afghanistan conflict must include moderate elements of the taliban .
earlier this year , german foreign minister guido westerwelle drummed up support for an " exit program " for taliban fighters funded by the international community .
but some point out that the country that finds it the hardest to embrace talks with the taliban is the us .
" the americans are ambivalent about bringing the taliban to the table due to their links with al qaeda .
it 's heightened after the botched bombing at times square , " fabrice pothier , head of carnegie europe , a forum for european policymakers and think-tanks , told deutsche welle . " any agreement with the taliban has to involve security guarantees on both sides - the taliban must sever links with al qaeda and the us must guarantee that taliban fighters wo n't be imprisoned or killed .
for the us president , justifying making a deal with the taliban is a hard sell at home . "
european involvement observers say that though european allies lack the political clout the us has in afghanistan , the talks in washington are being followed carefully across the atlantic .
" on hard political questions , europe is out of the picture in afghanistan .
we do n't have the same credibility as the us because we are n't taking the same risks as the us .
but at the same time , europe has a long-term interest in institution-building in afghanistan .
so the talks in the us remain important to europe 's future role -lrb- in afghanistan -rrb- , " pothier said .
many european governments are grappling with waning support at home for the war in afghanistan as troop casualties rise .
experts say it stands to reason that good ties between kabul and washington would help obama fulfill his pledge to start bringing us troops home in mid-2011 - and thus signal the way for an end in sight to the afghan engagement .
" when obama announced he would begin a partial withdrawal of troops in mid-2011 it was greeted with cheer in europe .
it was interpreted here as a possible end of the deployment .
but that 's not what it 's going to be .
we can expect some tough discussions and friction between the us and its european allies later in november this year when american generals review the success of the surge , " riecke said .
expert : west should rethink afghan policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising troop casualties have raised concerns in the west " western capitals keep making demands on kabul on corruption and governance .
but the fact is that much of the corruption is fuelled by international aid money .
the price per square meter of property in kabul is higher than in tokyo - it 's a bubble created by the west , " pothier said .
the expert pointed out that a host of events in afghanistan this year - the peace conference , a foreign donor nations meeting in july , parliamentary elections in september - offer a chance for the west to pursue a different script in afghanistan .
" the reality of the afghan state is that the western-backed karzai government in kabul has not percolated to the country 's provinces and districts .
karzai and his smart english-speaking ministers who travel the world have failed to deliver basic services to the majority of the afghan people , " porthier said .
" the west needs to take a hard look at what 's gone wrong and push for broader political change and reform in afghanistan . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 12.05.2010 brussels to unveil plans for tougher rules to protect euro großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels wants greater powers to protect the euro the european commission is to unveil a new strategy for avoiding crises like the one that has shaken greece and led to massive speculation on the value of the euro . european commission president jose manuel barroso and eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner olli rehn are expected wednesday to outline plans that include strengthening eu budget rules and economic surveillance in the 16-nation eurozone .
brussels believes germany 's tough debt-reduction measures , enshrined in the constitution , could be a model for other eu states .
in the wednesday edition of the german weekly , die zeit , rehn said brussels should have greater powers and be able to monitor the national budgets of eu nations .
he said regulations must be put in place to make this possible .
" we want governments to send their budget outlines to brussels for review before they are approved by their national parliaments , " rehn said .
" we can then see early whether a country is adhering to the stability and growth pact .
if not , we would intervene , " he said .
berlin has rejected such measures , however , saying it would impact on its budget sovereignty .
many eurozone nations in trouble - in particular greece , spain , and portugal - have accumulated budget deficits vastly exceeding the three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- permitted by the stability and growth pact .

germany this year is expected to reach a record debt of more than five percent of gdp , but has plans to start reducing this from 2011 .
greece , which has a crippling budget deficit of nearly 14 percent of national income , this month became the first eu nation to receive billions of euros in a rescue package to prevent it from defaulting on its debts .

the win in hamburg was atletico 's first european trophy . the spanish capital 's perpetual bridesmaid club atletico madrid became the center of attention this wednesday , outlasting fulham in extra time and winning the inaugural europa league trophy .
diego forlan of uruguay scored both goals for atletico , and was set up on both occasions by his argentine strike partner sergio " kun " aguero .
four minutes from time in the second extra time period , forlan got a glancing heel to aguero 's cross from the left byline , which was enough to dribble in for a goal after a deflection off of defender brede hangeland 's thigh .
it was a scrappy ending to a scrappy game , but one which most observers , including atletico defender tomas ujfalusi , felt was deserved .
" we fought for 120 minutes , and got the goals we needed from our best player , " said the defender , who was returning to what was his home stadium for four years as a bundesliga player .
ujfalusi had never won a trophy in his career , which has taken him from olomouc in the czech republic to hamburg to florence to madrid , and was clearly moved after the match .
" it 's for moments like this that we play football .
it 's an unbelievable feeling , " he said .
bildunterschrift : fulham 's goalkeeper mark schwarzer was unlucky to lose his second european final the build-up the match did n't catch fire until the 32nd minute , and even then did n't do so with much elegance .
aguero scuffed his left-footed shot attempt from the edge of the penalty box .
luckily for him , though , forlan was streaking into the area just then , and stuck out his boot to one-time the ball for a 1-0 lead .
but the travelling fulham fans did n't have long to wait before their side had evened the score - in similarly disjointed fashion .
a slip from an atletico defender meant bobby zamora found himself free on the left wing , but a poor touch robbed him of the chance to shoot as he came inside .
zoltan gera , however , was in place to cross the ball back out to the wing , where simon davies was waiting and scored with a neat volley .
not long after halftime , fulham 's goal-scoring hero bobby zamora succumbed to the ankle injury that had kept him out of fabio capello 's provisional england squad at midweek , forcing him out of the game .
his replacement , clint dempsey nearly put fulham in front within minutes of entering , but saw his shot parried by the atletico keeper - and was subsequently called for offside .
as the match wore on , atletico began to dominate possession , but had little to show for it as they failed to put many shots on target .
extended play bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fulham picked up the pace in extra time the second half came to a close and the match entered extra time , but the spanish side 's control of the ball continued .
forlan and aguero nearly linked up for another go-ahead strike at the end of the first period , but this time it was the argentine on the end of the chance , and he pushed the ball wide .
fulham looked livelier in the second extra time , earning free kicks in dangerous positions through the enterprising runs of dempsey and gera , but it was atletico who tipped the game 's balance in their favor as the madrid side 's dynamic south american duo struck again to end the game .
the loss was a particularly bitter one for fulham 's goalkeeper , australia 's mark schwarzer .
in 2006 he had led middlesborough to the final of the uefa cup -lrb- the forerunner tournament to the europa league -rrb- , only to fall to sevilla .
" when you look at the goals , you 'll see how unlucky we were , " said schwarzer .
" we had the game in our hands , had our own chances , and hoped that would be enough .
but it did n't turn out that way . "

the win in hamburg was atletico 's first european trophy . the spanish capital 's perpetual bridesmaid club atletico madrid became the center of attention this wednesday , outlasting fulham in extra time and winning the inaugural europa league trophy .
diego forlan of uruguay scored both goals for atletico , and was set up on both occasions by his argentine strike partner sergio " kun " aguero .
four minutes from time in the second extra time period , forlan got a glancing heel to aguero 's cross from the left byline , which was enough to dribble in for a goal after a deflection off of defender brede hangeland 's thigh .
it was a scrappy ending to a scrappy game , but one which most observers , including atletico defender tomas ujfalusi , felt was deserved .
" we fought for 120 minutes , and got the goals we needed from our best player , " said the defender , who was returning to what was his home stadium for four years as a bundesliga player .
ujfalusi had never won a trophy in his career , which has taken him from olomouc in the czech republic to hamburg to florence to madrid , and was clearly moved after the match .
" it 's for moments like this that we play football .
it 's an unbelievable feeling , " he said .
bildunterschrift : fulham 's goalkeeper mark schwarzer was unlucky to lose his second european final the build-up the match did n't catch fire until the 32nd minute , and even then did n't do so with much elegance .
aguero scuffed his left-footed shot attempt from the edge of the penalty box .
luckily for him , though , forlan was streaking into the area just then , and stuck out his boot to one-time the ball for a 1-0 lead .
but the travelling fulham fans did n't have long to wait before their side had evened the score - in similarly disjointed fashion .
a slip from an atletico defender meant bobby zamora found himself free on the left wing , but a poor touch robbed him of the chance to shoot as he came inside .
zoltan gera , however , was in place to cross the ball back out to the wing , where simon davies was waiting and scored with a neat volley .
not long after halftime , fulham 's goal-scoring hero bobby zamora succumbed to the ankle injury that had kept him out of fabio capello 's provisional england squad at midweek , forcing him out of the game .
his replacement , clint dempsey nearly put fulham in front within minutes of entering , but saw his shot parried by the atletico keeper - and was subsequently called for offside .
as the match wore on , atletico began to dominate possession , but had little to show for it as they failed to put many shots on target .
extended play bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fulham picked up the pace in extra time the second half came to a close and the match entered extra time , but the spanish side 's control of the ball continued .
forlan and aguero nearly linked up for another go-ahead strike at the end of the first period , but this time it was the argentine on the end of the chance , and he pushed the ball wide .
fulham looked livelier in the second extra time , earning free kicks in dangerous positions through the enterprising runs of dempsey and gera , but it was atletico who tipped the game 's balance in their favor as the madrid side 's dynamic south american duo struck again to end the game .
the loss was a particularly bitter one for fulham 's goalkeeper , australia 's mark schwarzer .
in 2006 he had led middlesborough to the final of the uefa cup -lrb- the forerunner tournament to the europa league -rrb- , only to fall to sevilla .
" when you look at the goals , you 'll see how unlucky we were , " said schwarzer .
" we had the game in our hands , had our own chances , and hoped that would be enough .
but it did n't turn out that way . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 12.05.2010 brussels to unveil plans for tougher rules to protect euro großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels wants greater powers to protect the euro the european commission is to unveil a new strategy for avoiding crises like the one that has shaken greece and led to massive speculation on the value of the euro . european commission president jose manuel barroso and eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner olli rehn are expected wednesday to outline plans that include strengthening eu budget rules and economic surveillance in the 16-nation eurozone .
brussels believes germany 's tough debt-reduction measures , enshrined in the constitution , could be a model for other eu states .
in the wednesday edition of the german weekly , die zeit , rehn said brussels should have greater powers and be able to monitor the national budgets of eu nations .
he said regulations must be put in place to make this possible .
" we want governments to send their budget outlines to brussels for review before they are approved by their national parliaments , " rehn said .
" we can then see early whether a country is adhering to the stability and growth pact .
if not , we would intervene , " he said .
berlin has rejected such measures , however , saying it would impact on its budget sovereignty .
many eurozone nations in trouble - in particular greece , spain , and portugal - have accumulated budget deficits vastly exceeding the three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- permitted by the stability and growth pact .
the pact is meant to ensure the stability of the economic and monetary union .
german debt-trimming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehn favors the german debt-reduction model rehn also told die zeit that he believed germany 's plans for debt reduction could serve as a model for other eu nations .
in 2009 , berlin passed a constitutional amendment making it illegal for the federal government to run structural deficits more than 0.35 percent of gdp per annum from 2016 , while from 2020 , germany 's federal states will not be allowed to run any deficit at all .
germany this year is expected to reach a record debt of more than five percent of gdp , but has plans to start reducing this from 2011 .
greece , which has a crippling budget deficit of nearly 14 percent of national income , this month became the first eu nation to receive billions of euros in a rescue package to prevent it from defaulting on its debts .
" it does n't touch greece alone , " rehn said in brussels earlier this month .
" it has to do with the eurozone as a whole . "
the eu commission has warned nations to rein in their spending , including france and italy , which until now have held back from introducing unpopular budget cuts .
750-billion-euro package the economic turbulence in some eu nations has led speculators and investors to target the euro , which has in the past weeks fallen to its lowest levels against the us dollar in more than 14 months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commission chief wants greater control over national budgets eu finance ministers on monday announced a rescue package of up to 500 billion euros -lrb- $ 632 billion -rrb- to protect the euro , as market speculators increasingly targeted the currency and began betting on its collapse . the international monetary fund is to provide a further 250 billion euros .
" we will defend the stability of the euro at any price , " rehn said earlier monday .
meanwhile , in a rare interview , john taylor , a hedge fund speculator who made big profits in 1992 when speculators bet against the british pound , told bloomberg tv that a fall in the value of the euro was inevitable .
" the euro is a poor design and ca n't continue like this .
it 's quite easy to see that the euro will become much weaker , " taylor told bloomberg tv .
micheal leister , a strategist at the westlb bank in dusseldorf , said hedge fund speculators may well make big profits by betting on currency fluctuations , but that they alone couldn ’ t shake the euro .
" in times like this , when investors start panicking and liquidity is getting tight , one can make massive profits .
but the jury is still out on whether that is the cause of all the current troubles . " wl / dpa / afp / reuters editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he was speaking following his talks with afghan president hamid karzai in washington . president obama said relations between the two governments were " strong " and would endure and that the tensions had been exaggerated . " with respect to perceived tensions between the us government and the afghan government , a lot of them were simply overstated , " said obama . he said the two sides renewed their goal to defeat al qaeda and its extremist allies . for his part , karzai told reporters that he had " frank and productive " discussions with president obama and the relations between the united states and afghanistan were much stronger now .
" we are much more strongly related to each other today than we ever were before . " he also said the us has committed to reducing civilian casualties in afghanistan , an issue that has strained their relations in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan 's president hamid karzai , left , and secretary of state hillary clinton reassurance to provide security in the first of a series of meetings , afghan president hamid karzai on tuesday met us secretary of state hillary clinton who reassured him that the us would remain committed to providing security in afghanistan even after us troops have left . " as we look toward a responsible , orderly transition in the international combat mission in afghanistan , we will not abandon the afghan people , " clinton said .
karzai , meanwhile , reiterated that his country would stick to its responsibility to further develop afghanistan 's civilian and democratic structures . the us commitment should serve as a reassurance to karzai , whose visit comes as relations between afghanistan and the west have cooled in recent months .
last month , following a visit by obama to kabul in late march , karzai slammed the un and the international community , accusing them of perpetrating a " vast fraud " in last year 's presidential elections as part of a conspiracy to undermine his victory .
he said western coalition troops risked being seen as invaders rather than saviours of his country .
while many observers put it down to an attempt by a politically weakened karzai to assert his legitimacy in afghanistan , the unusually harsh outburst sparked criticism in western capitals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us , nato and afghan forces are preparing for a major offensive in kandahar critical juncture " karzai 's visit to the us is highly significant .
it will help the us government show the political community in washington that it still has control over karzai .
it shows that karzai depends on the international community for his political survival .
and it also shows that the west has no viable alternative to karzai in afghanistan , " henning riecke , an analyst at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" from the afghan government point of view , this visit which takes place at a sensitive time , is extremely important , " waheed omar , karzai 's spokesman told reporters last week .
it comes amid a us military surge in afghanistan and ahead of a major offensive against militants in the southern afghan province of kandahar .
the talks in washington also take place amid mounting anger in afghanistan against rising civilian casualties and dwindling public support for the afghan mission in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say distinguishing between who 's moderate and who 's not in the taliban will be tricky tricky talks with the taliban a peace conference , or jirga , to forge a national consensus on how to reconcile with the taliban is to take place later this month in kabul .
the british newspaper the guardian reported recently that afghanistan is proposing to offer top taliban leaders exile if they agree to stop fighting against the government .
the newspaper refered to a document suggesting insurgent leaders could face " potential exile in a third country . "
it also calls for " deradicalisation " classes for insurgents and thousands of new manual jobs to be created for taliban fighters who lay down their arms .
plans to reach out to the taliban are n't now .
in a shift in strategy , most western nations now accept that any political solution to the afghanistan conflict must include moderate elements of the taliban .
earlier this year , german foreign minister guido westerwelle drummed up support for an " exit program " for taliban fighters funded by the international community .
but some point out that the country that finds it the hardest to embrace talks with the taliban is the us .
" the americans are ambivalent about bringing the taliban to the table due to their links with al qaeda .
it 's heightened after the botched bombing at times square , " fabrice pothier , head of carnegie europe , a forum for european policymakers and think-tanks , told deutsche welle . " any agreement with the taliban has to involve security guarantees on both sides - the taliban must sever links with al qaeda and the us must guarantee that taliban fighters wo n't be imprisoned or killed .
for the us president , justifying making a deal with the taliban is a hard sell at home . "
european involvement observers say that though european allies lack the political clout the us has in afghanistan , the talks in washington are being followed carefully across the atlantic .
" on hard political questions , europe is out of the picture in afghanistan .
we do n't have the same credibility as the us because we are n't taking the same risks as the us .
but at the same time , europe has a long-term interest in institution-building in afghanistan .
so the talks in the us remain important to europe 's future role -lrb- in afghanistan -rrb- , " pothier said .
many european governments are grappling with waning support at home for the war in afghanistan as troop casualties rise .
experts say it stands to reason that good ties between kabul and washington would help obama fulfill his pledge to start bringing us troops home in mid-2011 - and thus signal the way for an end in sight to the afghan engagement .
" when obama announced he would begin a partial withdrawal of troops in mid-2011 it was greeted with cheer in europe .
it was interpreted here as a possible end of the deployment .
but that 's not what it 's going to be .
we can expect some tough discussions and friction between the us and its european allies later in november this year when american generals review the success of the surge , " riecke said .
expert : west should rethink afghan policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising troop casualties have raised concerns in the west " western capitals keep making demands on kabul on corruption and governance .
but the fact is that much of the corruption is fuelled by international aid money .
the price per square meter of property in kabul is higher than in tokyo - it 's a bubble created by the west , " pothier said .
the expert pointed out that a host of events in afghanistan this year - the peace conference , a foreign donor nations meeting in july , parliamentary elections in september - offer a chance for the west to pursue a different script in afghanistan .
" the reality of the afghan state is that the western-backed karzai government in kabul has not percolated to the country 's provinces and districts .
karzai and his smart english-speaking ministers who travel the world have failed to deliver basic services to the majority of the afghan people , " porthier said .
" the west needs to take a hard look at what 's gone wrong and push for broader political change and reform in afghanistan . "

the win in hamburg was atletico 's first european trophy . the spanish capital 's perpetual bridesmaid club atletico madrid became the center of attention this wednesday , outlasting fulham in extra time and winning the inaugural europa league trophy .
diego forlan of uruguay scored both goals for atletico , and was set up on both occasions by his argentine strike partner sergio " kun " aguero .
four minutes from time in the second extra time period , forlan got a glancing heel to aguero 's cross from the left byline , which was enough to dribble in for a goal after a deflection off of defender brede hangeland 's thigh .
it was a scrappy ending to a scrappy game , but one which most observers , including atletico defender tomas ujfalusi , felt was deserved .
" we fought for 120 minutes , and got the goals we needed from our best player , " said the defender , who was returning to what was his home stadium for four years as a bundesliga player .
ujfalusi had never won a trophy in his career , which has taken him from olomouc in the czech republic to hamburg to florence to madrid , and was clearly moved after the match .
" it 's for moments like this that we play football .
it 's an unbelievable feeling , " he said .
bildunterschrift : fulham 's goalkeeper mark schwarzer was unlucky to lose his second european final the build-up the match did n't catch fire until the 32nd minute , and even then did n't do so with much elegance .
aguero scuffed his left-footed shot attempt from the edge of the penalty box .
luckily for him , though , forlan was streaking into the area just then , and stuck out his boot to one-time the ball for a 1-0 lead .
but the travelling fulham fans did n't have long to wait before their side had evened the score - in similarly disjointed fashion .
a slip from an atletico defender meant bobby zamora found himself free on the left wing , but a poor touch robbed him of the chance to shoot as he came inside .
zoltan gera , however , was in place to cross the ball back out to the wing , where simon davies was waiting and scored with a neat volley .
not long after halftime , fulham 's goal-scoring hero bobby zamora succumbed to the ankle injury that had kept him out of fabio capello 's provisional england squad at midweek , forcing him out of the game .
his replacement , clint dempsey nearly put fulham in front within minutes of entering , but saw his shot parried by the atletico keeper - and was subsequently called for offside .
as the match wore on , atletico began to dominate possession , but had little to show for it as they failed to put many shots on target .
extended play bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fulham picked up the pace in extra time the second half came to a close and the match entered extra time , but the spanish side 's control of the ball continued .
forlan and aguero nearly linked up for another go-ahead strike at the end of the first period , but this time it was the argentine on the end of the chance , and he pushed the ball wide .
fulham looked livelier in the second extra time , earning free kicks in dangerous positions through the enterprising runs of dempsey and gera , but it was atletico who tipped the game 's balance in their favor as the madrid side 's dynamic south american duo struck again to end the game .
the loss was a particularly bitter one for fulham 's goalkeeper , australia 's mark schwarzer .
in 2006 he had led middlesborough to the final of the uefa cup -lrb- the forerunner tournament to the europa league -rrb- , only to fall to sevilla .
" when you look at the goals , you 'll see how unlucky we were , " said schwarzer .
" we had the game in our hands , had our own chances , and hoped that would be enough .
but it did n't turn out that way . "

more than 700 representatives have attended the 12th asia-pacific conference of german business in singapore . at the asia-pacific conference two years ago , juergen hambrecht , the chairman of the asia-pacific committee of german business complained that only ten percent of german exports went to asia .
but the percentage has increased in the meantime : " the numbers have , of course , changed tremendously during the crisis , but one thing is clear : asia has remained calm , " says hambrecht .
" the exports to asia have clearly not decreased , compared to the average .
actually , since the last asia-pacific conference , there has been an increase from ten to over 16 percent . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singapore will host the asia-pacific conference of german business from may 13-15 juergen hambrecht is also the chairman of basf , the world 's largest chemical company , located in ludwigshafen .
in the 1990s he served as the head of basf 's east asia operations in hong kong and has since remained a fan of asia . germany in asia the asian development bank predicts asia 's economy will grow 7.5 percent this year .
as an exporting nation , the german economy is well positioned in asia , juergen hambrecht believes .
german machinery , automobiles and chemical products enjoy a good reputation .
but above all , german innovations have great prospects there and promise sustainable growth : " for example , energy-efficient construction , electric vehicles , lightweight materials for cars , light materials for other devices , for household appliances , simply as a whole : resource-efficient products , " he says . china and india have also recognized that growth at the expense of the environment will not be sustainable and that renewable energy and greater energy efficiency are crucial .
with its leading environmental technology , german industry can be an ideal partner for them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers producing volkswagen jetta at a plant in changchun , china not optimal conditions despite the potential , german business in asia has not been optimal .
companies complain about protectionism , especially in china , which has intensified since the crisis .
juergen hambrecht also mentions different industrial standards , especially in china . another obstacle is the lack of protection of intellectual property .
but hambrecht dismisses the widespread prejudice : " the major allegation was that a lot of plagiarism was happening in china which is not at all true , " he says .
" intellectual property is an issue worldwide and not just in china .
china has learned that intellectual property is valuable and it is quite interesting that most patents are filed today in china . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens staff in their training centre in singapore gradual change despite the progress in this area , china remains a difficult partner politically .
juergen hambrecht is , however , committed to the policy of " change through trade " : " we would like vietnam or china tomorrow to look like germany today .
and that is not going to be possible .
it was a very long process for us too and every country has to go through this process .
if we are able to move forward with our trade or even local production this can be the strongest impetus for change . " most of the some 4,000 german companies currently active in china would probably agree .
around 2000 companies from germany have invested in india .
even in other asian countries , many medium and small-sized german companies are trying their luck . author : danhong zhang / du editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ecb president jean-claude trichet claims he had no other option . credibility is sacred to powerful monetary watchdogs like the us federal reserve , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- and germany 's bundesbank .
it 's something precious , central bankers are quick to admit , that is hard to earn but easy to lose .
perhaps no one knows that better than jean-claude trichet , an architect of the euro who oversaw the french central bank 's deliverance from political control in the 1990s .
the ecb president is waging the battle of his career to preserve the reputation of the bank , which he and his predecessor , former dutch central banker and european monetary institute president wim duisenberg , helped build .
the outcome is all but clear .
an unprecedented move to rescue the euro trichet has been under fire ever since eurozone finance ministers agreed over the weekend to launch an unprecedented aid package worth 750 billion euros -lrb- $ 1 trillion -rrb- .
the scheme is designed to rescue the euro as the effects of the greek fiscal crisis spill over into other indebted nations in the eurozone .
in a nutshell , it allows the ecb to buy government bonds issued by eurozone nations in financial trouble .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb president trichet is hearing plenty of criticism about the bank 's euro rescue move analysts argue the move has comprised the central bank 's independence ; the bank would effectively be buying government debt , giving governments a freer hand in raising money when it should actually be policing their efforts to do so .
trichet has vigorously defended the move .
at a press conference in basel , he said the central bank 's monetary policy was " hampered " and that a number of markets were " dysfunctional . "
and with an eye to critics , he said that the central bank has always been and will always be " fiercely and totally independent . "
critics , indeed , are in no short supply .
numerous monetary experts accuse the ecb 's 22-member council of bowing to political pressure from the european union and the 16 eurozone nations .
" significant stability risks " among the more outspoken and high-profile critics is bundesbank president alex weber , who is a leading candidate to succeed trichet next year .
in an interview with germany 's boersen zeitung , weber said that the purchase of government bonds " poses significant stability risks . "
he criticized the ecb council 's decision " even in this extraordinary situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans want the euro to remain a strong currency in a message to investors , david zervos , managing director of jefferies & co investment bank in new york , said that for all the attempts by the ecb to remain independent , it was unable " to push back on the eu power base in a crisis period . "
zervos warned that this development could make the eurozone " far less stable in any crisis times than a traditional national union . "
trichet realizes that ecb 's credibility is tightly linked to the bank 's independence and that any u-turns could soften the euro .
he knows all too well that if there 's anything europeans do n't want - especially many germans who still mourn the loss of their beloved deutschmark - it is a weak , suffering currency .
citizens of euro nations have every reason to be concerned : tuesday saw the euro retreat against the dollar as euphoria over the massive eurozone bailout announced on monday gave way to continuing doubts over the ability of euro nations to reduce their deficits .

how will german film fare at the world 's most important movie market ?
dw spoke with mariette rissenbeek from the organization german film service + marketing . just 19 films are in the running for the coveted palme d 'or at this year 's cannes film festival 's main competition , but hundreds more features and dozens of shorts will be shown over the course of the festival , which runs through may 23 .
aside from the main competition - which generally highlights films by well-known directors - there are parallel selections .
these include " un certain regard , " a showcase for film from younger or more unusual directors , films shown out of competition , special screenings , and cannes classics , among others . there are also longstanding and independent festivals that run parallel to the official event , such as the highly regarded directors ' fortnight , organized by the association of french film directors . deutsche welle : ms. rissenbeek , over the years the cannes film festival has earned quite a reputation as a hub of hype , where seeing and being seen is of primary importance .
is the festival still meaningful in the world of film ? marianne rissenbeek : cannes is no doubt the most important festival for film - and the most important market for films - up to today .
i think it is still the leading film market .
and a lot of the films in the official program are rather author-driven .
so it 's not only about glitz and glamour , but about filmmaking . last year a german-language film " das weisse band " -lrb- " the white ribbon " -rrb- won the palme d 'or .
coming out after " the lives of others " won the oscar in 2007 , it seemed to signal a sort of renaissance in german art film .
this year , though , there is just one german film in competition - and in fact it is a german-ukrainian-dutch co-production - " my joy , " by sergei loznitsa .
are the tides turning for german film ? well , " my joy " is indeed a german production , which a german producer has developed .
he developed the script together with the director , so it 's not only a co-production with a financial commitment from germany .
there was creative input and engagement from germany .
i don ’ t think we feel neglected or ignored by the festival selection committee . bildunterschrift : germany 's offer in this year 's competition is ' my joy , ' a co-production with ukraine and the netherlands what else is germany showing at the festival , either out of competition , or on the sidelines as part of the un certain regard series , or as part of the directors ' fortnight ? in un certain regard there are two german films , one from christoph hochhaeusler , called " unter dir die stadt " -lrb- " the city below " -rrb- , and the other one , " life , above all , " is a production that was developed in germany .
even though the director , oliver schmitz , is south african-german , he has both nationalities .
and then in the directors ' fortnight there is a german film , " picco , " by philip koch .
so actually we feel there is quite a strong presence from germany . what are you most looking forward to seeing or experiencing at this year 's festival ? well of course , for us it is more important to see how german films will do .
it will be exciting to see how christoph hochhaeusler has developed - he was at cannes a few years ago with another film .
it will be interesting to see how his film is received this year .
and " picco , " by philip koch , is a first film , so that is exciting too .
it is very seldom that you gain access to cannes with your first film , and then to the directors ' fortnight … the film will get a lot of publicity , so that 's good . and then maybe you noticed that the directors ' cut of " the tin drum " by volker schloendorff will be shown , 30 years after it was premiered in cannes .
i look forward to seeing how audiences react to that . there are a lot of films from asia in competition this year - south korea , thailand , taiwan .
what do you make of that ?
does it indicate anything about the future of european versus asian film ? cannes always had an input from asia , there were always asian films in the program , from china , or taiwan … i do n't think it 's new .
this year maybe the films were more interesting from asia , so they chose more for competition , but i could n't really say if it means anything . we have organized screenings in the market of 28 films overall , many of which have already been premiered elsewhere .
they all have special attributes , so it 's hard to say which ones will be most successful . -lrb- … -rrb- it used to be that you were guaranteed a certain number of contracts if you came to cannes , but since the financial crisis two years ago , that 's not true anymore .
still , it is an important market . interview : jennifer abramsohn editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decision has sparked a debate about how to protect the public from violent offenders . germany is under pressure to change its system of preventive detention , which allows for violent and repeat offenders to be detained indefinitely , even after they have served their sentence .
in december , the european court of human rights -lrb- echr -rrb- ruled that germany had violated the european human rights convention in the case of german inmate reinhard m. , who was convicted for attempted murder and had been kept in prison more than 10 years after his sentence .
the 52-year-old man had completed his five-year prison sentence in 1991 , but was not released , as he was deemed a danger to the public .
he was detained for the next 10 years , the maximum term for preventive detention at the time .
but a change in german legislation in 1998 meant that prisoners can now be detained indefinitely .
right to liberty the echr ruled that because reinhard m had been convicted before the change in the law in 1998 germany violated the ' right to liberty ' .
the court also stated that " there was no sufficient causal connection between his conviction and his continued deprivation of liberty . "
germany requested the case be referred to the echr 's grand chamber , which has now been refused , making the original court decision binding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 70 violent offenders in germany could benefit from the court ruling the echr can only tackle specific cases , but the ruling has already sparked a debate on how to protect the public from criminals convicted of murder , armed robbery , rape and other violent crimes .
" we need a comprehensive not an alarmist debate on the ramifications and options of today 's ruling -lsb- by the echr -rsb- , " justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger said in a statement on tuesday .
new framework the federal coalition agreement from last autumn calls for a reform of the current system , but the government has not released any details yet .
the bavarian justice minister , beate merk , however , has been vocal in calling for a complete overhaul of preventive detention in germany .
" a few band-aids here and there just will not do , " she said in a statement .
" we need a completely new system that can deal with violent offenders that are likely to reoffend and be a danger to the public even after they have served their sentence , " she added .
merk is adamant that some form of post-sentence detention is necessary , but she would like to see the sentence , ie the punishment , separated from the subsequent detention , with separate facilities and dedicated therapy options for violent criminals - one of the areas the echr had criticized as lacking in the current system .
longer sentences but some legal experts believe preventive detention is not the answer .
" the law has been extended in the past because of an unsubstantiated fear of crime , at a time when crime rates are going down in germany , and i do n't believe there is a need for it at all , " hermann kuehn , an expert in criminal law who runs his own law firm , told deutsche welle .
he would like to see longer sentences handed down instead .
currently , the maximum sentence is 15 years , unless a defendant is sentenced to life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's constitutional court endorsed retroactive preventive detention in 2004 " we could extend the fixed-term punishments to give courts the opportunity for a longer prison sentence and then leave it to the court to release him earlier if he is no longer a danger to society , " kuehn said .
he believes the power to release a potentially dangerous person should remain with the court , however .
he argues that leaving violent criminals to medical authorities for preventive detention by separating punishment from detention could be dangerous if you rely on medical staff alone to determine whether or not a detainee is a danger to society .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 12.05.2010 controversial new eu budget control gets mixed reactions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barosso believes a preliminary check on national spending plans would help the eu the european commission presented a controversial proposal to check budgets before they are submitted to national parliaments .
german chancellor angela merkel says its a good first step , but others say it goes too far . the european commission proposed that member countries submit their national budgets to brussels for " peer review " before they are sent on to their national parliaments .
" the package concerns the whole eu , but this specific proposal has more bite concerning the euro area countries , " european economic and monetary affairs commissioner olli rehn told reporters at a press conference in brussels .
the rules are aimed at avoiding a repeat of the greek debt crisis by preventing countries from over-spending .
the measures would apply to all members of the eu , not just the 16 nations that use the euro currency .
but many nations feel the eu is over-stepping its bounds by interfering in domestic politics .
france and sweden have both voiced their opposition to the measures . " that this should concern all countries is something we find a little strange , " swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt told a press conference in stockholm .
" this kind of discussion could perhaps be possible for -lrb- countries -rrb- with a budget policy that goes against the stability and growth pact , " he said . mixed message from berlin germany 's foreign minister , guido westerwelle , spoke out against the eu commission 's proposal , saying that national budgets belong to " the core of sovereignty . "
" the budget law is a matter of national parliaments .
the european commission does not determine the budget , that is the job of the german bundestag , the national parliament , " westerwelle told reporters in berlin .
however , chancellor angela merkel praised the eu 's attempts to crackdown on irresponsible spending , and said the budget measures did not necessarily usurp the powers of national parliaments .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 12.05.2010 obama , karzai reaffirm commitment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president barack obama , right , shakes hands with afghan president hamid karzai us president barack obama has praised the " broad and deepening " us partnership with afghanistan and reaffirmed the us commitment to build a secure and stable afghanistan .
he was speaking following his talks with afghan president hamid karzai in washington . president obama said relations between the two governments were " strong " and would endure and that the tensions had been exaggerated . " with respect to perceived tensions between the us government and the afghan government , a lot of them were simply overstated , " said obama . he said the two sides renewed their goal to defeat al qaeda and its extremist allies . for his part , karzai told reporters that he had " frank and productive " discussions with president obama and the relations between the united states and afghanistan were much stronger now .
" we are much more strongly related to each other today than we ever were before . " he also said the us has committed to reducing civilian casualties in afghanistan , an issue that has strained their relations in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan 's president hamid karzai , left , and secretary of state hillary clinton reassurance to provide security in the first of a series of meetings , afghan president hamid karzai on tuesday met us secretary of state hillary clinton who reassured him that the us would remain committed to providing security in afghanistan even after us troops have left . " as we look toward a responsible , orderly transition in the international combat mission in afghanistan , we will not abandon the afghan people , " clinton said .
karzai , meanwhile , reiterated that his country would stick to its responsibility to further develop afghanistan 's civilian and democratic structures . the us commitment should serve as a reassurance to karzai , whose visit comes as relations between afghanistan and the west have cooled in recent months .
last month , following a visit by obama to kabul in late march , karzai slammed the un and the international community , accusing them of perpetrating a " vast fraud " in last year 's presidential elections as part of a conspiracy to undermine his victory .
he said western coalition troops risked being seen as invaders rather than saviours of his country .
while many observers put it down to an attempt by a politically weakened karzai to assert his legitimacy in afghanistan , the unusually harsh outburst sparked criticism in western capitals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us , nato and afghan forces are preparing for a major offensive in kandahar critical juncture " karzai 's visit to the us is highly significant .
it will help the us government show the political community in washington that it still has control over karzai .
it shows that karzai depends on the international community for his political survival .
and it also shows that the west has no viable alternative to karzai in afghanistan , " henning riecke , an analyst at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" from the afghan government point of view , this visit which takes place at a sensitive time , is extremely important , " waheed omar , karzai 's spokesman told reporters last week .
it comes amid a us military surge in afghanistan and ahead of a major offensive against militants in the southern afghan province of kandahar .
the talks in washington also take place amid mounting anger in afghanistan against rising civilian casualties and dwindling public support for the afghan mission in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say distinguishing between who 's moderate and who 's not in the taliban will be tricky tricky talks with the taliban a peace conference , or jirga , to forge a national consensus on how to reconcile with the taliban is to take place later this month in kabul .
the british newspaper the guardian reported recently that afghanistan is proposing to offer top taliban leaders exile if they agree to stop fighting against the government .
the newspaper refered to a document suggesting insurgent leaders could face " potential exile in a third country . "
it also calls for " deradicalisation " classes for insurgents and thousands of new manual jobs to be created for taliban fighters who lay down their arms .
plans to reach out to the taliban are n't now .
in a shift in strategy , most western nations now accept that any political solution to the afghanistan conflict must include moderate elements of the taliban .
earlier this year , german foreign minister guido westerwelle drummed up support for an " exit program " for taliban fighters funded by the international community .
but some point out that the country that finds it the hardest to embrace talks with the taliban is the us .
" the americans are ambivalent about bringing the taliban to the table due to their links with al qaeda .
it 's heightened after the botched bombing at times square , " fabrice pothier , head of carnegie europe , a forum for european policymakers and think-tanks , told deutsche welle . " any agreement with the taliban has to involve security guarantees on both sides - the taliban must sever links with al qaeda and the us must guarantee that taliban fighters wo n't be imprisoned or killed .
for the us president , justifying making a deal with the taliban is a hard sell at home . "
european involvement observers say that though european allies lack the political clout the us has in afghanistan , the talks in washington are being followed carefully across the atlantic .
" on hard political questions , europe is out of the picture in afghanistan .
we do n't have the same credibility as the us because we are n't taking the same risks as the us .
but at the same time , europe has a long-term interest in institution-building in afghanistan .
so the talks in the us remain important to europe 's future role -lrb- in afghanistan -rrb- , " pothier said .
many european governments are grappling with waning support at home for the war in afghanistan as troop casualties rise .
experts say it stands to reason that good ties between kabul and washington would help obama fulfill his pledge to start bringing us troops home in mid-2011 - and thus signal the way for an end in sight to the afghan engagement .
" when obama announced he would begin a partial withdrawal of troops in mid-2011 it was greeted with cheer in europe .
it was interpreted here as a possible end of the deployment .
but that 's not what it 's going to be .
we can expect some tough discussions and friction between the us and its european allies later in november this year when american generals review the success of the surge , " riecke said .
expert : west should rethink afghan policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising troop casualties have raised concerns in the west " western capitals keep making demands on kabul on corruption and governance .
but the fact is that much of the corruption is fuelled by international aid money .
the price per square meter of property in kabul is higher than in tokyo - it 's a bubble created by the west , " pothier said .
the expert pointed out that a host of events in afghanistan this year - the peace conference , a foreign donor nations meeting in july , parliamentary elections in september - offer a chance for the west to pursue a different script in afghanistan .
" the reality of the afghan state is that the western-backed karzai government in kabul has not percolated to the country 's provinces and districts .
karzai and his smart english-speaking ministers who travel the world have failed to deliver basic services to the majority of the afghan people , " porthier said .
" the west needs to take a hard look at what 's gone wrong and push for broader political change and reform in afghanistan . "

analyst forecasts had predicted growth would remain stagnant .
the federal statistics office in wiesbaden also revised 2009 figures for economic activity , saying it had expanded 0.2 percent in the last quarter of 2009 .
that put full-year contraction lower than expected : 4.9 percent , down from an earlier-reported 5.0 percent .
the statisticians attributed the slow gain in momentum overall in germany to an especially cold winter , which hampered construction activity .
exports and investments in industrial equipment had nonetheless provided engines for growth , the report said .
and data for industrial orders and production in march point to a solid rebound in that sector .

ecb president jean-claude trichet claims he had no other option . credibility is sacred to powerful monetary watchdogs like the us federal reserve , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- and germany 's bundesbank .
it 's something precious , central bankers are quick to admit , that is hard to earn but easy to lose .
perhaps no one knows that better than jean-claude trichet , an architect of the euro who oversaw the french central bank 's deliverance from political control in the 1990s .
the ecb president is waging the battle of his career to preserve the reputation of the bank , which he and his predecessor , former dutch central banker and european monetary institute president wim duisenberg , helped build .
the outcome is all but clear .
an unprecedented move to rescue the euro trichet has been under fire ever since eurozone finance ministers agreed over the weekend to launch an unprecedented aid package worth 750 billion euros -lrb- $ 1 trillion -rrb- .
the scheme is designed to rescue the euro as the effects of the greek fiscal crisis spill over into other indebted nations in the eurozone .
in a nutshell , it allows the ecb to buy government bonds issued by eurozone nations in financial trouble .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb president trichet is hearing plenty of criticism about the bank 's euro rescue move analysts argue the move has comprised the central bank 's independence ; the bank would effectively be buying government debt , giving governments a freer hand in raising money when it should actually be policing their efforts to do so .
trichet has vigorously defended the move .
at a press conference in basel , he said the central bank 's monetary policy was " hampered " and that a number of markets were " dysfunctional . "
and with an eye to critics , he said that the central bank has always been and will always be " fiercely and totally independent . "
critics , indeed , are in no short supply .
numerous monetary experts accuse the ecb 's 22-member council of bowing to political pressure from the european union and the 16 eurozone nations .
" significant stability risks " among the more outspoken and high-profile critics is bundesbank president alex weber , who is a leading candidate to succeed trichet next year .
in an interview with germany 's boersen zeitung , weber said that the purchase of government bonds " poses significant stability risks . "
he criticized the ecb council 's decision " even in this extraordinary situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans want the euro to remain a strong currency in a message to investors , david zervos , managing director of jefferies & co investment bank in new york , said that for all the attempts by the ecb to remain independent , it was unable " to push back on the eu power base in a crisis period . "
zervos warned that this development could make the eurozone " far less stable in any crisis times than a traditional national union . "
trichet realizes that ecb 's credibility is tightly linked to the bank 's independence and that any u-turns could soften the euro .
he knows all too well that if there 's anything europeans do n't want - especially many germans who still mourn the loss of their beloved deutschmark - it is a weak , suffering currency .
citizens of euro nations have every reason to be concerned : tuesday saw the euro retreat against the dollar as euphoria over the massive eurozone bailout announced on monday gave way to continuing doubts over the ability of euro nations to reduce their deficits .

more than 700 representatives have attended the 12th asia-pacific conference of german business in singapore . at the asia-pacific conference two years ago , juergen hambrecht , the chairman of the asia-pacific committee of german business complained that only ten percent of german exports went to asia .
but the percentage has increased in the meantime : " the numbers have , of course , changed tremendously during the crisis , but one thing is clear : asia has remained calm , " says hambrecht .
" the exports to asia have clearly not decreased , compared to the average .
actually , since the last asia-pacific conference , there has been an increase from ten to over 16 percent . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singapore will host the asia-pacific conference of german business from may 13-15 juergen hambrecht is also the chairman of basf , the world 's largest chemical company , located in ludwigshafen .
in the 1990s he served as the head of basf 's east asia operations in hong kong and has since remained a fan of asia . germany in asia the asian development bank predicts asia 's economy will grow 7.5 percent this year .
as an exporting nation , the german economy is well positioned in asia , juergen hambrecht believes .
german machinery , automobiles and chemical products enjoy a good reputation .
but above all , german innovations have great prospects there and promise sustainable growth : " for example , energy-efficient construction , electric vehicles , lightweight materials for cars , light materials for other devices , for household appliances , simply as a whole : resource-efficient products , " he says . china and india have also recognized that growth at the expense of the environment will not be sustainable and that renewable energy and greater energy efficiency are crucial .
with its leading environmental technology , german industry can be an ideal partner for them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers producing volkswagen jetta at a plant in changchun , china not optimal conditions despite the potential , german business in asia has not been optimal .
companies complain about protectionism , especially in china , which has intensified since the crisis .
juergen hambrecht also mentions different industrial standards , especially in china . another obstacle is the lack of protection of intellectual property .
but hambrecht dismisses the widespread prejudice : " the major allegation was that a lot of plagiarism was happening in china which is not at all true , " he says .
" intellectual property is an issue worldwide and not just in china .
china has learned that intellectual property is valuable and it is quite interesting that most patents are filed today in china . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens staff in their training centre in singapore gradual change despite the progress in this area , china remains a difficult partner politically .
juergen hambrecht is , however , committed to the policy of " change through trade " : " we would like vietnam or china tomorrow to look like germany today .
and that is not going to be possible .
it was a very long process for us too and every country has to go through this process .
if we are able to move forward with our trade or even local production this can be the strongest impetus for change . " most of the some 4,000 german companies currently active in china would probably agree .
around 2000 companies from germany have invested in india .
even in other asian countries , many medium and small-sized german companies are trying their luck . author : danhong zhang / du editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

brussels believes germany 's tough debt-reduction measures , enshrined in the constitution , could be a model for other eu states .
in the wednesday edition of the german weekly , die zeit , rehn said brussels should have greater powers and be able to monitor the national budgets of eu nations .
he said regulations must be put in place to make this possible .
" we want governments to send their budget outlines to brussels for review before they are approved by their national parliaments , " rehn said .
" we can then see early whether a country is adhering to the stability and growth pact .
if not , we would intervene , " he said .
berlin has rejected such measures , however , saying it would impact on its budget sovereignty .
many eurozone nations in trouble - in particular greece , spain , and portugal - have accumulated budget deficits vastly exceeding the three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- permitted by the stability and growth pact .
the pact is meant to ensure the stability of the economic and monetary union .
german debt-trimming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehn favors the german debt-reduction model rehn also told die zeit that he believed germany 's plans for debt reduction could serve as a model for other eu nations .
in 2009 , berlin passed a constitutional amendment making it illegal for the federal government to run structural deficits more than 0.35 percent of gdp per annum from 2016 , while from 2020 , germany 's federal states will not be allowed to run any deficit at all .
germany this year is expected to reach a record debt of more than five percent of gdp , but has plans to start reducing this from 2011 .
greece , which has a crippling budget deficit of nearly 14 percent of national income , this month became the first eu nation to receive billions of euros in a rescue package to prevent it from defaulting on its debts .
" it does n't touch greece alone , " rehn said in brussels earlier this month .
" it has to do with the eurozone as a whole . "
the eu commission has warned nations to rein in their spending , including france and italy , which until now have held back from introducing unpopular budget cuts .
750-billion-euro package the economic turbulence in some eu nations has led speculators and investors to target the euro , which has in the past weeks fallen to its lowest levels against the us dollar in more than 14 months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commission chief wants greater control over national budgets eu finance ministers on monday announced a rescue package of up to 500 billion euros -lrb- $ 632 billion -rrb- to protect the euro , as market speculators increasingly targeted the currency and began betting on its collapse . the international monetary fund is to provide a further 250 billion euros .
" we will defend the stability of the euro at any price , " rehn said earlier monday .
meanwhile , in a rare interview , john taylor , a hedge fund speculator who made big profits in 1992 when speculators bet against the british pound , told bloomberg tv that a fall in the value of the euro was inevitable .
" the euro is a poor design and ca n't continue like this .
it 's quite easy to see that the euro will become much weaker , " taylor told bloomberg tv .
micheal leister , a strategist at the westlb bank in dusseldorf , said hedge fund speculators may well make big profits by betting on currency fluctuations , but that they alone couldn ’ t shake the euro .
" in times like this , when investors start panicking and liquidity is getting tight , one can make massive profits .
but the jury is still out on whether that is the cause of all the current troubles . " wl / dpa / afp / reuters editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europa league -pipe- 12.05.2010 atletico madrid downs fulham in hamburg to lift europa league trophy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego forlan bagged both goals for atletico uruguay 's diego forlan was the hero , netting two goals in the spanish side 's 2-1 extra time win over london side fulham .
the win in hamburg was atletico 's first european trophy . the spanish capital 's perpetual bridesmaid club atletico madrid became the center of attention this wednesday , outlasting fulham in extra time and winning the inaugural europa league trophy .
diego forlan of uruguay scored both goals for atletico , and was set up on both occasions by his argentine strike partner sergio " kun " aguero .
four minutes from time in the second extra time period , forlan got a glancing heel to aguero 's cross from the left byline , which was enough to dribble in for a goal after a deflection off of defender brede hangeland 's thigh .
it was a scrappy ending to a scrappy game , but one which most observers , including atletico defender tomas ujfalusi , felt was deserved .
" we fought for 120 minutes , and got the goals we needed from our best player , " said the defender , who was returning to what was his home stadium for four years as a bundesliga player .
ujfalusi had never won a trophy in his career , which has taken him from olomouc in the czech republic to hamburg to florence to madrid , and was clearly moved after the match .
" it 's for moments like this that we play football .
it 's an unbelievable feeling , " he said .
bildunterschrift : fulham 's goalkeeper mark schwarzer was unlucky to lose his second european final the build-up the match did n't catch fire until the 32nd minute , and even then did n't do so with much elegance .
aguero scuffed his left-footed shot attempt from the edge of the penalty box .
luckily for him , though , forlan was streaking into the area just then , and stuck out his boot to one-time the ball for a 1-0 lead .
but the travelling fulham fans did n't have long to wait before their side had evened the score - in similarly disjointed fashion .
a slip from an atletico defender meant bobby zamora found himself free on the left wing , but a poor touch robbed him of the chance to shoot as he came inside .
zoltan gera , however , was in place to cross the ball back out to the wing , where simon davies was waiting and scored with a neat volley .
not long after halftime , fulham 's goal-scoring hero bobby zamora succumbed to the ankle injury that had kept him out of fabio capello 's provisional england squad at midweek , forcing him out of the game .
his replacement , clint dempsey nearly put fulham in front within minutes of entering , but saw his shot parried by the atletico keeper - and was subsequently called for offside .
as the match wore on , atletico began to dominate possession , but had little to show for it as they failed to put many shots on target .
extended play bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fulham picked up the pace in extra time the second half came to a close and the match entered extra time , but the spanish side 's control of the ball continued .
forlan and aguero nearly linked up for another go-ahead strike at the end of the first period , but this time it was the argentine on the end of the chance , and he pushed the ball wide .
fulham looked livelier in the second extra time , earning free kicks in dangerous positions through the enterprising runs of dempsey and gera , but it was atletico who tipped the game 's balance in their favor as the madrid side 's dynamic south american duo struck again to end the game .
the loss was a particularly bitter one for fulham 's goalkeeper , australia 's mark schwarzer .
in 2006 he had led middlesborough to the final of the uefa cup -lrb- the forerunner tournament to the europa league -rrb- , only to fall to sevilla .
" when you look at the goals , you 'll see how unlucky we were , " said schwarzer .
" we had the game in our hands , had our own chances , and hoped that would be enough .
but it did n't turn out that way . "

german chancellor angela merkel phoned david cameron on wednesday to congratulate him , and invited him to visit germany soon for more comprehensive talks , according to a government spokesman in berlin .
in brussels , european union officials hope the liberal democrats ' presence in the new coalition will soften the tories ' traditionally euroskeptic stance , and help quieten hardline backbenchers within the center-right party .
european commission president jose manuel barroso also congratulated david cameron , saying his government faced difficult choices in difficult times .
" what i hope is that the british prime minister will of course defend -lsb- his country 's -rsb- national interests in the european setting , " barroso told reporters in brussels , saying he was not concerned by conservative election manifesto pledges to claw back powers from brussels .
uncertain stance but no one in brussels is quite certain how far the new british government will go in defending its national interests , especially now that the liberal democrats form a part of its leadership .
as the country grapples with a runaway national debt and budget deficit , many in brussels believe that europe is not the top priority for the new conservative-led government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has the reputation of being a reluctant eu member " cameron has far too much on his plate to think about picking a fight with europe , " the european policy center 's -lrb- epc -rrb- acting director of studies , john wyles , told deutsche welle .
" and providing there is nothing major in the policy pipeline here -lsb- in brussels -rsb- , he is certainly not going to be looking for a fight . "
wyles also expects the conservatives and liberal democrats not to fight over european policy in the short term , partly because the liberal democrats have been sufficiently vague on the issue in their manifesto .
the message filtering through to brussels from london , according to wyles , is that david cameron 's approach will be entirely pragmatic on europe and relatively low key .
and so far , the new british government has signaled it will be ' business as usual ' as far as the european union is concerned .
conservatives remain a concern still , eu officials are keeping a watchful eye on britain 's new foreign secretary , william hague , who has been playing down policy differences over the european union within the new coalition .
hague did rule out further european integration for britain , telling reporters it was a " red line " for his party , but he focussed more on the agreements reached in negotiations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservatives have no plans to join the single european currency " the liberal democrats have readily agreed with us that it will not be the policy of this government to join the euro or to propose to join the euro in its lifetime , " former conservative party leader hague said .
" look , all british governments sometimes face difficulties over european policy . "
cameron pulled his conservatives out of the main center-right grouping in the european parliament , the european people 's party , because hardline conservatives deemed the group too pro-european .
but the epc 's john wyles believes that while this sounded some alarm bells in brussels , it 's unwise to over-analyze the decision .
" that was just a piece of red meat that -lsb- cameron -rsb- felt he needed to toss to the euroskeptic majority in order to get elected , " wyles said .
" it was not well judged , and it has created a lot of resentment against the conservatives among the center-right in europe , but they will get over that - i think many of them have largely got over it already . "
some in brussels even believe the conservatives will find their way back to the european people 's party , but john wyles said that this is an unlikely scenario .
he believes the new prime minister will have to strike a balance on europe - keeping hardline euroskeptics on board , while simultaneously staying sufficiently pragmatic to further britain 's interests on the continent .

estonia is set to adopt the euro and plans to replace its currency , the kroon , on january 1 , 2011 .
the move would make the baltic country the 17th eurozone member . the european commission on wednesday said estonia 's economy is strong enough to join the euro zone .
estonia plans to switch to the shared european currency on january 1 , 2011 . the commission had examined estonia 's debt , deficit , inflation , and interest levels .
olli rehn , the eu commissioner for economic and budgetary affairs , said the country had achieved " a high degree of sustainable economic convergence " and was therefore ready to adopt the euro .
' prudent fiscal policy ' is key " to ensure that the adoption of the euro is a success , estonia must pursue its efforts to maintain a prudent fiscal policy stance , " he said .
he urged tallinn to " remain vigilant and react early and decisively " if problems emerge .
the commission 's positive assessment came in the wake of an enormous european bailout for greece , which shed new light on the importance of countries taking inflation-control measures .
countries are concerned that massive debt problems in the eurozone could make brussels wary of taking on a new member .
economic data adds up according to rehn , " the assessment and our proposal is also a strong signal about the euro area and to the eu more broadly , " testifying that sound economic policies such as those adopted by estonia " generate concrete results . "
estonia has had an average budget surplus of 1.8 percent of gross domestic product between 2002 to 2007 , deteriorating to a deficit of minus 2.7 percent in 2008 and minus 1.7 percent in 2009 as a result of the economic crisis .
that is still well within the eurozone 's threshold of 3 percent .
the brussels-based eu executive said the country 's " price performance -lsb- is -rsb- sustainable " as average inflation fell to minus 0.7 percent in the 12 months to march 2010 .
but it warned that " estonia " will need to remain vigilant to keep inflation at a low level . "
in order for estonia to be finally welcomed into the eurozone , wednesday 's approval will have to be confirmed by the eu 's finance ministers in july .
so far , no positive recommendation by the commission on eurozone enlargement has ever been contradicted by eu member states .
estonia shifted rapidly from a communist command economy to the free market after breaking from the crumbling soviet bloc in 1991 .
the 1.3-million-strong country had hoped to adopt the euro in 2007 , but failed to meet the inflation-control criteria at the time. jen / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 12.05.2010 cannes is ' more than glitz and glamour , ' german promoter says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at this year 's festival , 16 films are in competition the 63rd edition of the cannes film festival opens on may 12 .
how will german film fare at the world 's most important movie market ?
dw spoke with mariette rissenbeek from the organization german film service + marketing . just 19 films are in the running for the coveted palme d 'or at this year 's cannes film festival 's main competition , but hundreds more features and dozens of shorts will be shown over the course of the festival , which runs through may 23 .
aside from the main competition - which generally highlights films by well-known directors - there are parallel selections .
these include " un certain regard , " a showcase for film from younger or more unusual directors , films shown out of competition , special screenings , and cannes classics , among others . there are also longstanding and independent festivals that run parallel to the official event , such as the highly regarded directors ' fortnight , organized by the association of french film directors . deutsche welle : ms. rissenbeek , over the years the cannes film festival has earned quite a reputation as a hub of hype , where seeing and being seen is of primary importance .
is the festival still meaningful in the world of film ? marianne rissenbeek : cannes is no doubt the most important festival for film - and the most important market for films - up to today .
i think it is still the leading film market .
and a lot of the films in the official program are rather author-driven .
so it 's not only about glitz and glamour , but about filmmaking . last year a german-language film " das weisse band " -lrb- " the white ribbon " -rrb- won the palme d 'or .
coming out after " the lives of others " won the oscar in 2007 , it seemed to signal a sort of renaissance in german art film .
this year , though , there is just one german film in competition - and in fact it is a german-ukrainian-dutch co-production - " my joy , " by sergei loznitsa .
are the tides turning for german film ? well , " my joy " is indeed a german production , which a german producer has developed .
he developed the script together with the director , so it 's not only a co-production with a financial commitment from germany .
there was creative input and engagement from germany .
i don ’ t think we feel neglected or ignored by the festival selection committee . bildunterschrift : germany 's offer in this year 's competition is ' my joy , ' a co-production with ukraine and the netherlands what else is germany showing at the festival , either out of competition , or on the sidelines as part of the un certain regard series , or as part of the directors ' fortnight ? in un certain regard there are two german films , one from christoph hochhaeusler , called " unter dir die stadt " -lrb- " the city below " -rrb- , and the other one , " life , above all , " is a production that was developed in germany .
even though the director , oliver schmitz , is south african-german , he has both nationalities .
and then in the directors ' fortnight there is a german film , " picco , " by philip koch .
so actually we feel there is quite a strong presence from germany . what are you most looking forward to seeing or experiencing at this year 's festival ? well of course , for us it is more important to see how german films will do .
it will be exciting to see how christoph hochhaeusler has developed - he was at cannes a few years ago with another film .
it will be interesting to see how his film is received this year .
and " picco , " by philip koch , is a first film , so that is exciting too .
it is very seldom that you gain access to cannes with your first film , and then to the directors ' fortnight … the film will get a lot of publicity , so that 's good . and then maybe you noticed that the directors ' cut of " the tin drum " by volker schloendorff will be shown , 30 years after it was premiered in cannes .
i look forward to seeing how audiences react to that . there are a lot of films from asia in competition this year - south korea , thailand , taiwan .
what do you make of that ?
does it indicate anything about the future of european versus asian film ? cannes always had an input from asia , there were always asian films in the program , from china , or taiwan … i do n't think it 's new .
this year maybe the films were more interesting from asia , so they chose more for competition , but i could n't really say if it means anything . we have organized screenings in the market of 28 films overall , many of which have already been premiered elsewhere .
they all have special attributes , so it 's hard to say which ones will be most successful . -lrb- … -rrb- it used to be that you were guaranteed a certain number of contracts if you came to cannes , but since the financial crisis two years ago , that 's not true anymore .
still , it is an important market . interview : jennifer abramsohn editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

analyst forecasts had predicted growth would remain stagnant .
the federal statistics office in wiesbaden also revised 2009 figures for economic activity , saying it had expanded 0.2 percent in the last quarter of 2009 .
that put full-year contraction lower than expected : 4.9 percent , down from an earlier-reported 5.0 percent .
the statisticians attributed the slow gain in momentum overall in germany to an especially cold winter , which hampered construction activity .
exports and investments in industrial equipment had nonetheless provided engines for growth , the report said .
and data for industrial orders and production in march point to a solid rebound in that sector .
the government forecasts growth of 1.4 percent for 2010 overall. jen / afp / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

how will german film fare at the world 's most important movie market ?
dw spoke with mariette rissenbeek from the organization german film service + marketing . just 19 films are in the running for the coveted palme d 'or at this year 's cannes film festival 's main competition , but hundreds more features and dozens of shorts will be shown over the course of the festival , which runs through may 23 .
aside from the main competition - which generally highlights films by well-known directors - there are parallel selections .
these include " un certain regard , " a showcase for film from younger or more unusual directors , films shown out of competition , special screenings , and cannes classics , among others . there are also longstanding and independent festivals that run parallel to the official event , such as the highly regarded directors ' fortnight , organized by the association of french film directors . deutsche welle : ms. rissenbeek , over the years the cannes film festival has earned quite a reputation as a hub of hype , where seeing and being seen is of primary importance .
is the festival still meaningful in the world of film ? marianne rissenbeek : cannes is no doubt the most important festival for film - and the most important market for films - up to today .
i think it is still the leading film market .
and a lot of the films in the official program are rather author-driven .
so it 's not only about glitz and glamour , but about filmmaking . last year a german-language film " das weisse band " -lrb- " the white ribbon " -rrb- won the palme d 'or .
coming out after " the lives of others " won the oscar in 2007 , it seemed to signal a sort of renaissance in german art film .
this year , though , there is just one german film in competition - and in fact it is a german-ukrainian-dutch co-production - " my joy , " by sergei loznitsa .
are the tides turning for german film ? well , " my joy " is indeed a german production , which a german producer has developed .
he developed the script together with the director , so it 's not only a co-production with a financial commitment from germany .
there was creative input and engagement from germany .
i don ’ t think we feel neglected or ignored by the festival selection committee . bildunterschrift : germany 's offer in this year 's competition is ' my joy , ' a co-production with ukraine and the netherlands what else is germany showing at the festival , either out of competition , or on the sidelines as part of the un certain regard series , or as part of the directors ' fortnight ? in un certain regard there are two german films , one from christoph hochhaeusler , called " unter dir die stadt " -lrb- " the city below " -rrb- , and the other one , " life , above all , " is a production that was developed in germany .
even though the director , oliver schmitz , is south african-german , he has both nationalities .
and then in the directors ' fortnight there is a german film , " picco , " by philip koch .
so actually we feel there is quite a strong presence from germany . what are you most looking forward to seeing or experiencing at this year 's festival ? well of course , for us it is more important to see how german films will do .
it will be exciting to see how christoph hochhaeusler has developed - he was at cannes a few years ago with another film .
it will be interesting to see how his film is received this year .
and " picco , " by philip koch , is a first film , so that is exciting too .
it is very seldom that you gain access to cannes with your first film , and then to the directors ' fortnight … the film will get a lot of publicity , so that 's good . and then maybe you noticed that the directors ' cut of " the tin drum " by volker schloendorff will be shown , 30 years after it was premiered in cannes .
i look forward to seeing how audiences react to that . there are a lot of films from asia in competition this year - south korea , thailand , taiwan .
what do you make of that ?
does it indicate anything about the future of european versus asian film ? cannes always had an input from asia , there were always asian films in the program , from china , or taiwan … i do n't think it 's new .
this year maybe the films were more interesting from asia , so they chose more for competition , but i could n't really say if it means anything . we have organized screenings in the market of 28 films overall , many of which have already been premiered elsewhere .
they all have special attributes , so it 's hard to say which ones will be most successful . -lrb- … -rrb- it used to be that you were guaranteed a certain number of contracts if you came to cannes , but since the financial crisis two years ago , that 's not true anymore .

the conservative party leader has formed an unlikely coaltion with the liberal democrats . britain 's new prime minister david cameron has begun appointing political allies to key cabinet posts and establishing the agenda of his coalition government . the leader of the conservative party filled many top cabinet posts on wednesday , including lawmaker liam fox as defense secretary , william hague as foreign secretary , kenneth clarke as justice secretary and theresa may as home secretary . liberal democrat negotiator david laws was appointed as chief secretary to the treasury . uneasy partnership cameron , 43 , has formed a coalition with the liberal democrats , despite stark ideological differences between the two parties . " we have a shared agenda and a shared resolve to tackle the challenges our country faces , to safeguard our national security and support our troops abroad , to tackle the debt crisis , to repair our broken political system and to build a stronger society , " cameron said at a press conference in london on wednesday . cameron was accompanied by his deputy pime minister , nick clegg , the leader of the liberal democrats .
the two formed a coalition after cameron made an attractive offer of a referendum on electoral reform , a key party platform of the liberal democrats . clegg is among the five liberal democrats in the coalition cabinet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cameron was accused in the british press of being too posh to govern end of labour party era cameron has taken over from former prime minister gordon brown , whose resignation officially ended the labour party 's 13-year hold on power . in his first speech as prime minister , cameron thanked the outgoing prime minister for his " long record of dedicated public service , " and spoke of the challenges ahead for britain . brown became prime minister in june 2007 after tony blair stepped down following 10 years in power and three straight general election victories . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world leaders offered their congratulations to cameron the conservatives won the most seats - 306 - and votes in last thursday 's election . brown 's ruling labour party was beaten into second place with 258 seats , while the liberal democrats came in a distant third with 57 seats .

estonia is set to adopt the euro and plans to replace its currency , the kroon , on january 1 , 2011 .
the move would make the baltic country the 17th eurozone member . the european commission on wednesday said estonia 's economy is strong enough to join the euro zone .
estonia plans to switch to the shared european currency on january 1 , 2011 . the commission had examined estonia 's debt , deficit , inflation , and interest levels .
olli rehn , the eu commissioner for economic and budgetary affairs , said the country had achieved " a high degree of sustainable economic convergence " and was therefore ready to adopt the euro .
' prudent fiscal policy ' is key " to ensure that the adoption of the euro is a success , estonia must pursue its efforts to maintain a prudent fiscal policy stance , " he said .
he urged tallinn to " remain vigilant and react early and decisively " if problems emerge .
the commission 's positive assessment came in the wake of an enormous european bailout for greece , which shed new light on the importance of countries taking inflation-control measures .
countries are concerned that massive debt problems in the eurozone could make brussels wary of taking on a new member .
economic data adds up according to rehn , " the assessment and our proposal is also a strong signal about the euro area and to the eu more broadly , " testifying that sound economic policies such as those adopted by estonia " generate concrete results . "
estonia has had an average budget surplus of 1.8 percent of gross domestic product between 2002 to 2007 , deteriorating to a deficit of minus 2.7 percent in 2008 and minus 1.7 percent in 2009 as a result of the economic crisis .
that is still well within the eurozone 's threshold of 3 percent .
the brussels-based eu executive said the country 's " price performance -lsb- is -rsb- sustainable " as average inflation fell to minus 0.7 percent in the 12 months to march 2010 .
but it warned that " estonia " will need to remain vigilant to keep inflation at a low level . "
in order for estonia to be finally welcomed into the eurozone , wednesday 's approval will have to be confirmed by the eu 's finance ministers in july .
so far , no positive recommendation by the commission on eurozone enlargement has ever been contradicted by eu member states .
estonia shifted rapidly from a communist command economy to the free market after breaking from the crumbling soviet bloc in 1991 .
the 1.3-million-strong country had hoped to adopt the euro in 2007 , but failed to meet the inflation-control criteria at the time. jen / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 12.05.2010 cannes is ' more than glitz and glamour , ' german promoter says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at this year 's festival , 16 films are in competition the 63rd edition of the cannes film festival opens on may 12 .
how will german film fare at the world 's most important movie market ?
dw spoke with mariette rissenbeek from the organization german film service + marketing . just 19 films are in the running for the coveted palme d 'or at this year 's cannes film festival 's main competition , but hundreds more features and dozens of shorts will be shown over the course of the festival , which runs through may 23 .
aside from the main competition - which generally highlights films by well-known directors - there are parallel selections .
these include " un certain regard , " a showcase for film from younger or more unusual directors , films shown out of competition , special screenings , and cannes classics , among others . there are also longstanding and independent festivals that run parallel to the official event , such as the highly regarded directors ' fortnight , organized by the association of french film directors . deutsche welle : ms. rissenbeek , over the years the cannes film festival has earned quite a reputation as a hub of hype , where seeing and being seen is of primary importance .
is the festival still meaningful in the world of film ? marianne rissenbeek : cannes is no doubt the most important festival for film - and the most important market for films - up to today .
i think it is still the leading film market .
and a lot of the films in the official program are rather author-driven .
so it 's not only about glitz and glamour , but about filmmaking . last year a german-language film " das weisse band " -lrb- " the white ribbon " -rrb- won the palme d 'or .
coming out after " the lives of others " won the oscar in 2007 , it seemed to signal a sort of renaissance in german art film .
this year , though , there is just one german film in competition - and in fact it is a german-ukrainian-dutch co-production - " my joy , " by sergei loznitsa .
are the tides turning for german film ? well , " my joy " is indeed a german production , which a german producer has developed .
he developed the script together with the director , so it 's not only a co-production with a financial commitment from germany .
there was creative input and engagement from germany .
i don ’ t think we feel neglected or ignored by the festival selection committee . bildunterschrift : germany 's offer in this year 's competition is ' my joy , ' a co-production with ukraine and the netherlands what else is germany showing at the festival , either out of competition , or on the sidelines as part of the un certain regard series , or as part of the directors ' fortnight ? in un certain regard there are two german films , one from christoph hochhaeusler , called " unter dir die stadt " -lrb- " the city below " -rrb- , and the other one , " life , above all , " is a production that was developed in germany .
even though the director , oliver schmitz , is south african-german , he has both nationalities .
and then in the directors ' fortnight there is a german film , " picco , " by philip koch .
so actually we feel there is quite a strong presence from germany . what are you most looking forward to seeing or experiencing at this year 's festival ? well of course , for us it is more important to see how german films will do .
it will be exciting to see how christoph hochhaeusler has developed - he was at cannes a few years ago with another film .
it will be interesting to see how his film is received this year .
and " picco , " by philip koch , is a first film , so that is exciting too .
it is very seldom that you gain access to cannes with your first film , and then to the directors ' fortnight … the film will get a lot of publicity , so that 's good . and then maybe you noticed that the directors ' cut of " the tin drum " by volker schloendorff will be shown , 30 years after it was premiered in cannes .
i look forward to seeing how audiences react to that . there are a lot of films from asia in competition this year - south korea , thailand , taiwan .
what do you make of that ?
does it indicate anything about the future of european versus asian film ? cannes always had an input from asia , there were always asian films in the program , from china , or taiwan … i do n't think it 's new .
this year maybe the films were more interesting from asia , so they chose more for competition , but i could n't really say if it means anything . we have organized screenings in the market of 28 films overall , many of which have already been premiered elsewhere .
they all have special attributes , so it 's hard to say which ones will be most successful . -lrb- … -rrb- it used to be that you were guaranteed a certain number of contracts if you came to cannes , but since the financial crisis two years ago , that 's not true anymore .
still , it is an important market . interview : jennifer abramsohn editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

brussels believes germany 's tough debt-reduction measures , enshrined in the constitution , could be a model for other eu states .
in the wednesday edition of the german weekly , die zeit , rehn said brussels should have greater powers and be able to monitor the national budgets of eu nations .
he said regulations must be put in place to make this possible .
" we want governments to send their budget outlines to brussels for review before they are approved by their national parliaments , " rehn said .
" we can then see early whether a country is adhering to the stability and growth pact .
if not , we would intervene , " he said .
berlin has rejected such measures , however , saying it would impact on its budget sovereignty .
many eurozone nations in trouble - in particular greece , spain , and portugal - have accumulated budget deficits vastly exceeding the three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- permitted by the stability and growth pact .
the pact is meant to ensure the stability of the economic and monetary union .
german debt-trimming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehn favors the german debt-reduction model rehn also told die zeit that he believed germany 's plans for debt reduction could serve as a model for other eu nations .
in 2009 , berlin passed a constitutional amendment making it illegal for the federal government to run structural deficits more than 0.35 percent of gdp per annum from 2016 , while from 2020 , germany 's federal states will not be allowed to run any deficit at all .
germany this year is expected to reach a record debt of more than five percent of gdp , but has plans to start reducing this from 2011 .
greece , which has a crippling budget deficit of nearly 14 percent of national income , this month became the first eu nation to receive billions of euros in a rescue package to prevent it from defaulting on its debts .
" it does n't touch greece alone , " rehn said in brussels earlier this month .
" it has to do with the eurozone as a whole . "
the eu commission has warned nations to rein in their spending , including france and italy , which until now have held back from introducing unpopular budget cuts .

brussels believes germany 's tough debt-reduction measures , enshrined in the constitution , could be a model for other eu states .
in the wednesday edition of the german weekly , die zeit , rehn said brussels should have greater powers and be able to monitor the national budgets of eu nations .
he said regulations must be put in place to make this possible .
" we want governments to send their budget outlines to brussels for review before they are approved by their national parliaments , " rehn said .
" we can then see early whether a country is adhering to the stability and growth pact .
if not , we would intervene , " he said .
berlin has rejected such measures , however , saying it would impact on its budget sovereignty .
many eurozone nations in trouble - in particular greece , spain , and portugal - have accumulated budget deficits vastly exceeding the three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- permitted by the stability and growth pact .
the pact is meant to ensure the stability of the economic and monetary union .
german debt-trimming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehn favors the german debt-reduction model rehn also told die zeit that he believed germany 's plans for debt reduction could serve as a model for other eu nations .
in 2009 , berlin passed a constitutional amendment making it illegal for the federal government to run structural deficits more than 0.35 percent of gdp per annum from 2016 , while from 2020 , germany 's federal states will not be allowed to run any deficit at all .
germany this year is expected to reach a record debt of more than five percent of gdp , but has plans to start reducing this from 2011 .
greece , which has a crippling budget deficit of nearly 14 percent of national income , this month became the first eu nation to receive billions of euros in a rescue package to prevent it from defaulting on its debts .
" it does n't touch greece alone , " rehn said in brussels earlier this month .
" it has to do with the eurozone as a whole . "
the eu commission has warned nations to rein in their spending , including france and italy , which until now have held back from introducing unpopular budget cuts .
750-billion-euro package the economic turbulence in some eu nations has led speculators and investors to target the euro , which has in the past weeks fallen to its lowest levels against the us dollar in more than 14 months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commission chief wants greater control over national budgets eu finance ministers on monday announced a rescue package of up to 500 billion euros -lrb- $ 632 billion -rrb- to protect the euro , as market speculators increasingly targeted the currency and began betting on its collapse . the international monetary fund is to provide a further 250 billion euros .
" we will defend the stability of the euro at any price , " rehn said earlier monday .
meanwhile , in a rare interview , john taylor , a hedge fund speculator who made big profits in 1992 when speculators bet against the british pound , told bloomberg tv that a fall in the value of the euro was inevitable .
" the euro is a poor design and ca n't continue like this .
it 's quite easy to see that the euro will become much weaker , " taylor told bloomberg tv .
micheal leister , a strategist at the westlb bank in dusseldorf , said hedge fund speculators may well make big profits by betting on currency fluctuations , but that they alone couldn ’ t shake the euro .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 12.05.2010 estonia is fit to adopt the euro , eu commission says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonia 's kroon : soon a thing of the past ?
estonia is set to adopt the euro and plans to replace its currency , the kroon , on january 1 , 2011 .
the move would make the baltic country the 17th eurozone member . the european commission on wednesday said estonia 's economy is strong enough to join the euro zone .
estonia plans to switch to the shared european currency on january 1 , 2011 . the commission had examined estonia 's debt , deficit , inflation , and interest levels .
olli rehn , the eu commissioner for economic and budgetary affairs , said the country had achieved " a high degree of sustainable economic convergence " and was therefore ready to adopt the euro .
' prudent fiscal policy ' is key " to ensure that the adoption of the euro is a success , estonia must pursue its efforts to maintain a prudent fiscal policy stance , " he said .
he urged tallinn to " remain vigilant and react early and decisively " if problems emerge .
the commission 's positive assessment came in the wake of an enormous european bailout for greece , which shed new light on the importance of countries taking inflation-control measures .
countries are concerned that massive debt problems in the eurozone could make brussels wary of taking on a new member .
economic data adds up according to rehn , " the assessment and our proposal is also a strong signal about the euro area and to the eu more broadly , " testifying that sound economic policies such as those adopted by estonia " generate concrete results . "
estonia has had an average budget surplus of 1.8 percent of gross domestic product between 2002 to 2007 , deteriorating to a deficit of minus 2.7 percent in 2008 and minus 1.7 percent in 2009 as a result of the economic crisis .
that is still well within the eurozone 's threshold of 3 percent .
the brussels-based eu executive said the country 's " price performance -lsb- is -rsb- sustainable " as average inflation fell to minus 0.7 percent in the 12 months to march 2010 .

estonia is set to adopt the euro and plans to replace its currency , the kroon , on january 1 , 2011 .
the move would make the baltic country the 17th eurozone member . the european commission on wednesday said estonia 's economy is strong enough to join the euro zone .
estonia plans to switch to the shared european currency on january 1 , 2011 . the commission had examined estonia 's debt , deficit , inflation , and interest levels .
olli rehn , the eu commissioner for economic and budgetary affairs , said the country had achieved " a high degree of sustainable economic convergence " and was therefore ready to adopt the euro .
' prudent fiscal policy ' is key " to ensure that the adoption of the euro is a success , estonia must pursue its efforts to maintain a prudent fiscal policy stance , " he said .
he urged tallinn to " remain vigilant and react early and decisively " if problems emerge .
the commission 's positive assessment came in the wake of an enormous european bailout for greece , which shed new light on the importance of countries taking inflation-control measures .
countries are concerned that massive debt problems in the eurozone could make brussels wary of taking on a new member .
economic data adds up according to rehn , " the assessment and our proposal is also a strong signal about the euro area and to the eu more broadly , " testifying that sound economic policies such as those adopted by estonia " generate concrete results . "
estonia has had an average budget surplus of 1.8 percent of gross domestic product between 2002 to 2007 , deteriorating to a deficit of minus 2.7 percent in 2008 and minus 1.7 percent in 2009 as a result of the economic crisis .
that is still well within the eurozone 's threshold of 3 percent .
the brussels-based eu executive said the country 's " price performance -lsb- is -rsb- sustainable " as average inflation fell to minus 0.7 percent in the 12 months to march 2010 .
but it warned that " estonia " will need to remain vigilant to keep inflation at a low level . "
in order for estonia to be finally welcomed into the eurozone , wednesday 's approval will have to be confirmed by the eu 's finance ministers in july .
so far , no positive recommendation by the commission on eurozone enlargement has ever been contradicted by eu member states .
estonia shifted rapidly from a communist command economy to the free market after breaking from the crumbling soviet bloc in 1991 .

analyst forecasts had predicted growth would remain stagnant .
the federal statistics office in wiesbaden also revised 2009 figures for economic activity , saying it had expanded 0.2 percent in the last quarter of 2009 .
that put full-year contraction lower than expected : 4.9 percent , down from an earlier-reported 5.0 percent .
the statisticians attributed the slow gain in momentum overall in germany to an especially cold winter , which hampered construction activity .
exports and investments in industrial equipment had nonetheless provided engines for growth , the report said .
and data for industrial orders and production in march point to a solid rebound in that sector .

how will german film fare at the world 's most important movie market ?
dw spoke with mariette rissenbeek from the organization german film service + marketing . just 19 films are in the running for the coveted palme d 'or at this year 's cannes film festival 's main competition , but hundreds more features and dozens of shorts will be shown over the course of the festival , which runs through may 23 .
aside from the main competition - which generally highlights films by well-known directors - there are parallel selections .
these include " un certain regard , " a showcase for film from younger or more unusual directors , films shown out of competition , special screenings , and cannes classics , among others . there are also longstanding and independent festivals that run parallel to the official event , such as the highly regarded directors ' fortnight , organized by the association of french film directors . deutsche welle : ms. rissenbeek , over the years the cannes film festival has earned quite a reputation as a hub of hype , where seeing and being seen is of primary importance .
is the festival still meaningful in the world of film ? marianne rissenbeek : cannes is no doubt the most important festival for film - and the most important market for films - up to today .
i think it is still the leading film market .
and a lot of the films in the official program are rather author-driven .
so it 's not only about glitz and glamour , but about filmmaking . last year a german-language film " das weisse band " -lrb- " the white ribbon " -rrb- won the palme d 'or .
coming out after " the lives of others " won the oscar in 2007 , it seemed to signal a sort of renaissance in german art film .
this year , though , there is just one german film in competition - and in fact it is a german-ukrainian-dutch co-production - " my joy , " by sergei loznitsa .
are the tides turning for german film ? well , " my joy " is indeed a german production , which a german producer has developed .
he developed the script together with the director , so it 's not only a co-production with a financial commitment from germany .
there was creative input and engagement from germany .
i don ’ t think we feel neglected or ignored by the festival selection committee . bildunterschrift : germany 's offer in this year 's competition is ' my joy , ' a co-production with ukraine and the netherlands what else is germany showing at the festival , either out of competition , or on the sidelines as part of the un certain regard series , or as part of the directors ' fortnight ? in un certain regard there are two german films , one from christoph hochhaeusler , called " unter dir die stadt " -lrb- " the city below " -rrb- , and the other one , " life , above all , " is a production that was developed in germany .
even though the director , oliver schmitz , is south african-german , he has both nationalities .
and then in the directors ' fortnight there is a german film , " picco , " by philip koch .
so actually we feel there is quite a strong presence from germany . what are you most looking forward to seeing or experiencing at this year 's festival ? well of course , for us it is more important to see how german films will do .
it will be exciting to see how christoph hochhaeusler has developed - he was at cannes a few years ago with another film .
it will be interesting to see how his film is received this year .
and " picco , " by philip koch , is a first film , so that is exciting too .
it is very seldom that you gain access to cannes with your first film , and then to the directors ' fortnight … the film will get a lot of publicity , so that 's good . and then maybe you noticed that the directors ' cut of " the tin drum " by volker schloendorff will be shown , 30 years after it was premiered in cannes .
i look forward to seeing how audiences react to that . there are a lot of films from asia in competition this year - south korea , thailand , taiwan .
what do you make of that ?
does it indicate anything about the future of european versus asian film ? cannes always had an input from asia , there were always asian films in the program , from china , or taiwan … i do n't think it 's new .
this year maybe the films were more interesting from asia , so they chose more for competition , but i could n't really say if it means anything . we have organized screenings in the market of 28 films overall , many of which have already been premiered elsewhere .

analyst forecasts had predicted growth would remain stagnant .
the federal statistics office in wiesbaden also revised 2009 figures for economic activity , saying it had expanded 0.2 percent in the last quarter of 2009 .
that put full-year contraction lower than expected : 4.9 percent , down from an earlier-reported 5.0 percent .
the statisticians attributed the slow gain in momentum overall in germany to an especially cold winter , which hampered construction activity .
exports and investments in industrial equipment had nonetheless provided engines for growth , the report said .
and data for industrial orders and production in march point to a solid rebound in that sector .
the government forecasts growth of 1.4 percent for 2010 overall. jen / afp / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ecb president jean-claude trichet claims he had no other option . credibility is sacred to powerful monetary watchdogs like the us federal reserve , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- and germany 's bundesbank .
it 's something precious , central bankers are quick to admit , that is hard to earn but easy to lose .
perhaps no one knows that better than jean-claude trichet , an architect of the euro who oversaw the french central bank 's deliverance from political control in the 1990s .
the ecb president is waging the battle of his career to preserve the reputation of the bank , which he and his predecessor , former dutch central banker and european monetary institute president wim duisenberg , helped build .
the outcome is all but clear .
an unprecedented move to rescue the euro trichet has been under fire ever since eurozone finance ministers agreed over the weekend to launch an unprecedented aid package worth 750 billion euros -lrb- $ 1 trillion -rrb- .
the scheme is designed to rescue the euro as the effects of the greek fiscal crisis spill over into other indebted nations in the eurozone .
in a nutshell , it allows the ecb to buy government bonds issued by eurozone nations in financial trouble .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb president trichet is hearing plenty of criticism about the bank 's euro rescue move analysts argue the move has comprised the central bank 's independence ; the bank would effectively be buying government debt , giving governments a freer hand in raising money when it should actually be policing their efforts to do so .
trichet has vigorously defended the move .
at a press conference in basel , he said the central bank 's monetary policy was " hampered " and that a number of markets were " dysfunctional . "
and with an eye to critics , he said that the central bank has always been and will always be " fiercely and totally independent . "
critics , indeed , are in no short supply .
numerous monetary experts accuse the ecb 's 22-member council of bowing to political pressure from the european union and the 16 eurozone nations .
" significant stability risks " among the more outspoken and high-profile critics is bundesbank president alex weber , who is a leading candidate to succeed trichet next year .
in an interview with germany 's boersen zeitung , weber said that the purchase of government bonds " poses significant stability risks . "
he criticized the ecb council 's decision " even in this extraordinary situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans want the euro to remain a strong currency in a message to investors , david zervos , managing director of jefferies & co investment bank in new york , said that for all the attempts by the ecb to remain independent , it was unable " to push back on the eu power base in a crisis period . "
zervos warned that this development could make the eurozone " far less stable in any crisis times than a traditional national union . "
trichet realizes that ecb 's credibility is tightly linked to the bank 's independence and that any u-turns could soften the euro .
he knows all too well that if there 's anything europeans do n't want - especially many germans who still mourn the loss of their beloved deutschmark - it is a weak , suffering currency .
citizens of euro nations have every reason to be concerned : tuesday saw the euro retreat against the dollar as euphoria over the massive eurozone bailout announced on monday gave way to continuing doubts over the ability of euro nations to reduce their deficits .

brussels believes germany 's tough debt-reduction measures , enshrined in the constitution , could be a model for other eu states .
in the wednesday edition of the german weekly , die zeit , rehn said brussels should have greater powers and be able to monitor the national budgets of eu nations .
he said regulations must be put in place to make this possible .
" we want governments to send their budget outlines to brussels for review before they are approved by their national parliaments , " rehn said .
" we can then see early whether a country is adhering to the stability and growth pact .
if not , we would intervene , " he said .
berlin has rejected such measures , however , saying it would impact on its budget sovereignty .
many eurozone nations in trouble - in particular greece , spain , and portugal - have accumulated budget deficits vastly exceeding the three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- permitted by the stability and growth pact .
the pact is meant to ensure the stability of the economic and monetary union .
german debt-trimming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehn favors the german debt-reduction model rehn also told die zeit that he believed germany 's plans for debt reduction could serve as a model for other eu nations .
in 2009 , berlin passed a constitutional amendment making it illegal for the federal government to run structural deficits more than 0.35 percent of gdp per annum from 2016 , while from 2020 , germany 's federal states will not be allowed to run any deficit at all .
germany this year is expected to reach a record debt of more than five percent of gdp , but has plans to start reducing this from 2011 .
greece , which has a crippling budget deficit of nearly 14 percent of national income , this month became the first eu nation to receive billions of euros in a rescue package to prevent it from defaulting on its debts .
" it does n't touch greece alone , " rehn said in brussels earlier this month .
" it has to do with the eurozone as a whole . "
the eu commission has warned nations to rein in their spending , including france and italy , which until now have held back from introducing unpopular budget cuts .
750-billion-euro package the economic turbulence in some eu nations has led speculators and investors to target the euro , which has in the past weeks fallen to its lowest levels against the us dollar in more than 14 months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commission chief wants greater control over national budgets eu finance ministers on monday announced a rescue package of up to 500 billion euros -lrb- $ 632 billion -rrb- to protect the euro , as market speculators increasingly targeted the currency and began betting on its collapse . the international monetary fund is to provide a further 250 billion euros .
" we will defend the stability of the euro at any price , " rehn said earlier monday .
meanwhile , in a rare interview , john taylor , a hedge fund speculator who made big profits in 1992 when speculators bet against the british pound , told bloomberg tv that a fall in the value of the euro was inevitable .
" the euro is a poor design and ca n't continue like this .
it 's quite easy to see that the euro will become much weaker , " taylor told bloomberg tv .
micheal leister , a strategist at the westlb bank in dusseldorf , said hedge fund speculators may well make big profits by betting on currency fluctuations , but that they alone couldn ’ t shake the euro .
" in times like this , when investors start panicking and liquidity is getting tight , one can make massive profits .
but the jury is still out on whether that is the cause of all the current troubles . " wl / dpa / afp / reuters editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ecb president jean-claude trichet claims he had no other option . credibility is sacred to powerful monetary watchdogs like the us federal reserve , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- and germany 's bundesbank .
it 's something precious , central bankers are quick to admit , that is hard to earn but easy to lose .
perhaps no one knows that better than jean-claude trichet , an architect of the euro who oversaw the french central bank 's deliverance from political control in the 1990s .
the ecb president is waging the battle of his career to preserve the reputation of the bank , which he and his predecessor , former dutch central banker and european monetary institute president wim duisenberg , helped build .
the outcome is all but clear .
an unprecedented move to rescue the euro trichet has been under fire ever since eurozone finance ministers agreed over the weekend to launch an unprecedented aid package worth 750 billion euros -lrb- $ 1 trillion -rrb- .
the scheme is designed to rescue the euro as the effects of the greek fiscal crisis spill over into other indebted nations in the eurozone .
in a nutshell , it allows the ecb to buy government bonds issued by eurozone nations in financial trouble .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb president trichet is hearing plenty of criticism about the bank 's euro rescue move analysts argue the move has comprised the central bank 's independence ; the bank would effectively be buying government debt , giving governments a freer hand in raising money when it should actually be policing their efforts to do so .
trichet has vigorously defended the move .
at a press conference in basel , he said the central bank 's monetary policy was " hampered " and that a number of markets were " dysfunctional . "
and with an eye to critics , he said that the central bank has always been and will always be " fiercely and totally independent . "
critics , indeed , are in no short supply .
numerous monetary experts accuse the ecb 's 22-member council of bowing to political pressure from the european union and the 16 eurozone nations .
" significant stability risks " among the more outspoken and high-profile critics is bundesbank president alex weber , who is a leading candidate to succeed trichet next year .
in an interview with germany 's boersen zeitung , weber said that the purchase of government bonds " poses significant stability risks . "
he criticized the ecb council 's decision " even in this extraordinary situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans want the euro to remain a strong currency in a message to investors , david zervos , managing director of jefferies & co investment bank in new york , said that for all the attempts by the ecb to remain independent , it was unable " to push back on the eu power base in a crisis period . "
zervos warned that this development could make the eurozone " far less stable in any crisis times than a traditional national union . "
trichet realizes that ecb 's credibility is tightly linked to the bank 's independence and that any u-turns could soften the euro .
he knows all too well that if there 's anything europeans do n't want - especially many germans who still mourn the loss of their beloved deutschmark - it is a weak , suffering currency .
citizens of euro nations have every reason to be concerned : tuesday saw the euro retreat against the dollar as euphoria over the massive eurozone bailout announced on monday gave way to continuing doubts over the ability of euro nations to reduce their deficits .

estonia is set to adopt the euro and plans to replace its currency , the kroon , on january 1 , 2011 .
the move would make the baltic country the 17th eurozone member . the european commission on wednesday said estonia 's economy is strong enough to join the euro zone .
estonia plans to switch to the shared european currency on january 1 , 2011 . the commission had examined estonia 's debt , deficit , inflation , and interest levels .
olli rehn , the eu commissioner for economic and budgetary affairs , said the country had achieved " a high degree of sustainable economic convergence " and was therefore ready to adopt the euro .
' prudent fiscal policy ' is key " to ensure that the adoption of the euro is a success , estonia must pursue its efforts to maintain a prudent fiscal policy stance , " he said .
he urged tallinn to " remain vigilant and react early and decisively " if problems emerge .
the commission 's positive assessment came in the wake of an enormous european bailout for greece , which shed new light on the importance of countries taking inflation-control measures .
countries are concerned that massive debt problems in the eurozone could make brussels wary of taking on a new member .
economic data adds up according to rehn , " the assessment and our proposal is also a strong signal about the euro area and to the eu more broadly , " testifying that sound economic policies such as those adopted by estonia " generate concrete results . "
estonia has had an average budget surplus of 1.8 percent of gross domestic product between 2002 to 2007 , deteriorating to a deficit of minus 2.7 percent in 2008 and minus 1.7 percent in 2009 as a result of the economic crisis .
that is still well within the eurozone 's threshold of 3 percent .
the brussels-based eu executive said the country 's " price performance -lsb- is -rsb- sustainable " as average inflation fell to minus 0.7 percent in the 12 months to march 2010 .
but it warned that " estonia " will need to remain vigilant to keep inflation at a low level . "
in order for estonia to be finally welcomed into the eurozone , wednesday 's approval will have to be confirmed by the eu 's finance ministers in july .
so far , no positive recommendation by the commission on eurozone enlargement has ever been contradicted by eu member states .
estonia shifted rapidly from a communist command economy to the free market after breaking from the crumbling soviet bloc in 1991 .
the 1.3-million-strong country had hoped to adopt the euro in 2007 , but failed to meet the inflation-control criteria at the time. jen / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the brussels-based eu executive said the country 's " price performance -lsb- is -rsb- sustainable " as average inflation fell to minus 0.7 percent in the 12 months to march 2010 .
