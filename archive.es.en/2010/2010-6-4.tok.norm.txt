could pricing the earth be the way to save it – and ourselves ? great extinctions come and go .
the earth has experienced five in the last half-a-billion years , and a number of lesser extinctions as well .
usually , they 're unleashed by a cataclysmic event – an asteroid impact or a super volcano .
scientists speculate that sometimes they 've been triggered by gradual changes in the earth 's atmosphere .
but what makes the so-called ' sixth great extinction ' distinctive is us .
this time around we are present to witness it .
we also happen to be driving it . according to the latest global biodiversity outlook released last month , extinction rates may be up to 1,000 times higher than the background rate – the normal pace of extinction that has accompanied evolution on earth .
bleak outlook bildunterschrift : tigers are set to become extinct in the wild in 15 years the decline is happening across the spectrum of life .
species are disappearing ; genetic variety – a safeguard against disease – is being lost ; and whole ecosystems , whose processes provide everything from habitats to the quality of our air , water and soils , are retreating .
some are faring worse than others .
amphibians face the greatest risk and corals are deteriorating most rapidly .
while the number of vertebrate species fell by nearly a third on average between 1970 and 1996 , nearly a quarter of all plant species are estimated to be threatened with extinction .
in the last 110 years , india 's wild tiger population has fallen by over 97.5 percent thanks to poaching and competition for land with humans .
" if business as usual continues , one can expect them -lrb- tigers -rrb- to be all extinct by 2025 , " says dr ashok khosla , president of the international union for conservation of nature -lrb- iucn -rrb- , the organization which catalogues the world 's species in its so-called ' red lists . '
another example which khosla likes to cite from his native india is the sudden plunge in vulture populations in south asia , which saw the birds ' population drop from 40 million to 60,000 within a decade of the year 1992 .
" it was discovered that a hormone fed to cattle for more milk was getting into the vultures … within eight years governments in india and nepal and elsewhere had taken - luckily for us - action to stop the decline , but they were down to virtually extinct , " khosla said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the only known medication for childhood leukaemia comes from this threatened flower a human-shaped footprint the drivers for the loss of biodiversity can all be traced – directly or indirectly – to humans .
the principle pressures include habitat change -lrb- think monocultures and clear-felling -rrb- , overexploitation -lrb- consider the ocean 's fish stocks -rrb- , pollution , invasive alien species -lrb- whose advances into new territories are usually abetted by people -rrb- and climate change .
in stark contrast to most of our fellow tenants on this planet , the human population has exploded in the last century .
in 1900 , the world 's population was 1.6 billion people .
today it is roughly 6.9 billion and expected to rise to nine billion by 2050 .
we 've also been consuming more .
according to this year 's consumption report by the world watch institute , the average american consumes six times as much today as he did in 1960 .
our numbers and behavior already suck up the resources of 1.4 planets , says the global footprint network .
according to its ' moderate ' business as usual trends , we will need two planets to sustain us by 2050 .
these figures have led to a growing sense of alarm in some quarters , and mounting calls for radical change . " it takes by our collective bio-capacity at the moment 18 months to provide 12 months of natural goods and services , and it 's heading in the wrong direction , " says andrew simms , a policy director at the new economics foundation , a green-oriented think tank .
" so if we ask ourselves if orthodox price mechanisms are working at the moment , well obviously they 're not , because they 're not turning things around . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank economist pavan sukhdev is auditing nature services rendered if living beyond our natural means comes with a cost , then putting a figure on that cost is the difficult job of pavan sukhdev , an economist at deutsche bank .
the banker is on loan to the united nations environment program where he runs a study called the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity -lrb- teeb -rrb- .
the idea grew out of the stern report of 2006 which laid out the economic case for tackling climate change .
" economics today is the currency of policy , " sukhdev told a recent biodiversity conference . " no matter how strong , no matter how emotive , no matter how powerful and no matter how human your arguments to do anything in this world , we are at a stage today where you will also be asked for economic justification .
so whether you like it or not – indeed whether i like it or not – there will be a case of tradeoffs being evaluated . "
from pollinating crops – a service worth up to seven billion dollars in the us , according to studies there – to wetlands ' capacity to mitigate storm damage , there are myriad ways that ecosystems provide services not factored into our economies .
nine-out-of-ten new medicines is derived from something found in nature .
according to teeb 's interim report , we are sacrificing 1.3 to 3.1 trillion euros -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- worth of ecosystems services every year as our economies continue to treat the environment as an ' externality . '
to put that in perspective , that 's up to twice the cost of failing to tackle climate change .
or to put it another way , it 's the financial crisis every three years .
yet even some potential allies remain wary of the drive to a market solution .
" we 're faced with what i would call the paradox of environmental economics , " said andrew simms .
" how , for example , would you put a price on the marginal ton of carbon , which when burnt , puts us on a path to runaway climate change ?
you 're basically asking ' what is the price of civilization ? '
even if a market allowed for the trading of that ton of carbon , i would argue that it should not be allowed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrew simms is concerned about the distinction between value and price squaring the circle nevertheless , if teeb 's aim is to rouse decision-makers to action out of concern for their state coffers , then there are signs that it 's bearing fruit .
this year 's green week -lrb- 1-4 june -rrb- , an annual environment conference organized by the european union , was dedicated to the issue of biodiversity , and the bloc 's executive used the event to announce two new tools aimed at halting biodiversity loss .
recognizing the need for accurate information , the bloc 's executive and the european environment agency unveiled a centralized clearing house for data called bise – the biodiversity information system for europe . taking a page out of the climate change play-book , they also established a " biodiversity baseline " , which will be used to offer a snapshot of trends and measure progress on goals .
but as useful as the common starting point of 1990 levels of carbon emissions has been for climate action , how do you make a baseline for something as complex as biodiversity ?
the eu 's initial groping efforts have produced a five-page brochure with 15 charts .
though it 's not as intuitively clear as a target for cutting emissions , it is an important step that will " help us review our actions and take tangible new measures , " according to environment commissioner janez potocnik .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could european farmers be paid to make wildlife reserves ?
rethinking the cap and other innovative ideas may be on their way .
the eu 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- – a 50-billion-euro-a-year program of farm subsidies – has long been controversial for its distortion of trade and impact on developing countries .
there are now mounting calls to pay famers the money for habitat restoration instead , and at a fraction of the cost . a recent policy paper by the european centre for international political economy found that " substantial " environmental gains could be secured at half the cost of the current cap .
yet reforming agriculture – a sector that eats up half the eu 's budget – has always been a quagmire , despite the optimistic view , on the part of the eu 's most senior environmental bureaucrat , that things are beginning to change .
" we will definitely see support for agriculture tied more and more – i ca n't say exclusively – to respect for the environment , and ecologically friendlier forms of production , " karl falkenberg , director general of the environment commission , told deutsche welle .
in any event , europe will have to move fast if it is to have any shot at halting - and reversing - the loss of biodiversity , as it aims to do by 2020 .
like every region in the world , it failed to meet this year 's deadline to halt biodiversity loss , a target laid down with no baseline , little information and no sub-targets in 2002 .
the next goals will be set internationally when the global community gathers in nagoya in october for the next convention on biological diversity conference .
if europe and the world is to avoid another ground hog day , then political leaders will need to find the attention spans – and stomachs – to deal with ' two ' environmental crises at once .

human rights experts are calling for action and prosecutions for those responsible . the first global investigation of secret detention facilities conducted by the united nations found that in 66 of 192 un nations , several thousand people have been detained in secret facilities and even tortured since the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the united states .
arbitrary arrests and disappearances , shadowy prisons and criminal interrogation methods were all common practices in earlier centuries , but since the 9/11 attacks , these kinds of violations of international human rights rules have become more and more frequent .
they almost all happen under the guise of preventing terrorism , the 220-page un report said .
included on the list of those countries with secret prisons are three permanent members of the un security council - china , russia and the united states .
they are accompanied by afghanistan , india , pakistan and several african countries as well as european states , such as poland , romania , bosnia-herzegovina and lithuania .
crimes again humanity ?
" secret detention amounts to an enforced disappearance , and if resorted to in a widespread or systematic manner , it might reach the threshold of a crime against humanity , " manfred nowak , the un 's special rapporteur on torture and one of the report 's authors , said during debate on the report on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report 's authors concluded that secret detention ' violates a number of human rights amd humanitarian law norms ' the dimensions of the problem could be even greater than the report lays out .
the detailed questionnaire that nowak , martin scheinin , the un special rapporteur on human rights and counter terrorism , as well as other un experts formulated and sent to the un 's 192 member countries was only answered by 44 .
of these , not one admitted to the existence of secret prisons .
the report 's authors depended on independent sources for their investigation and many countries denied them any kind of access to relevant materials or sources .
denial and censorship during the debate , china , russia , pakistan , sri lanka , syria , algeria and other african nations denied that any secret detention facilities existed on their territory .
they accused the report 's authors of sloppy research , of overstepping their mandate and of compiling the report without being commissioned to do so by the un human rights council .
" we are concerned at the unprofessional way in which the report was written and presented , " said syria 's representative to the council .
" the report makes use of unverified allegations by non-credible parties and presents them as fact . "
in march , pakistan and other nations called for the report , which was scheduled to be discussed then , to be removed from the un agenda , and the belgian president of the council agreed to that demand .
in the meantime , russia and pakistan have asked that the report be removed from the un 's website and that debate around it be terminated .
however , this call for censorship failed in the wake of objections from independent human rights groups .
scant support only a few un states , including sweden , canada and south africa , gave their unreserved approval to the report during the debate of the human rights council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un said " secret detention should be explicitly prohibited " the us ambassador to the un , susan rice , underlined the fact that president barack obama has announced the closing of the us prison at guantanamo bay , cuba , although it was never a secret facility .
however , she made no comment on the bagram facility , the main detention facility for persons detained by us forces in afghanistan , or other formerly secret prisons in third countries where american officials sent prisoners who were then often subjected to harsh interrogation procedures or torture .
the report 's authors called for the immediate closure of all secret detention facilities as well as for compensation for those who were victims of illegal imprisonment and torture .
no former detainee has yet to receive any kind of compensation .
both nowak and scheinin said they hoped that the human rights council would pass a resolution on the matter , although after the debate and opposition to the report , that wish is seen as fairly unrealistic .

human rights experts are calling for action and prosecutions for those responsible . the first global investigation of secret detention facilities conducted by the united nations found that in 66 of 192 un nations , several thousand people have been detained in secret facilities and even tortured since the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the united states .
arbitrary arrests and disappearances , shadowy prisons and criminal interrogation methods were all common practices in earlier centuries , but since the 9/11 attacks , these kinds of violations of international human rights rules have become more and more frequent .
they almost all happen under the guise of preventing terrorism , the 220-page un report said .
included on the list of those countries with secret prisons are three permanent members of the un security council - china , russia and the united states .
they are accompanied by afghanistan , india , pakistan and several african countries as well as european states , such as poland , romania , bosnia-herzegovina and lithuania .
crimes again humanity ?
" secret detention amounts to an enforced disappearance , and if resorted to in a widespread or systematic manner , it might reach the threshold of a crime against humanity , " manfred nowak , the un 's special rapporteur on torture and one of the report 's authors , said during debate on the report on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report 's authors concluded that secret detention ' violates a number of human rights amd humanitarian law norms ' the dimensions of the problem could be even greater than the report lays out .
the detailed questionnaire that nowak , martin scheinin , the un special rapporteur on human rights and counter terrorism , as well as other un experts formulated and sent to the un 's 192 member countries was only answered by 44 .
of these , not one admitted to the existence of secret prisons .
the report 's authors depended on independent sources for their investigation and many countries denied them any kind of access to relevant materials or sources .
denial and censorship during the debate , china , russia , pakistan , sri lanka , syria , algeria and other african nations denied that any secret detention facilities existed on their territory .
they accused the report 's authors of sloppy research , of overstepping their mandate and of compiling the report without being commissioned to do so by the un human rights council .
" we are concerned at the unprofessional way in which the report was written and presented , " said syria 's representative to the council .
" the report makes use of unverified allegations by non-credible parties and presents them as fact . "
in march , pakistan and other nations called for the report , which was scheduled to be discussed then , to be removed from the un agenda , and the belgian president of the council agreed to that demand .
in the meantime , russia and pakistan have asked that the report be removed from the un 's website and that debate around it be terminated .
however , this call for censorship failed in the wake of objections from independent human rights groups .
scant support only a few un states , including sweden , canada and south africa , gave their unreserved approval to the report during the debate of the human rights council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un said " secret detention should be explicitly prohibited " the us ambassador to the un , susan rice , underlined the fact that president barack obama has announced the closing of the us prison at guantanamo bay , cuba , although it was never a secret facility .
however , she made no comment on the bagram facility , the main detention facility for persons detained by us forces in afghanistan , or other formerly secret prisons in third countries where american officials sent prisoners who were then often subjected to harsh interrogation procedures or torture .
the report 's authors called for the immediate closure of all secret detention facilities as well as for compensation for those who were victims of illegal imprisonment and torture .
no former detainee has yet to receive any kind of compensation .
both nowak and scheinin said they hoped that the human rights council would pass a resolution on the matter , although after the debate and opposition to the report , that wish is seen as fairly unrealistic .

human rights experts are calling for action and prosecutions for those responsible . the first global investigation of secret detention facilities conducted by the united nations found that in 66 of 192 un nations , several thousand people have been detained in secret facilities and even tortured since the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the united states .
arbitrary arrests and disappearances , shadowy prisons and criminal interrogation methods were all common practices in earlier centuries , but since the 9/11 attacks , these kinds of violations of international human rights rules have become more and more frequent .
they almost all happen under the guise of preventing terrorism , the 220-page un report said .
included on the list of those countries with secret prisons are three permanent members of the un security council - china , russia and the united states .
they are accompanied by afghanistan , india , pakistan and several african countries as well as european states , such as poland , romania , bosnia-herzegovina and lithuania .
crimes again humanity ?
" secret detention amounts to an enforced disappearance , and if resorted to in a widespread or systematic manner , it might reach the threshold of a crime against humanity , " manfred nowak , the un 's special rapporteur on torture and one of the report 's authors , said during debate on the report on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report 's authors concluded that secret detention ' violates a number of human rights amd humanitarian law norms ' the dimensions of the problem could be even greater than the report lays out .
the detailed questionnaire that nowak , martin scheinin , the un special rapporteur on human rights and counter terrorism , as well as other un experts formulated and sent to the un 's 192 member countries was only answered by 44 .
of these , not one admitted to the existence of secret prisons .
the report 's authors depended on independent sources for their investigation and many countries denied them any kind of access to relevant materials or sources .
denial and censorship during the debate , china , russia , pakistan , sri lanka , syria , algeria and other african nations denied that any secret detention facilities existed on their territory .
they accused the report 's authors of sloppy research , of overstepping their mandate and of compiling the report without being commissioned to do so by the un human rights council .
" we are concerned at the unprofessional way in which the report was written and presented , " said syria 's representative to the council .
" the report makes use of unverified allegations by non-credible parties and presents them as fact . "
in march , pakistan and other nations called for the report , which was scheduled to be discussed then , to be removed from the un agenda , and the belgian president of the council agreed to that demand .
in the meantime , russia and pakistan have asked that the report be removed from the un 's website and that debate around it be terminated .
however , this call for censorship failed in the wake of objections from independent human rights groups .
scant support only a few un states , including sweden , canada and south africa , gave their unreserved approval to the report during the debate of the human rights council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un said " secret detention should be explicitly prohibited " the us ambassador to the un , susan rice , underlined the fact that president barack obama has announced the closing of the us prison at guantanamo bay , cuba , although it was never a secret facility .
however , she made no comment on the bagram facility , the main detention facility for persons detained by us forces in afghanistan , or other formerly secret prisons in third countries where american officials sent prisoners who were then often subjected to harsh interrogation procedures or torture .
the report 's authors called for the immediate closure of all secret detention facilities as well as for compensation for those who were victims of illegal imprisonment and torture .
no former detainee has yet to receive any kind of compensation .
both nowak and scheinin said they hoped that the human rights council would pass a resolution on the matter , although after the debate and opposition to the report , that wish is seen as fairly unrealistic .

his assumption will most likely stir up controversy at the deutsche welle global media forum .
brayne will be leading a workshop that looks at the role of the media and reporting on the psychology of climate change .
this year ’ s conference , entitled “ the heat is on – climate change and the media ” , will take place from june 21-23 in bonn .
for brayne , it comes down to the mindset .
“ journalists are no different from businessmen or politicians in their / our inability to respond to the existential threat of climate change and resources depletion , ” he said in an interview with deutsche welle .
“ like all human beings , we respond in ways that are programmed by millions of years of evolution , identifying and meeting immediate needs and indulging immediate greeds , and failing to see these in the context of longer-term survival . ”
he went on to say that unless politicians , business leaders and voters really understand how desperately serious things are , there is no hope of that change .
“ and what is our most powerful tool for determining and changing what people think ?
the media , ” said brayne .
“ paradoxically , by courageously facing and reporting what i believe to be the inevitability of collapse , we might yet avert it .
perhaps . “ brayne became well-known for founding the dart center for journalism and trauma in london .
he was also director of the center until 2008 .
after 30 years of working as a reporter and correspondent for reuters and the bbc – in which team he covered global events like the massacre at tiananmen square in 1989 – he trained to become a psychological therapist .
brayne says that many correspondents in areas of conflict can ’ t forget what they have seen – and he wants to help them . more than 50 individual events in 2010 , the deutsche welle global media forum once again offers more than 50 events including podium discussions and workshops , interactive presentations and exhibitions , networking and interesting side events .
it takes place at the world conference center bonn , close to deutsche welle ’ s headquarters .
deutsche welle is cooperating with many different organizations for this interdisciplinary conference , including the unesco , the united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , the international human dimensions program on global environmental change -lrb- un ihdp / essp -rrb- , eu commission and the world bank , the wuppertal institute , world wildlife fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- , nabu and the climate alliance , the institute for world business kiel , german development institute -lrb- die -rrb- , the center for development research -lrb- zef -rrb- and many others .
co-host of the deutsche welle global media forum is the foundation for international dialogue of the sparkasse in bonn .

the parties have been in talks since monday , two days after the second round of general elections , when it became clear that although the social democrats won the biggest share of the vote at 22 percent , they had little chance of forming a government .
fiscal discipline one of the main objectives for the new czech government is to produce a budget for 2011 .

the fao is pressing for greater action to stem the global increase . the new campaign by the united nations food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- says that by 2050 asia will be facing " enormous challenges " to feed its five billion population .
recent multiple crises have led to a sharp rise in those facing chronic hunger .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fao hq in rome hiroyuki konuma , fao 's regional chief for asia and the pacific , says more investment is needed because " the crises are still continuing and affecting the populations of the world . " the world 's chronic hungry population has increased very rapidly in the past two years .
it got to 850 million around three to four years ago .
at the end of last year , it reached over one billion .
this is an issue where we need solidarity and all the assistance in the world . " two-thirds of the world 's hungry population in asia the asia and pacific region holds two thirds of the world 's hungry population – 640 million people .
the fao estimates that over 50 million people were pushed into chronic malnutrition in 2009 alone . purushottam k. mudbhary , the head of the fao policy assistance branch , says there are signs of declining global food stocks , which means that food prices have remained at the same high levels of early 2008 . " this is why we need to step up investment in agriculture to increase food production .
and one of the other reasons is that there has not really been a major technical breakthrough like we had during the green revolution , which made a major impact on agricultural production .
the investment in agriculture has to be reinvigorated to stem the tide of this . " countries such as india and china , that are experiencing major gains in economic growth , are seeing a greater demand for high-value products and livestock , which is also putting a strain on food stocks . southeast asia generally better off than south asia " relative to south asia in aggregate terms southeast asia is much better off , " says sumiter broca , an economist with the fao . " but within southeast asia there are countries which are at a lower level of development – myanmar , laos because of the resource constraints and the philippines , where there are major problems . " bildunterschrift : the fao says that foreign investment in agricultural land is creating legal and ethical issues the fao also points to the recent surge of foreign investment in agricultural land .
it says the investment is opening up complex economic , political , institutional , legal and ethical issues and their impact on property rights , rural development , technology and access to land and water . however , the organization also says foreign investment in developing country agriculture could make a contribution to realizing important hunger and poverty-fighting goals . author : ron corben -lrb- bangkok -rrb- editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german newspaper commentators were divided over her choice . germany 's government has nominated the 50-year-old state premier of lower saxony as its candidate for the nation 's presidency . chancellor angela merkel chose christian wulff to replace president horst koehler as germany 's new head of state after koehler 's surprise resignation earlier this week . across germany , reactions to wulff 's nomination were mixed , with much of the press commentary focusing on who was not chosen for the post - namely merkel 's rumored first-choice candidate , labor minister ursula von der leyen . financial times deutschland asks " christian who ? " and writes the fact that wulff is moving into the presidential palace serves as " a sad piece of evidence for how little wriggle room cdu party leader angela merkel has in her own party . "
the paper goes on to say that merkel 's inability to push through her first-choice candidate was " far more worrisome than the idea of president christian wulff . " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung says koehler 's sudden resignation had lifted the lid on the traditionally rather opaque process by which candidates are chosen .
never before have people been able to get such an insight into the selection process .
the paper says " the fact that ...
merkel could not get her favorite approved discloses the acute weakness that also affects the chancellor . " speaking on the thursday edition of the " maybrit illner " talk show on german state broadcaster zdf , free democrat politician jorge chatzmarkakis said the reason von der leyen was not nominated was because conservative politicians from the mainly catholic south of germany did not like to see two protestant women , i.e. merkel and von der leyen , leading the country . one of germany 's largest broadsheets , sueddeutsche zeitung , says wulff has a tough road ahead of him . " he will have enough to do after his election in order to achieve the gravitas , seriousness and dignity that one expects from a president .
-lsb- finance minister -rsb- wolfgang schaeuble would have already had it . "
the paper adds , however , that " because wulff is an experienced party politician , the nomination is not as surprising as it may seem to many at first glance . " the regional daily saechsische zeitung says wulff is a popular state premier in lower saxony .
" most perceive him as a nice , friendly man without any rough edges .
he first began garnering political attention two months ago , when he brought a turkish-born muslim into his cabinet .
that was brave , and let 's hope that as president he is also able to think long-term .
because just being friendly and flattering will not be enough to give the necessary weight to the office . " the stuttgarter zeitung praises wulff 's nomination , and notes that he would be the " youngest candidate to serve in the office of president . " the paper also praises his controversial decision to appoint a muslim woman to a ministerial post .
the daily saw the choice as a breath of fresh air , writing " with the decision yesterday , the coalition has stirred the hope that lethargy does n't necessarily have to be their trademark .

german newspaper commentators were divided over her choice . germany 's government has nominated the 50-year-old state premier of lower saxony as its candidate for the nation 's presidency . chancellor angela merkel chose christian wulff to replace president horst koehler as germany 's new head of state after koehler 's surprise resignation earlier this week . across germany , reactions to wulff 's nomination were mixed , with much of the press commentary focusing on who was not chosen for the post - namely merkel 's rumored first-choice candidate , labor minister ursula von der leyen . financial times deutschland asks " christian who ? " and writes the fact that wulff is moving into the presidential palace serves as " a sad piece of evidence for how little wriggle room cdu party leader angela merkel has in her own party . "
the paper goes on to say that merkel 's inability to push through her first-choice candidate was " far more worrisome than the idea of president christian wulff . " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung says koehler 's sudden resignation had lifted the lid on the traditionally rather opaque process by which candidates are chosen .
never before have people been able to get such an insight into the selection process .
the paper says " the fact that ...
merkel could not get her favorite approved discloses the acute weakness that also affects the chancellor . " speaking on the thursday edition of the " maybrit illner " talk show on german state broadcaster zdf , free democrat politician jorge chatzmarkakis said the reason von der leyen was not nominated was because conservative politicians from the mainly catholic south of germany did not like to see two protestant women , i.e. merkel and von der leyen , leading the country . one of germany 's largest broadsheets , sueddeutsche zeitung , says wulff has a tough road ahead of him . " he will have enough to do after his election in order to achieve the gravitas , seriousness and dignity that one expects from a president .
-lsb- finance minister -rsb- wolfgang schaeuble would have already had it . "
the paper adds , however , that " because wulff is an experienced party politician , the nomination is not as surprising as it may seem to many at first glance . " the regional daily saechsische zeitung says wulff is a popular state premier in lower saxony .
" most perceive him as a nice , friendly man without any rough edges .
he first began garnering political attention two months ago , when he brought a turkish-born muslim into his cabinet .
that was brave , and let 's hope that as president he is also able to think long-term .
because just being friendly and flattering will not be enough to give the necessary weight to the office . " the stuttgarter zeitung praises wulff 's nomination , and notes that he would be the " youngest candidate to serve in the office of president . " the paper also praises his controversial decision to appoint a muslim woman to a ministerial post .
the daily saw the choice as a breath of fresh air , writing " with the decision yesterday , the coalition has stirred the hope that lethargy does n't necessarily have to be their trademark .

some 1,600 tribal elders and religious leaders agreed to make peace with the taliban .
but prospects of peace are bleak , says deutsche welle 's ratbil shamel . once again a jirga has come to an end in kabul and once again it has done what the ruling government wanted . namely , it has presented the government 's suggestions as the people 's wishes .
this time , the jirga has handed the government a mandate to enter peace negotiations with the taliban .
it would like hizb-e-islami , the party of the warlord and politician gulbuddin hekmatyar , to be involved as well . the jirga wants the afghan government and the international community to guarantee political and legal security to all those who reject the taliban and al qaeda . the taliban will also be called upon to discuss their demands with kabul and to stop working with the terrorist organization al qaeda .
all fighting parties will be asked to protect the safety and rights of the civilian population instead of putting them in danger .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan delegates walk outside the site of the peace jirga in kabul the demands of the peace jirga are very much in tune with the afghan president 's wishes .
he has been trying to persuade the taliban to come to the negotiating table for at least five years but to little avail .
at first , he could not convince anyone of his idea to integrate moderate taliban back into public life , finding support for it neither at home nor abroad .
but half a decade later , he has succeeded . the population has wanted nothing but peace in over 30 years of war .
in the past nine years , the us and its allies have not been able to solve the problem of the taliban .
now president hamid karzai , amid general helplessness , has eyed his chance to take things into his own hands at last . but he and his advisors know that for there to be longstanding peace in afghanistan , they not only need the us on their side , but also regional big powers such as russia , china and india . there can also be no peace without the close cooperation of pakistan , iran and saudi arabia . all these countries see their fundamental interests threatened by an afghanistan under us influence .
this means that a peace jirga in kabul only makes sense if prior agreements have been made between the us and afghanistan 's neighbors .
however , these have never been made . moreover , the taliban and al qaeda will never be ready to agree to peace in afghanistan as long as there are places they can retreat to abroad and people willing to support them . the taliban and al qaeda leadership want the establishment of a worldwide islamic empire .
they want this world to be cleansed of unbelievers .

some 1,600 tribal elders and religious leaders agreed to make peace with the taliban .
but prospects of peace are bleak , says deutsche welle 's ratbil shamel . once again a jirga has come to an end in kabul and once again it has done what the ruling government wanted . namely , it has presented the government 's suggestions as the people 's wishes .
this time , the jirga has handed the government a mandate to enter peace negotiations with the taliban .
it would like hizb-e-islami , the party of the warlord and politician gulbuddin hekmatyar , to be involved as well . the jirga wants the afghan government and the international community to guarantee political and legal security to all those who reject the taliban and al qaeda . the taliban will also be called upon to discuss their demands with kabul and to stop working with the terrorist organization al qaeda .
all fighting parties will be asked to protect the safety and rights of the civilian population instead of putting them in danger .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan delegates walk outside the site of the peace jirga in kabul the demands of the peace jirga are very much in tune with the afghan president 's wishes .
he has been trying to persuade the taliban to come to the negotiating table for at least five years but to little avail .
at first , he could not convince anyone of his idea to integrate moderate taliban back into public life , finding support for it neither at home nor abroad .
but half a decade later , he has succeeded . the population has wanted nothing but peace in over 30 years of war .
in the past nine years , the us and its allies have not been able to solve the problem of the taliban .
now president hamid karzai , amid general helplessness , has eyed his chance to take things into his own hands at last . but he and his advisors know that for there to be longstanding peace in afghanistan , they not only need the us on their side , but also regional big powers such as russia , china and india . there can also be no peace without the close cooperation of pakistan , iran and saudi arabia . all these countries see their fundamental interests threatened by an afghanistan under us influence .
this means that a peace jirga in kabul only makes sense if prior agreements have been made between the us and afghanistan 's neighbors .
however , these have never been made . moreover , the taliban and al qaeda will never be ready to agree to peace in afghanistan as long as there are places they can retreat to abroad and people willing to support them . the taliban and al qaeda leadership want the establishment of a worldwide islamic empire .

we have seen that russia has slightly changed its previously stubborn position on this issue , it is now moving toward western positions .
and the meeting with merkel will probably demonstrate that russia is indeed willing to support more sanctions as it was ready to do a couple of weeks ago .
what has prompted this change on russia 's part ?
russia came to the conclusion that what the west has always said is true that iran is indeed building a nuclear bomb , and that this nuclear bomb will indeed threaten russia .
i think that obama could do more to convince medvedev to join the western anti-iranian coalition , and he did it also by changing his policy on central-eastern europe .
we remember , the united states wanted to install anti-missile defense infrastructure in poland and the czech republic , but russia feels threatened by that .
and out of this threat and out of this conflict which arose with the united states , russia somehow felt sympathetic in a way toward iran .
now the iranian leadership itself has accused russia of being an enemy of iran .
the bridges between tehran and moscow seem to have burned , and that will help russia to make the right decisions , and mrs. merkel will try to move medvedev closer to western positions .
both russia and germany are going to be attending the g-20 meeting in toronto this month , at which financial market regulation will be a key issue .
is there much common ground between berlin and moscow on this issue ?
there is no real common ground because russia is not yet a part of the global financial system as germany and the united states and many other of the g-20 states are .
but russia is very much interested not to go to the summit of the g-20 with an individual position .
it wants to join the position of other states .
it wants to be part of states who could maybe propose certain agendas .
and russia is very much interested in negotiating with germany a kind of pre-position before going to this summit , to have germany on its side when decisions will be taken about the future financial system of the world , about what the probable change of the wto rules , about the world economic system .
it is very important for russia .

deutsche welle spoke with alexander rahr , a russia expert at the german council on foreign relations , about the state of russo-german relations and what is likely to be discussed at the meeting .
dw : germany has joined permanent members of the un security council , which include russia , in calling for sanctions against iran .
what aspects of the dispute with iran will the two leaders be discussing .
alexander rahr : angela merkel stands clearly on the us position that sanctions against iran are necessary .
we have seen that russia has slightly changed its previously stubborn position on this issue , it is now moving toward western positions .
and the meeting with merkel will probably demonstrate that russia is indeed willing to support more sanctions as it was ready to do a couple of weeks ago .
what has prompted this change on russia 's part ?
russia came to the conclusion that what the west has always said is true that iran is indeed building a nuclear bomb , and that this nuclear bomb will indeed threaten russia .
i think that obama could do more to convince medvedev to join the western anti-iranian coalition , and he did it also by changing his policy on central-eastern europe .
we remember , the united states wanted to install anti-missile defense infrastructure in poland and the czech republic , but russia feels threatened by that .
and out of this threat and out of this conflict which arose with the united states , russia somehow felt sympathetic in a way toward iran .
now the iranian leadership itself has accused russia of being an enemy of iran .
the bridges between tehran and moscow seem to have burned , and that will help russia to make the right decisions , and mrs. merkel will try to move medvedev closer to western positions .
both russia and germany are going to be attending the g-20 meeting in toronto this month , at which financial market regulation will be a key issue .
is there much common ground between berlin and moscow on this issue ?
there is no real common ground because russia is not yet a part of the global financial system as germany and the united states and many other of the g-20 states are .
but russia is very much interested not to go to the summit of the g-20 with an individual position .
it wants to join the position of other states .
it wants to be part of states who could maybe propose certain agendas .
and russia is very much interested in negotiating with germany a kind of pre-position before going to this summit , to have germany on its side when decisions will be taken about the future financial system of the world , about what the probable change of the wto rules , about the world economic system .
it is very important for russia .

it comes the day after a leading bishop in turkey was murdered . pope benedict xvi said on friday he hoped cyprus ' divided greek and turkish communities could find " the desire to live in harmony " to reach peace .
the island has been divided along ethnic lines since 1974 when turkish troops occupied its northern third in response to a greek cypriot coup seeking union with greece .
president demetris christofias , who heads the greek cypriot community , told the pontiff that the island was " in need of your prayers . "
" cyprus is in need of your words of peace , given the difficult situation the island is facing in its occupied are , " christofias added .
the three-day trip is benedict 's first to a majority orthodox country , and comes amid desires to warm relations between the catholic and eastern orthodox churches .
bishop ’ s murder should ‘ not harm islam dialogue ’ during his visit , the pope will present a working document on regional issues , ahead of a meeting of middle east bishops in october .
among the bishops scheduled to attend the synod was luigi padovese , a leading catholic bishop in turkey who was murdered on thursday .
the pope spoke of his " profound sadness " over the stabbing .
he said the killing should not be allowed to hurt dialog with islam or stain the image of turkey and its people .
" we must not attribute this to turkey or to turks ... the certain thing is that it was not a political or religious assassination .
it was a personal thing , " benedict said. cb / reuters / afp / dpa editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it comes the day after a leading bishop in turkey was murdered . pope benedict xvi said on friday he hoped cyprus ' divided greek and turkish communities could find " the desire to live in harmony " to reach peace .
the island has been divided along ethnic lines since 1974 when turkish troops occupied its northern third in response to a greek cypriot coup seeking union with greece .
president demetris christofias , who heads the greek cypriot community , told the pontiff that the island was " in need of your prayers . "
" cyprus is in need of your words of peace , given the difficult situation the island is facing in its occupied are , " christofias added .
the three-day trip is benedict 's first to a majority orthodox country , and comes amid desires to warm relations between the catholic and eastern orthodox churches .
bishop ’ s murder should ‘ not harm islam dialogue ’ during his visit , the pope will present a working document on regional issues , ahead of a meeting of middle east bishops in october .
among the bishops scheduled to attend the synod was luigi padovese , a leading catholic bishop in turkey who was murdered on thursday .
the pope spoke of his " profound sadness " over the stabbing .
he said the killing should not be allowed to hurt dialog with islam or stain the image of turkey and its people .
" we must not attribute this to turkey or to turks ... the certain thing is that it was not a political or religious assassination .
it was a personal thing , " benedict said. cb / reuters / afp / dpa editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the two sides issued a joint statement in brussels on friday at the second-ever eu-pakistan summit . for a long time , the eu showed little interest in pakistan .
however , that changed with the fight against the taliban and al qaeda in afghanistan . today , eu leaders think that the whole western military and political engagement in afghanistan depends on a stable pakistan , as eu council president herman van rompuy explained in his press conference with pakistani prime minister yousuf raza gilani . " the developments of pakistan have a direct influence on europe and on the whole world .
therefore it is in our own interest , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu thinks pakistan is pivotal to peace in afghanistan where bomb attacks are almost a daily occurence direct aid to pakistan the eu supports pakistan with direct aid as well as with development programs , which are focused on education , the fight against poverty and on democratization . " mr prime minister , we have common enemies , poverty and terrorism , our common instrument is political democracy .
now we have to succeed , " van rompuy told his pakistani guest . the europeans want pakistan to continue fighting against extremism and to further implement democratic reforms .
both are difficult tasks for prime minister gilani and he wants something in return .
his main aim is to get better access to the european market for pakistani goods . " trade not aid " is the term often used by pakistani officials .
but the eu has been reluctant to open its markets .
commission president jose manuel barroso mentioned difficult negotiations with all the 27 member states , with the european parliament and the world trade organization .
however , he did say there it might be possible in one or two years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the faisal mosque of islamabad .
gilani reminded eu delegates in brussels on friday that " islam is a religion of peace " " islam is a religion of peace not of terrorism " prime minister gilani did not only talk about trade , however .
he was also keen to defend his religion against negative stereotyping . " islam is a religion of peace and tolerance , " he said .
" there is a perception in the west that the religion of islam is a religion of terrorism .
we are peaceful people and our religion has taught us tolerance , love and peace . " before going to the european council , gilani had met nato general secretary anders fogh rasmussen and told him his country was determined to win against what he called the evil forces of extremism and terrorism . author : christoph hasselbach -lrb- brussels -rrb- editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : germany searches for a new president german presidential election goes into third and final round of voting the role of the german president how germany 's president is elected christian wulff : the quiet modernizer press review -pipe- 04.06.2010 press review : wulff nominated as next german president großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian wulff could be the next president of germany chancellor angela merkel has nominated christian wulff , the state premier of lower saxony , as germany 's new head of state .
german newspaper commentators were divided over her choice . germany 's government has nominated the 50-year-old state premier of lower saxony as its candidate for the nation 's presidency . chancellor angela merkel chose christian wulff to replace president horst koehler as germany 's new head of state after koehler 's surprise resignation earlier this week . across germany , reactions to wulff 's nomination were mixed , with much of the press commentary focusing on who was not chosen for the post - namely merkel 's rumored first-choice candidate , labor minister ursula von der leyen . financial times deutschland asks " christian who ? " and writes the fact that wulff is moving into the presidential palace serves as " a sad piece of evidence for how little wriggle room cdu party leader angela merkel has in her own party . "
the paper goes on to say that merkel 's inability to push through her first-choice candidate was " far more worrisome than the idea of president christian wulff . " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung says koehler 's sudden resignation had lifted the lid on the traditionally rather opaque process by which candidates are chosen .
never before have people been able to get such an insight into the selection process .
the paper says " the fact that ...
merkel could not get her favorite approved discloses the acute weakness that also affects the chancellor . " speaking on the thursday edition of the " maybrit illner " talk show on german state broadcaster zdf , free democrat politician jorge chatzmarkakis said the reason von der leyen was not nominated was because conservative politicians from the mainly catholic south of germany did not like to see two protestant women , i.e. merkel and von der leyen , leading the country . one of germany 's largest broadsheets , sueddeutsche zeitung , says wulff has a tough road ahead of him . " he will have enough to do after his election in order to achieve the gravitas , seriousness and dignity that one expects from a president .
-lsb- finance minister -rsb- wolfgang schaeuble would have already had it . "
the paper adds , however , that " because wulff is an experienced party politician , the nomination is not as surprising as it may seem to many at first glance . " the regional daily saechsische zeitung says wulff is a popular state premier in lower saxony .
" most perceive him as a nice , friendly man without any rough edges .
he first began garnering political attention two months ago , when he brought a turkish-born muslim into his cabinet .
that was brave , and let 's hope that as president he is also able to think long-term .
because just being friendly and flattering will not be enough to give the necessary weight to the office . " the stuttgarter zeitung praises wulff 's nomination , and notes that he would be the " youngest candidate to serve in the office of president . " the paper also praises his controversial decision to appoint a muslim woman to a ministerial post .
the daily saw the choice as a breath of fresh air , writing " with the decision yesterday , the coalition has stirred the hope that lethargy does n't necessarily have to be their trademark .

with more and more areas transforming into homogenized yuppy-villes , is this the death of kiezkultur ? berliners , so proud of their poverty and punkish attitude to life , find it easy to sneer at yuppies .
and , given that i am not especially materialistic either , i guess i do too .
i do n't have a car , i could n't care a toffee about designer labels and i currently own but two pairs of shoes .
each month is a constant exercise in flying by the seat of my pants when it comes to paying the rent and so long as there 's enough money in the bank for milk and cigarettes , i 'm relatively content . you can therefore imagine that splashy displays of affluence are something that i tend to find rather vulgar .
and i am not the only one .
berliners hate it too .
especially when their tumbledown , graffiti-riddled neighborhoods end up being gutted , sanitized and then invaded by a bizarre species created via stepford wives and l.a. law cross-pollination . the process of gentrification has been striding forward mercilessly since the berlin wall fell back in 1989 .
as many ex-gdr citizens headed for the bright lights of the west , eager capitalists soon swooped down on the former heart of german socialism , bought up the empty properties and began transforming neighborhoods wholesale .
and it has n't stopped since .
the creative bohemians in the city have packed their easels and moved to successive districts to stay ahead of the gentrification tide .
i mean , if you make your meager living selling anti-something-or-other political art , why would you want to live next door to some stuffy doctor and his bland wife ? newcomers bring energy to berlin aside from being rather dreary , your slightly more upper crust neighbors might pose a more serious threat than just ruining your street cred .
what makes a neighborhood , or kiez ?

move in mr and mrs dull , formerly of conservativeville , who think it 's rather amusing to live in a bombed-out ruin in prenzlauer berg because it 's so " arty " and by the end of week one they 're sending for the police and complaining about the noise . it 's happened time and again ; moaning neighbors and rising rents have seen the demise of berlin heavyweight clubs like rio and scala and seen venues like king kong , once famed for it 's nightly live music roster , have its assets stripped and only do gigs on weekends .
the famous off-location parties - guerilla affairs set up in some basement somewhere - happen less and less often simply because the basements are now all graphic design companies and law firms .
if you want to party in a basement , you have to go to the spandau district now . but is it all bad news ?
not necessarily .
ellen allien , dj and founder of label bpitch control , recently said in an interview with flavorwire : " a lot of times people move to the city for just three years or something and then they go back to america or italy or whatever .
but they bring the impact , the energy .
that 's really good for the scene , because we have all these new people doing something , trying something .
that 's why the music scene here is super dynamic . " but she also warned that " rich people just visiting for the weekend " are what is " killing the city .
but as long as people keep moving here , berlin will remain cool . " a common fate for capital cities it seems not a week goes by these days without some anti-gentrification demo taking place somewhere in berlin .
prenzlauer berg and mitte , once grim east berlin wastelands , are now lost to the yuppies so the fight is on to stem the flow before kreuzberg , friedrichshain and neukoelln go the same way .
take a quick peek at the non-political website brennende-autos.de and you 'll see that the current trend for torching a fancy motor as a symbolic " f * * k you " to the yuppies all takes place within the central districts mentioned above - such is the feeling of territorialism in these areas . the wave of transforming an area into something upmarket and appealing to people with higher-end incomes , is something which has already wrecked a number of the world 's capitals . " gentrification can certainly be an enormous problem for nightlife and a city 's creative essence , " dj and journalist jonty skrufff told me .
" you only have to look at new york and london and how their club scenes have been watered down , marginalized and ruined by rich incomers to understand what can happen , " he told me . now that london has become expensive and the trend-setting clubs have closed , " horrible expensive bars have moved in and every weekend hordes of drunken office workers descend on the area making it unpleasant for the few freaks left who previously made the area so interesting and creative , " he added . a lose-lose situation djs , freaks and flamboyant queers hate the gentrification " afflicting " their once bohemian neighborhoods ; real estate companies and housing associations think they are making the area more pleasant for everyone .
it 's a lose-lose situation , as the two sides of the argument are both valid and can not be reconciled .
gentrification , beautification , sanitation ; whatever you want to call it , the floodgates opened years ago and it 's unlikely to stop anytime soon .
the process will only reach an end once all the creativity and quirkiness which makes berlin berlin has been squeezed out .
sad but true . as for me ?
well , i never much cared for fashion to the extent that it should dictate which street i live in .
my needs are very simple ; so long as there 's somewhere to lock my bike and buy coffee and cigarettes , i 'm happy .
i do n't really care if my neighbors are lefty anarchists or sharp-suited architects because , at the end of the day , i hate everyone in equal measure anyway . the incurably grumpy neale lytollis currently lives in kreuzberg , above a cigarette kiosk . editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

prenzlauer berg and mitte , once grim east berlin wastelands , are now lost to the yuppies so the fight is on to stem the flow before kreuzberg , friedrichshain and neukoelln go the same way .
take a quick peek at the non-political website brennende-autos.de and you 'll see that the current trend for torching a fancy motor as a symbolic " f * * k you " to the yuppies all takes place within the central districts mentioned above - such is the feeling of territorialism in these areas . the wave of transforming an area into something upmarket and appealing to people with higher-end incomes , is something which has already wrecked a number of the world 's capitals . " gentrification can certainly be an enormous problem for nightlife and a city 's creative essence , " dj and journalist jonty skrufff told me .
" you only have to look at new york and london and how their club scenes have been watered down , marginalized and ruined by rich incomers to understand what can happen , " he told me . now that london has become expensive and the trend-setting clubs have closed , " horrible expensive bars have moved in and every weekend hordes of drunken office workers descend on the area making it unpleasant for the few freaks left who previously made the area so interesting and creative , " he added . a lose-lose situation djs , freaks and flamboyant queers hate the gentrification " afflicting " their once bohemian neighborhoods ; real estate companies and housing associations think they are making the area more pleasant for everyone .
it 's a lose-lose situation , as the two sides of the argument are both valid and can not be reconciled .
gentrification , beautification , sanitation ; whatever you want to call it , the floodgates opened years ago and it 's unlikely to stop anytime soon .
the process will only reach an end once all the creativity and quirkiness which makes berlin berlin has been squeezed out .
sad but true . as for me ?
well , i never much cared for fashion to the extent that it should dictate which street i live in .
my needs are very simple ; so long as there 's somewhere to lock my bike and buy coffee and cigarettes , i 'm happy .
i do n't really care if my neighbors are lefty anarchists or sharp-suited architects because , at the end of the day , i hate everyone in equal measure anyway . the incurably grumpy neale lytollis currently lives in kreuzberg , above a cigarette kiosk . editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german newspaper commentators were divided over her choice . germany 's government has nominated the 50-year-old state premier of lower saxony as its candidate for the nation 's presidency . chancellor angela merkel chose christian wulff to replace president horst koehler as germany 's new head of state after koehler 's surprise resignation earlier this week . across germany , reactions to wulff 's nomination were mixed , with much of the press commentary focusing on who was not chosen for the post - namely merkel 's rumored first-choice candidate , labor minister ursula von der leyen . financial times deutschland asks " christian who ? " and writes the fact that wulff is moving into the presidential palace serves as " a sad piece of evidence for how little wriggle room cdu party leader angela merkel has in her own party . "
the paper goes on to say that merkel 's inability to push through her first-choice candidate was " far more worrisome than the idea of president christian wulff .

merkel could not get her favorite approved discloses the acute weakness that also affects the chancellor . " speaking on the thursday edition of the " maybrit illner " talk show on german state broadcaster zdf , free democrat politician jorge chatzmarkakis said the reason von der leyen was not nominated was because conservative politicians from the mainly catholic south of germany did not like to see two protestant women , i.e. merkel and von der leyen , leading the country . one of germany 's largest broadsheets , sueddeutsche zeitung , says wulff has a tough road ahead of him . " he will have enough to do after his election in order to achieve the gravitas , seriousness and dignity that one expects from a president .
-lsb- finance minister -rsb- wolfgang schaeuble would have already had it . "
the paper adds , however , that " because wulff is an experienced party politician , the nomination is not as surprising as it may seem to many at first glance . " the regional daily saechsische zeitung says wulff is a popular state premier in lower saxony .
" most perceive him as a nice , friendly man without any rough edges .
he first began garnering political attention two months ago , when he brought a turkish-born muslim into his cabinet .
that was brave , and let 's hope that as president he is also able to think long-term .
because just being friendly and flattering will not be enough to give the necessary weight to the office . " the stuttgarter zeitung praises wulff 's nomination , and notes that he would be the " youngest candidate to serve in the office of president . " the paper also praises his controversial decision to appoint a muslim woman to a ministerial post .
the daily saw the choice as a breath of fresh air , writing " with the decision yesterday , the coalition has stirred the hope that lethargy does n't necessarily have to be their trademark .

german newspaper commentators were divided over her choice . germany 's government has nominated the 50-year-old state premier of lower saxony as its candidate for the nation 's presidency . chancellor angela merkel chose christian wulff to replace president horst koehler as germany 's new head of state after koehler 's surprise resignation earlier this week . across germany , reactions to wulff 's nomination were mixed , with much of the press commentary focusing on who was not chosen for the post - namely merkel 's rumored first-choice candidate , labor minister ursula von der leyen . financial times deutschland asks " christian who ? " and writes the fact that wulff is moving into the presidential palace serves as " a sad piece of evidence for how little wriggle room cdu party leader angela merkel has in her own party . "
the paper goes on to say that merkel 's inability to push through her first-choice candidate was " far more worrisome than the idea of president christian wulff . " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung says koehler 's sudden resignation had lifted the lid on the traditionally rather opaque process by which candidates are chosen .

could pricing the earth be the way to save it – and ourselves ? great extinctions come and go .
the earth has experienced five in the last half-a-billion years , and a number of lesser extinctions as well .
usually , they 're unleashed by a cataclysmic event – an asteroid impact or a super volcano .
scientists speculate that sometimes they 've been triggered by gradual changes in the earth 's atmosphere .
but what makes the so-called ' sixth great extinction ' distinctive is us .
this time around we are present to witness it .
we also happen to be driving it . according to the latest global biodiversity outlook released last month , extinction rates may be up to 1,000 times higher than the background rate – the normal pace of extinction that has accompanied evolution on earth .
bleak outlook bildunterschrift : tigers are set to become extinct in the wild in 15 years the decline is happening across the spectrum of life .
species are disappearing ; genetic variety – a safeguard against disease – is being lost ; and whole ecosystems , whose processes provide everything from habitats to the quality of our air , water and soils , are retreating .
some are faring worse than others .
amphibians face the greatest risk and corals are deteriorating most rapidly .
while the number of vertebrate species fell by nearly a third on average between 1970 and 1996 , nearly a quarter of all plant species are estimated to be threatened with extinction .
in the last 110 years , india 's wild tiger population has fallen by over 97.5 percent thanks to poaching and competition for land with humans .
" if business as usual continues , one can expect them -lrb- tigers -rrb- to be all extinct by 2025 , " says dr ashok khosla , president of the international union for conservation of nature -lrb- iucn -rrb- , the organization which catalogues the world 's species in its so-called ' red lists . '
another example which khosla likes to cite from his native india is the sudden plunge in vulture populations in south asia , which saw the birds ' population drop from 40 million to 60,000 within a decade of the year 1992 .
" it was discovered that a hormone fed to cattle for more milk was getting into the vultures … within eight years governments in india and nepal and elsewhere had taken - luckily for us - action to stop the decline , but they were down to virtually extinct , " khosla said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the only known medication for childhood leukaemia comes from this threatened flower a human-shaped footprint the drivers for the loss of biodiversity can all be traced – directly or indirectly – to humans .
the principle pressures include habitat change -lrb- think monocultures and clear-felling -rrb- , overexploitation -lrb- consider the ocean 's fish stocks -rrb- , pollution , invasive alien species -lrb- whose advances into new territories are usually abetted by people -rrb- and climate change .
in stark contrast to most of our fellow tenants on this planet , the human population has exploded in the last century .
in 1900 , the world 's population was 1.6 billion people .
today it is roughly 6.9 billion and expected to rise to nine billion by 2050 .
we 've also been consuming more .
according to this year 's consumption report by the world watch institute , the average american consumes six times as much today as he did in 1960 .
our numbers and behavior already suck up the resources of 1.4 planets , says the global footprint network .
according to its ' moderate ' business as usual trends , we will need two planets to sustain us by 2050 .
these figures have led to a growing sense of alarm in some quarters , and mounting calls for radical change . " it takes by our collective bio-capacity at the moment 18 months to provide 12 months of natural goods and services , and it 's heading in the wrong direction , " says andrew simms , a policy director at the new economics foundation , a green-oriented think tank .
" so if we ask ourselves if orthodox price mechanisms are working at the moment , well obviously they 're not , because they 're not turning things around . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank economist pavan sukhdev is auditing nature services rendered if living beyond our natural means comes with a cost , then putting a figure on that cost is the difficult job of pavan sukhdev , an economist at deutsche bank .
the banker is on loan to the united nations environment program where he runs a study called the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity -lrb- teeb -rrb- .
the idea grew out of the stern report of 2006 which laid out the economic case for tackling climate change .
" economics today is the currency of policy , " sukhdev told a recent biodiversity conference . " no matter how strong , no matter how emotive , no matter how powerful and no matter how human your arguments to do anything in this world , we are at a stage today where you will also be asked for economic justification .
so whether you like it or not – indeed whether i like it or not – there will be a case of tradeoffs being evaluated . "
from pollinating crops – a service worth up to seven billion dollars in the us , according to studies there – to wetlands ' capacity to mitigate storm damage , there are myriad ways that ecosystems provide services not factored into our economies .
nine-out-of-ten new medicines is derived from something found in nature .
according to teeb 's interim report , we are sacrificing 1.3 to 3.1 trillion euros -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- worth of ecosystems services every year as our economies continue to treat the environment as an ' externality . '
to put that in perspective , that 's up to twice the cost of failing to tackle climate change .
or to put it another way , it 's the financial crisis every three years .
yet even some potential allies remain wary of the drive to a market solution .
" we 're faced with what i would call the paradox of environmental economics , " said andrew simms .
" how , for example , would you put a price on the marginal ton of carbon , which when burnt , puts us on a path to runaway climate change ?
you 're basically asking ' what is the price of civilization ? '
even if a market allowed for the trading of that ton of carbon , i would argue that it should not be allowed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrew simms is concerned about the distinction between value and price squaring the circle nevertheless , if teeb 's aim is to rouse decision-makers to action out of concern for their state coffers , then there are signs that it 's bearing fruit .
this year 's green week -lrb- 1-4 june -rrb- , an annual environment conference organized by the european union , was dedicated to the issue of biodiversity , and the bloc 's executive used the event to announce two new tools aimed at halting biodiversity loss .
recognizing the need for accurate information , the bloc 's executive and the european environment agency unveiled a centralized clearing house for data called bise – the biodiversity information system for europe . taking a page out of the climate change play-book , they also established a " biodiversity baseline " , which will be used to offer a snapshot of trends and measure progress on goals .
but as useful as the common starting point of 1990 levels of carbon emissions has been for climate action , how do you make a baseline for something as complex as biodiversity ?
the eu 's initial groping efforts have produced a five-page brochure with 15 charts .
though it 's not as intuitively clear as a target for cutting emissions , it is an important step that will " help us review our actions and take tangible new measures , " according to environment commissioner janez potocnik .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could european farmers be paid to make wildlife reserves ?
rethinking the cap and other innovative ideas may be on their way .
the eu 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- – a 50-billion-euro-a-year program of farm subsidies – has long been controversial for its distortion of trade and impact on developing countries .
there are now mounting calls to pay famers the money for habitat restoration instead , and at a fraction of the cost . a recent policy paper by the european centre for international political economy found that " substantial " environmental gains could be secured at half the cost of the current cap .
yet reforming agriculture – a sector that eats up half the eu 's budget – has always been a quagmire , despite the optimistic view , on the part of the eu 's most senior environmental bureaucrat , that things are beginning to change .
" we will definitely see support for agriculture tied more and more – i ca n't say exclusively – to respect for the environment , and ecologically friendlier forms of production , " karl falkenberg , director general of the environment commission , told deutsche welle .
in any event , europe will have to move fast if it is to have any shot at halting - and reversing - the loss of biodiversity , as it aims to do by 2020 .
like every region in the world , it failed to meet this year 's deadline to halt biodiversity loss , a target laid down with no baseline , little information and no sub-targets in 2002 .
the next goals will be set internationally when the global community gathers in nagoya in october for the next convention on biological diversity conference .
if europe and the world is to avoid another ground hog day , then political leaders will need to find the attention spans – and stomachs – to deal with ' two ' environmental crises at once .

german newspaper commentators were divided over her choice . germany 's government has nominated the 50-year-old state premier of lower saxony as its candidate for the nation 's presidency . chancellor angela merkel chose christian wulff to replace president horst koehler as germany 's new head of state after koehler 's surprise resignation earlier this week . across germany , reactions to wulff 's nomination were mixed , with much of the press commentary focusing on who was not chosen for the post - namely merkel 's rumored first-choice candidate , labor minister ursula von der leyen . financial times deutschland asks " christian who ? " and writes the fact that wulff is moving into the presidential palace serves as " a sad piece of evidence for how little wriggle room cdu party leader angela merkel has in her own party . "
the paper goes on to say that merkel 's inability to push through her first-choice candidate was " far more worrisome than the idea of president christian wulff . " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung says koehler 's sudden resignation had lifted the lid on the traditionally rather opaque process by which candidates are chosen .
never before have people been able to get such an insight into the selection process .
the paper says " the fact that ...
merkel could not get her favorite approved discloses the acute weakness that also affects the chancellor . " speaking on the thursday edition of the " maybrit illner " talk show on german state broadcaster zdf , free democrat politician jorge chatzmarkakis said the reason von der leyen was not nominated was because conservative politicians from the mainly catholic south of germany did not like to see two protestant women , i.e. merkel and von der leyen , leading the country . one of germany 's largest broadsheets , sueddeutsche zeitung , says wulff has a tough road ahead of him . " he will have enough to do after his election in order to achieve the gravitas , seriousness and dignity that one expects from a president .
-lsb- finance minister -rsb- wolfgang schaeuble would have already had it . "
the paper adds , however , that " because wulff is an experienced party politician , the nomination is not as surprising as it may seem to many at first glance . " the regional daily saechsische zeitung says wulff is a popular state premier in lower saxony .
" most perceive him as a nice , friendly man without any rough edges .
he first began garnering political attention two months ago , when he brought a turkish-born muslim into his cabinet .
that was brave , and let 's hope that as president he is also able to think long-term .
because just being friendly and flattering will not be enough to give the necessary weight to the office . " the stuttgarter zeitung praises wulff 's nomination , and notes that he would be the " youngest candidate to serve in the office of president . " the paper also praises his controversial decision to appoint a muslim woman to a ministerial post .
the daily saw the choice as a breath of fresh air , writing " with the decision yesterday , the coalition has stirred the hope that lethargy does n't necessarily have to be their trademark .

could pricing the earth be the way to save it – and ourselves ? great extinctions come and go .
the earth has experienced five in the last half-a-billion years , and a number of lesser extinctions as well .
usually , they 're unleashed by a cataclysmic event – an asteroid impact or a super volcano .
scientists speculate that sometimes they 've been triggered by gradual changes in the earth 's atmosphere .
but what makes the so-called ' sixth great extinction ' distinctive is us .
this time around we are present to witness it .
we also happen to be driving it . according to the latest global biodiversity outlook released last month , extinction rates may be up to 1,000 times higher than the background rate – the normal pace of extinction that has accompanied evolution on earth .
bleak outlook bildunterschrift : tigers are set to become extinct in the wild in 15 years the decline is happening across the spectrum of life .
species are disappearing ; genetic variety – a safeguard against disease – is being lost ; and whole ecosystems , whose processes provide everything from habitats to the quality of our air , water and soils , are retreating .
some are faring worse than others .
amphibians face the greatest risk and corals are deteriorating most rapidly .
while the number of vertebrate species fell by nearly a third on average between 1970 and 1996 , nearly a quarter of all plant species are estimated to be threatened with extinction .
in the last 110 years , india 's wild tiger population has fallen by over 97.5 percent thanks to poaching and competition for land with humans .
" if business as usual continues , one can expect them -lrb- tigers -rrb- to be all extinct by 2025 , " says dr ashok khosla , president of the international union for conservation of nature -lrb- iucn -rrb- , the organization which catalogues the world 's species in its so-called ' red lists . '
another example which khosla likes to cite from his native india is the sudden plunge in vulture populations in south asia , which saw the birds ' population drop from 40 million to 60,000 within a decade of the year 1992 .
" it was discovered that a hormone fed to cattle for more milk was getting into the vultures … within eight years governments in india and nepal and elsewhere had taken - luckily for us - action to stop the decline , but they were down to virtually extinct , " khosla said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the only known medication for childhood leukaemia comes from this threatened flower a human-shaped footprint the drivers for the loss of biodiversity can all be traced – directly or indirectly – to humans .
the principle pressures include habitat change -lrb- think monocultures and clear-felling -rrb- , overexploitation -lrb- consider the ocean 's fish stocks -rrb- , pollution , invasive alien species -lrb- whose advances into new territories are usually abetted by people -rrb- and climate change .
in stark contrast to most of our fellow tenants on this planet , the human population has exploded in the last century .
in 1900 , the world 's population was 1.6 billion people .
today it is roughly 6.9 billion and expected to rise to nine billion by 2050 .
we 've also been consuming more .
according to this year 's consumption report by the world watch institute , the average american consumes six times as much today as he did in 1960 .
our numbers and behavior already suck up the resources of 1.4 planets , says the global footprint network .
according to its ' moderate ' business as usual trends , we will need two planets to sustain us by 2050 .
these figures have led to a growing sense of alarm in some quarters , and mounting calls for radical change . " it takes by our collective bio-capacity at the moment 18 months to provide 12 months of natural goods and services , and it 's heading in the wrong direction , " says andrew simms , a policy director at the new economics foundation , a green-oriented think tank .
" so if we ask ourselves if orthodox price mechanisms are working at the moment , well obviously they 're not , because they 're not turning things around . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank economist pavan sukhdev is auditing nature services rendered if living beyond our natural means comes with a cost , then putting a figure on that cost is the difficult job of pavan sukhdev , an economist at deutsche bank .
the banker is on loan to the united nations environment program where he runs a study called the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity -lrb- teeb -rrb- .
the idea grew out of the stern report of 2006 which laid out the economic case for tackling climate change .
" economics today is the currency of policy , " sukhdev told a recent biodiversity conference . " no matter how strong , no matter how emotive , no matter how powerful and no matter how human your arguments to do anything in this world , we are at a stage today where you will also be asked for economic justification .
so whether you like it or not – indeed whether i like it or not – there will be a case of tradeoffs being evaluated . "
from pollinating crops – a service worth up to seven billion dollars in the us , according to studies there – to wetlands ' capacity to mitigate storm damage , there are myriad ways that ecosystems provide services not factored into our economies .
nine-out-of-ten new medicines is derived from something found in nature .
according to teeb 's interim report , we are sacrificing 1.3 to 3.1 trillion euros -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- worth of ecosystems services every year as our economies continue to treat the environment as an ' externality . '
to put that in perspective , that 's up to twice the cost of failing to tackle climate change .
or to put it another way , it 's the financial crisis every three years .
yet even some potential allies remain wary of the drive to a market solution .
" we 're faced with what i would call the paradox of environmental economics , " said andrew simms .
" how , for example , would you put a price on the marginal ton of carbon , which when burnt , puts us on a path to runaway climate change ?
you 're basically asking ' what is the price of civilization ? '
even if a market allowed for the trading of that ton of carbon , i would argue that it should not be allowed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrew simms is concerned about the distinction between value and price squaring the circle nevertheless , if teeb 's aim is to rouse decision-makers to action out of concern for their state coffers , then there are signs that it 's bearing fruit .
this year 's green week -lrb- 1-4 june -rrb- , an annual environment conference organized by the european union , was dedicated to the issue of biodiversity , and the bloc 's executive used the event to announce two new tools aimed at halting biodiversity loss .
recognizing the need for accurate information , the bloc 's executive and the european environment agency unveiled a centralized clearing house for data called bise – the biodiversity information system for europe . taking a page out of the climate change play-book , they also established a " biodiversity baseline " , which will be used to offer a snapshot of trends and measure progress on goals .
but as useful as the common starting point of 1990 levels of carbon emissions has been for climate action , how do you make a baseline for something as complex as biodiversity ?
the eu 's initial groping efforts have produced a five-page brochure with 15 charts .
though it 's not as intuitively clear as a target for cutting emissions , it is an important step that will " help us review our actions and take tangible new measures , " according to environment commissioner janez potocnik .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could european farmers be paid to make wildlife reserves ?
rethinking the cap and other innovative ideas may be on their way .
the eu 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- – a 50-billion-euro-a-year program of farm subsidies – has long been controversial for its distortion of trade and impact on developing countries .
there are now mounting calls to pay famers the money for habitat restoration instead , and at a fraction of the cost . a recent policy paper by the european centre for international political economy found that " substantial " environmental gains could be secured at half the cost of the current cap .
yet reforming agriculture – a sector that eats up half the eu 's budget – has always been a quagmire , despite the optimistic view , on the part of the eu 's most senior environmental bureaucrat , that things are beginning to change .
" we will definitely see support for agriculture tied more and more – i ca n't say exclusively – to respect for the environment , and ecologically friendlier forms of production , " karl falkenberg , director general of the environment commission , told deutsche welle .
in any event , europe will have to move fast if it is to have any shot at halting - and reversing - the loss of biodiversity , as it aims to do by 2020 .
like every region in the world , it failed to meet this year 's deadline to halt biodiversity loss , a target laid down with no baseline , little information and no sub-targets in 2002 .
the next goals will be set internationally when the global community gathers in nagoya in october for the next convention on biological diversity conference .
if europe and the world is to avoid another ground hog day , then political leaders will need to find the attention spans – and stomachs – to deal with ' two ' environmental crises at once .

according to its ' moderate ' business as usual trends , we will need two planets to sustain us by 2050 .
these figures have led to a growing sense of alarm in some quarters , and mounting calls for radical change . " it takes by our collective bio-capacity at the moment 18 months to provide 12 months of natural goods and services , and it 's heading in the wrong direction , " says andrew simms , a policy director at the new economics foundation , a green-oriented think tank .
" so if we ask ourselves if orthodox price mechanisms are working at the moment , well obviously they 're not , because they 're not turning things around . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank economist pavan sukhdev is auditing nature services rendered if living beyond our natural means comes with a cost , then putting a figure on that cost is the difficult job of pavan sukhdev , an economist at deutsche bank .
the banker is on loan to the united nations environment program where he runs a study called the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity -lrb- teeb -rrb- .
the idea grew out of the stern report of 2006 which laid out the economic case for tackling climate change .
" economics today is the currency of policy , " sukhdev told a recent biodiversity conference . " no matter how strong , no matter how emotive , no matter how powerful and no matter how human your arguments to do anything in this world , we are at a stage today where you will also be asked for economic justification .
so whether you like it or not – indeed whether i like it or not – there will be a case of tradeoffs being evaluated . "
from pollinating crops – a service worth up to seven billion dollars in the us , according to studies there – to wetlands ' capacity to mitigate storm damage , there are myriad ways that ecosystems provide services not factored into our economies .
nine-out-of-ten new medicines is derived from something found in nature .
according to teeb 's interim report , we are sacrificing 1.3 to 3.1 trillion euros -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- worth of ecosystems services every year as our economies continue to treat the environment as an ' externality . '
to put that in perspective , that 's up to twice the cost of failing to tackle climate change .
or to put it another way , it 's the financial crisis every three years .
yet even some potential allies remain wary of the drive to a market solution .
" we 're faced with what i would call the paradox of environmental economics , " said andrew simms .
" how , for example , would you put a price on the marginal ton of carbon , which when burnt , puts us on a path to runaway climate change ?
you 're basically asking ' what is the price of civilization ? '
even if a market allowed for the trading of that ton of carbon , i would argue that it should not be allowed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrew simms is concerned about the distinction between value and price squaring the circle nevertheless , if teeb 's aim is to rouse decision-makers to action out of concern for their state coffers , then there are signs that it 's bearing fruit .
this year 's green week -lrb- 1-4 june -rrb- , an annual environment conference organized by the european union , was dedicated to the issue of biodiversity , and the bloc 's executive used the event to announce two new tools aimed at halting biodiversity loss .
recognizing the need for accurate information , the bloc 's executive and the european environment agency unveiled a centralized clearing house for data called bise – the biodiversity information system for europe . taking a page out of the climate change play-book , they also established a " biodiversity baseline " , which will be used to offer a snapshot of trends and measure progress on goals .
but as useful as the common starting point of 1990 levels of carbon emissions has been for climate action , how do you make a baseline for something as complex as biodiversity ?
the eu 's initial groping efforts have produced a five-page brochure with 15 charts .
though it 's not as intuitively clear as a target for cutting emissions , it is an important step that will " help us review our actions and take tangible new measures , " according to environment commissioner janez potocnik .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could european farmers be paid to make wildlife reserves ?
rethinking the cap and other innovative ideas may be on their way .
the eu 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- – a 50-billion-euro-a-year program of farm subsidies – has long been controversial for its distortion of trade and impact on developing countries .
there are now mounting calls to pay famers the money for habitat restoration instead , and at a fraction of the cost . a recent policy paper by the european centre for international political economy found that " substantial " environmental gains could be secured at half the cost of the current cap .
yet reforming agriculture – a sector that eats up half the eu 's budget – has always been a quagmire , despite the optimistic view , on the part of the eu 's most senior environmental bureaucrat , that things are beginning to change .
" we will definitely see support for agriculture tied more and more – i ca n't say exclusively – to respect for the environment , and ecologically friendlier forms of production , " karl falkenberg , director general of the environment commission , told deutsche welle .
in any event , europe will have to move fast if it is to have any shot at halting - and reversing - the loss of biodiversity , as it aims to do by 2020 .
like every region in the world , it failed to meet this year 's deadline to halt biodiversity loss , a target laid down with no baseline , little information and no sub-targets in 2002 .
the next goals will be set internationally when the global community gathers in nagoya in october for the next convention on biological diversity conference .
if europe and the world is to avoid another ground hog day , then political leaders will need to find the attention spans – and stomachs – to deal with ' two ' environmental crises at once .

the country has taken a risk by investing billions of euros in infrastructure , stadiums and roads in preparation for the big event .
the goal is to increase foreign tourism , trade and investment long after the final whistle is blown .

the host nation is hoping to reap the same benefits germany did four years ago . south africa is abuzz with activity with just one week to go to the kick-off of the 2010 fifa world cup in johannesburg on june 11 .
from transport and tourist arrangements to stadiums and soccer , officials and entrepreneurs in south africa 's nine host cities have been finalizing their arrangements to ensure the country is ready for the long-awaited football extravaganza .
they 've been drawing on the experience of germany , which hosted the 2006 competition .
although germany failed to lift the trophy , the country did win in other respects : its international image received a massive boost and consumer confidence shot up .
this time round , south africa is keen to reap the same benefits .
the country has taken a risk by investing billions of euros in infrastructure , stadiums and roads in preparation for the big event .
the goal is to increase foreign tourism , trade and investment long after the final whistle is blown .
nikolaus eberl , a german branding expert who is in south africa to help the country with its marketing and branding ahead of the 2010 competition , believes south africa can learn from germany , which rebranded itself as a " welcoming , fun , modern and innovative nation " during the last world cup .
" germans took a hard look at their image as ' effective but unfriendly , " ' he said .
" and then devised a nation-building strategy that promised the world ' a time to make friends . " '
the strategy paid off and tourism shot up 31 percent soon after the end of the world cup .
unemployment also dropped and exports increased . bildunterschrift : germany 's international image improved dramatically as fans reveled at the last world cup success not confined to the pitch in his book , " brand ovation - how germany won the world cup of nation branding , " eberl says 91 percent of visitors to germany 's world cup recommended the country as a holiday destination and depicted germans as " open-minded , friendly and welcoming . "
germany also propelled itself from seventh to second most valued brand in the 2006 nation brands index -lrb- anholt-gmi q3/2006 -rrb- .
south africa is hoping to pick up where germany left off through its " welcoming the world to africa " slogan , backed up by a range of initiatives .
cities are staging welcoming campaigns , service personnel have been trained to be ambassadors , people are learning french , german , spanish and italian , while thousands of people will help in and around the stadiums as volunteers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new stadiums like green-point in cape town aim to help project a modern image of south africa one of them is german national , lawrence langer .
he works in community development in south africa and is involved in the football for hope program in south africa which spans townships across the country .
" i experienced germany 's world cup , and it was amazing how people opened up in the excitement of the event , " he said .
this experience only made him more determined to be involved in south africa 's world cup .
" i knew i wanted to be part of this , " said sharon banda , another volunteer .
" meeting people from all over the world and showing them how great africa is . "
' brand advocates ' make up for drop in expected visitors football fever has been rising as the tournament draws closer .
in johannesburg and other cities , south african flags and those of the 32 nations competing in the world cup are flying from car windows - and the excitement is palpable .
initially south africa had estimated that 400,000 visitors would be coming to the country for the world cup .
however , south africa 's tourism minister , marthinus van schalkwyk , announced that closer to 300,000 fans were expected from across the globe .
while the direct numbers may be down , eberl estimates that for each visitor to the world cup , another 150 will be indirectly influenced in their perceptions about the host country , through word-of-mouth by the fans when they return home . and these brand advocates could hold the key to long-term benefits for south africa .
bildunterschrift : the most important branding south africa is hoping for will come from the fans themselves south africa is also banking on the global television coverage it gets when matches are screened worldwide .
the world cup offers south africa the opportunity to market the country as a business destination and a springboard into developing markets in the southern african region .
matthias boddenberg , chief executive of the southern african german chamber of commerce , said south africa should focus on promoting trade and investment in areas like mining and energy , particularly the use of renewable energy and exports from its manufacturing sector .
" south africa is a beautiful country offering unbelievable opportunities , " he said .
" but it is also a country facing big challenges in terms of inequality and crime .
south africa should not fall into the trap of painting a perfect picture .
the message should be realistic , yet optimistic . "

it comes the day after a leading bishop in turkey was murdered . pope benedict xvi said on friday he hoped cyprus ' divided greek and turkish communities could find " the desire to live in harmony " to reach peace .
the island has been divided along ethnic lines since 1974 when turkish troops occupied its northern third in response to a greek cypriot coup seeking union with greece .
president demetris christofias , who heads the greek cypriot community , told the pontiff that the island was " in need of your prayers . "
" cyprus is in need of your words of peace , given the difficult situation the island is facing in its occupied are , " christofias added .
the three-day trip is benedict 's first to a majority orthodox country , and comes amid desires to warm relations between the catholic and eastern orthodox churches .
bishop ’ s murder should ‘ not harm islam dialogue ’ during his visit , the pope will present a working document on regional issues , ahead of a meeting of middle east bishops in october .
among the bishops scheduled to attend the synod was luigi padovese , a leading catholic bishop in turkey who was murdered on thursday .
the pope spoke of his " profound sadness " over the stabbing .
he said the killing should not be allowed to hurt dialog with islam or stain the image of turkey and its people .
" we must not attribute this to turkey or to turks ... the certain thing is that it was not a political or religious assassination .
it was a personal thing , " benedict said. cb / reuters / afp / dpa editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

could pricing the earth be the way to save it – and ourselves ? great extinctions come and go .
the earth has experienced five in the last half-a-billion years , and a number of lesser extinctions as well .
usually , they 're unleashed by a cataclysmic event – an asteroid impact or a super volcano .
scientists speculate that sometimes they 've been triggered by gradual changes in the earth 's atmosphere .
but what makes the so-called ' sixth great extinction ' distinctive is us .
this time around we are present to witness it .
we also happen to be driving it . according to the latest global biodiversity outlook released last month , extinction rates may be up to 1,000 times higher than the background rate – the normal pace of extinction that has accompanied evolution on earth .
bleak outlook bildunterschrift : tigers are set to become extinct in the wild in 15 years the decline is happening across the spectrum of life .
species are disappearing ; genetic variety – a safeguard against disease – is being lost ; and whole ecosystems , whose processes provide everything from habitats to the quality of our air , water and soils , are retreating .
some are faring worse than others .
amphibians face the greatest risk and corals are deteriorating most rapidly .
while the number of vertebrate species fell by nearly a third on average between 1970 and 1996 , nearly a quarter of all plant species are estimated to be threatened with extinction .
in the last 110 years , india 's wild tiger population has fallen by over 97.5 percent thanks to poaching and competition for land with humans .
" if business as usual continues , one can expect them -lrb- tigers -rrb- to be all extinct by 2025 , " says dr ashok khosla , president of the international union for conservation of nature -lrb- iucn -rrb- , the organization which catalogues the world 's species in its so-called ' red lists . '
another example which khosla likes to cite from his native india is the sudden plunge in vulture populations in south asia , which saw the birds ' population drop from 40 million to 60,000 within a decade of the year 1992 .
" it was discovered that a hormone fed to cattle for more milk was getting into the vultures … within eight years governments in india and nepal and elsewhere had taken - luckily for us - action to stop the decline , but they were down to virtually extinct , " khosla said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the only known medication for childhood leukaemia comes from this threatened flower a human-shaped footprint the drivers for the loss of biodiversity can all be traced – directly or indirectly – to humans .
the principle pressures include habitat change -lrb- think monocultures and clear-felling -rrb- , overexploitation -lrb- consider the ocean 's fish stocks -rrb- , pollution , invasive alien species -lrb- whose advances into new territories are usually abetted by people -rrb- and climate change .
in stark contrast to most of our fellow tenants on this planet , the human population has exploded in the last century .
in 1900 , the world 's population was 1.6 billion people .
today it is roughly 6.9 billion and expected to rise to nine billion by 2050 .
we 've also been consuming more .
according to this year 's consumption report by the world watch institute , the average american consumes six times as much today as he did in 1960 .
our numbers and behavior already suck up the resources of 1.4 planets , says the global footprint network .
according to its ' moderate ' business as usual trends , we will need two planets to sustain us by 2050 .
these figures have led to a growing sense of alarm in some quarters , and mounting calls for radical change . " it takes by our collective bio-capacity at the moment 18 months to provide 12 months of natural goods and services , and it 's heading in the wrong direction , " says andrew simms , a policy director at the new economics foundation , a green-oriented think tank .
" so if we ask ourselves if orthodox price mechanisms are working at the moment , well obviously they 're not , because they 're not turning things around . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank economist pavan sukhdev is auditing nature services rendered if living beyond our natural means comes with a cost , then putting a figure on that cost is the difficult job of pavan sukhdev , an economist at deutsche bank .
the banker is on loan to the united nations environment program where he runs a study called the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity -lrb- teeb -rrb- .
the idea grew out of the stern report of 2006 which laid out the economic case for tackling climate change .
" economics today is the currency of policy , " sukhdev told a recent biodiversity conference . " no matter how strong , no matter how emotive , no matter how powerful and no matter how human your arguments to do anything in this world , we are at a stage today where you will also be asked for economic justification .
so whether you like it or not – indeed whether i like it or not – there will be a case of tradeoffs being evaluated . "
from pollinating crops – a service worth up to seven billion dollars in the us , according to studies there – to wetlands ' capacity to mitigate storm damage , there are myriad ways that ecosystems provide services not factored into our economies .
nine-out-of-ten new medicines is derived from something found in nature .
according to teeb 's interim report , we are sacrificing 1.3 to 3.1 trillion euros -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- worth of ecosystems services every year as our economies continue to treat the environment as an ' externality . '
to put that in perspective , that 's up to twice the cost of failing to tackle climate change .
or to put it another way , it 's the financial crisis every three years .
yet even some potential allies remain wary of the drive to a market solution .
" we 're faced with what i would call the paradox of environmental economics , " said andrew simms .
" how , for example , would you put a price on the marginal ton of carbon , which when burnt , puts us on a path to runaway climate change ?
you 're basically asking ' what is the price of civilization ? '
even if a market allowed for the trading of that ton of carbon , i would argue that it should not be allowed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrew simms is concerned about the distinction between value and price squaring the circle nevertheless , if teeb 's aim is to rouse decision-makers to action out of concern for their state coffers , then there are signs that it 's bearing fruit .
this year 's green week -lrb- 1-4 june -rrb- , an annual environment conference organized by the european union , was dedicated to the issue of biodiversity , and the bloc 's executive used the event to announce two new tools aimed at halting biodiversity loss .
recognizing the need for accurate information , the bloc 's executive and the european environment agency unveiled a centralized clearing house for data called bise – the biodiversity information system for europe . taking a page out of the climate change play-book , they also established a " biodiversity baseline " , which will be used to offer a snapshot of trends and measure progress on goals .
but as useful as the common starting point of 1990 levels of carbon emissions has been for climate action , how do you make a baseline for something as complex as biodiversity ?
the eu 's initial groping efforts have produced a five-page brochure with 15 charts .
though it 's not as intuitively clear as a target for cutting emissions , it is an important step that will " help us review our actions and take tangible new measures , " according to environment commissioner janez potocnik .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could european farmers be paid to make wildlife reserves ?
rethinking the cap and other innovative ideas may be on their way .
the eu 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- – a 50-billion-euro-a-year program of farm subsidies – has long been controversial for its distortion of trade and impact on developing countries .
there are now mounting calls to pay famers the money for habitat restoration instead , and at a fraction of the cost . a recent policy paper by the european centre for international political economy found that " substantial " environmental gains could be secured at half the cost of the current cap .
yet reforming agriculture – a sector that eats up half the eu 's budget – has always been a quagmire , despite the optimistic view , on the part of the eu 's most senior environmental bureaucrat , that things are beginning to change .
" we will definitely see support for agriculture tied more and more – i ca n't say exclusively – to respect for the environment , and ecologically friendlier forms of production , " karl falkenberg , director general of the environment commission , told deutsche welle .
in any event , europe will have to move fast if it is to have any shot at halting - and reversing - the loss of biodiversity , as it aims to do by 2020 .
like every region in the world , it failed to meet this year 's deadline to halt biodiversity loss , a target laid down with no baseline , little information and no sub-targets in 2002 .
the next goals will be set internationally when the global community gathers in nagoya in october for the next convention on biological diversity conference .
if europe and the world is to avoid another ground hog day , then political leaders will need to find the attention spans – and stomachs – to deal with ' two ' environmental crises at once .

could pricing the earth be the way to save it – and ourselves ? great extinctions come and go .
the earth has experienced five in the last half-a-billion years , and a number of lesser extinctions as well .
usually , they 're unleashed by a cataclysmic event – an asteroid impact or a super volcano .
scientists speculate that sometimes they 've been triggered by gradual changes in the earth 's atmosphere .
but what makes the so-called ' sixth great extinction ' distinctive is us .
this time around we are present to witness it .
we also happen to be driving it . according to the latest global biodiversity outlook released last month , extinction rates may be up to 1,000 times higher than the background rate – the normal pace of extinction that has accompanied evolution on earth .
bleak outlook bildunterschrift : tigers are set to become extinct in the wild in 15 years the decline is happening across the spectrum of life .
species are disappearing ; genetic variety – a safeguard against disease – is being lost ; and whole ecosystems , whose processes provide everything from habitats to the quality of our air , water and soils , are retreating .
some are faring worse than others .
amphibians face the greatest risk and corals are deteriorating most rapidly .
while the number of vertebrate species fell by nearly a third on average between 1970 and 1996 , nearly a quarter of all plant species are estimated to be threatened with extinction .
in the last 110 years , india 's wild tiger population has fallen by over 97.5 percent thanks to poaching and competition for land with humans .
" if business as usual continues , one can expect them -lrb- tigers -rrb- to be all extinct by 2025 , " says dr ashok khosla , president of the international union for conservation of nature -lrb- iucn -rrb- , the organization which catalogues the world 's species in its so-called ' red lists . '
another example which khosla likes to cite from his native india is the sudden plunge in vulture populations in south asia , which saw the birds ' population drop from 40 million to 60,000 within a decade of the year 1992 .
" it was discovered that a hormone fed to cattle for more milk was getting into the vultures … within eight years governments in india and nepal and elsewhere had taken - luckily for us - action to stop the decline , but they were down to virtually extinct , " khosla said .

in stark contrast to most of our fellow tenants on this planet , the human population has exploded in the last century .
in 1900 , the world 's population was 1.6 billion people .
today it is roughly 6.9 billion and expected to rise to nine billion by 2050 .

could pricing the earth be the way to save it – and ourselves ? great extinctions come and go .
the earth has experienced five in the last half-a-billion years , and a number of lesser extinctions as well .
usually , they 're unleashed by a cataclysmic event – an asteroid impact or a super volcano .
scientists speculate that sometimes they 've been triggered by gradual changes in the earth 's atmosphere .
but what makes the so-called ' sixth great extinction ' distinctive is us .
this time around we are present to witness it .
we also happen to be driving it . according to the latest global biodiversity outlook released last month , extinction rates may be up to 1,000 times higher than the background rate – the normal pace of extinction that has accompanied evolution on earth .
bleak outlook bildunterschrift : tigers are set to become extinct in the wild in 15 years the decline is happening across the spectrum of life .
species are disappearing ; genetic variety – a safeguard against disease – is being lost ; and whole ecosystems , whose processes provide everything from habitats to the quality of our air , water and soils , are retreating .
some are faring worse than others .
amphibians face the greatest risk and corals are deteriorating most rapidly .
while the number of vertebrate species fell by nearly a third on average between 1970 and 1996 , nearly a quarter of all plant species are estimated to be threatened with extinction .
in the last 110 years , india 's wild tiger population has fallen by over 97.5 percent thanks to poaching and competition for land with humans .
" if business as usual continues , one can expect them -lrb- tigers -rrb- to be all extinct by 2025 , " says dr ashok khosla , president of the international union for conservation of nature -lrb- iucn -rrb- , the organization which catalogues the world 's species in its so-called ' red lists . '
another example which khosla likes to cite from his native india is the sudden plunge in vulture populations in south asia , which saw the birds ' population drop from 40 million to 60,000 within a decade of the year 1992 .
" it was discovered that a hormone fed to cattle for more milk was getting into the vultures … within eight years governments in india and nepal and elsewhere had taken - luckily for us - action to stop the decline , but they were down to virtually extinct , " khosla said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the only known medication for childhood leukaemia comes from this threatened flower a human-shaped footprint the drivers for the loss of biodiversity can all be traced – directly or indirectly – to humans .
the principle pressures include habitat change -lrb- think monocultures and clear-felling -rrb- , overexploitation -lrb- consider the ocean 's fish stocks -rrb- , pollution , invasive alien species -lrb- whose advances into new territories are usually abetted by people -rrb- and climate change .
in stark contrast to most of our fellow tenants on this planet , the human population has exploded in the last century .
in 1900 , the world 's population was 1.6 billion people .
today it is roughly 6.9 billion and expected to rise to nine billion by 2050 .
we 've also been consuming more .
according to this year 's consumption report by the world watch institute , the average american consumes six times as much today as he did in 1960 .
our numbers and behavior already suck up the resources of 1.4 planets , says the global footprint network .
according to its ' moderate ' business as usual trends , we will need two planets to sustain us by 2050 .
these figures have led to a growing sense of alarm in some quarters , and mounting calls for radical change . " it takes by our collective bio-capacity at the moment 18 months to provide 12 months of natural goods and services , and it 's heading in the wrong direction , " says andrew simms , a policy director at the new economics foundation , a green-oriented think tank .
" so if we ask ourselves if orthodox price mechanisms are working at the moment , well obviously they 're not , because they 're not turning things around . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank economist pavan sukhdev is auditing nature services rendered if living beyond our natural means comes with a cost , then putting a figure on that cost is the difficult job of pavan sukhdev , an economist at deutsche bank .
the banker is on loan to the united nations environment program where he runs a study called the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity -lrb- teeb -rrb- .
the idea grew out of the stern report of 2006 which laid out the economic case for tackling climate change .
" economics today is the currency of policy , " sukhdev told a recent biodiversity conference . " no matter how strong , no matter how emotive , no matter how powerful and no matter how human your arguments to do anything in this world , we are at a stage today where you will also be asked for economic justification .
so whether you like it or not – indeed whether i like it or not – there will be a case of tradeoffs being evaluated . "
from pollinating crops – a service worth up to seven billion dollars in the us , according to studies there – to wetlands ' capacity to mitigate storm damage , there are myriad ways that ecosystems provide services not factored into our economies .
nine-out-of-ten new medicines is derived from something found in nature .
according to teeb 's interim report , we are sacrificing 1.3 to 3.1 trillion euros -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- worth of ecosystems services every year as our economies continue to treat the environment as an ' externality . '
to put that in perspective , that 's up to twice the cost of failing to tackle climate change .
or to put it another way , it 's the financial crisis every three years .
yet even some potential allies remain wary of the drive to a market solution .
" we 're faced with what i would call the paradox of environmental economics , " said andrew simms .
" how , for example , would you put a price on the marginal ton of carbon , which when burnt , puts us on a path to runaway climate change ?
you 're basically asking ' what is the price of civilization ? '
even if a market allowed for the trading of that ton of carbon , i would argue that it should not be allowed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrew simms is concerned about the distinction between value and price squaring the circle nevertheless , if teeb 's aim is to rouse decision-makers to action out of concern for their state coffers , then there are signs that it 's bearing fruit .
this year 's green week -lrb- 1-4 june -rrb- , an annual environment conference organized by the european union , was dedicated to the issue of biodiversity , and the bloc 's executive used the event to announce two new tools aimed at halting biodiversity loss .
recognizing the need for accurate information , the bloc 's executive and the european environment agency unveiled a centralized clearing house for data called bise – the biodiversity information system for europe . taking a page out of the climate change play-book , they also established a " biodiversity baseline " , which will be used to offer a snapshot of trends and measure progress on goals .
but as useful as the common starting point of 1990 levels of carbon emissions has been for climate action , how do you make a baseline for something as complex as biodiversity ?
the eu 's initial groping efforts have produced a five-page brochure with 15 charts .
though it 's not as intuitively clear as a target for cutting emissions , it is an important step that will " help us review our actions and take tangible new measures , " according to environment commissioner janez potocnik .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could european farmers be paid to make wildlife reserves ?
rethinking the cap and other innovative ideas may be on their way .
the eu 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- – a 50-billion-euro-a-year program of farm subsidies – has long been controversial for its distortion of trade and impact on developing countries .
there are now mounting calls to pay famers the money for habitat restoration instead , and at a fraction of the cost . a recent policy paper by the european centre for international political economy found that " substantial " environmental gains could be secured at half the cost of the current cap .
yet reforming agriculture – a sector that eats up half the eu 's budget – has always been a quagmire , despite the optimistic view , on the part of the eu 's most senior environmental bureaucrat , that things are beginning to change .
" we will definitely see support for agriculture tied more and more – i ca n't say exclusively – to respect for the environment , and ecologically friendlier forms of production , " karl falkenberg , director general of the environment commission , told deutsche welle .
in any event , europe will have to move fast if it is to have any shot at halting - and reversing - the loss of biodiversity , as it aims to do by 2020 .
like every region in the world , it failed to meet this year 's deadline to halt biodiversity loss , a target laid down with no baseline , little information and no sub-targets in 2002 .
the next goals will be set internationally when the global community gathers in nagoya in october for the next convention on biological diversity conference .
if europe and the world is to avoid another ground hog day , then political leaders will need to find the attention spans – and stomachs – to deal with ' two ' environmental crises at once .

could pricing the earth be the way to save it – and ourselves ? great extinctions come and go .
the earth has experienced five in the last half-a-billion years , and a number of lesser extinctions as well .
usually , they 're unleashed by a cataclysmic event – an asteroid impact or a super volcano .
scientists speculate that sometimes they 've been triggered by gradual changes in the earth 's atmosphere .
but what makes the so-called ' sixth great extinction ' distinctive is us .
this time around we are present to witness it .
we also happen to be driving it . according to the latest global biodiversity outlook released last month , extinction rates may be up to 1,000 times higher than the background rate – the normal pace of extinction that has accompanied evolution on earth .
bleak outlook bildunterschrift : tigers are set to become extinct in the wild in 15 years the decline is happening across the spectrum of life .
species are disappearing ; genetic variety – a safeguard against disease – is being lost ; and whole ecosystems , whose processes provide everything from habitats to the quality of our air , water and soils , are retreating .
some are faring worse than others .
amphibians face the greatest risk and corals are deteriorating most rapidly .
while the number of vertebrate species fell by nearly a third on average between 1970 and 1996 , nearly a quarter of all plant species are estimated to be threatened with extinction .
in the last 110 years , india 's wild tiger population has fallen by over 97.5 percent thanks to poaching and competition for land with humans .
" if business as usual continues , one can expect them -lrb- tigers -rrb- to be all extinct by 2025 , " says dr ashok khosla , president of the international union for conservation of nature -lrb- iucn -rrb- , the organization which catalogues the world 's species in its so-called ' red lists . '
another example which khosla likes to cite from his native india is the sudden plunge in vulture populations in south asia , which saw the birds ' population drop from 40 million to 60,000 within a decade of the year 1992 .
" it was discovered that a hormone fed to cattle for more milk was getting into the vultures … within eight years governments in india and nepal and elsewhere had taken - luckily for us - action to stop the decline , but they were down to virtually extinct , " khosla said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the only known medication for childhood leukaemia comes from this threatened flower a human-shaped footprint the drivers for the loss of biodiversity can all be traced – directly or indirectly – to humans .
the principle pressures include habitat change -lrb- think monocultures and clear-felling -rrb- , overexploitation -lrb- consider the ocean 's fish stocks -rrb- , pollution , invasive alien species -lrb- whose advances into new territories are usually abetted by people -rrb- and climate change .
in stark contrast to most of our fellow tenants on this planet , the human population has exploded in the last century .
in 1900 , the world 's population was 1.6 billion people .
today it is roughly 6.9 billion and expected to rise to nine billion by 2050 .
we 've also been consuming more .
according to this year 's consumption report by the world watch institute , the average american consumes six times as much today as he did in 1960 .
our numbers and behavior already suck up the resources of 1.4 planets , says the global footprint network .
according to its ' moderate ' business as usual trends , we will need two planets to sustain us by 2050 .
these figures have led to a growing sense of alarm in some quarters , and mounting calls for radical change . " it takes by our collective bio-capacity at the moment 18 months to provide 12 months of natural goods and services , and it 's heading in the wrong direction , " says andrew simms , a policy director at the new economics foundation , a green-oriented think tank .
" so if we ask ourselves if orthodox price mechanisms are working at the moment , well obviously they 're not , because they 're not turning things around . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank economist pavan sukhdev is auditing nature services rendered if living beyond our natural means comes with a cost , then putting a figure on that cost is the difficult job of pavan sukhdev , an economist at deutsche bank .
the banker is on loan to the united nations environment program where he runs a study called the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity -lrb- teeb -rrb- .
the idea grew out of the stern report of 2006 which laid out the economic case for tackling climate change .
" economics today is the currency of policy , " sukhdev told a recent biodiversity conference . " no matter how strong , no matter how emotive , no matter how powerful and no matter how human your arguments to do anything in this world , we are at a stage today where you will also be asked for economic justification .
so whether you like it or not – indeed whether i like it or not – there will be a case of tradeoffs being evaluated . "
from pollinating crops – a service worth up to seven billion dollars in the us , according to studies there – to wetlands ' capacity to mitigate storm damage , there are myriad ways that ecosystems provide services not factored into our economies .
nine-out-of-ten new medicines is derived from something found in nature .
according to teeb 's interim report , we are sacrificing 1.3 to 3.1 trillion euros -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- worth of ecosystems services every year as our economies continue to treat the environment as an ' externality . '
to put that in perspective , that 's up to twice the cost of failing to tackle climate change .
or to put it another way , it 's the financial crisis every three years .
yet even some potential allies remain wary of the drive to a market solution .
" we 're faced with what i would call the paradox of environmental economics , " said andrew simms .
" how , for example , would you put a price on the marginal ton of carbon , which when burnt , puts us on a path to runaway climate change ?
you 're basically asking ' what is the price of civilization ? '
even if a market allowed for the trading of that ton of carbon , i would argue that it should not be allowed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrew simms is concerned about the distinction between value and price squaring the circle nevertheless , if teeb 's aim is to rouse decision-makers to action out of concern for their state coffers , then there are signs that it 's bearing fruit .
this year 's green week -lrb- 1-4 june -rrb- , an annual environment conference organized by the european union , was dedicated to the issue of biodiversity , and the bloc 's executive used the event to announce two new tools aimed at halting biodiversity loss .
recognizing the need for accurate information , the bloc 's executive and the european environment agency unveiled a centralized clearing house for data called bise – the biodiversity information system for europe . taking a page out of the climate change play-book , they also established a " biodiversity baseline " , which will be used to offer a snapshot of trends and measure progress on goals .
but as useful as the common starting point of 1990 levels of carbon emissions has been for climate action , how do you make a baseline for something as complex as biodiversity ?
the eu 's initial groping efforts have produced a five-page brochure with 15 charts .
though it 's not as intuitively clear as a target for cutting emissions , it is an important step that will " help us review our actions and take tangible new measures , " according to environment commissioner janez potocnik .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could european farmers be paid to make wildlife reserves ?
rethinking the cap and other innovative ideas may be on their way .
the eu 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- – a 50-billion-euro-a-year program of farm subsidies – has long been controversial for its distortion of trade and impact on developing countries .
there are now mounting calls to pay famers the money for habitat restoration instead , and at a fraction of the cost . a recent policy paper by the european centre for international political economy found that " substantial " environmental gains could be secured at half the cost of the current cap .
yet reforming agriculture – a sector that eats up half the eu 's budget – has always been a quagmire , despite the optimistic view , on the part of the eu 's most senior environmental bureaucrat , that things are beginning to change .
" we will definitely see support for agriculture tied more and more – i ca n't say exclusively – to respect for the environment , and ecologically friendlier forms of production , " karl falkenberg , director general of the environment commission , told deutsche welle .
in any event , europe will have to move fast if it is to have any shot at halting - and reversing - the loss of biodiversity , as it aims to do by 2020 .
like every region in the world , it failed to meet this year 's deadline to halt biodiversity loss , a target laid down with no baseline , little information and no sub-targets in 2002 .
the next goals will be set internationally when the global community gathers in nagoya in october for the next convention on biological diversity conference .
if europe and the world is to avoid another ground hog day , then political leaders will need to find the attention spans – and stomachs – to deal with ' two ' environmental crises at once .

like every region in the world , it failed to meet this year 's deadline to halt biodiversity loss , a target laid down with no baseline , little information and no sub-targets in 2002 .
the next goals will be set internationally when the global community gathers in nagoya in october for the next convention on biological diversity conference .
if europe and the world is to avoid another ground hog day , then political leaders will need to find the attention spans – and stomachs – to deal with ' two ' environmental crises at once .

it comes the day after a leading bishop in turkey was murdered . pope benedict xvi said on friday he hoped cyprus ' divided greek and turkish communities could find " the desire to live in harmony " to reach peace .
the island has been divided along ethnic lines since 1974 when turkish troops occupied its northern third in response to a greek cypriot coup seeking union with greece .
president demetris christofias , who heads the greek cypriot community , told the pontiff that the island was " in need of your prayers . "
" cyprus is in need of your words of peace , given the difficult situation the island is facing in its occupied are , " christofias added .
the three-day trip is benedict 's first to a majority orthodox country , and comes amid desires to warm relations between the catholic and eastern orthodox churches .
bishop ’ s murder should ‘ not harm islam dialogue ’ during his visit , the pope will present a working document on regional issues , ahead of a meeting of middle east bishops in october .
among the bishops scheduled to attend the synod was luigi padovese , a leading catholic bishop in turkey who was murdered on thursday .
the pope spoke of his " profound sadness " over the stabbing .
he said the killing should not be allowed to hurt dialog with islam or stain the image of turkey and its people .
" we must not attribute this to turkey or to turks ... the certain thing is that it was not a political or religious assassination .
it was a personal thing , " benedict said. cb / reuters / afp / dpa editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with more and more areas transforming into homogenized yuppy-villes , is this the death of kiezkultur ? berliners , so proud of their poverty and punkish attitude to life , find it easy to sneer at yuppies .
and , given that i am not especially materialistic either , i guess i do too .
i do n't have a car , i could n't care a toffee about designer labels and i currently own but two pairs of shoes .
each month is a constant exercise in flying by the seat of my pants when it comes to paying the rent and so long as there 's enough money in the bank for milk and cigarettes , i 'm relatively content . you can therefore imagine that splashy displays of affluence are something that i tend to find rather vulgar .
and i am not the only one .
berliners hate it too .
especially when their tumbledown , graffiti-riddled neighborhoods end up being gutted , sanitized and then invaded by a bizarre species created via stepford wives and l.a. law cross-pollination . the process of gentrification has been striding forward mercilessly since the berlin wall fell back in 1989 .
as many ex-gdr citizens headed for the bright lights of the west , eager capitalists soon swooped down on the former heart of german socialism , bought up the empty properties and began transforming neighborhoods wholesale .
and it has n't stopped since .
the creative bohemians in the city have packed their easels and moved to successive districts to stay ahead of the gentrification tide .
i mean , if you make your meager living selling anti-something-or-other political art , why would you want to live next door to some stuffy doctor and his bland wife ? newcomers bring energy to berlin aside from being rather dreary , your slightly more upper crust neighbors might pose a more serious threat than just ruining your street cred .
what makes a neighborhood , or kiez ?
the people certainly , but also the wacky little shops , the open-all-hours boozer and the night clubs .
move in mr and mrs dull , formerly of conservativeville , who think it 's rather amusing to live in a bombed-out ruin in prenzlauer berg because it 's so " arty " and by the end of week one they 're sending for the police and complaining about the noise . it 's happened time and again ; moaning neighbors and rising rents have seen the demise of berlin heavyweight clubs like rio and scala and seen venues like king kong , once famed for it 's nightly live music roster , have its assets stripped and only do gigs on weekends .
the famous off-location parties - guerilla affairs set up in some basement somewhere - happen less and less often simply because the basements are now all graphic design companies and law firms .
if you want to party in a basement , you have to go to the spandau district now . but is it all bad news ?
not necessarily .
ellen allien , dj and founder of label bpitch control , recently said in an interview with flavorwire : " a lot of times people move to the city for just three years or something and then they go back to america or italy or whatever .
but they bring the impact , the energy .
that 's really good for the scene , because we have all these new people doing something , trying something .
that 's why the music scene here is super dynamic . " but she also warned that " rich people just visiting for the weekend " are what is " killing the city .
but as long as people keep moving here , berlin will remain cool . " a common fate for capital cities it seems not a week goes by these days without some anti-gentrification demo taking place somewhere in berlin .
prenzlauer berg and mitte , once grim east berlin wastelands , are now lost to the yuppies so the fight is on to stem the flow before kreuzberg , friedrichshain and neukoelln go the same way .
take a quick peek at the non-political website brennende-autos.de and you 'll see that the current trend for torching a fancy motor as a symbolic " f * * k you " to the yuppies all takes place within the central districts mentioned above - such is the feeling of territorialism in these areas . the wave of transforming an area into something upmarket and appealing to people with higher-end incomes , is something which has already wrecked a number of the world 's capitals . " gentrification can certainly be an enormous problem for nightlife and a city 's creative essence , " dj and journalist jonty skrufff told me .
" you only have to look at new york and london and how their club scenes have been watered down , marginalized and ruined by rich incomers to understand what can happen , " he told me . now that london has become expensive and the trend-setting clubs have closed , " horrible expensive bars have moved in and every weekend hordes of drunken office workers descend on the area making it unpleasant for the few freaks left who previously made the area so interesting and creative , " he added . a lose-lose situation djs , freaks and flamboyant queers hate the gentrification " afflicting " their once bohemian neighborhoods ; real estate companies and housing associations think they are making the area more pleasant for everyone .
it 's a lose-lose situation , as the two sides of the argument are both valid and can not be reconciled .
gentrification , beautification , sanitation ; whatever you want to call it , the floodgates opened years ago and it 's unlikely to stop anytime soon .
the process will only reach an end once all the creativity and quirkiness which makes berlin berlin has been squeezed out .
sad but true . as for me ?
well , i never much cared for fashion to the extent that it should dictate which street i live in .
my needs are very simple ; so long as there 's somewhere to lock my bike and buy coffee and cigarettes , i 'm happy .
i do n't really care if my neighbors are lefty anarchists or sharp-suited architects because , at the end of the day , i hate everyone in equal measure anyway . the incurably grumpy gavin blackburn currently lives in kreuzberg , above a cigarette kiosk . editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the host nation is hoping to reap the same benefits germany did four years ago . south africa is abuzz with activity with just one week to go to the kick-off of the 2010 fifa world cup in johannesburg on june 11 .
from transport and tourist arrangements to stadiums and soccer , officials and entrepreneurs in south africa 's nine host cities have been finalizing their arrangements to ensure the country is ready for the long-awaited football extravaganza .
they 've been drawing on the experience of germany , which hosted the 2006 competition .
although germany failed to lift the trophy , the country did win in other respects : its international image received a massive boost and consumer confidence shot up .
this time round , south africa is keen to reap the same benefits .
the country has taken a risk by investing billions of euros in infrastructure , stadiums and roads in preparation for the big event .
the goal is to increase foreign tourism , trade and investment long after the final whistle is blown .
nikolaus eberl , a german branding expert who is in south africa to help the country with its marketing and branding ahead of the 2010 competition , believes south africa can learn from germany , which rebranded itself as a " welcoming , fun , modern and innovative nation " during the last world cup .
" germans took a hard look at their image as ' effective but unfriendly , " ' he said .
" and then devised a nation-building strategy that promised the world ' a time to make friends . " '
the strategy paid off and tourism shot up 31 percent soon after the end of the world cup .
unemployment also dropped and exports increased . bildunterschrift : germany 's international image improved dramatically as fans reveled at the last world cup success not confined to the pitch in his book , " brand ovation - how germany won the world cup of nation branding , " eberl says 91 percent of visitors to germany 's world cup recommended the country as a holiday destination and depicted germans as " open-minded , friendly and welcoming . "
germany also propelled itself from seventh to second most valued brand in the 2006 nation brands index -lrb- anholt-gmi q3/2006 -rrb- .
south africa is hoping to pick up where germany left off through its " welcoming the world to africa " slogan , backed up by a range of initiatives .

" i knew i wanted to be part of this , " said sharon banda , another volunteer .

' brand advocates ' make up for drop in expected visitors football fever has been rising as the tournament draws closer .
in johannesburg and other cities , south african flags and those of the 32 nations competing in the world cup are flying from car windows - and the excitement is palpable .
initially south africa had estimated that 400,000 visitors would be coming to the country for the world cup .
however , south africa 's tourism minister , marthinus van schalkwyk , announced that closer to 300,000 fans were expected from across the globe .
while the direct numbers may be down , eberl estimates that for each visitor to the world cup , another 150 will be indirectly influenced in their perceptions about the host country , through word-of-mouth by the fans when they return home . and these brand advocates could hold the key to long-term benefits for south africa .
bildunterschrift : the most important branding south africa is hoping for will come from the fans themselves south africa is also banking on the global television coverage it gets when matches are screened worldwide .
the world cup offers south africa the opportunity to market the country as a business destination and a springboard into developing markets in the southern african region .
matthias boddenberg , chief executive of the southern african german chamber of commerce , said south africa should focus on promoting trade and investment in areas like mining and energy , particularly the use of renewable energy and exports from its manufacturing sector .
" south africa is a beautiful country offering unbelievable opportunities , " he said .
" but it is also a country facing big challenges in terms of inequality and crime .
south africa should not fall into the trap of painting a perfect picture .
the message should be realistic , yet optimistic . "

the country has taken a risk by investing billions of euros in infrastructure , stadiums and roads in preparation for the big event .
the goal is to increase foreign tourism , trade and investment long after the final whistle is blown .
nikolaus eberl , a german branding expert who is in south africa to help the country with its marketing and branding ahead of the 2010 competition , believes south africa can learn from germany , which rebranded itself as a " welcoming , fun , modern and innovative nation " during the last world cup .
" germans took a hard look at their image as ' effective but unfriendly , " ' he said .

however , south africa 's tourism minister , marthinus van schalkwyk , announced that closer to 300,000 fans were expected from across the globe .
while the direct numbers may be down , eberl estimates that for each visitor to the world cup , another 150 will be indirectly influenced in their perceptions about the host country , through word-of-mouth by the fans when they return home . and these brand advocates could hold the key to long-term benefits for south africa .

the fao is pressing for greater action to stem the global increase . the new campaign by the united nations food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- says that by 2050 asia will be facing " enormous challenges " to feed its five billion population .
recent multiple crises have led to a sharp rise in those facing chronic hunger .

the director says it is a declaration of love to indian cinema and indian food but most importantly it is a film that is supposed to make the audience laugh . the swiss director oliver paulus has already made several films but " tandoori love " is his first venture into the bollywood genre . " my very first visit to india about 20 years ago inspired me to make the film , " he told deutsche welle .
" i had a really funny experience while watching a bollywood film in a real countryside cinema .
suddenly there was a scene where the stars were dancing in a little village in switzerland and the whole traffic was blocked and the swiss people seemed to be angry . " i just loved the idea of the indian chaos , the colorfulness , the cheerfulness and the craziness coming to switzerland to a very organized little village and mixing everything up . " a simple plot the plot is simple .
an indian film crew comes to the swiss highlands to shoot a ubiquitous bollywood drama full of emotion and tears . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it all starts when an indian film crew come to the swiss mountains to shoot a bollywood movie - these are the main leads rajah , played by vijay raaz , is the cook .
the spoilt and attractive main female lead in the drama tries to seduce him but he has no interest .
he has a picture of a buxom blonde in his tent to inspire him as he crushes his spices and concocts delicious meals . surprise surprise , on a trip to the supermarket , rajah sees his embodiment of the perfect woman marching right towards him .
he falls head-over-heels for her and immediately declares his love to her in a song . " forget the cheese and the honey , try a little bit of love , " he tells her in perhaps the kitschiest scene of the film -lrb- and there are many -rrb- .
but sonja -lrb- lavinia wilson -rrb- , who is already engaged to the solid but rather boring markus -lrb- martin schick -rrb- , is bewildered and quickly runs away from what she thinks is a tamil refugee . however , this is a movie after all , their paths soon meet again .
rajah quickly finds himself employed at her fiances traditional swiss restaurant , unaware that he and his new boss are in love with the same woman . bildunterschrift : " forget the cheese and the honey , " vijay tells sonja .
" try a little bit of love . " " spiceless but still very very hot " the indian chef starts concocting new dishes for the swiss customers and the disabled dog .
" in india , we do things differently , " he tells him .
" this is swiss-indian style .
a rare combination – spiceless but still very very hot . " the indian-style nouvelle cuisine is visually stunning .
the mouth waters as curries , daals and tandoori chicken are brought to the table .
but when tomatoes and calamari start dancing , the viewer can only laugh .
the director says this was the " main aim of the sequence and of the whole film " . moreover , it fit his wish that " everything should dance .
the typical thing in a bollywood film are the dancing sequences and the songs .
i wanted to have dancing vegetables , dancing cows and dancing farmers .

some 1,600 tribal elders and religious leaders agreed to make peace with the taliban .
but prospects of peace are bleak , says deutsche welle 's ratbil shamel . once again a jirga has come to an end in kabul and once again it has done what the ruling government wanted . namely , it has presented the government 's suggestions as the people 's wishes .
this time , the jirga has handed the government a mandate to enter peace negotiations with the taliban .
it would like hizb-e-islami , the party of the warlord and politician gulbuddin hekmatyar , to be involved as well . the jirga wants the afghan government and the international community to guarantee political and legal security to all those who reject the taliban and al qaeda . the taliban will also be called upon to discuss their demands with kabul and to stop working with the terrorist organization al qaeda .
all fighting parties will be asked to protect the safety and rights of the civilian population instead of putting them in danger .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan delegates walk outside the site of the peace jirga in kabul the demands of the peace jirga are very much in tune with the afghan president 's wishes .
he has been trying to persuade the taliban to come to the negotiating table for at least five years but to little avail .
at first , he could not convince anyone of his idea to integrate moderate taliban back into public life , finding support for it neither at home nor abroad .
but half a decade later , he has succeeded . the population has wanted nothing but peace in over 30 years of war .
in the past nine years , the us and its allies have not been able to solve the problem of the taliban .
now president hamid karzai , amid general helplessness , has eyed his chance to take things into his own hands at last . but he and his advisors know that for there to be longstanding peace in afghanistan , they not only need the us on their side , but also regional big powers such as russia , china and india . there can also be no peace without the close cooperation of pakistan , iran and saudi arabia . all these countries see their fundamental interests threatened by an afghanistan under us influence .
this means that a peace jirga in kabul only makes sense if prior agreements have been made between the us and afghanistan 's neighbors .
however , these have never been made . moreover , the taliban and al qaeda will never be ready to agree to peace in afghanistan as long as there are places they can retreat to abroad and people willing to support them . the taliban and al qaeda leadership want the establishment of a worldwide islamic empire .
they want this world to be cleansed of unbelievers .

it would like hizb-e-islami , the party of the warlord and politician gulbuddin hekmatyar , to be involved as well . the jirga wants the afghan government and the international community to guarantee political and legal security to all those who reject the taliban and al qaeda . the taliban will also be called upon to discuss their demands with kabul and to stop working with the terrorist organization al qaeda .

his assumption will most likely stir up controversy at the deutsche welle global media forum .
brayne will be leading a workshop that looks at the role of the media and reporting on the psychology of climate change .
this year ’ s conference , entitled “ the heat is on – climate change and the media ” , will take place from june 21-23 in bonn .
for brayne , it comes down to the mindset .
“ journalists are no different from businessmen or politicians in their / our inability to respond to the existential threat of climate change and resources depletion , ” he said in an interview with deutsche welle .
“ like all human beings , we respond in ways that are programmed by millions of years of evolution , identifying and meeting immediate needs and indulging immediate greeds , and failing to see these in the context of longer-term survival . ”
he went on to say that unless politicians , business leaders and voters really understand how desperately serious things are , there is no hope of that change .
“ and what is our most powerful tool for determining and changing what people think ?
the media , ” said brayne .
“ paradoxically , by courageously facing and reporting what i believe to be the inevitability of collapse , we might yet avert it .
perhaps . “ brayne became well-known for founding the dart center for journalism and trauma in london .
he was also director of the center until 2008 .
after 30 years of working as a reporter and correspondent for reuters and the bbc – in which team he covered global events like the massacre at tiananmen square in 1989 – he trained to become a psychological therapist .
brayne says that many correspondents in areas of conflict can ’ t forget what they have seen – and he wants to help them . more than 50 individual events in 2010 , the deutsche welle global media forum once again offers more than 50 events including podium discussions and workshops , interactive presentations and exhibitions , networking and interesting side events .
it takes place at the world conference center bonn , close to deutsche welle ’ s headquarters .
deutsche welle is cooperating with many different organizations for this interdisciplinary conference , including the unesco , the united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , the international human dimensions program on global environmental change -lrb- un ihdp / essp -rrb- , eu commission and the world bank , the wuppertal institute , world wildlife fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- , nabu and the climate alliance , the institute for world business kiel , german development institute -lrb- die -rrb- , the center for development research -lrb- zef -rrb- and many others .
co-host of the deutsche welle global media forum is the foundation for international dialogue of the sparkasse in bonn .
the convention is also supported by germany ’ s federal foreign office , the family , women and integration ministry of the german state of north rhine-westphalia , european funds for regional development , the city of bonn , dhl , the ksb group and faber-castell .

dw : germany has joined permanent members of the un security council , which include russia , in calling for sanctions against iran .
what aspects of the dispute with iran will the two leaders be discussing .
alexander rahr : angela merkel stands clearly on the us position that sanctions against iran are necessary .
we have seen that russia has slightly changed its previously stubborn position on this issue , it is now moving toward western positions .
and the meeting with merkel will probably demonstrate that russia is indeed willing to support more sanctions as it was ready to do a couple of weeks ago .
what has prompted this change on russia 's part ?
russia came to the conclusion that what the west has always said is true that iran is indeed building a nuclear bomb , and that this nuclear bomb will indeed threaten russia .
i think that obama could do more to convince medvedev to join the western anti-iranian coalition , and he did it also by changing his policy on central-eastern europe .
we remember , the united states wanted to install anti-missile defense infrastructure in poland and the czech republic , but russia feels threatened by that .
and out of this threat and out of this conflict which arose with the united states , russia somehow felt sympathetic in a way toward iran .
now the iranian leadership itself has accused russia of being an enemy of iran .
the bridges between tehran and moscow seem to have burned , and that will help russia to make the right decisions , and mrs. merkel will try to move medvedev closer to western positions .
both russia and germany are going to be attending the g-20 meeting in toronto this month , at which financial market regulation will be a key issue .
is there much common ground between berlin and moscow on this issue ?
there is no real common ground because russia is not yet a part of the global financial system as germany and the united states and many other of the g-20 states are .
but russia is very much interested not to go to the summit of the g-20 with an individual position .
it wants to join the position of other states .
it wants to be part of states who could maybe propose certain agendas .
and russia is very much interested in negotiating with germany a kind of pre-position before going to this summit , to have germany on its side when decisions will be taken about the future financial system of the world , about what the probable change of the wto rules , about the world economic system .
it is very important for russia .

there is no real common ground because russia is not yet a part of the global financial system as germany and the united states and many other of the g-20 states are .

it wants to join the position of other states .

deutsche welle spoke with alexander rahr , a russia expert at the german council on foreign relations , about the state of russo-german relations and what is likely to be discussed at the meeting .
dw : germany has joined permanent members of the un security council , which include russia , in calling for sanctions against iran .
what aspects of the dispute with iran will the two leaders be discussing .
alexander rahr : angela merkel stands clearly on the us position that sanctions against iran are necessary .
we have seen that russia has slightly changed its previously stubborn position on this issue , it is now moving toward western positions .
and the meeting with merkel will probably demonstrate that russia is indeed willing to support more sanctions as it was ready to do a couple of weeks ago .
what has prompted this change on russia 's part ?
russia came to the conclusion that what the west has always said is true that iran is indeed building a nuclear bomb , and that this nuclear bomb will indeed threaten russia .
i think that obama could do more to convince medvedev to join the western anti-iranian coalition , and he did it also by changing his policy on central-eastern europe .
we remember , the united states wanted to install anti-missile defense infrastructure in poland and the czech republic , but russia feels threatened by that .
and out of this threat and out of this conflict which arose with the united states , russia somehow felt sympathetic in a way toward iran .
now the iranian leadership itself has accused russia of being an enemy of iran .
the bridges between tehran and moscow seem to have burned , and that will help russia to make the right decisions , and mrs. merkel will try to move medvedev closer to western positions .
both russia and germany are going to be attending the g-20 meeting in toronto this month , at which financial market regulation will be a key issue .

could pricing the earth be the way to save it – and ourselves ? great extinctions come and go .
the earth has experienced five in the last half-a-billion years , and a number of lesser extinctions as well .
usually , they 're unleashed by a cataclysmic event – an asteroid impact or a super volcano .
scientists speculate that sometimes they 've been triggered by gradual changes in the earth 's atmosphere .
but what makes the so-called ' sixth great extinction ' distinctive is us .
this time around we are present to witness it .
we also happen to be driving it . according to the latest global biodiversity outlook released last month , extinction rates may be up to 1,000 times higher than the background rate – the normal pace of extinction that has accompanied evolution on earth .
bleak outlook bildunterschrift : tigers are set to become extinct in the wild in 15 years the decline is happening across the spectrum of life .
species are disappearing ; genetic variety – a safeguard against disease – is being lost ; and whole ecosystems , whose processes provide everything from habitats to the quality of our air , water and soils , are retreating .
some are faring worse than others .
amphibians face the greatest risk and corals are deteriorating most rapidly .
while the number of vertebrate species fell by nearly a third on average between 1970 and 1996 , nearly a quarter of all plant species are estimated to be threatened with extinction .
in the last 110 years , india 's wild tiger population has fallen by over 97.5 percent thanks to poaching and competition for land with humans .

" it was discovered that a hormone fed to cattle for more milk was getting into the vultures … within eight years governments in india and nepal and elsewhere had taken - luckily for us - action to stop the decline , but they were down to virtually extinct , " khosla said .

" we will definitely see support for agriculture tied more and more – i ca n't say exclusively – to respect for the environment , and ecologically friendlier forms of production , " karl falkenberg , director general of the environment commission , told deutsche welle .
in any event , europe will have to move fast if it is to have any shot at halting - and reversing - the loss of biodiversity , as it aims to do by 2020 .
like every region in the world , it failed to meet this year 's deadline to halt biodiversity loss , a target laid down with no baseline , little information and no sub-targets in 2002 .
the next goals will be set internationally when the global community gathers in nagoya in october for the next convention on biological diversity conference .
if europe and the world is to avoid another ground hog day , then political leaders will need to find the attention spans – and stomachs – to deal with ' two ' environmental crises at once .

could pricing the earth be the way to save it – and ourselves ? great extinctions come and go .
the earth has experienced five in the last half-a-billion years , and a number of lesser extinctions as well .
usually , they 're unleashed by a cataclysmic event – an asteroid impact or a super volcano .
scientists speculate that sometimes they 've been triggered by gradual changes in the earth 's atmosphere .
but what makes the so-called ' sixth great extinction ' distinctive is us .
this time around we are present to witness it .
we also happen to be driving it . according to the latest global biodiversity outlook released last month , extinction rates may be up to 1,000 times higher than the background rate – the normal pace of extinction that has accompanied evolution on earth .

could pricing the earth be the way to save it – and ourselves ? great extinctions come and go .
the earth has experienced five in the last half-a-billion years , and a number of lesser extinctions as well .
usually , they 're unleashed by a cataclysmic event – an asteroid impact or a super volcano .
scientists speculate that sometimes they 've been triggered by gradual changes in the earth 's atmosphere .
but what makes the so-called ' sixth great extinction ' distinctive is us .
this time around we are present to witness it .
we also happen to be driving it . according to the latest global biodiversity outlook released last month , extinction rates may be up to 1,000 times higher than the background rate – the normal pace of extinction that has accompanied evolution on earth .
bleak outlook bildunterschrift : tigers are set to become extinct in the wild in 15 years the decline is happening across the spectrum of life .
species are disappearing ; genetic variety – a safeguard against disease – is being lost ; and whole ecosystems , whose processes provide everything from habitats to the quality of our air , water and soils , are retreating .
some are faring worse than others .
amphibians face the greatest risk and corals are deteriorating most rapidly .
while the number of vertebrate species fell by nearly a third on average between 1970 and 1996 , nearly a quarter of all plant species are estimated to be threatened with extinction .
in the last 110 years , india 's wild tiger population has fallen by over 97.5 percent thanks to poaching and competition for land with humans .
" if business as usual continues , one can expect them -lrb- tigers -rrb- to be all extinct by 2025 , " says dr ashok khosla , president of the international union for conservation of nature -lrb- iucn -rrb- , the organization which catalogues the world 's species in its so-called ' red lists . '
another example which khosla likes to cite from his native india is the sudden plunge in vulture populations in south asia , which saw the birds ' population drop from 40 million to 60,000 within a decade of the year 1992 .
" it was discovered that a hormone fed to cattle for more milk was getting into the vultures … within eight years governments in india and nepal and elsewhere had taken - luckily for us - action to stop the decline , but they were down to virtually extinct , " khosla said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the only known medication for childhood leukaemia comes from this threatened flower a human-shaped footprint the drivers for the loss of biodiversity can all be traced – directly or indirectly – to humans .
the principle pressures include habitat change -lrb- think monocultures and clear-felling -rrb- , overexploitation -lrb- consider the ocean 's fish stocks -rrb- , pollution , invasive alien species -lrb- whose advances into new territories are usually abetted by people -rrb- and climate change .
in stark contrast to most of our fellow tenants on this planet , the human population has exploded in the last century .
in 1900 , the world 's population was 1.6 billion people .
today it is roughly 6.9 billion and expected to rise to nine billion by 2050 .
we 've also been consuming more .
according to this year 's consumption report by the world watch institute , the average american consumes six times as much today as he did in 1960 .
our numbers and behavior already suck up the resources of 1.4 planets , says the global footprint network .
according to its ' moderate ' business as usual trends , we will need two planets to sustain us by 2050 .
these figures have led to a growing sense of alarm in some quarters , and mounting calls for radical change . " it takes by our collective bio-capacity at the moment 18 months to provide 12 months of natural goods and services , and it 's heading in the wrong direction , " says andrew simms , a policy director at the new economics foundation , a green-oriented think tank .
" so if we ask ourselves if orthodox price mechanisms are working at the moment , well obviously they 're not , because they 're not turning things around . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank economist pavan sukhdev is auditing nature services rendered if living beyond our natural means comes with a cost , then putting a figure on that cost is the difficult job of pavan sukhdev , an economist at deutsche bank .
the banker is on loan to the united nations environment program where he runs a study called the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity -lrb- teeb -rrb- .
the idea grew out of the stern report of 2006 which laid out the economic case for tackling climate change .
" economics today is the currency of policy , " sukhdev told a recent biodiversity conference . " no matter how strong , no matter how emotive , no matter how powerful and no matter how human your arguments to do anything in this world , we are at a stage today where you will also be asked for economic justification .
so whether you like it or not – indeed whether i like it or not – there will be a case of tradeoffs being evaluated . "
from pollinating crops – a service worth up to seven billion dollars in the us , according to studies there – to wetlands ' capacity to mitigate storm damage , there are myriad ways that ecosystems provide services not factored into our economies .
nine-out-of-ten new medicines is derived from something found in nature .
according to teeb 's interim report , we are sacrificing 1.3 to 3.1 trillion euros -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- worth of ecosystems services every year as our economies continue to treat the environment as an ' externality . '
to put that in perspective , that 's up to twice the cost of failing to tackle climate change .
or to put it another way , it 's the financial crisis every three years .
yet even some potential allies remain wary of the drive to a market solution .
" we 're faced with what i would call the paradox of environmental economics , " said andrew simms .
" how , for example , would you put a price on the marginal ton of carbon , which when burnt , puts us on a path to runaway climate change ?
you 're basically asking ' what is the price of civilization ? '
even if a market allowed for the trading of that ton of carbon , i would argue that it should not be allowed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrew simms is concerned about the distinction between value and price squaring the circle nevertheless , if teeb 's aim is to rouse decision-makers to action out of concern for their state coffers , then there are signs that it 's bearing fruit .
this year 's green week -lrb- 1-4 june -rrb- , an annual environment conference organized by the european union , was dedicated to the issue of biodiversity , and the bloc 's executive used the event to announce two new tools aimed at halting biodiversity loss .
recognizing the need for accurate information , the bloc 's executive and the european environment agency unveiled a centralized clearing house for data called bise – the biodiversity information system for europe . taking a page out of the climate change play-book , they also established a " biodiversity baseline " , which will be used to offer a snapshot of trends and measure progress on goals .
but as useful as the common starting point of 1990 levels of carbon emissions has been for climate action , how do you make a baseline for something as complex as biodiversity ?
the eu 's initial groping efforts have produced a five-page brochure with 15 charts .
though it 's not as intuitively clear as a target for cutting emissions , it is an important step that will " help us review our actions and take tangible new measures , " according to environment commissioner janez potocnik .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could european farmers be paid to make wildlife reserves ?
rethinking the cap and other innovative ideas may be on their way .
the eu 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- – a 50-billion-euro-a-year program of farm subsidies – has long been controversial for its distortion of trade and impact on developing countries .
there are now mounting calls to pay famers the money for habitat restoration instead , and at a fraction of the cost . a recent policy paper by the european centre for international political economy found that " substantial " environmental gains could be secured at half the cost of the current cap .
yet reforming agriculture – a sector that eats up half the eu 's budget – has always been a quagmire , despite the optimistic view , on the part of the eu 's most senior environmental bureaucrat , that things are beginning to change .

" it was discovered that a hormone fed to cattle for more milk was getting into the vultures … within eight years governments in india and nepal and elsewhere had taken - luckily for us - action to stop the decline , but they were down to virtually extinct , " khosla said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the only known medication for childhood leukaemia comes from this threatened flower a human-shaped footprint the drivers for the loss of biodiversity can all be traced – directly or indirectly – to humans .
the principle pressures include habitat change -lrb- think monocultures and clear-felling -rrb- , overexploitation -lrb- consider the ocean 's fish stocks -rrb- , pollution , invasive alien species -lrb- whose advances into new territories are usually abetted by people -rrb- and climate change .
in stark contrast to most of our fellow tenants on this planet , the human population has exploded in the last century .
in 1900 , the world 's population was 1.6 billion people .
today it is roughly 6.9 billion and expected to rise to nine billion by 2050 .
we 've also been consuming more .
according to this year 's consumption report by the world watch institute , the average american consumes six times as much today as he did in 1960 .
our numbers and behavior already suck up the resources of 1.4 planets , says the global footprint network .
according to its ' moderate ' business as usual trends , we will need two planets to sustain us by 2050 .
these figures have led to a growing sense of alarm in some quarters , and mounting calls for radical change . " it takes by our collective bio-capacity at the moment 18 months to provide 12 months of natural goods and services , and it 's heading in the wrong direction , " says andrew simms , a policy director at the new economics foundation , a green-oriented think tank .
" so if we ask ourselves if orthodox price mechanisms are working at the moment , well obviously they 're not , because they 're not turning things around . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank economist pavan sukhdev is auditing nature services rendered if living beyond our natural means comes with a cost , then putting a figure on that cost is the difficult job of pavan sukhdev , an economist at deutsche bank .
the banker is on loan to the united nations environment program where he runs a study called the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity -lrb- teeb -rrb- .
the idea grew out of the stern report of 2006 which laid out the economic case for tackling climate change .
" economics today is the currency of policy , " sukhdev told a recent biodiversity conference . " no matter how strong , no matter how emotive , no matter how powerful and no matter how human your arguments to do anything in this world , we are at a stage today where you will also be asked for economic justification .
so whether you like it or not – indeed whether i like it or not – there will be a case of tradeoffs being evaluated . "
from pollinating crops – a service worth up to seven billion dollars in the us , according to studies there – to wetlands ' capacity to mitigate storm damage , there are myriad ways that ecosystems provide services not factored into our economies .
nine-out-of-ten new medicines is derived from something found in nature .
according to teeb 's interim report , we are sacrificing 1.3 to 3.1 trillion euros -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- worth of ecosystems services every year as our economies continue to treat the environment as an ' externality . '
to put that in perspective , that 's up to twice the cost of failing to tackle climate change .
or to put it another way , it 's the financial crisis every three years .
yet even some potential allies remain wary of the drive to a market solution .
" we 're faced with what i would call the paradox of environmental economics , " said andrew simms .
" how , for example , would you put a price on the marginal ton of carbon , which when burnt , puts us on a path to runaway climate change ?
you 're basically asking ' what is the price of civilization ? '
even if a market allowed for the trading of that ton of carbon , i would argue that it should not be allowed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrew simms is concerned about the distinction between value and price squaring the circle nevertheless , if teeb 's aim is to rouse decision-makers to action out of concern for their state coffers , then there are signs that it 's bearing fruit .
this year 's green week -lrb- 1-4 june -rrb- , an annual environment conference organized by the european union , was dedicated to the issue of biodiversity , and the bloc 's executive used the event to announce two new tools aimed at halting biodiversity loss .
recognizing the need for accurate information , the bloc 's executive and the european environment agency unveiled a centralized clearing house for data called bise – the biodiversity information system for europe . taking a page out of the climate change play-book , they also established a " biodiversity baseline " , which will be used to offer a snapshot of trends and measure progress on goals .
but as useful as the common starting point of 1990 levels of carbon emissions has been for climate action , how do you make a baseline for something as complex as biodiversity ?
the eu 's initial groping efforts have produced a five-page brochure with 15 charts .
though it 's not as intuitively clear as a target for cutting emissions , it is an important step that will " help us review our actions and take tangible new measures , " according to environment commissioner janez potocnik .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could european farmers be paid to make wildlife reserves ?
rethinking the cap and other innovative ideas may be on their way .
the eu 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- – a 50-billion-euro-a-year program of farm subsidies – has long been controversial for its distortion of trade and impact on developing countries .
there are now mounting calls to pay famers the money for habitat restoration instead , and at a fraction of the cost . a recent policy paper by the european centre for international political economy found that " substantial " environmental gains could be secured at half the cost of the current cap .
yet reforming agriculture – a sector that eats up half the eu 's budget – has always been a quagmire , despite the optimistic view , on the part of the eu 's most senior environmental bureaucrat , that things are beginning to change .
" we will definitely see support for agriculture tied more and more – i ca n't say exclusively – to respect for the environment , and ecologically friendlier forms of production , " karl falkenberg , director general of the environment commission , told deutsche welle .
in any event , europe will have to move fast if it is to have any shot at halting - and reversing - the loss of biodiversity , as it aims to do by 2020 .
like every region in the world , it failed to meet this year 's deadline to halt biodiversity loss , a target laid down with no baseline , little information and no sub-targets in 2002 .
the next goals will be set internationally when the global community gathers in nagoya in october for the next convention on biological diversity conference .
if europe and the world is to avoid another ground hog day , then political leaders will need to find the attention spans – and stomachs – to deal with ' two ' environmental crises at once .

german newspaper commentators were divided over her choice . germany 's government has nominated the 50-year-old state premier of lower saxony as its candidate for the nation 's presidency . chancellor angela merkel chose christian wulff to replace president horst koehler as germany 's new head of state after koehler 's surprise resignation earlier this week . across germany , reactions to wulff 's nomination were mixed , with much of the press commentary focusing on who was not chosen for the post - namely merkel 's rumored first-choice candidate , labor minister ursula von der leyen . financial times deutschland asks " christian who ? " and writes the fact that wulff is moving into the presidential palace serves as " a sad piece of evidence for how little wriggle room cdu party leader angela merkel has in her own party . "
the paper goes on to say that merkel 's inability to push through her first-choice candidate was " far more worrisome than the idea of president christian wulff . " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung says koehler 's sudden resignation had lifted the lid on the traditionally rather opaque process by which candidates are chosen .
never before have people been able to get such an insight into the selection process .
the paper says " the fact that ...
merkel could not get her favorite approved discloses the acute weakness that also affects the chancellor . " speaking on the thursday edition of the " maybrit illner " talk show on german state broadcaster zdf , free democrat politician jorge chatzmarkakis said the reason von der leyen was not nominated was because conservative politicians from the mainly catholic south of germany did not like to see two protestant women , i.e. merkel and von der leyen , leading the country . one of germany 's largest broadsheets , sueddeutsche zeitung , says wulff has a tough road ahead of him . " he will have enough to do after his election in order to achieve the gravitas , seriousness and dignity that one expects from a president .
-lsb- finance minister -rsb- wolfgang schaeuble would have already had it . "

human rights experts are calling for action and prosecutions for those responsible . the first global investigation of secret detention facilities conducted by the united nations found that in 66 of 192 un nations , several thousand people have been detained in secret facilities and even tortured since the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the united states .
arbitrary arrests and disappearances , shadowy prisons and criminal interrogation methods were all common practices in earlier centuries , but since the 9/11 attacks , these kinds of violations of international human rights rules have become more and more frequent .
they almost all happen under the guise of preventing terrorism , the 220-page un report said .
included on the list of those countries with secret prisons are three permanent members of the un security council - china , russia and the united states .
they are accompanied by afghanistan , india , pakistan and several african countries as well as european states , such as poland , romania , bosnia-herzegovina and lithuania .
crimes again humanity ?
" secret detention amounts to an enforced disappearance , and if resorted to in a widespread or systematic manner , it might reach the threshold of a crime against humanity , " manfred nowak , the un 's special rapporteur on torture and one of the report 's authors , said during debate on the report on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report 's authors concluded that secret detention ' violates a number of human rights amd humanitarian law norms ' the dimensions of the problem could be even greater than the report lays out .
the detailed questionnaire that nowak , martin scheinin , the un special rapporteur on human rights and counter terrorism , as well as other un experts formulated and sent to the un 's 192 member countries was only answered by 44 .
of these , not one admitted to the existence of secret prisons .
the report 's authors depended on independent sources for their investigation and many countries denied them any kind of access to relevant materials or sources .
denial and censorship during the debate , china , russia , pakistan , sri lanka , syria , algeria and other african nations denied that any secret detention facilities existed on their territory .
they accused the report 's authors of sloppy research , of overstepping their mandate and of compiling the report without being commissioned to do so by the un human rights council .
" we are concerned at the unprofessional way in which the report was written and presented , " said syria 's representative to the council .
" the report makes use of unverified allegations by non-credible parties and presents them as fact . "
in march , pakistan and other nations called for the report , which was scheduled to be discussed then , to be removed from the un agenda , and the belgian president of the council agreed to that demand .
in the meantime , russia and pakistan have asked that the report be removed from the un 's website and that debate around it be terminated .
however , this call for censorship failed in the wake of objections from independent human rights groups .
scant support only a few un states , including sweden , canada and south africa , gave their unreserved approval to the report during the debate of the human rights council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un said " secret detention should be explicitly prohibited " the us ambassador to the un , susan rice , underlined the fact that president barack obama has announced the closing of the us prison at guantanamo bay , cuba , although it was never a secret facility .
however , she made no comment on the bagram facility , the main detention facility for persons detained by us forces in afghanistan , or other formerly secret prisons in third countries where american officials sent prisoners who were then often subjected to harsh interrogation procedures or torture .
the report 's authors called for the immediate closure of all secret detention facilities as well as for compensation for those who were victims of illegal imprisonment and torture .
no former detainee has yet to receive any kind of compensation .
both nowak and scheinin said they hoped that the human rights council would pass a resolution on the matter , although after the debate and opposition to the report , that wish is seen as fairly unrealistic .

human rights experts are calling for action and prosecutions for those responsible . the first global investigation of secret detention facilities conducted by the united nations found that in 66 of 192 un nations , several thousand people have been detained in secret facilities and even tortured since the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the united states .
arbitrary arrests and disappearances , shadowy prisons and criminal interrogation methods were all common practices in earlier centuries , but since the 9/11 attacks , these kinds of violations of international human rights rules have become more and more frequent .
they almost all happen under the guise of preventing terrorism , the 220-page un report said .
included on the list of those countries with secret prisons are three permanent members of the un security council - china , russia and the united states .
they are accompanied by afghanistan , india , pakistan and several african countries as well as european states , such as poland , romania , bosnia-herzegovina and lithuania .
crimes again humanity ?
" secret detention amounts to an enforced disappearance , and if resorted to in a widespread or systematic manner , it might reach the threshold of a crime against humanity , " manfred nowak , the un 's special rapporteur on torture and one of the report 's authors , said during debate on the report on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report 's authors concluded that secret detention ' violates a number of human rights amd humanitarian law norms ' the dimensions of the problem could be even greater than the report lays out .
the detailed questionnaire that nowak , martin scheinin , the un special rapporteur on human rights and counter terrorism , as well as other un experts formulated and sent to the un 's 192 member countries was only answered by 44 .
of these , not one admitted to the existence of secret prisons .
the report 's authors depended on independent sources for their investigation and many countries denied them any kind of access to relevant materials or sources .
denial and censorship during the debate , china , russia , pakistan , sri lanka , syria , algeria and other african nations denied that any secret detention facilities existed on their territory .
they accused the report 's authors of sloppy research , of overstepping their mandate and of compiling the report without being commissioned to do so by the un human rights council .
" we are concerned at the unprofessional way in which the report was written and presented , " said syria 's representative to the council .
" the report makes use of unverified allegations by non-credible parties and presents them as fact . "
in march , pakistan and other nations called for the report , which was scheduled to be discussed then , to be removed from the un agenda , and the belgian president of the council agreed to that demand .
in the meantime , russia and pakistan have asked that the report be removed from the un 's website and that debate around it be terminated .
however , this call for censorship failed in the wake of objections from independent human rights groups .
scant support only a few un states , including sweden , canada and south africa , gave their unreserved approval to the report during the debate of the human rights council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un said " secret detention should be explicitly prohibited " the us ambassador to the un , susan rice , underlined the fact that president barack obama has announced the closing of the us prison at guantanamo bay , cuba , although it was never a secret facility .
however , she made no comment on the bagram facility , the main detention facility for persons detained by us forces in afghanistan , or other formerly secret prisons in third countries where american officials sent prisoners who were then often subjected to harsh interrogation procedures or torture .
the report 's authors called for the immediate closure of all secret detention facilities as well as for compensation for those who were victims of illegal imprisonment and torture .
no former detainee has yet to receive any kind of compensation .
both nowak and scheinin said they hoped that the human rights council would pass a resolution on the matter , although after the debate and opposition to the report , that wish is seen as fairly unrealistic .

his assumption will most likely stir up controversy at the deutsche welle global media forum .
brayne will be leading a workshop that looks at the role of the media and reporting on the psychology of climate change .
this year ’ s conference , entitled “ the heat is on – climate change and the media ” , will take place from june 21-23 in bonn .
for brayne , it comes down to the mindset .
“ journalists are no different from businessmen or politicians in their / our inability to respond to the existential threat of climate change and resources depletion , ” he said in an interview with deutsche welle .
“ like all human beings , we respond in ways that are programmed by millions of years of evolution , identifying and meeting immediate needs and indulging immediate greeds , and failing to see these in the context of longer-term survival . ”
he went on to say that unless politicians , business leaders and voters really understand how desperately serious things are , there is no hope of that change .
“ and what is our most powerful tool for determining and changing what people think ?
the media , ” said brayne .
“ paradoxically , by courageously facing and reporting what i believe to be the inevitability of collapse , we might yet avert it .

his assumption will most likely stir up controversy at the deutsche welle global media forum .
brayne will be leading a workshop that looks at the role of the media and reporting on the psychology of climate change .
this year ’ s conference , entitled “ the heat is on – climate change and the media ” , will take place from june 21-23 in bonn .
for brayne , it comes down to the mindset .
“ journalists are no different from businessmen or politicians in their / our inability to respond to the existential threat of climate change and resources depletion , ” he said in an interview with deutsche welle .
“ like all human beings , we respond in ways that are programmed by millions of years of evolution , identifying and meeting immediate needs and indulging immediate greeds , and failing to see these in the context of longer-term survival . ”
he went on to say that unless politicians , business leaders and voters really understand how desperately serious things are , there is no hope of that change .
“ and what is our most powerful tool for determining and changing what people think ?
the media , ” said brayne .
“ paradoxically , by courageously facing and reporting what i believe to be the inevitability of collapse , we might yet avert it .
perhaps . “ brayne became well-known for founding the dart center for journalism and trauma in london .
he was also director of the center until 2008 .

human rights experts are calling for action and prosecutions for those responsible . the first global investigation of secret detention facilities conducted by the united nations found that in 66 of 192 un nations , several thousand people have been detained in secret facilities and even tortured since the sept .

arbitrary arrests and disappearances , shadowy prisons and criminal interrogation methods were all common practices in earlier centuries , but since the 9/11 attacks , these kinds of violations of international human rights rules have become more and more frequent .
they almost all happen under the guise of preventing terrorism , the 220-page un report said .
included on the list of those countries with secret prisons are three permanent members of the un security council - china , russia and the united states .
they are accompanied by afghanistan , india , pakistan and several african countries as well as european states , such as poland , romania , bosnia-herzegovina and lithuania .
crimes again humanity ?
" secret detention amounts to an enforced disappearance , and if resorted to in a widespread or systematic manner , it might reach the threshold of a crime against humanity , " manfred nowak , the un 's special rapporteur on torture and one of the report 's authors , said during debate on the report on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report 's authors concluded that secret detention ' violates a number of human rights amd humanitarian law norms ' the dimensions of the problem could be even greater than the report lays out .
the detailed questionnaire that nowak , martin scheinin , the un special rapporteur on human rights and counter terrorism , as well as other un experts formulated and sent to the un 's 192 member countries was only answered by 44 .
of these , not one admitted to the existence of secret prisons .
the report 's authors depended on independent sources for their investigation and many countries denied them any kind of access to relevant materials or sources .
denial and censorship during the debate , china , russia , pakistan , sri lanka , syria , algeria and other african nations denied that any secret detention facilities existed on their territory .
they accused the report 's authors of sloppy research , of overstepping their mandate and of compiling the report without being commissioned to do so by the un human rights council .
" we are concerned at the unprofessional way in which the report was written and presented , " said syria 's representative to the council .
" the report makes use of unverified allegations by non-credible parties and presents them as fact . "
in march , pakistan and other nations called for the report , which was scheduled to be discussed then , to be removed from the un agenda , and the belgian president of the council agreed to that demand .
in the meantime , russia and pakistan have asked that the report be removed from the un 's website and that debate around it be terminated .
however , this call for censorship failed in the wake of objections from independent human rights groups .
scant support only a few un states , including sweden , canada and south africa , gave their unreserved approval to the report during the debate of the human rights council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un said " secret detention should be explicitly prohibited " the us ambassador to the un , susan rice , underlined the fact that president barack obama has announced the closing of the us prison at guantanamo bay , cuba , although it was never a secret facility .
however , she made no comment on the bagram facility , the main detention facility for persons detained by us forces in afghanistan , or other formerly secret prisons in third countries where american officials sent prisoners who were then often subjected to harsh interrogation procedures or torture .
the report 's authors called for the immediate closure of all secret detention facilities as well as for compensation for those who were victims of illegal imprisonment and torture .
no former detainee has yet to receive any kind of compensation .
both nowak and scheinin said they hoped that the human rights council would pass a resolution on the matter , although after the debate and opposition to the report , that wish is seen as fairly unrealistic .

the fao is pressing for greater action to stem the global increase . the new campaign by the united nations food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- says that by 2050 asia will be facing " enormous challenges " to feed its five billion population .
recent multiple crises have led to a sharp rise in those facing chronic hunger .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fao hq in rome hiroyuki konuma , fao 's regional chief for asia and the pacific , says more investment is needed because " the crises are still continuing and affecting the populations of the world . " the world 's chronic hungry population has increased very rapidly in the past two years .
it got to 850 million around three to four years ago .
at the end of last year , it reached over one billion .
this is an issue where we need solidarity and all the assistance in the world . " two-thirds of the world 's hungry population in asia the asia and pacific region holds two thirds of the world 's hungry population – 640 million people .
the fao estimates that over 50 million people were pushed into chronic malnutrition in 2009 alone . purushottam k. mudbhary , the head of the fao policy assistance branch , says there are signs of declining global food stocks , which means that food prices have remained at the same high levels of early 2008 . " this is why we need to step up investment in agriculture to increase food production .
and one of the other reasons is that there has not really been a major technical breakthrough like we had during the green revolution , which made a major impact on agricultural production .
the investment in agriculture has to be reinvigorated to stem the tide of this . " countries such as india and china , that are experiencing major gains in economic growth , are seeing a greater demand for high-value products and livestock , which is also putting a strain on food stocks . southeast asia generally better off than south asia " relative to south asia in aggregate terms southeast asia is much better off , " says sumiter broca , an economist with the fao . " but within southeast asia there are countries which are at a lower level of development – myanmar , laos because of the resource constraints and the philippines , where there are major problems . " bildunterschrift : the fao says that foreign investment in agricultural land is creating legal and ethical issues the fao also points to the recent surge of foreign investment in agricultural land .
it says the investment is opening up complex economic , political , institutional , legal and ethical issues and their impact on property rights , rural development , technology and access to land and water . however , the organization also says foreign investment in developing country agriculture could make a contribution to realizing important hunger and poverty-fighting goals . author : ron corben -lrb- bangkok -rrb- editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the director says it is a declaration of love to indian cinema and indian food but most importantly it is a film that is supposed to make the audience laugh . the swiss director oliver paulus has already made several films but " tandoori love " is his first venture into the bollywood genre . " my very first visit to india about 20 years ago inspired me to make the film , " he told deutsche welle .
" i had a really funny experience while watching a bollywood film in a real countryside cinema .
suddenly there was a scene where the stars were dancing in a little village in switzerland and the whole traffic was blocked and the swiss people seemed to be angry . " i just loved the idea of the indian chaos , the colorfulness , the cheerfulness and the craziness coming to switzerland to a very organized little village and mixing everything up . " a simple plot the plot is simple .
an indian film crew comes to the swiss highlands to shoot a ubiquitous bollywood drama full of emotion and tears . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it all starts when an indian film crew come to the swiss mountains to shoot a bollywood movie - these are the main leads rajah , played by vijay raaz , is the cook .
the spoilt and attractive main female lead in the drama tries to seduce him but he has no interest .
he has a picture of a buxom blonde in his tent to inspire him as he crushes his spices and concocts delicious meals . surprise surprise , on a trip to the supermarket , rajah sees his embodiment of the perfect woman marching right towards him .
he falls head-over-heels for her and immediately declares his love to her in a song . " forget the cheese and the honey , try a little bit of love , " he tells her in perhaps the kitschiest scene of the film -lrb- and there are many -rrb- .
but sonja -lrb- lavinia wilson -rrb- , who is already engaged to the solid but rather boring markus -lrb- martin schick -rrb- , is bewildered and quickly runs away from what she thinks is a tamil refugee . however , this is a movie after all , their paths soon meet again .
rajah quickly finds himself employed at her fiances traditional swiss restaurant , unaware that he and his new boss are in love with the same woman . bildunterschrift : " forget the cheese and the honey , " vijay tells sonja .
" try a little bit of love . " " spiceless but still very very hot " the indian chef starts concocting new dishes for the swiss customers and the disabled dog .
" in india , we do things differently , " he tells him .
" this is swiss-indian style .
a rare combination – spiceless but still very very hot . " the indian-style nouvelle cuisine is visually stunning .
the mouth waters as curries , daals and tandoori chicken are brought to the table .
but when tomatoes and calamari start dancing , the viewer can only laugh .
the director says this was the " main aim of the sequence and of the whole film " . moreover , it fit his wish that " everything should dance .
the typical thing in a bollywood film are the dancing sequences and the songs .
i wanted to have dancing vegetables , dancing cows and dancing farmers . " and dancing vegetables , cows and farmers is what the audience gets , as well as dancing men and women , so paulus follows in hindi movie tradition , although he insists " tandoori love " is not a " bollywood film per se . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director wanted everybody in the film to dance - here sonja does a number a love declaration to indian film and food sophia stepf , a dramaturg and cultural trainer with a focus on india , explains that bollywood is popular all over the world because " it has song and dance .
it has great visuals and it has fashion so it 's something that you can watch anywhere in the world and you do n't need to understand the language at all . " to really understand " tandoori love " – not a " real " bollywood film – it helps if you can speak swiss german , hindi and english .
but who can ?
and who exactly is this film for ? " the main target audience is the a western european audience , " says the director .
" it is a film that makes fun of bollywood a bit – not in a bad sense – and uses all the elements i really love .
it 's a love declaration to indian cinema and indian cuisine . " and after all , what better way to spend an evening than with indian cinema and cuisine ? author : anne thomas editor : disha uppal send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the director says it is a declaration of love to indian cinema and indian food but most importantly it is a film that is supposed to make the audience laugh . the swiss director oliver paulus has already made several films but " tandoori love " is his first venture into the bollywood genre . " my very first visit to india about 20 years ago inspired me to make the film , " he told deutsche welle .
" i had a really funny experience while watching a bollywood film in a real countryside cinema .
suddenly there was a scene where the stars were dancing in a little village in switzerland and the whole traffic was blocked and the swiss people seemed to be angry . " i just loved the idea of the indian chaos , the colorfulness , the cheerfulness and the craziness coming to switzerland to a very organized little village and mixing everything up . " a simple plot the plot is simple .
an indian film crew comes to the swiss highlands to shoot a ubiquitous bollywood drama full of emotion and tears . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it all starts when an indian film crew come to the swiss mountains to shoot a bollywood movie - these are the main leads rajah , played by vijay raaz , is the cook .
the spoilt and attractive main female lead in the drama tries to seduce him but he has no interest .
he has a picture of a buxom blonde in his tent to inspire him as he crushes his spices and concocts delicious meals . surprise surprise , on a trip to the supermarket , rajah sees his embodiment of the perfect woman marching right towards him .
he falls head-over-heels for her and immediately declares his love to her in a song . " forget the cheese and the honey , try a little bit of love , " he tells her in perhaps the kitschiest scene of the film -lrb- and there are many -rrb- .
but sonja -lrb- lavinia wilson -rrb- , who is already engaged to the solid but rather boring markus -lrb- martin schick -rrb- , is bewildered and quickly runs away from what she thinks is a tamil refugee . however , this is a movie after all , their paths soon meet again .
rajah quickly finds himself employed at her fiances traditional swiss restaurant , unaware that he and his new boss are in love with the same woman . bildunterschrift : " forget the cheese and the honey , " vijay tells sonja .
" try a little bit of love . " " spiceless but still very very hot " the indian chef starts concocting new dishes for the swiss customers and the disabled dog .
" in india , we do things differently , " he tells him .
" this is swiss-indian style .
a rare combination – spiceless but still very very hot . " the indian-style nouvelle cuisine is visually stunning .
the mouth waters as curries , daals and tandoori chicken are brought to the table .
but when tomatoes and calamari start dancing , the viewer can only laugh .
the director says this was the " main aim of the sequence and of the whole film " . moreover , it fit his wish that " everything should dance .
the typical thing in a bollywood film are the dancing sequences and the songs .
i wanted to have dancing vegetables , dancing cows and dancing farmers . " and dancing vegetables , cows and farmers is what the audience gets , as well as dancing men and women , so paulus follows in hindi movie tradition , although he insists " tandoori love " is not a " bollywood film per se . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director wanted everybody in the film to dance - here sonja does a number a love declaration to indian film and food sophia stepf , a dramaturg and cultural trainer with a focus on india , explains that bollywood is popular all over the world because " it has song and dance .
it has great visuals and it has fashion so it 's something that you can watch anywhere in the world and you do n't need to understand the language at all . " to really understand " tandoori love " – not a " real " bollywood film – it helps if you can speak swiss german , hindi and english .
but who can ?
and who exactly is this film for ? " the main target audience is the a western european audience , " says the director .
" it is a film that makes fun of bollywood a bit – not in a bad sense – and uses all the elements i really love .
it 's a love declaration to indian cinema and indian cuisine .

german newspaper commentators were divided over her choice . germany 's government has nominated the 50-year-old state premier of lower saxony as its candidate for the nation 's presidency . chancellor angela merkel chose christian wulff to replace president horst koehler as germany 's new head of state after koehler 's surprise resignation earlier this week . across germany , reactions to wulff 's nomination were mixed , with much of the press commentary focusing on who was not chosen for the post - namely merkel 's rumored first-choice candidate , labor minister ursula von der leyen . financial times deutschland asks " christian who ? " and writes the fact that wulff is moving into the presidential palace serves as " a sad piece of evidence for how little wriggle room cdu party leader angela merkel has in her own party . "
the paper goes on to say that merkel 's inability to push through her first-choice candidate was " far more worrisome than the idea of president christian wulff . " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung says koehler 's sudden resignation had lifted the lid on the traditionally rather opaque process by which candidates are chosen .
never before have people been able to get such an insight into the selection process .
the paper says " the fact that ...
merkel could not get her favorite approved discloses the acute weakness that also affects the chancellor . " speaking on the thursday edition of the " maybrit illner " talk show on german state broadcaster zdf , free democrat politician jorge chatzmarkakis said the reason von der leyen was not nominated was because conservative politicians from the mainly catholic south of germany did not like to see two protestant women , i.e. merkel and von der leyen , leading the country . one of germany 's largest broadsheets , sueddeutsche zeitung , says wulff has a tough road ahead of him . " he will have enough to do after his election in order to achieve the gravitas , seriousness and dignity that one expects from a president .
-lsb- finance minister -rsb- wolfgang schaeuble would have already had it . "
the paper adds , however , that " because wulff is an experienced party politician , the nomination is not as surprising as it may seem to many at first glance . " the regional daily saechsische zeitung says wulff is a popular state premier in lower saxony .
" most perceive him as a nice , friendly man without any rough edges .
he first began garnering political attention two months ago , when he brought a turkish-born muslim into his cabinet .
that was brave , and let 's hope that as president he is also able to think long-term .
because just being friendly and flattering will not be enough to give the necessary weight to the office . " the stuttgarter zeitung praises wulff 's nomination , and notes that he would be the " youngest candidate to serve in the office of president . " the paper also praises his controversial decision to appoint a muslim woman to a ministerial post .
the daily saw the choice as a breath of fresh air , writing " with the decision yesterday , the coalition has stirred the hope that lethargy does n't necessarily have to be their trademark .

german newspaper commentators were divided over her choice . germany 's government has nominated the 50-year-old state premier of lower saxony as its candidate for the nation 's presidency . chancellor angela merkel chose christian wulff to replace president horst koehler as germany 's new head of state after koehler 's surprise resignation earlier this week . across germany , reactions to wulff 's nomination were mixed , with much of the press commentary focusing on who was not chosen for the post - namely merkel 's rumored first-choice candidate , labor minister ursula von der leyen . financial times deutschland asks " christian who ? " and writes the fact that wulff is moving into the presidential palace serves as " a sad piece of evidence for how little wriggle room cdu party leader angela merkel has in her own party . "
the paper goes on to say that merkel 's inability to push through her first-choice candidate was " far more worrisome than the idea of president christian wulff . " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung says koehler 's sudden resignation had lifted the lid on the traditionally rather opaque process by which candidates are chosen .
never before have people been able to get such an insight into the selection process .
the paper says " the fact that ...
merkel could not get her favorite approved discloses the acute weakness that also affects the chancellor . " speaking on the thursday edition of the " maybrit illner " talk show on german state broadcaster zdf , free democrat politician jorge chatzmarkakis said the reason von der leyen was not nominated was because conservative politicians from the mainly catholic south of germany did not like to see two protestant women , i.e. merkel and von der leyen , leading the country . one of germany 's largest broadsheets , sueddeutsche zeitung , says wulff has a tough road ahead of him . " he will have enough to do after his election in order to achieve the gravitas , seriousness and dignity that one expects from a president .
-lsb- finance minister -rsb- wolfgang schaeuble would have already had it . "
the paper adds , however , that " because wulff is an experienced party politician , the nomination is not as surprising as it may seem to many at first glance . " the regional daily saechsische zeitung says wulff is a popular state premier in lower saxony .
" most perceive him as a nice , friendly man without any rough edges .
he first began garnering political attention two months ago , when he brought a turkish-born muslim into his cabinet .
that was brave , and let 's hope that as president he is also able to think long-term .
because just being friendly and flattering will not be enough to give the necessary weight to the office . " the stuttgarter zeitung praises wulff 's nomination , and notes that he would be the " youngest candidate to serve in the office of president . " the paper also praises his controversial decision to appoint a muslim woman to a ministerial post .
the daily saw the choice as a breath of fresh air , writing " with the decision yesterday , the coalition has stirred the hope that lethargy does n't necessarily have to be their trademark .

the host nation is hoping to reap the same benefits germany did four years ago . south africa is abuzz with activity with just one week to go to the kick-off of the 2010 fifa world cup in johannesburg on june 11 .
from transport and tourist arrangements to stadiums and soccer , officials and entrepreneurs in south africa 's nine host cities have been finalizing their arrangements to ensure the country is ready for the long-awaited football extravaganza .
they 've been drawing on the experience of germany , which hosted the 2006 competition .
although germany failed to lift the trophy , the country did win in other respects : its international image received a massive boost and consumer confidence shot up .
this time round , south africa is keen to reap the same benefits .
the country has taken a risk by investing billions of euros in infrastructure , stadiums and roads in preparation for the big event .
the goal is to increase foreign tourism , trade and investment long after the final whistle is blown .
nikolaus eberl , a german branding expert who is in south africa to help the country with its marketing and branding ahead of the 2010 competition , believes south africa can learn from germany , which rebranded itself as a " welcoming , fun , modern and innovative nation " during the last world cup .
" germans took a hard look at their image as ' effective but unfriendly , " ' he said .
" and then devised a nation-building strategy that promised the world ' a time to make friends . " '
the strategy paid off and tourism shot up 31 percent soon after the end of the world cup .
unemployment also dropped and exports increased . bildunterschrift : germany 's international image improved dramatically as fans reveled at the last world cup success not confined to the pitch in his book , " brand ovation - how germany won the world cup of nation branding , " eberl says 91 percent of visitors to germany 's world cup recommended the country as a holiday destination and depicted germans as " open-minded , friendly and welcoming . "
germany also propelled itself from seventh to second most valued brand in the 2006 nation brands index -lrb- anholt-gmi q3/2006 -rrb- .
south africa is hoping to pick up where germany left off through its " welcoming the world to africa " slogan , backed up by a range of initiatives .

this experience only made him more determined to be involved in south africa 's world cup .
" i knew i wanted to be part of this , " said sharon banda , another volunteer .

' brand advocates ' make up for drop in expected visitors football fever has been rising as the tournament draws closer .
in johannesburg and other cities , south african flags and those of the 32 nations competing in the world cup are flying from car windows - and the excitement is palpable .
initially south africa had estimated that 400,000 visitors would be coming to the country for the world cup .
however , south africa 's tourism minister , marthinus van schalkwyk , announced that closer to 300,000 fans were expected from across the globe .
while the direct numbers may be down , eberl estimates that for each visitor to the world cup , another 150 will be indirectly influenced in their perceptions about the host country , through word-of-mouth by the fans when they return home . and these brand advocates could hold the key to long-term benefits for south africa .
bildunterschrift : the most important branding south africa is hoping for will come from the fans themselves south africa is also banking on the global television coverage it gets when matches are screened worldwide .
the world cup offers south africa the opportunity to market the country as a business destination and a springboard into developing markets in the southern african region .
matthias boddenberg , chief executive of the southern african german chamber of commerce , said south africa should focus on promoting trade and investment in areas like mining and energy , particularly the use of renewable energy and exports from its manufacturing sector .
" south africa is a beautiful country offering unbelievable opportunities , " he said .
" but it is also a country facing big challenges in terms of inequality and crime .
south africa should not fall into the trap of painting a perfect picture .
the message should be realistic , yet optimistic . "

they 've been drawing on the experience of germany , which hosted the 2006 competition .
although germany failed to lift the trophy , the country did win in other respects : its international image received a massive boost and consumer confidence shot up .
this time round , south africa is keen to reap the same benefits .
the country has taken a risk by investing billions of euros in infrastructure , stadiums and roads in preparation for the big event .
the goal is to increase foreign tourism , trade and investment long after the final whistle is blown .
nikolaus eberl , a german branding expert who is in south africa to help the country with its marketing and branding ahead of the 2010 competition , believes south africa can learn from germany , which rebranded itself as a " welcoming , fun , modern and innovative nation " during the last world cup .
" germans took a hard look at their image as ' effective but unfriendly , " ' he said .
" and then devised a nation-building strategy that promised the world ' a time to make friends . " '
the strategy paid off and tourism shot up 31 percent soon after the end of the world cup .
unemployment also dropped and exports increased . bildunterschrift : germany 's international image improved dramatically as fans reveled at the last world cup success not confined to the pitch in his book , " brand ovation - how germany won the world cup of nation branding , " eberl says 91 percent of visitors to germany 's world cup recommended the country as a holiday destination and depicted germans as " open-minded , friendly and welcoming . "
germany also propelled itself from seventh to second most valued brand in the 2006 nation brands index -lrb- anholt-gmi q3/2006 -rrb- .
south africa is hoping to pick up where germany left off through its " welcoming the world to africa " slogan , backed up by a range of initiatives .
cities are staging welcoming campaigns , service personnel have been trained to be ambassadors , people are learning french , german , spanish and italian , while thousands of people will help in and around the stadiums as volunteers .

he works in community development in south africa and is involved in the football for hope program in south africa which spans townships across the country .
" i experienced germany 's world cup , and it was amazing how people opened up in the excitement of the event , " he said .
this experience only made him more determined to be involved in south africa 's world cup .
" i knew i wanted to be part of this , " said sharon banda , another volunteer .
" meeting people from all over the world and showing them how great africa is . "
' brand advocates ' make up for drop in expected visitors football fever has been rising as the tournament draws closer .
in johannesburg and other cities , south african flags and those of the 32 nations competing in the world cup are flying from car windows - and the excitement is palpable .
initially south africa had estimated that 400,000 visitors would be coming to the country for the world cup .
however , south africa 's tourism minister , marthinus van schalkwyk , announced that closer to 300,000 fans were expected from across the globe .
while the direct numbers may be down , eberl estimates that for each visitor to the world cup , another 150 will be indirectly influenced in their perceptions about the host country , through word-of-mouth by the fans when they return home . and these brand advocates could hold the key to long-term benefits for south africa .
bildunterschrift : the most important branding south africa is hoping for will come from the fans themselves south africa is also banking on the global television coverage it gets when matches are screened worldwide .
the world cup offers south africa the opportunity to market the country as a business destination and a springboard into developing markets in the southern african region .
matthias boddenberg , chief executive of the southern african german chamber of commerce , said south africa should focus on promoting trade and investment in areas like mining and energy , particularly the use of renewable energy and exports from its manufacturing sector .
" south africa is a beautiful country offering unbelievable opportunities , " he said .
" but it is also a country facing big challenges in terms of inequality and crime .
south africa should not fall into the trap of painting a perfect picture .
the message should be realistic , yet optimistic . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 04.06.2010 opinion : clear demands but little hope of success after kabul peace assembly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the peace jirga in afghanistan has come to an end .
some 1,600 tribal elders and religious leaders agreed to make peace with the taliban .
but prospects of peace are bleak , says deutsche welle 's ratbil shamel . once again a jirga has come to an end in kabul and once again it has done what the ruling government wanted . namely , it has presented the government 's suggestions as the people 's wishes .
this time , the jirga has handed the government a mandate to enter peace negotiations with the taliban .
it would like hizb-e-islami , the party of the warlord and politician gulbuddin hekmatyar , to be involved as well . the jirga wants the afghan government and the international community to guarantee political and legal security to all those who reject the taliban and al qaeda . the taliban will also be called upon to discuss their demands with kabul and to stop working with the terrorist organization al qaeda .
all fighting parties will be asked to protect the safety and rights of the civilian population instead of putting them in danger .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan delegates walk outside the site of the peace jirga in kabul the demands of the peace jirga are very much in tune with the afghan president 's wishes .
he has been trying to persuade the taliban to come to the negotiating table for at least five years but to little avail .
at first , he could not convince anyone of his idea to integrate moderate taliban back into public life , finding support for it neither at home nor abroad .
but half a decade later , he has succeeded . the population has wanted nothing but peace in over 30 years of war .
in the past nine years , the us and its allies have not been able to solve the problem of the taliban .
now president hamid karzai , amid general helplessness , has eyed his chance to take things into his own hands at last . but he and his advisors know that for there to be longstanding peace in afghanistan , they not only need the us on their side , but also regional big powers such as russia , china and india . there can also be no peace without the close cooperation of pakistan , iran and saudi arabia . all these countries see their fundamental interests threatened by an afghanistan under us influence .
this means that a peace jirga in kabul only makes sense if prior agreements have been made between the us and afghanistan 's neighbors .
however , these have never been made . moreover , the taliban and al qaeda will never be ready to agree to peace in afghanistan as long as there are places they can retreat to abroad and people willing to support them . the taliban and al qaeda leadership want the establishment of a worldwide islamic empire .
they want this world to be cleansed of unbelievers .
so , the resolutions of a peace jirga are meaningless to taliban and al qaeda leaders .
they will continue their fight in afghanistan . author : ratbil shamel / act editor : disha uppal send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this means that a peace jirga in kabul only makes sense if prior agreements have been made between the us and afghanistan 's neighbors .
however , these have never been made . moreover , the taliban and al qaeda will never be ready to agree to peace in afghanistan as long as there are places they can retreat to abroad and people willing to support them . the taliban and al qaeda leadership want the establishment of a worldwide islamic empire .
they want this world to be cleansed of unbelievers .
so , the resolutions of a peace jirga are meaningless to taliban and al qaeda leaders .
they will continue their fight in afghanistan . author : ratbil shamel / act editor : disha uppal send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle spoke with alexander rahr , a russia expert at the german council on foreign relations , about the state of russo-german relations and what is likely to be discussed at the meeting .
dw : germany has joined permanent members of the un security council , which include russia , in calling for sanctions against iran .
what aspects of the dispute with iran will the two leaders be discussing .
alexander rahr : angela merkel stands clearly on the us position that sanctions against iran are necessary .
we have seen that russia has slightly changed its previously stubborn position on this issue , it is now moving toward western positions .
and the meeting with merkel will probably demonstrate that russia is indeed willing to support more sanctions as it was ready to do a couple of weeks ago .
what has prompted this change on russia 's part ?
russia came to the conclusion that what the west has always said is true that iran is indeed building a nuclear bomb , and that this nuclear bomb will indeed threaten russia .
i think that obama could do more to convince medvedev to join the western anti-iranian coalition , and he did it also by changing his policy on central-eastern europe .
we remember , the united states wanted to install anti-missile defense infrastructure in poland and the czech republic , but russia feels threatened by that .
and out of this threat and out of this conflict which arose with the united states , russia somehow felt sympathetic in a way toward iran .
now the iranian leadership itself has accused russia of being an enemy of iran .
the bridges between tehran and moscow seem to have burned , and that will help russia to make the right decisions , and mrs. merkel will try to move medvedev closer to western positions .
both russia and germany are going to be attending the g-20 meeting in toronto this month , at which financial market regulation will be a key issue .
is there much common ground between berlin and moscow on this issue ?
there is no real common ground because russia is not yet a part of the global financial system as germany and the united states and many other of the g-20 states are .
but russia is very much interested not to go to the summit of the g-20 with an individual position .
it wants to join the position of other states .
it wants to be part of states who could maybe propose certain agendas .
and russia is very much interested in negotiating with germany a kind of pre-position before going to this summit , to have germany on its side when decisions will be taken about the future financial system of the world , about what the probable change of the wto rules , about the world economic system .
it is very important for russia .

deutsche welle spoke with alexander rahr , a russia expert at the german council on foreign relations , about the state of russo-german relations and what is likely to be discussed at the meeting .
dw : germany has joined permanent members of the un security council , which include russia , in calling for sanctions against iran .
what aspects of the dispute with iran will the two leaders be discussing .
alexander rahr : angela merkel stands clearly on the us position that sanctions against iran are necessary .
we have seen that russia has slightly changed its previously stubborn position on this issue , it is now moving toward western positions .
and the meeting with merkel will probably demonstrate that russia is indeed willing to support more sanctions as it was ready to do a couple of weeks ago .
what has prompted this change on russia 's part ?
russia came to the conclusion that what the west has always said is true that iran is indeed building a nuclear bomb , and that this nuclear bomb will indeed threaten russia .
i think that obama could do more to convince medvedev to join the western anti-iranian coalition , and he did it also by changing his policy on central-eastern europe .
we remember , the united states wanted to install anti-missile defense infrastructure in poland and the czech republic , but russia feels threatened by that .
and out of this threat and out of this conflict which arose with the united states , russia somehow felt sympathetic in a way toward iran .
now the iranian leadership itself has accused russia of being an enemy of iran .
the bridges between tehran and moscow seem to have burned , and that will help russia to make the right decisions , and mrs. merkel will try to move medvedev closer to western positions .
both russia and germany are going to be attending the g-20 meeting in toronto this month , at which financial market regulation will be a key issue .
is there much common ground between berlin and moscow on this issue ?
there is no real common ground because russia is not yet a part of the global financial system as germany and the united states and many other of the g-20 states are .
but russia is very much interested not to go to the summit of the g-20 with an individual position .
it wants to join the position of other states .
it wants to be part of states who could maybe propose certain agendas .
and russia is very much interested in negotiating with germany a kind of pre-position before going to this summit , to have germany on its side when decisions will be taken about the future financial system of the world , about what the probable change of the wto rules , about the world economic system .
it is very important for russia .

the two sides issued a joint statement in brussels on friday at the second-ever eu-pakistan summit . for a long time , the eu showed little interest in pakistan .
however , that changed with the fight against the taliban and al qaeda in afghanistan . today , eu leaders think that the whole western military and political engagement in afghanistan depends on a stable pakistan , as eu council president herman van rompuy explained in his press conference with pakistani prime minister yousuf raza gilani . " the developments of pakistan have a direct influence on europe and on the whole world .
therefore it is in our own interest , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu thinks pakistan is pivotal to peace in afghanistan where bomb attacks are almost a daily occurence direct aid to pakistan the eu supports pakistan with direct aid as well as with development programs , which are focused on education , the fight against poverty and on democratization . " mr prime minister , we have common enemies , poverty and terrorism , our common instrument is political democracy .
now we have to succeed , " van rompuy told his pakistani guest . the europeans want pakistan to continue fighting against extremism and to further implement democratic reforms .
both are difficult tasks for prime minister gilani and he wants something in return .
his main aim is to get better access to the european market for pakistani goods . " trade not aid " is the term often used by pakistani officials .
but the eu has been reluctant to open its markets .
commission president jose manuel barroso mentioned difficult negotiations with all the 27 member states , with the european parliament and the world trade organization .
however , he did say there it might be possible in one or two years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the faisal mosque of islamabad .
gilani reminded eu delegates in brussels on friday that " islam is a religion of peace " " islam is a religion of peace not of terrorism " prime minister gilani did not only talk about trade , however .
he was also keen to defend his religion against negative stereotyping . " islam is a religion of peace and tolerance , " he said .
" there is a perception in the west that the religion of islam is a religion of terrorism .
we are peaceful people and our religion has taught us tolerance , love and peace .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de biodiversity -pipe- 04.06.2010 pricing the earth to save biodiversity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tropical rainforests are being cleared for biofuels across asia it 's a threat overshadowed by climate change but no less menacing : life on earth is being extinguished at a rate that will one day stop us in our tracks .
could pricing the earth be the way to save it – and ourselves ? great extinctions come and go .
the earth has experienced five in the last half-a-billion years , and a number of lesser extinctions as well .
usually , they 're unleashed by a cataclysmic event – an asteroid impact or a super volcano .
scientists speculate that sometimes they 've been triggered by gradual changes in the earth 's atmosphere .
but what makes the so-called ' sixth great extinction ' distinctive is us .
this time around we are present to witness it .
we also happen to be driving it . according to the latest global biodiversity outlook released last month , extinction rates may be up to 1,000 times higher than the background rate – the normal pace of extinction that has accompanied evolution on earth .
bleak outlook bildunterschrift : tigers are set to become extinct in the wild in 15 years the decline is happening across the spectrum of life .
species are disappearing ; genetic variety – a safeguard against disease – is being lost ; and whole ecosystems , whose processes provide everything from habitats to the quality of our air , water and soils , are retreating .
some are faring worse than others .
amphibians face the greatest risk and corals are deteriorating most rapidly .
while the number of vertebrate species fell by nearly a third on average between 1970 and 1996 , nearly a quarter of all plant species are estimated to be threatened with extinction .
in the last 110 years , india 's wild tiger population has fallen by over 97.5 percent thanks to poaching and competition for land with humans .
" if business as usual continues , one can expect them -lrb- tigers -rrb- to be all extinct by 2025 , " says dr ashok khosla , president of the international union for conservation of nature -lrb- iucn -rrb- , the organization which catalogues the world 's species in its so-called ' red lists . '
another example which khosla likes to cite from his native india is the sudden plunge in vulture populations in south asia , which saw the birds ' population drop from 40 million to 60,000 within a decade of the year 1992 .
" it was discovered that a hormone fed to cattle for more milk was getting into the vultures … within eight years governments in india and nepal and elsewhere had taken - luckily for us - action to stop the decline , but they were down to virtually extinct , " khosla said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the only known medication for childhood leukaemia comes from this threatened flower a human-shaped footprint the drivers for the loss of biodiversity can all be traced – directly or indirectly – to humans .
the principle pressures include habitat change -lrb- think monocultures and clear-felling -rrb- , overexploitation -lrb- consider the ocean 's fish stocks -rrb- , pollution , invasive alien species -lrb- whose advances into new territories are usually abetted by people -rrb- and climate change .
in stark contrast to most of our fellow tenants on this planet , the human population has exploded in the last century .
in 1900 , the world 's population was 1.6 billion people .
today it is roughly 6.9 billion and expected to rise to nine billion by 2050 .
we 've also been consuming more .
according to this year 's consumption report by the world watch institute , the average american consumes six times as much today as he did in 1960 .
our numbers and behavior already suck up the resources of 1.4 planets , says the global footprint network .
according to its ' moderate ' business as usual trends , we will need two planets to sustain us by 2050 .
these figures have led to a growing sense of alarm in some quarters , and mounting calls for radical change . " it takes by our collective bio-capacity at the moment 18 months to provide 12 months of natural goods and services , and it 's heading in the wrong direction , " says andrew simms , a policy director at the new economics foundation , a green-oriented think tank .
" so if we ask ourselves if orthodox price mechanisms are working at the moment , well obviously they 're not , because they 're not turning things around . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank economist pavan sukhdev is auditing nature services rendered if living beyond our natural means comes with a cost , then putting a figure on that cost is the difficult job of pavan sukhdev , an economist at deutsche bank .
the banker is on loan to the united nations environment program where he runs a study called the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity -lrb- teeb -rrb- .
the idea grew out of the stern report of 2006 which laid out the economic case for tackling climate change .
" economics today is the currency of policy , " sukhdev told a recent biodiversity conference . " no matter how strong , no matter how emotive , no matter how powerful and no matter how human your arguments to do anything in this world , we are at a stage today where you will also be asked for economic justification .
so whether you like it or not – indeed whether i like it or not – there will be a case of tradeoffs being evaluated . "
from pollinating crops – a service worth up to seven billion dollars in the us , according to studies there – to wetlands ' capacity to mitigate storm damage , there are myriad ways that ecosystems provide services not factored into our economies .
nine-out-of-ten new medicines is derived from something found in nature .
according to teeb 's interim report , we are sacrificing 1.3 to 3.1 trillion euros -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- worth of ecosystems services every year as our economies continue to treat the environment as an ' externality . '
to put that in perspective , that 's up to twice the cost of failing to tackle climate change .
or to put it another way , it 's the financial crisis every three years .
yet even some potential allies remain wary of the drive to a market solution .
" we 're faced with what i would call the paradox of environmental economics , " said andrew simms .
" how , for example , would you put a price on the marginal ton of carbon , which when burnt , puts us on a path to runaway climate change ?
you 're basically asking ' what is the price of civilization ? '
even if a market allowed for the trading of that ton of carbon , i would argue that it should not be allowed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrew simms is concerned about the distinction between value and price squaring the circle nevertheless , if teeb 's aim is to rouse decision-makers to action out of concern for their state coffers , then there are signs that it 's bearing fruit .
this year 's green week -lrb- 1-4 june -rrb- , an annual environment conference organized by the european union , was dedicated to the issue of biodiversity , and the bloc 's executive used the event to announce two new tools aimed at halting biodiversity loss .
recognizing the need for accurate information , the bloc 's executive and the european environment agency unveiled a centralized clearing house for data called bise – the biodiversity information system for europe . taking a page out of the climate change play-book , they also established a " biodiversity baseline " , which will be used to offer a snapshot of trends and measure progress on goals .
but as useful as the common starting point of 1990 levels of carbon emissions has been for climate action , how do you make a baseline for something as complex as biodiversity ?
the eu 's initial groping efforts have produced a five-page brochure with 15 charts .
though it 's not as intuitively clear as a target for cutting emissions , it is an important step that will " help us review our actions and take tangible new measures , " according to environment commissioner janez potocnik .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could european farmers be paid to make wildlife reserves ?
rethinking the cap and other innovative ideas may be on their way .
the eu 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- – a 50-billion-euro-a-year program of farm subsidies – has long been controversial for its distortion of trade and impact on developing countries .
there are now mounting calls to pay famers the money for habitat restoration instead , and at a fraction of the cost . a recent policy paper by the european centre for international political economy found that " substantial " environmental gains could be secured at half the cost of the current cap .

could pricing the earth be the way to save it – and ourselves ? great extinctions come and go .
the earth has experienced five in the last half-a-billion years , and a number of lesser extinctions as well .
usually , they 're unleashed by a cataclysmic event – an asteroid impact or a super volcano .
scientists speculate that sometimes they 've been triggered by gradual changes in the earth 's atmosphere .
but what makes the so-called ' sixth great extinction ' distinctive is us .
this time around we are present to witness it .
we also happen to be driving it . according to the latest global biodiversity outlook released last month , extinction rates may be up to 1,000 times higher than the background rate – the normal pace of extinction that has accompanied evolution on earth .
bleak outlook bildunterschrift : tigers are set to become extinct in the wild in 15 years the decline is happening across the spectrum of life .
species are disappearing ; genetic variety – a safeguard against disease – is being lost ; and whole ecosystems , whose processes provide everything from habitats to the quality of our air , water and soils , are retreating .
some are faring worse than others .
amphibians face the greatest risk and corals are deteriorating most rapidly .
while the number of vertebrate species fell by nearly a third on average between 1970 and 1996 , nearly a quarter of all plant species are estimated to be threatened with extinction .
in the last 110 years , india 's wild tiger population has fallen by over 97.5 percent thanks to poaching and competition for land with humans .
" if business as usual continues , one can expect them -lrb- tigers -rrb- to be all extinct by 2025 , " says dr ashok khosla , president of the international union for conservation of nature -lrb- iucn -rrb- , the organization which catalogues the world 's species in its so-called ' red lists . '
another example which khosla likes to cite from his native india is the sudden plunge in vulture populations in south asia , which saw the birds ' population drop from 40 million to 60,000 within a decade of the year 1992 .
" it was discovered that a hormone fed to cattle for more milk was getting into the vultures … within eight years governments in india and nepal and elsewhere had taken - luckily for us - action to stop the decline , but they were down to virtually extinct , " khosla said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the only known medication for childhood leukaemia comes from this threatened flower a human-shaped footprint the drivers for the loss of biodiversity can all be traced – directly or indirectly – to humans .
the principle pressures include habitat change -lrb- think monocultures and clear-felling -rrb- , overexploitation -lrb- consider the ocean 's fish stocks -rrb- , pollution , invasive alien species -lrb- whose advances into new territories are usually abetted by people -rrb- and climate change .
in stark contrast to most of our fellow tenants on this planet , the human population has exploded in the last century .
in 1900 , the world 's population was 1.6 billion people .
today it is roughly 6.9 billion and expected to rise to nine billion by 2050 .
we 've also been consuming more .
according to this year 's consumption report by the world watch institute , the average american consumes six times as much today as he did in 1960 .
our numbers and behavior already suck up the resources of 1.4 planets , says the global footprint network .
according to its ' moderate ' business as usual trends , we will need two planets to sustain us by 2050 .
these figures have led to a growing sense of alarm in some quarters , and mounting calls for radical change . " it takes by our collective bio-capacity at the moment 18 months to provide 12 months of natural goods and services , and it 's heading in the wrong direction , " says andrew simms , a policy director at the new economics foundation , a green-oriented think tank .
" so if we ask ourselves if orthodox price mechanisms are working at the moment , well obviously they 're not , because they 're not turning things around . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank economist pavan sukhdev is auditing nature services rendered if living beyond our natural means comes with a cost , then putting a figure on that cost is the difficult job of pavan sukhdev , an economist at deutsche bank .
the banker is on loan to the united nations environment program where he runs a study called the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity -lrb- teeb -rrb- .
the idea grew out of the stern report of 2006 which laid out the economic case for tackling climate change .
" economics today is the currency of policy , " sukhdev told a recent biodiversity conference . " no matter how strong , no matter how emotive , no matter how powerful and no matter how human your arguments to do anything in this world , we are at a stage today where you will also be asked for economic justification .
so whether you like it or not – indeed whether i like it or not – there will be a case of tradeoffs being evaluated . "
from pollinating crops – a service worth up to seven billion dollars in the us , according to studies there – to wetlands ' capacity to mitigate storm damage , there are myriad ways that ecosystems provide services not factored into our economies .
nine-out-of-ten new medicines is derived from something found in nature .
according to teeb 's interim report , we are sacrificing 1.3 to 3.1 trillion euros -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- worth of ecosystems services every year as our economies continue to treat the environment as an ' externality . '
to put that in perspective , that 's up to twice the cost of failing to tackle climate change .
or to put it another way , it 's the financial crisis every three years .
yet even some potential allies remain wary of the drive to a market solution .
" we 're faced with what i would call the paradox of environmental economics , " said andrew simms .
" how , for example , would you put a price on the marginal ton of carbon , which when burnt , puts us on a path to runaway climate change ?
you 're basically asking ' what is the price of civilization ? '
even if a market allowed for the trading of that ton of carbon , i would argue that it should not be allowed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrew simms is concerned about the distinction between value and price squaring the circle nevertheless , if teeb 's aim is to rouse decision-makers to action out of concern for their state coffers , then there are signs that it 's bearing fruit .
this year 's green week -lrb- 1-4 june -rrb- , an annual environment conference organized by the european union , was dedicated to the issue of biodiversity , and the bloc 's executive used the event to announce two new tools aimed at halting biodiversity loss .
recognizing the need for accurate information , the bloc 's executive and the european environment agency unveiled a centralized clearing house for data called bise – the biodiversity information system for europe . taking a page out of the climate change play-book , they also established a " biodiversity baseline " , which will be used to offer a snapshot of trends and measure progress on goals .
but as useful as the common starting point of 1990 levels of carbon emissions has been for climate action , how do you make a baseline for something as complex as biodiversity ?
the eu 's initial groping efforts have produced a five-page brochure with 15 charts .
though it 's not as intuitively clear as a target for cutting emissions , it is an important step that will " help us review our actions and take tangible new measures , " according to environment commissioner janez potocnik .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could european farmers be paid to make wildlife reserves ?
rethinking the cap and other innovative ideas may be on their way .
the eu 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- – a 50-billion-euro-a-year program of farm subsidies – has long been controversial for its distortion of trade and impact on developing countries .
there are now mounting calls to pay famers the money for habitat restoration instead , and at a fraction of the cost . a recent policy paper by the european centre for international political economy found that " substantial " environmental gains could be secured at half the cost of the current cap .
yet reforming agriculture – a sector that eats up half the eu 's budget – has always been a quagmire , despite the optimistic view , on the part of the eu 's most senior environmental bureaucrat , that things are beginning to change .
" we will definitely see support for agriculture tied more and more – i ca n't say exclusively – to respect for the environment , and ecologically friendlier forms of production , " karl falkenberg , director general of the environment commission , told deutsche welle .
in any event , europe will have to move fast if it is to have any shot at halting - and reversing - the loss of biodiversity , as it aims to do by 2020 .

in any event , europe will have to move fast if it is to have any shot at halting - and reversing - the loss of biodiversity , as it aims to do by 2020 .
like every region in the world , it failed to meet this year 's deadline to halt biodiversity loss , a target laid down with no baseline , little information and no sub-targets in 2002 .
the next goals will be set internationally when the global community gathers in nagoya in october for the next convention on biological diversity conference .
if europe and the world is to avoid another ground hog day , then political leaders will need to find the attention spans – and stomachs – to deal with ' two ' environmental crises at once .

could pricing the earth be the way to save it – and ourselves ? great extinctions come and go .
the earth has experienced five in the last half-a-billion years , and a number of lesser extinctions as well .
usually , they 're unleashed by a cataclysmic event – an asteroid impact or a super volcano .
scientists speculate that sometimes they 've been triggered by gradual changes in the earth 's atmosphere .
but what makes the so-called ' sixth great extinction ' distinctive is us .
this time around we are present to witness it .
we also happen to be driving it . according to the latest global biodiversity outlook released last month , extinction rates may be up to 1,000 times higher than the background rate – the normal pace of extinction that has accompanied evolution on earth .
bleak outlook bildunterschrift : tigers are set to become extinct in the wild in 15 years the decline is happening across the spectrum of life .
species are disappearing ; genetic variety – a safeguard against disease – is being lost ; and whole ecosystems , whose processes provide everything from habitats to the quality of our air , water and soils , are retreating .
some are faring worse than others .
amphibians face the greatest risk and corals are deteriorating most rapidly .
while the number of vertebrate species fell by nearly a third on average between 1970 and 1996 , nearly a quarter of all plant species are estimated to be threatened with extinction .
in the last 110 years , india 's wild tiger population has fallen by over 97.5 percent thanks to poaching and competition for land with humans .
" if business as usual continues , one can expect them -lrb- tigers -rrb- to be all extinct by 2025 , " says dr ashok khosla , president of the international union for conservation of nature -lrb- iucn -rrb- , the organization which catalogues the world 's species in its so-called ' red lists . '

could pricing the earth be the way to save it – and ourselves ? great extinctions come and go .
the earth has experienced five in the last half-a-billion years , and a number of lesser extinctions as well .

some are faring worse than others .
amphibians face the greatest risk and corals are deteriorating most rapidly .
while the number of vertebrate species fell by nearly a third on average between 1970 and 1996 , nearly a quarter of all plant species are estimated to be threatened with extinction .
in the last 110 years , india 's wild tiger population has fallen by over 97.5 percent thanks to poaching and competition for land with humans .

another example which khosla likes to cite from his native india is the sudden plunge in vulture populations in south asia , which saw the birds ' population drop from 40 million to 60,000 within a decade of the year 1992 .
" it was discovered that a hormone fed to cattle for more milk was getting into the vultures … within eight years governments in india and nepal and elsewhere had taken - luckily for us - action to stop the decline , but they were down to virtually extinct , " khosla said .

“ like all human beings , we respond in ways that are programmed by millions of years of evolution , identifying and meeting immediate needs and indulging immediate greeds , and failing to see these in the context of longer-term survival . ”

it comes the day after a leading bishop in turkey was murdered . pope benedict xvi said on friday he hoped cyprus ' divided greek and turkish communities could find " the desire to live in harmony " to reach peace .
the island has been divided along ethnic lines since 1974 when turkish troops occupied its northern third in response to a greek cypriot coup seeking union with greece .
president demetris christofias , who heads the greek cypriot community , told the pontiff that the island was " in need of your prayers . "
" cyprus is in need of your words of peace , given the difficult situation the island is facing in its occupied are , " christofias added .
the three-day trip is benedict 's first to a majority orthodox country , and comes amid desires to warm relations between the catholic and eastern orthodox churches .
bishop ’ s murder should ‘ not harm islam dialogue ’ during his visit , the pope will present a working document on regional issues , ahead of a meeting of middle east bishops in october .
among the bishops scheduled to attend the synod was luigi padovese , a leading catholic bishop in turkey who was murdered on thursday .
the pope spoke of his " profound sadness " over the stabbing .
he said the killing should not be allowed to hurt dialog with islam or stain the image of turkey and its people .
" we must not attribute this to turkey or to turks ... the certain thing is that it was not a political or religious assassination .
it was a personal thing , " benedict said. cb / reuters / afp / dpa editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

“ journalists are no different from businessmen or politicians in their / our inability to respond to the existential threat of climate change and resources depletion , ” he said in an interview with deutsche welle .
“ like all human beings , we respond in ways that are programmed by millions of years of evolution , identifying and meeting immediate needs and indulging immediate greeds , and failing to see these in the context of longer-term survival . ”

it comes the day after a leading bishop in turkey was murdered . pope benedict xvi said on friday he hoped cyprus ' divided greek and turkish communities could find " the desire to live in harmony " to reach peace .
the island has been divided along ethnic lines since 1974 when turkish troops occupied its northern third in response to a greek cypriot coup seeking union with greece .
president demetris christofias , who heads the greek cypriot community , told the pontiff that the island was " in need of your prayers . "
" cyprus is in need of your words of peace , given the difficult situation the island is facing in its occupied are , " christofias added .
the three-day trip is benedict 's first to a majority orthodox country , and comes amid desires to warm relations between the catholic and eastern orthodox churches .
bishop ’ s murder should ‘ not harm islam dialogue ’ during his visit , the pope will present a working document on regional issues , ahead of a meeting of middle east bishops in october .
among the bishops scheduled to attend the synod was luigi padovese , a leading catholic bishop in turkey who was murdered on thursday .
the pope spoke of his " profound sadness " over the stabbing .
he said the killing should not be allowed to hurt dialog with islam or stain the image of turkey and its people .
" we must not attribute this to turkey or to turks ... the certain thing is that it was not a political or religious assassination .
it was a personal thing , " benedict said. cb / reuters / afp / dpa editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 04.06.2010 fao calls for more investment to tackle hunger großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of hungry asians rose by 50 million last year the recent global crises , from the food-fuel crisis to financial recession , have led to a sharp increase in the numbers of the chronically-hungry .
the fao is pressing for greater action to stem the global increase . the new campaign by the united nations food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- says that by 2050 asia will be facing " enormous challenges " to feed its five billion population .
recent multiple crises have led to a sharp rise in those facing chronic hunger .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fao hq in rome hiroyuki konuma , fao 's regional chief for asia and the pacific , says more investment is needed because " the crises are still continuing and affecting the populations of the world . " the world 's chronic hungry population has increased very rapidly in the past two years .
it got to 850 million around three to four years ago .
at the end of last year , it reached over one billion .
this is an issue where we need solidarity and all the assistance in the world . " two-thirds of the world 's hungry population in asia the asia and pacific region holds two thirds of the world 's hungry population – 640 million people .
the fao estimates that over 50 million people were pushed into chronic malnutrition in 2009 alone . purushottam k. mudbhary , the head of the fao policy assistance branch , says there are signs of declining global food stocks , which means that food prices have remained at the same high levels of early 2008 . " this is why we need to step up investment in agriculture to increase food production .
and one of the other reasons is that there has not really been a major technical breakthrough like we had during the green revolution , which made a major impact on agricultural production .
the investment in agriculture has to be reinvigorated to stem the tide of this . " countries such as india and china , that are experiencing major gains in economic growth , are seeing a greater demand for high-value products and livestock , which is also putting a strain on food stocks . southeast asia generally better off than south asia " relative to south asia in aggregate terms southeast asia is much better off , " says sumiter broca , an economist with the fao . " but within southeast asia there are countries which are at a lower level of development – myanmar , laos because of the resource constraints and the philippines , where there are major problems . " bildunterschrift : the fao says that foreign investment in agricultural land is creating legal and ethical issues the fao also points to the recent surge of foreign investment in agricultural land .
it says the investment is opening up complex economic , political , institutional , legal and ethical issues and their impact on property rights , rural development , technology and access to land and water . however , the organization also says foreign investment in developing country agriculture could make a contribution to realizing important hunger and poverty-fighting goals . author : ron corben -lrb- bangkok -rrb- editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with more and more areas transforming into homogenized yuppy-villes , is this the death of kiezkultur ? berliners , so proud of their poverty and punkish attitude to life , find it easy to sneer at yuppies .
and , given that i am not especially materialistic either , i guess i do too .
i do n't have a car , i could n't care a toffee about designer labels and i currently own but two pairs of shoes .
each month is a constant exercise in flying by the seat of my pants when it comes to paying the rent and so long as there 's enough money in the bank for milk and cigarettes , i 'm relatively content . you can therefore imagine that splashy displays of affluence are something that i tend to find rather vulgar .
and i am not the only one .
berliners hate it too .
especially when their tumbledown , graffiti-riddled neighborhoods end up being gutted , sanitized and then invaded by a bizarre species created via stepford wives and l.a. law cross-pollination . the process of gentrification has been striding forward mercilessly since the berlin wall fell back in 1989 .
as many ex-gdr citizens headed for the bright lights of the west , eager capitalists soon swooped down on the former heart of german socialism , bought up the empty properties and began transforming neighborhoods wholesale .
and it has n't stopped since .
the creative bohemians in the city have packed their easels and moved to successive districts to stay ahead of the gentrification tide .
i mean , if you make your meager living selling anti-something-or-other political art , why would you want to live next door to some stuffy doctor and his bland wife ? newcomers bring energy to berlin aside from being rather dreary , your slightly more upper crust neighbors might pose a more serious threat than just ruining your street cred .
what makes a neighborhood , or kiez ?
the people certainly , but also the wacky little shops , the open-all-hours boozer and the night clubs .
move in mr and mrs dull , formerly of conservativeville , who think it 's rather amusing to live in a bombed-out ruin in prenzlauer berg because it 's so " arty " and by the end of week one they 're sending for the police and complaining about the noise . it 's happened time and again ; moaning neighbors and rising rents have seen the demise of berlin heavyweight clubs like rio and scala and seen venues like king kong , once famed for it 's nightly live music roster , have its assets stripped and only do gigs on weekends .
the famous off-location parties - guerilla affairs set up in some basement somewhere - happen less and less often simply because the basements are now all graphic design companies and law firms .
if you want to party in a basement , you have to go to the spandau district now . but is it all bad news ?
not necessarily .
ellen allien , dj and founder of label bpitch control , recently said in an interview with flavorwire : " a lot of times people move to the city for just three years or something and then they go back to america or italy or whatever .
but they bring the impact , the energy .
that 's really good for the scene , because we have all these new people doing something , trying something .
that 's why the music scene here is super dynamic . " but she also warned that " rich people just visiting for the weekend " are what is " killing the city .
but as long as people keep moving here , berlin will remain cool . " a common fate for capital cities it seems not a week goes by these days without some anti-gentrification demo taking place somewhere in berlin .
prenzlauer berg and mitte , once grim east berlin wastelands , are now lost to the yuppies so the fight is on to stem the flow before kreuzberg , friedrichshain and neukoelln go the same way .
take a quick peek at the non-political website brennende-autos.de and you 'll see that the current trend for torching a fancy motor as a symbolic " f * * k you " to the yuppies all takes place within the central districts mentioned above - such is the feeling of territorialism in these areas . the wave of transforming an area into something upmarket and appealing to people with higher-end incomes , is something which has already wrecked a number of the world 's capitals . " gentrification can certainly be an enormous problem for nightlife and a city 's creative essence , " dj and journalist jonty skrufff told me .
" you only have to look at new york and london and how their club scenes have been watered down , marginalized and ruined by rich incomers to understand what can happen , " he told me . now that london has become expensive and the trend-setting clubs have closed , " horrible expensive bars have moved in and every weekend hordes of drunken office workers descend on the area making it unpleasant for the few freaks left who previously made the area so interesting and creative , " he added . a lose-lose situation djs , freaks and flamboyant queers hate the gentrification " afflicting " their once bohemian neighborhoods ; real estate companies and housing associations think they are making the area more pleasant for everyone .
it 's a lose-lose situation , as the two sides of the argument are both valid and can not be reconciled .
gentrification , beautification , sanitation ; whatever you want to call it , the floodgates opened years ago and it 's unlikely to stop anytime soon .
the process will only reach an end once all the creativity and quirkiness which makes berlin berlin has been squeezed out .
sad but true . as for me ?
well , i never much cared for fashion to the extent that it should dictate which street i live in .
my needs are very simple ; so long as there 's somewhere to lock my bike and buy coffee and cigarettes , i 'm happy .
i do n't really care if my neighbors are lefty anarchists or sharp-suited architects because , at the end of the day , i hate everyone in equal measure anyway . the incurably grumpy gavin blackburn currently lives in kreuzberg , above a cigarette kiosk . editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with more and more areas transforming into homogenized yuppy-villes , is this the death of kiezkultur ? berliners , so proud of their poverty and punkish attitude to life , find it easy to sneer at yuppies .
and , given that i am not especially materialistic either , i guess i do too .
i do n't have a car , i could n't care a toffee about designer labels and i currently own but two pairs of shoes .
each month is a constant exercise in flying by the seat of my pants when it comes to paying the rent and so long as there 's enough money in the bank for milk and cigarettes , i 'm relatively content . you can therefore imagine that splashy displays of affluence are something that i tend to find rather vulgar .
and i am not the only one .
berliners hate it too .
especially when their tumbledown , graffiti-riddled neighborhoods end up being gutted , sanitized and then invaded by a bizarre species created via stepford wives and l.a. law cross-pollination . the process of gentrification has been striding forward mercilessly since the berlin wall fell back in 1989 .
as many ex-gdr citizens headed for the bright lights of the west , eager capitalists soon swooped down on the former heart of german socialism , bought up the empty properties and began transforming neighborhoods wholesale .
and it has n't stopped since .
the creative bohemians in the city have packed their easels and moved to successive districts to stay ahead of the gentrification tide .
i mean , if you make your meager living selling anti-something-or-other political art , why would you want to live next door to some stuffy doctor and his bland wife ? newcomers bring energy to berlin aside from being rather dreary , your slightly more upper crust neighbors might pose a more serious threat than just ruining your street cred .
what makes a neighborhood , or kiez ?
the people certainly , but also the wacky little shops , the open-all-hours boozer and the night clubs .
move in mr and mrs dull , formerly of conservativeville , who think it 's rather amusing to live in a bombed-out ruin in prenzlauer berg because it 's so " arty " and by the end of week one they 're sending for the police and complaining about the noise . it 's happened time and again ; moaning neighbors and rising rents have seen the demise of berlin heavyweight clubs like rio and scala and seen venues like king kong , once famed for it 's nightly live music roster , have its assets stripped and only do gigs on weekends .
the famous off-location parties - guerilla affairs set up in some basement somewhere - happen less and less often simply because the basements are now all graphic design companies and law firms .
if you want to party in a basement , you have to go to the spandau district now . but is it all bad news ?
not necessarily .
ellen allien , dj and founder of label bpitch control , recently said in an interview with flavorwire : " a lot of times people move to the city for just three years or something and then they go back to america or italy or whatever .
but they bring the impact , the energy .
that 's really good for the scene , because we have all these new people doing something , trying something .
that 's why the music scene here is super dynamic . " but she also warned that " rich people just visiting for the weekend " are what is " killing the city .
but as long as people keep moving here , berlin will remain cool . " a common fate for capital cities it seems not a week goes by these days without some anti-gentrification demo taking place somewhere in berlin .
prenzlauer berg and mitte , once grim east berlin wastelands , are now lost to the yuppies so the fight is on to stem the flow before kreuzberg , friedrichshain and neukoelln go the same way .
take a quick peek at the non-political website brennende-autos.de and you 'll see that the current trend for torching a fancy motor as a symbolic " f * * k you " to the yuppies all takes place within the central districts mentioned above - such is the feeling of territorialism in these areas . the wave of transforming an area into something upmarket and appealing to people with higher-end incomes , is something which has already wrecked a number of the world 's capitals . " gentrification can certainly be an enormous problem for nightlife and a city 's creative essence , " dj and journalist jonty skrufff told me .
" you only have to look at new york and london and how their club scenes have been watered down , marginalized and ruined by rich incomers to understand what can happen , " he told me . now that london has become expensive and the trend-setting clubs have closed , " horrible expensive bars have moved in and every weekend hordes of drunken office workers descend on the area making it unpleasant for the few freaks left who previously made the area so interesting and creative , " he added . a lose-lose situation djs , freaks and flamboyant queers hate the gentrification " afflicting " their once bohemian neighborhoods ; real estate companies and housing associations think they are making the area more pleasant for everyone .
it 's a lose-lose situation , as the two sides of the argument are both valid and can not be reconciled .
gentrification , beautification , sanitation ; whatever you want to call it , the floodgates opened years ago and it 's unlikely to stop anytime soon .
the process will only reach an end once all the creativity and quirkiness which makes berlin berlin has been squeezed out .
sad but true . as for me ?
well , i never much cared for fashion to the extent that it should dictate which street i live in .
my needs are very simple ; so long as there 's somewhere to lock my bike and buy coffee and cigarettes , i 'm happy .
i do n't really care if my neighbors are lefty anarchists or sharp-suited architects because , at the end of the day , i hate everyone in equal measure anyway . the incurably grumpy neale lytollis currently lives in kreuzberg , above a cigarette kiosk . editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some 1,600 tribal elders and religious leaders agreed to make peace with the taliban .
but prospects of peace are bleak , says deutsche welle 's ratbil shamel . once again a jirga has come to an end in kabul and once again it has done what the ruling government wanted . namely , it has presented the government 's suggestions as the people 's wishes .
this time , the jirga has handed the government a mandate to enter peace negotiations with the taliban .
it would like hizb-e-islami , the party of the warlord and politician gulbuddin hekmatyar , to be involved as well . the jirga wants the afghan government and the international community to guarantee political and legal security to all those who reject the taliban and al qaeda . the taliban will also be called upon to discuss their demands with kabul and to stop working with the terrorist organization al qaeda .
all fighting parties will be asked to protect the safety and rights of the civilian population instead of putting them in danger .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan delegates walk outside the site of the peace jirga in kabul the demands of the peace jirga are very much in tune with the afghan president 's wishes .
he has been trying to persuade the taliban to come to the negotiating table for at least five years but to little avail .
at first , he could not convince anyone of his idea to integrate moderate taliban back into public life , finding support for it neither at home nor abroad .
but half a decade later , he has succeeded . the population has wanted nothing but peace in over 30 years of war .
in the past nine years , the us and its allies have not been able to solve the problem of the taliban .
now president hamid karzai , amid general helplessness , has eyed his chance to take things into his own hands at last . but he and his advisors know that for there to be longstanding peace in afghanistan , they not only need the us on their side , but also regional big powers such as russia , china and india . there can also be no peace without the close cooperation of pakistan , iran and saudi arabia . all these countries see their fundamental interests threatened by an afghanistan under us influence .
this means that a peace jirga in kabul only makes sense if prior agreements have been made between the us and afghanistan 's neighbors .
however , these have never been made . moreover , the taliban and al qaeda will never be ready to agree to peace in afghanistan as long as there are places they can retreat to abroad and people willing to support them . the taliban and al qaeda leadership want the establishment of a worldwide islamic empire .
they want this world to be cleansed of unbelievers .

this means that a peace jirga in kabul only makes sense if prior agreements have been made between the us and afghanistan 's neighbors .
however , these have never been made . moreover , the taliban and al qaeda will never be ready to agree to peace in afghanistan as long as there are places they can retreat to abroad and people willing to support them . the taliban and al qaeda leadership want the establishment of a worldwide islamic empire .
they want this world to be cleansed of unbelievers .
so , the resolutions of a peace jirga are meaningless to taliban and al qaeda leaders .
they will continue their fight in afghanistan . author : ratbil shamel / act editor : disha uppal send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the host nation is hoping to reap the same benefits germany did four years ago . south africa is abuzz with activity with just one week to go to the kick-off of the 2010 fifa world cup in johannesburg on june 11 .
from transport and tourist arrangements to stadiums and soccer , officials and entrepreneurs in south africa 's nine host cities have been finalizing their arrangements to ensure the country is ready for the long-awaited football extravaganza .
they 've been drawing on the experience of germany , which hosted the 2006 competition .
although germany failed to lift the trophy , the country did win in other respects : its international image received a massive boost and consumer confidence shot up .
this time round , south africa is keen to reap the same benefits .
the country has taken a risk by investing billions of euros in infrastructure , stadiums and roads in preparation for the big event .
the goal is to increase foreign tourism , trade and investment long after the final whistle is blown .
nikolaus eberl , a german branding expert who is in south africa to help the country with its marketing and branding ahead of the 2010 competition , believes south africa can learn from germany , which rebranded itself as a " welcoming , fun , modern and innovative nation " during the last world cup .
" germans took a hard look at their image as ' effective but unfriendly , " ' he said .
" and then devised a nation-building strategy that promised the world ' a time to make friends . " '
the strategy paid off and tourism shot up 31 percent soon after the end of the world cup .

"
germany also propelled itself from seventh to second most valued brand in the 2006 nation brands index -lrb- anholt-gmi q3/2006 -rrb- .
south africa is hoping to pick up where germany left off through its " welcoming the world to africa " slogan , backed up by a range of initiatives .
cities are staging welcoming campaigns , service personnel have been trained to be ambassadors , people are learning french , german , spanish and italian , while thousands of people will help in and around the stadiums as volunteers .

he works in community development in south africa and is involved in the football for hope program in south africa which spans townships across the country .
" i experienced germany 's world cup , and it was amazing how people opened up in the excitement of the event , " he said .
this experience only made him more determined to be involved in south africa 's world cup .
" i knew i wanted to be part of this , " said sharon banda , another volunteer .
" meeting people from all over the world and showing them how great africa is . "
' brand advocates ' make up for drop in expected visitors football fever has been rising as the tournament draws closer .
in johannesburg and other cities , south african flags and those of the 32 nations competing in the world cup are flying from car windows - and the excitement is palpable .
initially south africa had estimated that 400,000 visitors would be coming to the country for the world cup .
however , south africa 's tourism minister , marthinus van schalkwyk , announced that closer to 300,000 fans were expected from across the globe .
while the direct numbers may be down , eberl estimates that for each visitor to the world cup , another 150 will be indirectly influenced in their perceptions about the host country , through word-of-mouth by the fans when they return home . and these brand advocates could hold the key to long-term benefits for south africa .
bildunterschrift : the most important branding south africa is hoping for will come from the fans themselves south africa is also banking on the global television coverage it gets when matches are screened worldwide .
the world cup offers south africa the opportunity to market the country as a business destination and a springboard into developing markets in the southern african region .
matthias boddenberg , chief executive of the southern african german chamber of commerce , said south africa should focus on promoting trade and investment in areas like mining and energy , particularly the use of renewable energy and exports from its manufacturing sector .
" south africa is a beautiful country offering unbelievable opportunities , " he said .
" but it is also a country facing big challenges in terms of inequality and crime .
south africa should not fall into the trap of painting a perfect picture .
the message should be realistic , yet optimistic . "

his assumption will most likely stir up controversy at the deutsche welle global media forum .
brayne will be leading a workshop that looks at the role of the media and reporting on the psychology of climate change .
this year ’ s conference , entitled “ the heat is on – climate change and the media ” , will take place from june 21-23 in bonn .
for brayne , it comes down to the mindset .
“ journalists are no different from businessmen or politicians in their / our inability to respond to the existential threat of climate change and resources depletion , ” he said in an interview with deutsche welle .
“ like all human beings , we respond in ways that are programmed by millions of years of evolution , identifying and meeting immediate needs and indulging immediate greeds , and failing to see these in the context of longer-term survival . ”
he went on to say that unless politicians , business leaders and voters really understand how desperately serious things are , there is no hope of that change .
“ and what is our most powerful tool for determining and changing what people think ?
the media , ” said brayne .
“ paradoxically , by courageously facing and reporting what i believe to be the inevitability of collapse , we might yet avert it .
perhaps . “ brayne became well-known for founding the dart center for journalism and trauma in london .
he was also director of the center until 2008 .
after 30 years of working as a reporter and correspondent for reuters and the bbc – in which team he covered global events like the massacre at tiananmen square in 1989 – he trained to become a psychological therapist .
brayne says that many correspondents in areas of conflict can ’ t forget what they have seen – and he wants to help them . more than 50 individual events in 2010 , the deutsche welle global media forum once again offers more than 50 events including podium discussions and workshops , interactive presentations and exhibitions , networking and interesting side events .
it takes place at the world conference center bonn , close to deutsche welle ’ s headquarters .
deutsche welle is cooperating with many different organizations for this interdisciplinary conference , including the unesco , the united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , the international human dimensions program on global environmental change -lrb- un ihdp / essp -rrb- , eu commission and the world bank , the wuppertal institute , world wildlife fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- , nabu and the climate alliance , the institute for world business kiel , german development institute -lrb- die -rrb- , the center for development research -lrb- zef -rrb- and many others .
co-host of the deutsche welle global media forum is the foundation for international dialogue of the sparkasse in bonn .
the convention is also supported by germany ’ s federal foreign office , the family , women and integration ministry of the german state of north rhine-westphalia , european funds for regional development , the city of bonn , dhl , the ksb group and faber-castell .

deutsche welle spoke with alexander rahr , a russia expert at the german council on foreign relations , about the state of russo-german relations and what is likely to be discussed at the meeting .
dw : germany has joined permanent members of the un security council , which include russia , in calling for sanctions against iran .
what aspects of the dispute with iran will the two leaders be discussing .
alexander rahr : angela merkel stands clearly on the us position that sanctions against iran are necessary .
we have seen that russia has slightly changed its previously stubborn position on this issue , it is now moving toward western positions .
and the meeting with merkel will probably demonstrate that russia is indeed willing to support more sanctions as it was ready to do a couple of weeks ago .
what has prompted this change on russia 's part ?
russia came to the conclusion that what the west has always said is true that iran is indeed building a nuclear bomb , and that this nuclear bomb will indeed threaten russia .
i think that obama could do more to convince medvedev to join the western anti-iranian coalition , and he did it also by changing his policy on central-eastern europe .
we remember , the united states wanted to install anti-missile defense infrastructure in poland and the czech republic , but russia feels threatened by that .
and out of this threat and out of this conflict which arose with the united states , russia somehow felt sympathetic in a way toward iran .
now the iranian leadership itself has accused russia of being an enemy of iran .
the bridges between tehran and moscow seem to have burned , and that will help russia to make the right decisions , and mrs. merkel will try to move medvedev closer to western positions .
both russia and germany are going to be attending the g-20 meeting in toronto this month , at which financial market regulation will be a key issue .
is there much common ground between berlin and moscow on this issue ?
there is no real common ground because russia is not yet a part of the global financial system as germany and the united states and many other of the g-20 states are .
but russia is very much interested not to go to the summit of the g-20 with an individual position .
it wants to join the position of other states .
it wants to be part of states who could maybe propose certain agendas .
and russia is very much interested in negotiating with germany a kind of pre-position before going to this summit , to have germany on its side when decisions will be taken about the future financial system of the world , about what the probable change of the wto rules , about the world economic system .
it is very important for russia .

could pricing the earth be the way to save it – and ourselves ? great extinctions come and go .
the earth has experienced five in the last half-a-billion years , and a number of lesser extinctions as well .
usually , they 're unleashed by a cataclysmic event – an asteroid impact or a super volcano .
scientists speculate that sometimes they 've been triggered by gradual changes in the earth 's atmosphere .
but what makes the so-called ' sixth great extinction ' distinctive is us .
this time around we are present to witness it .
we also happen to be driving it . according to the latest global biodiversity outlook released last month , extinction rates may be up to 1,000 times higher than the background rate – the normal pace of extinction that has accompanied evolution on earth .
bleak outlook bildunterschrift : tigers are set to become extinct in the wild in 15 years the decline is happening across the spectrum of life .
species are disappearing ; genetic variety – a safeguard against disease – is being lost ; and whole ecosystems , whose processes provide everything from habitats to the quality of our air , water and soils , are retreating .
some are faring worse than others .
amphibians face the greatest risk and corals are deteriorating most rapidly .
while the number of vertebrate species fell by nearly a third on average between 1970 and 1996 , nearly a quarter of all plant species are estimated to be threatened with extinction .
in the last 110 years , india 's wild tiger population has fallen by over 97.5 percent thanks to poaching and competition for land with humans .
" if business as usual continues , one can expect them -lrb- tigers -rrb- to be all extinct by 2025 , " says dr ashok khosla , president of the international union for conservation of nature -lrb- iucn -rrb- , the organization which catalogues the world 's species in its so-called ' red lists . '
another example which khosla likes to cite from his native india is the sudden plunge in vulture populations in south asia , which saw the birds ' population drop from 40 million to 60,000 within a decade of the year 1992 .
" it was discovered that a hormone fed to cattle for more milk was getting into the vultures … within eight years governments in india and nepal and elsewhere had taken - luckily for us - action to stop the decline , but they were down to virtually extinct , " khosla said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the only known medication for childhood leukaemia comes from this threatened flower a human-shaped footprint the drivers for the loss of biodiversity can all be traced – directly or indirectly – to humans .
the principle pressures include habitat change -lrb- think monocultures and clear-felling -rrb- , overexploitation -lrb- consider the ocean 's fish stocks -rrb- , pollution , invasive alien species -lrb- whose advances into new territories are usually abetted by people -rrb- and climate change .
in stark contrast to most of our fellow tenants on this planet , the human population has exploded in the last century .
in 1900 , the world 's population was 1.6 billion people .
today it is roughly 6.9 billion and expected to rise to nine billion by 2050 .
we 've also been consuming more .
according to this year 's consumption report by the world watch institute , the average american consumes six times as much today as he did in 1960 .
our numbers and behavior already suck up the resources of 1.4 planets , says the global footprint network .
according to its ' moderate ' business as usual trends , we will need two planets to sustain us by 2050 .
these figures have led to a growing sense of alarm in some quarters , and mounting calls for radical change . " it takes by our collective bio-capacity at the moment 18 months to provide 12 months of natural goods and services , and it 's heading in the wrong direction , " says andrew simms , a policy director at the new economics foundation , a green-oriented think tank .
" so if we ask ourselves if orthodox price mechanisms are working at the moment , well obviously they 're not , because they 're not turning things around . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank economist pavan sukhdev is auditing nature services rendered if living beyond our natural means comes with a cost , then putting a figure on that cost is the difficult job of pavan sukhdev , an economist at deutsche bank .
the banker is on loan to the united nations environment program where he runs a study called the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity -lrb- teeb -rrb- .
the idea grew out of the stern report of 2006 which laid out the economic case for tackling climate change .
" economics today is the currency of policy , " sukhdev told a recent biodiversity conference . " no matter how strong , no matter how emotive , no matter how powerful and no matter how human your arguments to do anything in this world , we are at a stage today where you will also be asked for economic justification .
so whether you like it or not – indeed whether i like it or not – there will be a case of tradeoffs being evaluated . "
from pollinating crops – a service worth up to seven billion dollars in the us , according to studies there – to wetlands ' capacity to mitigate storm damage , there are myriad ways that ecosystems provide services not factored into our economies .
nine-out-of-ten new medicines is derived from something found in nature .
according to teeb 's interim report , we are sacrificing 1.3 to 3.1 trillion euros -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- worth of ecosystems services every year as our economies continue to treat the environment as an ' externality . '
to put that in perspective , that 's up to twice the cost of failing to tackle climate change .
or to put it another way , it 's the financial crisis every three years .
yet even some potential allies remain wary of the drive to a market solution .
" we 're faced with what i would call the paradox of environmental economics , " said andrew simms .
" how , for example , would you put a price on the marginal ton of carbon , which when burnt , puts us on a path to runaway climate change ?
you 're basically asking ' what is the price of civilization ? '
even if a market allowed for the trading of that ton of carbon , i would argue that it should not be allowed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrew simms is concerned about the distinction between value and price squaring the circle nevertheless , if teeb 's aim is to rouse decision-makers to action out of concern for their state coffers , then there are signs that it 's bearing fruit .
this year 's green week -lrb- 1-4 june -rrb- , an annual environment conference organized by the european union , was dedicated to the issue of biodiversity , and the bloc 's executive used the event to announce two new tools aimed at halting biodiversity loss .
recognizing the need for accurate information , the bloc 's executive and the european environment agency unveiled a centralized clearing house for data called bise – the biodiversity information system for europe . taking a page out of the climate change play-book , they also established a " biodiversity baseline " , which will be used to offer a snapshot of trends and measure progress on goals .
but as useful as the common starting point of 1990 levels of carbon emissions has been for climate action , how do you make a baseline for something as complex as biodiversity ?
the eu 's initial groping efforts have produced a five-page brochure with 15 charts .
though it 's not as intuitively clear as a target for cutting emissions , it is an important step that will " help us review our actions and take tangible new measures , " according to environment commissioner janez potocnik .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could european farmers be paid to make wildlife reserves ?
rethinking the cap and other innovative ideas may be on their way .
the eu 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- – a 50-billion-euro-a-year program of farm subsidies – has long been controversial for its distortion of trade and impact on developing countries .
there are now mounting calls to pay famers the money for habitat restoration instead , and at a fraction of the cost . a recent policy paper by the european centre for international political economy found that " substantial " environmental gains could be secured at half the cost of the current cap .
yet reforming agriculture – a sector that eats up half the eu 's budget – has always been a quagmire , despite the optimistic view , on the part of the eu 's most senior environmental bureaucrat , that things are beginning to change .
" we will definitely see support for agriculture tied more and more – i ca n't say exclusively – to respect for the environment , and ecologically friendlier forms of production , " karl falkenberg , director general of the environment commission , told deutsche welle .
in any event , europe will have to move fast if it is to have any shot at halting - and reversing - the loss of biodiversity , as it aims to do by 2020 .
like every region in the world , it failed to meet this year 's deadline to halt biodiversity loss , a target laid down with no baseline , little information and no sub-targets in 2002 .
the next goals will be set internationally when the global community gathers in nagoya in october for the next convention on biological diversity conference .
if europe and the world is to avoid another ground hog day , then political leaders will need to find the attention spans – and stomachs – to deal with ' two ' environmental crises at once .

could pricing the earth be the way to save it – and ourselves ? great extinctions come and go .
the earth has experienced five in the last half-a-billion years , and a number of lesser extinctions as well .
usually , they 're unleashed by a cataclysmic event – an asteroid impact or a super volcano .
scientists speculate that sometimes they 've been triggered by gradual changes in the earth 's atmosphere .
but what makes the so-called ' sixth great extinction ' distinctive is us .
this time around we are present to witness it .
we also happen to be driving it . according to the latest global biodiversity outlook released last month , extinction rates may be up to 1,000 times higher than the background rate – the normal pace of extinction that has accompanied evolution on earth .
bleak outlook bildunterschrift : tigers are set to become extinct in the wild in 15 years the decline is happening across the spectrum of life .
species are disappearing ; genetic variety – a safeguard against disease – is being lost ; and whole ecosystems , whose processes provide everything from habitats to the quality of our air , water and soils , are retreating .
some are faring worse than others .
amphibians face the greatest risk and corals are deteriorating most rapidly .
while the number of vertebrate species fell by nearly a third on average between 1970 and 1996 , nearly a quarter of all plant species are estimated to be threatened with extinction .
in the last 110 years , india 's wild tiger population has fallen by over 97.5 percent thanks to poaching and competition for land with humans .
" if business as usual continues , one can expect them -lrb- tigers -rrb- to be all extinct by 2025 , " says dr ashok khosla , president of the international union for conservation of nature -lrb- iucn -rrb- , the organization which catalogues the world 's species in its so-called ' red lists . '
another example which khosla likes to cite from his native india is the sudden plunge in vulture populations in south asia , which saw the birds ' population drop from 40 million to 60,000 within a decade of the year 1992 .
" it was discovered that a hormone fed to cattle for more milk was getting into the vultures … within eight years governments in india and nepal and elsewhere had taken - luckily for us - action to stop the decline , but they were down to virtually extinct , " khosla said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the only known medication for childhood leukaemia comes from this threatened flower a human-shaped footprint the drivers for the loss of biodiversity can all be traced – directly or indirectly – to humans .
the principle pressures include habitat change -lrb- think monocultures and clear-felling -rrb- , overexploitation -lrb- consider the ocean 's fish stocks -rrb- , pollution , invasive alien species -lrb- whose advances into new territories are usually abetted by people -rrb- and climate change .
in stark contrast to most of our fellow tenants on this planet , the human population has exploded in the last century .
in 1900 , the world 's population was 1.6 billion people .
today it is roughly 6.9 billion and expected to rise to nine billion by 2050 .
we 've also been consuming more .
according to this year 's consumption report by the world watch institute , the average american consumes six times as much today as he did in 1960 .
our numbers and behavior already suck up the resources of 1.4 planets , says the global footprint network .
according to its ' moderate ' business as usual trends , we will need two planets to sustain us by 2050 .
these figures have led to a growing sense of alarm in some quarters , and mounting calls for radical change . " it takes by our collective bio-capacity at the moment 18 months to provide 12 months of natural goods and services , and it 's heading in the wrong direction , " says andrew simms , a policy director at the new economics foundation , a green-oriented think tank .
" so if we ask ourselves if orthodox price mechanisms are working at the moment , well obviously they 're not , because they 're not turning things around . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank economist pavan sukhdev is auditing nature services rendered if living beyond our natural means comes with a cost , then putting a figure on that cost is the difficult job of pavan sukhdev , an economist at deutsche bank .
the banker is on loan to the united nations environment program where he runs a study called the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity -lrb- teeb -rrb- .
the idea grew out of the stern report of 2006 which laid out the economic case for tackling climate change .
" economics today is the currency of policy , " sukhdev told a recent biodiversity conference . " no matter how strong , no matter how emotive , no matter how powerful and no matter how human your arguments to do anything in this world , we are at a stage today where you will also be asked for economic justification .
so whether you like it or not – indeed whether i like it or not – there will be a case of tradeoffs being evaluated . "
from pollinating crops – a service worth up to seven billion dollars in the us , according to studies there – to wetlands ' capacity to mitigate storm damage , there are myriad ways that ecosystems provide services not factored into our economies .
nine-out-of-ten new medicines is derived from something found in nature .
according to teeb 's interim report , we are sacrificing 1.3 to 3.1 trillion euros -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- worth of ecosystems services every year as our economies continue to treat the environment as an ' externality . '
to put that in perspective , that 's up to twice the cost of failing to tackle climate change .
or to put it another way , it 's the financial crisis every three years .
yet even some potential allies remain wary of the drive to a market solution .
" we 're faced with what i would call the paradox of environmental economics , " said andrew simms .
" how , for example , would you put a price on the marginal ton of carbon , which when burnt , puts us on a path to runaway climate change ?
you 're basically asking ' what is the price of civilization ? '

human rights experts are calling for action and prosecutions for those responsible . the first global investigation of secret detention facilities conducted by the united nations found that in 66 of 192 un nations , several thousand people have been detained in secret facilities and even tortured since the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the united states .
arbitrary arrests and disappearances , shadowy prisons and criminal interrogation methods were all common practices in earlier centuries , but since the 9/11 attacks , these kinds of violations of international human rights rules have become more and more frequent .
they almost all happen under the guise of preventing terrorism , the 220-page un report said .
included on the list of those countries with secret prisons are three permanent members of the un security council - china , russia and the united states .
they are accompanied by afghanistan , india , pakistan and several african countries as well as european states , such as poland , romania , bosnia-herzegovina and lithuania .
crimes again humanity ?
" secret detention amounts to an enforced disappearance , and if resorted to in a widespread or systematic manner , it might reach the threshold of a crime against humanity , " manfred nowak , the un 's special rapporteur on torture and one of the report 's authors , said during debate on the report on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report 's authors concluded that secret detention ' violates a number of human rights amd humanitarian law norms ' the dimensions of the problem could be even greater than the report lays out .
the detailed questionnaire that nowak , martin scheinin , the un special rapporteur on human rights and counter terrorism , as well as other un experts formulated and sent to the un 's 192 member countries was only answered by 44 .
of these , not one admitted to the existence of secret prisons .
the report 's authors depended on independent sources for their investigation and many countries denied them any kind of access to relevant materials or sources .
denial and censorship during the debate , china , russia , pakistan , sri lanka , syria , algeria and other african nations denied that any secret detention facilities existed on their territory .
they accused the report 's authors of sloppy research , of overstepping their mandate and of compiling the report without being commissioned to do so by the un human rights council .
" we are concerned at the unprofessional way in which the report was written and presented , " said syria 's representative to the council .
" the report makes use of unverified allegations by non-credible parties and presents them as fact . "
in march , pakistan and other nations called for the report , which was scheduled to be discussed then , to be removed from the un agenda , and the belgian president of the council agreed to that demand .
in the meantime , russia and pakistan have asked that the report be removed from the un 's website and that debate around it be terminated .
however , this call for censorship failed in the wake of objections from independent human rights groups .
scant support only a few un states , including sweden , canada and south africa , gave their unreserved approval to the report during the debate of the human rights council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un said " secret detention should be explicitly prohibited " the us ambassador to the un , susan rice , underlined the fact that president barack obama has announced the closing of the us prison at guantanamo bay , cuba , although it was never a secret facility .
however , she made no comment on the bagram facility , the main detention facility for persons detained by us forces in afghanistan , or other formerly secret prisons in third countries where american officials sent prisoners who were then often subjected to harsh interrogation procedures or torture .
the report 's authors called for the immediate closure of all secret detention facilities as well as for compensation for those who were victims of illegal imprisonment and torture .
no former detainee has yet to receive any kind of compensation .
both nowak and scheinin said they hoped that the human rights council would pass a resolution on the matter , although after the debate and opposition to the report , that wish is seen as fairly unrealistic .

human rights experts are calling for action and prosecutions for those responsible . the first global investigation of secret detention facilities conducted by the united nations found that in 66 of 192 un nations , several thousand people have been detained in secret facilities and even tortured since the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the united states .
arbitrary arrests and disappearances , shadowy prisons and criminal interrogation methods were all common practices in earlier centuries , but since the 9/11 attacks , these kinds of violations of international human rights rules have become more and more frequent .
they almost all happen under the guise of preventing terrorism , the 220-page un report said .
included on the list of those countries with secret prisons are three permanent members of the un security council - china , russia and the united states .
they are accompanied by afghanistan , india , pakistan and several african countries as well as european states , such as poland , romania , bosnia-herzegovina and lithuania .
crimes again humanity ?
" secret detention amounts to an enforced disappearance , and if resorted to in a widespread or systematic manner , it might reach the threshold of a crime against humanity , " manfred nowak , the un 's special rapporteur on torture and one of the report 's authors , said during debate on the report on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report 's authors concluded that secret detention ' violates a number of human rights amd humanitarian law norms ' the dimensions of the problem could be even greater than the report lays out .
the detailed questionnaire that nowak , martin scheinin , the un special rapporteur on human rights and counter terrorism , as well as other un experts formulated and sent to the un 's 192 member countries was only answered by 44 .
of these , not one admitted to the existence of secret prisons .
the report 's authors depended on independent sources for their investigation and many countries denied them any kind of access to relevant materials or sources .
denial and censorship during the debate , china , russia , pakistan , sri lanka , syria , algeria and other african nations denied that any secret detention facilities existed on their territory .
they accused the report 's authors of sloppy research , of overstepping their mandate and of compiling the report without being commissioned to do so by the un human rights council .
" we are concerned at the unprofessional way in which the report was written and presented , " said syria 's representative to the council .
" the report makes use of unverified allegations by non-credible parties and presents them as fact . "
in march , pakistan and other nations called for the report , which was scheduled to be discussed then , to be removed from the un agenda , and the belgian president of the council agreed to that demand .
in the meantime , russia and pakistan have asked that the report be removed from the un 's website and that debate around it be terminated .
however , this call for censorship failed in the wake of objections from independent human rights groups .
scant support only a few un states , including sweden , canada and south africa , gave their unreserved approval to the report during the debate of the human rights council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un said " secret detention should be explicitly prohibited " the us ambassador to the un , susan rice , underlined the fact that president barack obama has announced the closing of the us prison at guantanamo bay , cuba , although it was never a secret facility .
however , she made no comment on the bagram facility , the main detention facility for persons detained by us forces in afghanistan , or other formerly secret prisons in third countries where american officials sent prisoners who were then often subjected to harsh interrogation procedures or torture .
the report 's authors called for the immediate closure of all secret detention facilities as well as for compensation for those who were victims of illegal imprisonment and torture .
no former detainee has yet to receive any kind of compensation .
both nowak and scheinin said they hoped that the human rights council would pass a resolution on the matter , although after the debate and opposition to the report , that wish is seen as fairly unrealistic .

arbitrary arrests and disappearances , shadowy prisons and criminal interrogation methods were all common practices in earlier centuries , but since the 9/11 attacks , these kinds of violations of international human rights rules have become more and more frequent .
they almost all happen under the guise of preventing terrorism , the 220-page un report said .
included on the list of those countries with secret prisons are three permanent members of the un security council - china , russia and the united states .
they are accompanied by afghanistan , india , pakistan and several african countries as well as european states , such as poland , romania , bosnia-herzegovina and lithuania .
crimes again humanity ?
" secret detention amounts to an enforced disappearance , and if resorted to in a widespread or systematic manner , it might reach the threshold of a crime against humanity , " manfred nowak , the un 's special rapporteur on torture and one of the report 's authors , said during debate on the report on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report 's authors concluded that secret detention ' violates a number of human rights amd humanitarian law norms ' the dimensions of the problem could be even greater than the report lays out .
the detailed questionnaire that nowak , martin scheinin , the un special rapporteur on human rights and counter terrorism , as well as other un experts formulated and sent to the un 's 192 member countries was only answered by 44 .
of these , not one admitted to the existence of secret prisons .
the report 's authors depended on independent sources for their investigation and many countries denied them any kind of access to relevant materials or sources .
denial and censorship during the debate , china , russia , pakistan , sri lanka , syria , algeria and other african nations denied that any secret detention facilities existed on their territory .
they accused the report 's authors of sloppy research , of overstepping their mandate and of compiling the report without being commissioned to do so by the un human rights council .
" we are concerned at the unprofessional way in which the report was written and presented , " said syria 's representative to the council .
" the report makes use of unverified allegations by non-credible parties and presents them as fact . "
in march , pakistan and other nations called for the report , which was scheduled to be discussed then , to be removed from the un agenda , and the belgian president of the council agreed to that demand .
in the meantime , russia and pakistan have asked that the report be removed from the un 's website and that debate around it be terminated .
however , this call for censorship failed in the wake of objections from independent human rights groups .
scant support only a few un states , including sweden , canada and south africa , gave their unreserved approval to the report during the debate of the human rights council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un said " secret detention should be explicitly prohibited " the us ambassador to the un , susan rice , underlined the fact that president barack obama has announced the closing of the us prison at guantanamo bay , cuba , although it was never a secret facility .
however , she made no comment on the bagram facility , the main detention facility for persons detained by us forces in afghanistan , or other formerly secret prisons in third countries where american officials sent prisoners who were then often subjected to harsh interrogation procedures or torture .
the report 's authors called for the immediate closure of all secret detention facilities as well as for compensation for those who were victims of illegal imprisonment and torture .
no former detainee has yet to receive any kind of compensation .
both nowak and scheinin said they hoped that the human rights council would pass a resolution on the matter , although after the debate and opposition to the report , that wish is seen as fairly unrealistic .

his assumption will most likely stir up controversy at the deutsche welle global media forum .
brayne will be leading a workshop that looks at the role of the media and reporting on the psychology of climate change .
this year ’ s conference , entitled “ the heat is on – climate change and the media ” , will take place from june 21-23 in bonn .
for brayne , it comes down to the mindset .
“ journalists are no different from businessmen or politicians in their / our inability to respond to the existential threat of climate change and resources depletion , ” he said in an interview with deutsche welle .
“ like all human beings , we respond in ways that are programmed by millions of years of evolution , identifying and meeting immediate needs and indulging immediate greeds , and failing to see these in the context of longer-term survival . ”
he went on to say that unless politicians , business leaders and voters really understand how desperately serious things are , there is no hope of that change .
“ and what is our most powerful tool for determining and changing what people think ?
the media , ” said brayne .
“ paradoxically , by courageously facing and reporting what i believe to be the inevitability of collapse , we might yet avert it .
perhaps . “ brayne became well-known for founding the dart center for journalism and trauma in london .
he was also director of the center until 2008 .
after 30 years of working as a reporter and correspondent for reuters and the bbc – in which team he covered global events like the massacre at tiananmen square in 1989 – he trained to become a psychological therapist .
brayne says that many correspondents in areas of conflict can ’ t forget what they have seen – and he wants to help them . more than 50 individual events in 2010 , the deutsche welle global media forum once again offers more than 50 events including podium discussions and workshops , interactive presentations and exhibitions , networking and interesting side events .
it takes place at the world conference center bonn , close to deutsche welle ’ s headquarters .
deutsche welle is cooperating with many different organizations for this interdisciplinary conference , including the unesco , the united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , the international human dimensions program on global environmental change -lrb- un ihdp / essp -rrb- , eu commission and the world bank , the wuppertal institute , world wildlife fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- , nabu and the climate alliance , the institute for world business kiel , german development institute -lrb- die -rrb- , the center for development research -lrb- zef -rrb- and many others .
co-host of the deutsche welle global media forum is the foundation for international dialogue of the sparkasse in bonn .
the convention is also supported by germany ’ s federal foreign office , the family , women and integration ministry of the german state of north rhine-westphalia , european funds for regional development , the city of bonn , dhl , the ksb group and faber-castell .

could pricing the earth be the way to save it – and ourselves ? great extinctions come and go .
the earth has experienced five in the last half-a-billion years , and a number of lesser extinctions as well .
usually , they 're unleashed by a cataclysmic event – an asteroid impact or a super volcano .
scientists speculate that sometimes they 've been triggered by gradual changes in the earth 's atmosphere .
but what makes the so-called ' sixth great extinction ' distinctive is us .
this time around we are present to witness it .
we also happen to be driving it . according to the latest global biodiversity outlook released last month , extinction rates may be up to 1,000 times higher than the background rate – the normal pace of extinction that has accompanied evolution on earth .
bleak outlook bildunterschrift : tigers are set to become extinct in the wild in 15 years the decline is happening across the spectrum of life .
species are disappearing ; genetic variety – a safeguard against disease – is being lost ; and whole ecosystems , whose processes provide everything from habitats to the quality of our air , water and soils , are retreating .
some are faring worse than others .
amphibians face the greatest risk and corals are deteriorating most rapidly .
while the number of vertebrate species fell by nearly a third on average between 1970 and 1996 , nearly a quarter of all plant species are estimated to be threatened with extinction .
in the last 110 years , india 's wild tiger population has fallen by over 97.5 percent thanks to poaching and competition for land with humans .
" if business as usual continues , one can expect them -lrb- tigers -rrb- to be all extinct by 2025 , " says dr ashok khosla , president of the international union for conservation of nature -lrb- iucn -rrb- , the organization which catalogues the world 's species in its so-called ' red lists . '
another example which khosla likes to cite from his native india is the sudden plunge in vulture populations in south asia , which saw the birds ' population drop from 40 million to 60,000 within a decade of the year 1992 .
" it was discovered that a hormone fed to cattle for more milk was getting into the vultures … within eight years governments in india and nepal and elsewhere had taken - luckily for us - action to stop the decline , but they were down to virtually extinct , " khosla said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the only known medication for childhood leukaemia comes from this threatened flower a human-shaped footprint the drivers for the loss of biodiversity can all be traced – directly or indirectly – to humans .
the principle pressures include habitat change -lrb- think monocultures and clear-felling -rrb- , overexploitation -lrb- consider the ocean 's fish stocks -rrb- , pollution , invasive alien species -lrb- whose advances into new territories are usually abetted by people -rrb- and climate change .
in stark contrast to most of our fellow tenants on this planet , the human population has exploded in the last century .
in 1900 , the world 's population was 1.6 billion people .
today it is roughly 6.9 billion and expected to rise to nine billion by 2050 .
we 've also been consuming more .
according to this year 's consumption report by the world watch institute , the average american consumes six times as much today as he did in 1960 .
our numbers and behavior already suck up the resources of 1.4 planets , says the global footprint network .
according to its ' moderate ' business as usual trends , we will need two planets to sustain us by 2050 .
these figures have led to a growing sense of alarm in some quarters , and mounting calls for radical change . " it takes by our collective bio-capacity at the moment 18 months to provide 12 months of natural goods and services , and it 's heading in the wrong direction , " says andrew simms , a policy director at the new economics foundation , a green-oriented think tank .
" so if we ask ourselves if orthodox price mechanisms are working at the moment , well obviously they 're not , because they 're not turning things around . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank economist pavan sukhdev is auditing nature services rendered if living beyond our natural means comes with a cost , then putting a figure on that cost is the difficult job of pavan sukhdev , an economist at deutsche bank .
the banker is on loan to the united nations environment program where he runs a study called the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity -lrb- teeb -rrb- .
the idea grew out of the stern report of 2006 which laid out the economic case for tackling climate change .
" economics today is the currency of policy , " sukhdev told a recent biodiversity conference . " no matter how strong , no matter how emotive , no matter how powerful and no matter how human your arguments to do anything in this world , we are at a stage today where you will also be asked for economic justification .
so whether you like it or not – indeed whether i like it or not – there will be a case of tradeoffs being evaluated . "
from pollinating crops – a service worth up to seven billion dollars in the us , according to studies there – to wetlands ' capacity to mitigate storm damage , there are myriad ways that ecosystems provide services not factored into our economies .
nine-out-of-ten new medicines is derived from something found in nature .
according to teeb 's interim report , we are sacrificing 1.3 to 3.1 trillion euros -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- worth of ecosystems services every year as our economies continue to treat the environment as an ' externality . '
to put that in perspective , that 's up to twice the cost of failing to tackle climate change .
or to put it another way , it 's the financial crisis every three years .
yet even some potential allies remain wary of the drive to a market solution .
" we 're faced with what i would call the paradox of environmental economics , " said andrew simms .
" how , for example , would you put a price on the marginal ton of carbon , which when burnt , puts us on a path to runaway climate change ?
you 're basically asking ' what is the price of civilization ? '
even if a market allowed for the trading of that ton of carbon , i would argue that it should not be allowed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrew simms is concerned about the distinction between value and price squaring the circle nevertheless , if teeb 's aim is to rouse decision-makers to action out of concern for their state coffers , then there are signs that it 's bearing fruit .
this year 's green week -lrb- 1-4 june -rrb- , an annual environment conference organized by the european union , was dedicated to the issue of biodiversity , and the bloc 's executive used the event to announce two new tools aimed at halting biodiversity loss .
recognizing the need for accurate information , the bloc 's executive and the european environment agency unveiled a centralized clearing house for data called bise – the biodiversity information system for europe . taking a page out of the climate change play-book , they also established a " biodiversity baseline " , which will be used to offer a snapshot of trends and measure progress on goals .
but as useful as the common starting point of 1990 levels of carbon emissions has been for climate action , how do you make a baseline for something as complex as biodiversity ?
the eu 's initial groping efforts have produced a five-page brochure with 15 charts .
though it 's not as intuitively clear as a target for cutting emissions , it is an important step that will " help us review our actions and take tangible new measures , " according to environment commissioner janez potocnik .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could european farmers be paid to make wildlife reserves ?
rethinking the cap and other innovative ideas may be on their way .
the eu 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- – a 50-billion-euro-a-year program of farm subsidies – has long been controversial for its distortion of trade and impact on developing countries .
there are now mounting calls to pay famers the money for habitat restoration instead , and at a fraction of the cost . a recent policy paper by the european centre for international political economy found that " substantial " environmental gains could be secured at half the cost of the current cap .
yet reforming agriculture – a sector that eats up half the eu 's budget – has always been a quagmire , despite the optimistic view , on the part of the eu 's most senior environmental bureaucrat , that things are beginning to change .
" we will definitely see support for agriculture tied more and more – i ca n't say exclusively – to respect for the environment , and ecologically friendlier forms of production , " karl falkenberg , director general of the environment commission , told deutsche welle .
in any event , europe will have to move fast if it is to have any shot at halting - and reversing - the loss of biodiversity , as it aims to do by 2020 .
like every region in the world , it failed to meet this year 's deadline to halt biodiversity loss , a target laid down with no baseline , little information and no sub-targets in 2002 .
the next goals will be set internationally when the global community gathers in nagoya in october for the next convention on biological diversity conference .
if europe and the world is to avoid another ground hog day , then political leaders will need to find the attention spans – and stomachs – to deal with ' two ' environmental crises at once .

" my very first visit to india about 20 years ago inspired me to make the film , " he told deutsche welle .
" i had a really funny experience while watching a bollywood film in a real countryside cinema .
suddenly there was a scene where the stars were dancing in a little village in switzerland and the whole traffic was blocked and the swiss people seemed to be angry . " i just loved the idea of the indian chaos , the colorfulness , the cheerfulness and the craziness coming to switzerland to a very organized little village and mixing everything up .

an indian film crew comes to the swiss highlands to shoot a ubiquitous bollywood drama full of emotion and tears . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it all starts when an indian film crew come to the swiss mountains to shoot a bollywood movie - these are the main leads rajah , played by vijay raaz , is the cook .
the spoilt and attractive main female lead in the drama tries to seduce him but he has no interest .

human rights experts are calling for action and prosecutions for those responsible . the first global investigation of secret detention facilities conducted by the united nations found that in 66 of 192 un nations , several thousand people have been detained in secret facilities and even tortured since the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the united states .
arbitrary arrests and disappearances , shadowy prisons and criminal interrogation methods were all common practices in earlier centuries , but since the 9/11 attacks , these kinds of violations of international human rights rules have become more and more frequent .
they almost all happen under the guise of preventing terrorism , the 220-page un report said .
included on the list of those countries with secret prisons are three permanent members of the un security council - china , russia and the united states .
they are accompanied by afghanistan , india , pakistan and several african countries as well as european states , such as poland , romania , bosnia-herzegovina and lithuania .
crimes again humanity ?
" secret detention amounts to an enforced disappearance , and if resorted to in a widespread or systematic manner , it might reach the threshold of a crime against humanity , " manfred nowak , the un 's special rapporteur on torture and one of the report 's authors , said during debate on the report on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report 's authors concluded that secret detention ' violates a number of human rights amd humanitarian law norms ' the dimensions of the problem could be even greater than the report lays out .
the detailed questionnaire that nowak , martin scheinin , the un special rapporteur on human rights and counter terrorism , as well as other un experts formulated and sent to the un 's 192 member countries was only answered by 44 .
of these , not one admitted to the existence of secret prisons .
the report 's authors depended on independent sources for their investigation and many countries denied them any kind of access to relevant materials or sources .
denial and censorship during the debate , china , russia , pakistan , sri lanka , syria , algeria and other african nations denied that any secret detention facilities existed on their territory .
they accused the report 's authors of sloppy research , of overstepping their mandate and of compiling the report without being commissioned to do so by the un human rights council .
" we are concerned at the unprofessional way in which the report was written and presented , " said syria 's representative to the council .
" the report makes use of unverified allegations by non-credible parties and presents them as fact . "
in march , pakistan and other nations called for the report , which was scheduled to be discussed then , to be removed from the un agenda , and the belgian president of the council agreed to that demand .
in the meantime , russia and pakistan have asked that the report be removed from the un 's website and that debate around it be terminated .
however , this call for censorship failed in the wake of objections from independent human rights groups .
scant support only a few un states , including sweden , canada and south africa , gave their unreserved approval to the report during the debate of the human rights council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un said " secret detention should be explicitly prohibited " the us ambassador to the un , susan rice , underlined the fact that president barack obama has announced the closing of the us prison at guantanamo bay , cuba , although it was never a secret facility .
however , she made no comment on the bagram facility , the main detention facility for persons detained by us forces in afghanistan , or other formerly secret prisons in third countries where american officials sent prisoners who were then often subjected to harsh interrogation procedures or torture .
the report 's authors called for the immediate closure of all secret detention facilities as well as for compensation for those who were victims of illegal imprisonment and torture .
no former detainee has yet to receive any kind of compensation .
both nowak and scheinin said they hoped that the human rights council would pass a resolution on the matter , although after the debate and opposition to the report , that wish is seen as fairly unrealistic .

arbitrary arrests and disappearances , shadowy prisons and criminal interrogation methods were all common practices in earlier centuries , but since the 9/11 attacks , these kinds of violations of international human rights rules have become more and more frequent .
they almost all happen under the guise of preventing terrorism , the 220-page un report said .
included on the list of those countries with secret prisons are three permanent members of the un security council - china , russia and the united states .
they are accompanied by afghanistan , india , pakistan and several african countries as well as european states , such as poland , romania , bosnia-herzegovina and lithuania .
crimes again humanity ?
" secret detention amounts to an enforced disappearance , and if resorted to in a widespread or systematic manner , it might reach the threshold of a crime against humanity , " manfred nowak , the un 's special rapporteur on torture and one of the report 's authors , said during debate on the report on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report 's authors concluded that secret detention ' violates a number of human rights amd humanitarian law norms ' the dimensions of the problem could be even greater than the report lays out .
the detailed questionnaire that nowak , martin scheinin , the un special rapporteur on human rights and counter terrorism , as well as other un experts formulated and sent to the un 's 192 member countries was only answered by 44 .
of these , not one admitted to the existence of secret prisons .
the report 's authors depended on independent sources for their investigation and many countries denied them any kind of access to relevant materials or sources .
denial and censorship during the debate , china , russia , pakistan , sri lanka , syria , algeria and other african nations denied that any secret detention facilities existed on their territory .
they accused the report 's authors of sloppy research , of overstepping their mandate and of compiling the report without being commissioned to do so by the un human rights council .
" we are concerned at the unprofessional way in which the report was written and presented , " said syria 's representative to the council .
" the report makes use of unverified allegations by non-credible parties and presents them as fact . "
in march , pakistan and other nations called for the report , which was scheduled to be discussed then , to be removed from the un agenda , and the belgian president of the council agreed to that demand .
in the meantime , russia and pakistan have asked that the report be removed from the un 's website and that debate around it be terminated .
however , this call for censorship failed in the wake of objections from independent human rights groups .
scant support only a few un states , including sweden , canada and south africa , gave their unreserved approval to the report during the debate of the human rights council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un said " secret detention should be explicitly prohibited " the us ambassador to the un , susan rice , underlined the fact that president barack obama has announced the closing of the us prison at guantanamo bay , cuba , although it was never a secret facility .
however , she made no comment on the bagram facility , the main detention facility for persons detained by us forces in afghanistan , or other formerly secret prisons in third countries where american officials sent prisoners who were then often subjected to harsh interrogation procedures or torture .
the report 's authors called for the immediate closure of all secret detention facilities as well as for compensation for those who were victims of illegal imprisonment and torture .
no former detainee has yet to receive any kind of compensation .
both nowak and scheinin said they hoped that the human rights council would pass a resolution on the matter , although after the debate and opposition to the report , that wish is seen as fairly unrealistic .

with more and more areas transforming into homogenized yuppy-villes , is this the death of kiezkultur ? berliners , so proud of their poverty and punkish attitude to life , find it easy to sneer at yuppies .
and , given that i am not especially materialistic either , i guess i do too .
i do n't have a car , i could n't care a toffee about designer labels and i currently own but two pairs of shoes .
each month is a constant exercise in flying by the seat of my pants when it comes to paying the rent and so long as there 's enough money in the bank for milk and cigarettes , i 'm relatively content . you can therefore imagine that splashy displays of affluence are something that i tend to find rather vulgar .
and i am not the only one .
berliners hate it too .
especially when their tumbledown , graffiti-riddled neighborhoods end up being gutted , sanitized and then invaded by a bizarre species created via stepford wives and l.a. law cross-pollination . the process of gentrification has been striding forward mercilessly since the berlin wall fell back in 1989 .
as many ex-gdr citizens headed for the bright lights of the west , eager capitalists soon swooped down on the former heart of german socialism , bought up the empty properties and began transforming neighborhoods wholesale .
and it has n't stopped since .
the creative bohemians in the city have packed their easels and moved to successive districts to stay ahead of the gentrification tide .
i mean , if you make your meager living selling anti-something-or-other political art , why would you want to live next door to some stuffy doctor and his bland wife ? newcomers bring energy to berlin aside from being rather dreary , your slightly more upper crust neighbors might pose a more serious threat than just ruining your street cred .
what makes a neighborhood , or kiez ?
the people certainly , but also the wacky little shops , the open-all-hours boozer and the night clubs .
move in mr and mrs dull , formerly of conservativeville , who think it 's rather amusing to live in a bombed-out ruin in prenzlauer berg because it 's so " arty " and by the end of week one they 're sending for the police and complaining about the noise . it 's happened time and again ; moaning neighbors and rising rents have seen the demise of berlin heavyweight clubs like rio and scala and seen venues like king kong , once famed for it 's nightly live music roster , have its assets stripped and only do gigs on weekends .
the famous off-location parties - guerilla affairs set up in some basement somewhere - happen less and less often simply because the basements are now all graphic design companies and law firms .
if you want to party in a basement , you have to go to the spandau district now . but is it all bad news ?
not necessarily .
ellen allien , dj and founder of label bpitch control , recently said in an interview with flavorwire : " a lot of times people move to the city for just three years or something and then they go back to america or italy or whatever .
but they bring the impact , the energy .
that 's really good for the scene , because we have all these new people doing something , trying something .
that 's why the music scene here is super dynamic . " but she also warned that " rich people just visiting for the weekend " are what is " killing the city .
but as long as people keep moving here , berlin will remain cool . " a common fate for capital cities it seems not a week goes by these days without some anti-gentrification demo taking place somewhere in berlin .
prenzlauer berg and mitte , once grim east berlin wastelands , are now lost to the yuppies so the fight is on to stem the flow before kreuzberg , friedrichshain and neukoelln go the same way .
take a quick peek at the non-political website brennende-autos.de and you 'll see that the current trend for torching a fancy motor as a symbolic " f * * k you " to the yuppies all takes place within the central districts mentioned above - such is the feeling of territorialism in these areas . the wave of transforming an area into something upmarket and appealing to people with higher-end incomes , is something which has already wrecked a number of the world 's capitals . " gentrification can certainly be an enormous problem for nightlife and a city 's creative essence , " dj and journalist jonty skrufff told me .
" you only have to look at new york and london and how their club scenes have been watered down , marginalized and ruined by rich incomers to understand what can happen , " he told me . now that london has become expensive and the trend-setting clubs have closed , " horrible expensive bars have moved in and every weekend hordes of drunken office workers descend on the area making it unpleasant for the few freaks left who previously made the area so interesting and creative , " he added . a lose-lose situation djs , freaks and flamboyant queers hate the gentrification " afflicting " their once bohemian neighborhoods ; real estate companies and housing associations think they are making the area more pleasant for everyone .
it 's a lose-lose situation , as the two sides of the argument are both valid and can not be reconciled .
gentrification , beautification , sanitation ; whatever you want to call it , the floodgates opened years ago and it 's unlikely to stop anytime soon .
the process will only reach an end once all the creativity and quirkiness which makes berlin berlin has been squeezed out .
sad but true . as for me ?
well , i never much cared for fashion to the extent that it should dictate which street i live in .
my needs are very simple ; so long as there 's somewhere to lock my bike and buy coffee and cigarettes , i 'm happy .
i do n't really care if my neighbors are lefty anarchists or sharp-suited architects because , at the end of the day , i hate everyone in equal measure anyway . the incurably grumpy neale lytollis currently lives in kreuzberg , above a cigarette kiosk . editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

rights groups say it is one of the most persecuted communities in the world - they were made stateless in 1982 , and deemed to be illegal immigrants from bangladesh .
several hundred thousand have since crossed into bangladesh , where people speak a similar language .
this year dhaka has been accused of arresting hundreds of rohingya and forcing them over the border - claims the government denies .
it says it is too poor to help them .
the bbc 's mark dummett spoke to nasima in the kutupalong makeshift camp , which is now home to more than 30,000 rohingyas .
nasima 's baby died as she fled burma back to bangladesh " in burma my people face persecution , so that 's why we come to bangladesh , " nasima said .
" in my family 's case , we came under pressure from the government because we had some property .
" one day , the army accused my father of sheltering someone who had just returned from bangladesh .
anyone who comes back to burma is sent to jail , so it is illegal to look after them .
but that accusation was false .
" they took my father to a military camp and beat him up .
after seven days they sent us his blood-stained clothes and said they would kill him .
" so we sold all our cattle and chickens at the market .
we sent that money to the camp and they then released him .
" later , my brother was attacked by some buddhist people .
he was badly injured and after lots of suffering he eventually died .
" as i grew up , my father decided that i was n't safe in burma .
the government does n't let us marry so he told me to leave for bangladesh .
" we had a relative who was handicapped and a beggar , and she agreed to look after me .
" we took a boat over the river and it was very dangerous .
on the other side we were stopped by the bangladesh rifles -lsb- bdr -rsb- .
" they demanded bribes of 100 taka each -lsb- $ 1.50 -rsb- to let us through , but we only had 100 taka between us .
" ' you must leave the girl with us then , ' the bdr men said .
but my relative refused and argued that she could not move without me helping her .
so finally they let us through . "
police raid nasima said : " i already had one sister in bangladesh but i did n't know where she was living .
so we went to cox 's bazar and lived as beggars .
" sometimes people would give us a little rice or a bit of money to survive .
" finally i met a man who knew my sister .
she was living in alikadam , and her husband came and got me .
nasima says death would be better than life in the camp " i lived there for two years , working as a farm labourer .
life was fine , and i was able to marry and have a child .
" but five days after the baby was born the police arrived .
they came without warning when we were having dinner .
" they rounded up all the burmese men including my husband and my sister 's husband and put them in a police truck .
" i told the police that i had a newborn and that we could not survive without my husband .
" i begged them to let him stay , but they said that the rohingya should expect no mercy .
so i told them to take me too .
" they put me into the lorry and drove us to the river .
" they found a fishing boat and threatened to beat up the captain if he did n't take us to the other side - to burma .
" once we got there , he told us that he had seen some other rohingyas being shot by the nasaka -lsb- the burmese border guards -rsb- , and he told us how to follow the river upstream and then sneak back into bangladesh .
" we walked the whole night and then finally in the morning we got back to this side .
" that 's when i noticed there was something wrong with my baby .
he had died during the journey and i had n't even realised it .
we dug a small hole with our bare hands and buried him there .
" we came to a road and waved to a passing jeep .
we begged the driver to save our lives and take us away from there .
all i had to pay him with was my scarf .
families in the camp are struggling to feed their children " he had heard about the kutupalong camp and said that the rohingya were safe there .
" one week after arriving at the camp my husband said he had to go and find work .
he left and i have no idea where he is now .
" i survive by going into the jungle and collecting firewood to sell .
if i collect some , i can then eat a little .
" this week i have only had three meals .
but i am living alone .
it is much worse for some of the families with 10 or 11 mouths to feed .
" death would be better than this life . "

rights groups say it is one of the most persecuted communities in the world - they were made stateless in 1982 , and deemed to be illegal immigrants from bangladesh .
several hundred thousand have since crossed into bangladesh , where people speak a similar language .
this year dhaka has been accused of arresting hundreds of rohingya and forcing them over the border - claims the government denies .
it says it is too poor to help them .
the bbc 's mark dummett spoke to nasima in the kutupalong makeshift camp , which is now home to more than 30,000 rohingyas .
nasima 's baby died as she fled burma back to bangladesh " in burma my people face persecution , so that 's why we come to bangladesh , " nasima said .
" in my family 's case , we came under pressure from the government because we had some property .
" one day , the army accused my father of sheltering someone who had just returned from bangladesh .
anyone who comes back to burma is sent to jail , so it is illegal to look after them .
but that accusation was false .
" they took my father to a military camp and beat him up .
after seven days they sent us his blood-stained clothes and said they would kill him .
" so we sold all our cattle and chickens at the market .
we sent that money to the camp and they then released him .
" later , my brother was attacked by some buddhist people .
he was badly injured and after lots of suffering he eventually died .
" as i grew up , my father decided that i was n't safe in burma .
the government does n't let us marry so he told me to leave for bangladesh .
" we had a relative who was handicapped and a beggar , and she agreed to look after me .
" we took a boat over the river and it was very dangerous .
on the other side we were stopped by the bangladesh rifles -lsb- bdr -rsb- .
" they demanded bribes of 100 taka each -lsb- $ 1.50 -rsb- to let us through , but we only had 100 taka between us .
" ' you must leave the girl with us then , ' the bdr men said .
but my relative refused and argued that she could not move without me helping her .
so finally they let us through . "
police raid nasima said : " i already had one sister in bangladesh but i did n't know where she was living .
so we went to cox 's bazar and lived as beggars .
" sometimes people would give us a little rice or a bit of money to survive .
" finally i met a man who knew my sister .
she was living in alikadam , and her husband came and got me .
nasima says death would be better than life in the camp " i lived there for two years , working as a farm labourer .
life was fine , and i was able to marry and have a child .
" but five days after the baby was born the police arrived .
they came without warning when we were having dinner .
" they rounded up all the burmese men including my husband and my sister 's husband and put them in a police truck .
" i told the police that i had a newborn and that we could not survive without my husband .
" i begged them to let him stay , but they said that the rohingya should expect no mercy .
so i told them to take me too .
" they put me into the lorry and drove us to the river .
" they found a fishing boat and threatened to beat up the captain if he did n't take us to the other side - to burma .
" once we got there , he told us that he had seen some other rohingyas being shot by the nasaka -lsb- the burmese border guards -rsb- , and he told us how to follow the river upstream and then sneak back into bangladesh .
" we walked the whole night and then finally in the morning we got back to this side .
" that 's when i noticed there was something wrong with my baby .
he had died during the journey and i had n't even realised it .
we dug a small hole with our bare hands and buried him there .
" we came to a road and waved to a passing jeep .
we begged the driver to save our lives and take us away from there .
all i had to pay him with was my scarf .
families in the camp are struggling to feed their children " he had heard about the kutupalong camp and said that the rohingya were safe there .
" one week after arriving at the camp my husband said he had to go and find work .
he left and i have no idea where he is now .
" i survive by going into the jungle and collecting firewood to sell .
if i collect some , i can then eat a little .
" this week i have only had three meals .
but i am living alone .
it is much worse for some of the families with 10 or 11 mouths to feed .
" death would be better than this life . "

by david goldblatt focus on africa magazine picture the scene : the world cup has culminated in a thrilling finale , johannesburg 's soccer city stadium has been swept clean and south african officials are nursing their post-tournament hangovers .
but the nagging headache is not a result of overindulgence - rather it is the question over who is now going to pay for it all .
one thing is for sure , football 's world governing body , fifa , will not be forking out .
fifa will pocket the vast majority of the money raised by the sale of media rights and global sponsorship deals as well as some of the income from ticket sales .
south africa , on the other hand , will be paying the costs .
hosting scramble there are few cast iron laws in economics but one seems to hold - the organisers of sporting mega-events always overestimate the economic benefits and underestimate the costs .
world cup 2010 costs transport - $ 1.2bn stadiums - $ 1.12bn organising committee - $ 428m broadcasting / ict - $ 387m ports of entry - $ 200m security - $ 89m legacy projects - $ 45m telecommunications - $ 40m arts and culture - $ 20m training volunteers - $ 3m total cost - $ 3.5bn source : south african public service commission yet , even in an era of global economic uncertainty , governments are falling over themselves to host tournaments .
ten countries , grouped in eight bids , are fighting to host the world cup in 2018 and 2022 .
they are all armed with reports and projections from management consultants and all believe that they can put on the show at a reasonable cost , returned many times over by the economic benefits that come from hosting .
history , however , suggests a different outcome .
japan 's gigantic infrastructure programme for the 2002 world cup , for one , barely shifted its sluggish economy .
the 2000 sydney olympics , it was argued , would transform future visitor numbers to the city but they have remained static .
then , four years later , the athens games were going to be put on for $ 1.5bn -lrb- £ 1bn -rrb- ; that ended up costing 10 times as much .
fudging the figures economists who have tried to quantify the impact of these occasions on job creation have found that there are almost no long-term employment benefits .
there is , however , ample evidence of underestimated costs - countries left with underused stadiums and facilities which are ruinously expensive to maintain .
this , it seems , could turn out to be the case for the south african world cup too .
fifa 's ruthless defence of its brand often restricts business opportunities in 2004 , when fifa awarded the tournament to the country , consultants grant thornton predicted costs of just $ 300m on stadiums and infrastructure and a boost to gross domestic product of $ 2.9bn.
today we know that $ 300m would not have even covered the cost of rebuilding soccer city , where the opening game and final will be held , let alone the other $ 1bn needed to build and refurbish the other stadiums .
when the costs of upgrading airports , inner city transport , telecoms infrastructure and the actual running of the show are counted , the total bill for the world cup has risen more than tenfold , to almost $ 4bn .
so , as the costs have increased , have the likely economic gains for south africa also increased ?
at this stage , it looks like south africa may struggle to make the $ 3bn originally forecast .
on the other side of the global economic downturn , the projected figures on visitor numbers and their anticipated spend look very optimistic .
fifa 's ruthless defence of its brand and the interests of its main sponsors mean that there are restricted opportunities for traders and small businesses to get a slice of the tourist pie .
legacy of course , there have been real economic benefits for those employed in construction work , but the boost has gone mainly to people who run and own the companies managing the work .
while the stadiums are now finished and impressive , many are destined to mutate into white elephants a royal white elephant ?
world cup ' just for the rich ' along the way , there have been controversial demolitions of informal housing , allegations of corruption in the awarding of contracts and bitter labour disputes .
while the stadiums are now finished and impressive , many are destined to mutate into white elephants , their costs and capacity massively exceeding the means and needs of the local football economy .
in portugal , which built 10 stadiums for the 2004 european football championships , augusto mateus , a former economics minister , argued that the most sensible thing to do with many of these buildings is to pull them down and start again .
in south africa , while there may be the legacy of an improved transport infrastructure , its future remains dependent on a successful resolution to the simmering conflict between the established taxi industry and the new buses .
yet , in the face of this economic uncertainty , south africa remains resolutely upbeat about the gains of hosting the world cup .
the reason is that there are some things which are hard to put on a balance sheet .
here we are in the realm of intangibles .
this is the soft power derived from hosting the world 's biggest football festival and of being the first country on the continent to hold the competition .
african stereotype the opportunity is there to reshape global perceptions of south africa - and possibly the rest of africa - and the theory is that this could be rewarded by higher flows of capital , skilled workers and tourists .
but in the build-up to the tournament there has been little movement in the way south africa is perceived by the outside world .
world cup on the bbc latest news on the world cup from bbc sport guide to bbc coverage fixture guide although the country has demonstrated it has the capacity and ability to take on complex construction projects , the focus of the world 's media attention has been on violence and the crime rate .
even incidents outside the country - such as the attack on the togolese team on the eve of the africa cup of nations in angola - led to questions in the european press about safety in south africa .
the tournament organisers also seem to be promoting an image of africa peddled elsewhere in the world .
the video shown in cape town before the competition draw featured pyramids , rural people in traditional dress and large mammals .
urban africa , with its love of football , was downplayed .
will happiness help the hangover ?
what then is left of the economic case for hosting the world cup ?
well , happiness could play a crucial part .
this is not a flippant response .
indeed , economic research suggests that the hosts of major football tournaments experience a real rise in public contentment .
the theory is that investing in projects that create a rarely experienced but precious sense of national purpose , and collective identity , are good value .
the snag here is that all the work on happiness so far has looked at richer nations .
some may argue that in the case of south africa there are practical things like new housing and sewage systems which should have been invested in first .
but it is very likely that hosting africa 's first world cup will provoke a wave of national and continental joy that will be infectious .
the challenge will be to capitalise on this and turn it into tangible development .
