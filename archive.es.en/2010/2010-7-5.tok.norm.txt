program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 05.07.2010 daimler plans electric motor scooter großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carmakers see market for city electric motor scooters daimler plans an electric scooter as the carmaker moves to build different types of electric vehicles for different market segments .
it 's not the first motorcycle , by the way , to come from the stuttgart-based car icon . the news came from the top .
in a television program over the weekend , daimler chief executive officer dieter zetsche said the german carmaker " will soon present an e-scooter . "
while many daimler car fans may wonder why the company would want to add e-scooters to its premium car and truck-dominated product portfolio , car analysts are n't surprised by the move .
" it 's all about the e-mobility push by the car industry , " christoph stuermer , an auto analyst with ihs global insight in frankfurt , told deutsche welle .
" a key element of this strategy is to build specific vehicles , like e-scooters , for specific market segments , such as short-distance travel in urban areas .
daimler aims to fill all these segments with products . "
bildunterschrift : lithium-ion batteries are powering a new wave of e-scooters global effort daimler spokeswoman eva wiese batted down speculation that daimler may hand over development of the new e-scooter to its new chinese electric vehicle partner , byd , which is specialized in car battery and drive technology .
" we will develop the e-scooter ourselves , using components , of course , from our global network of suppliers , " wiese told deutsche welle .
" it will be a global product , as all our products are . "
while motorcycle manufacturing , arguably , has not been a core competency of daimler , company co-founder gottlieb daimler is credited with having invented the first gasoline engine-powered motorcycle in 1885 .
essentially , it was a four-stroke internal combustion engine mounted on a wooden bicycle .
bmw and peugeot with head start much has happened in the way of motorcycle development since then , most recently in the area of electrically powered systems .
and perhaps to the dismay of daimler , some of its major competitors in europe , including bmw and peugeot , have a head start .
in the early 2000s , bmw launched the c1 , an enclosed scooter with many innovative features to protect the rider in an accident .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler now offers an electric version of its smart urban car last year , bmw , which manufacturers both cars and motorcycles , also unveiled an electric version of the scooter for the european safer urban motorcycling project .
the electric motor is powered by a lithium-ion battery with sufficient power for most inner-city driving conditions .
french carmaker peugeot , which mass-produced its first e-scooter 15 years ago , has launched yet another , the e-vivacity .
it is also equipped with lithium-ion battery capable of covering up to 100 kilometers on the road .
" it 's a logical move for daimler to build an e-scooter , " stuermer said .
" the company is engineering an electrical version of its smart urban car and hybrid models of its sedans for longer distances .
and now it plans a light vehicle for short city trips .
it 's filling all the gaps . "

speaking a day after scoring a brace in germany 's 4-0 demolition of argentina in the quarters , klose said he had his eyes on becoming the all-time world cup top scorer .
" i want to score at least five goals at the world cup .
and i will be very satisfied if i score six , " klose told a news conference .
the 32-year-old scored five goals in world cups in 2002 and 2006 and has so far netted four times in the 2010 tournament .
that puts him one goal behind record scorer ronaldo of brazil , who netted 15 world cup goals between 1998 and 2006 .
measured , yet confident klose said that his team would n't get carried away after several resounding victories throughout the competition , including a 4-1 win over england and a 4-0 thumping of australia .
" spain is better than england and argentina , no question .
they are not unbeatable , and we will try to expose their weaknesses ...
we are better than 2008 and want to show that on the pitch , " said klose .
the germans will line up against spain without young forward thomas mueller , whose red-hot form has been one of the pillars of germany 's effectiveness .
the 20-year-old was given a yellow card in the win against argentina and will miss the semifinal clash .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller has been a revelation this world cup germany coach joachim loew sought to downplay worries over having to rejig his lineup , insisting he had enough talent at his disposal to cover the loss of mueller .
" it 's clear it 's a blow for us - he has shown himself to be dangerous in front of goal .
but we have players who can replace him , " loew said .
possible replacements for mueller include hamburg attacking midfielder piotr trochowski and young bayern attacker toni kroos , both of whom have been given game time in south africa .
stuttgart-based striker cacau is also an option , but rumors still persist about an abdominal muscle strain that kept him out of the quarterfinals .

komorowski beat jaroslaw kaczynski by a margin of seven percent of the vote . liberal parliamentary speaker and acting president bronislaw komorowski has won poland 's presidential run-off election . with all votes counted , komorowski earned 53 percent of the vote , while his opponent , nationalist opposition leader jaroslaw kaczynski , gained 47 percent of the votes , according to the election commission . jaroslaw is the twin brother of former president lech kaczynski , who died in a plane crash on april 10 .
the election was triggered by the former leader 's sudden death , along with his wife and 95 others , in the crash . sunday 's election followed a first round of voting on june 20 , in which neither candidate secured a majority . ' good for poland ' on hearing early results , a beaming komorowski said that polish democracy had emerged the winner . " today democracy has won , our polish democracy , " komorowski said before a crowd of cheering supporters , adding that it was " important not to foment divisions , but to build a sense of unity . " kaczynski admitted defeat shortly after komorowski 's speech . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski has performed better than expected " i congratulate the winner .
i congratulate bronislaw komorowski , " kaczynski said from his campaign headquarters . german foreign minister guido westerwelle also offered his congratulations , describing the result as a step in the right direction for closer cooperation between poland and europe . " the polish people 's decision to elect komorowski is a strong pro-european signal , " westerwelle said in berlin .
" with president komorowski , as well as prime minister donald tusk and foreign minister radoslaw sikorski , we will have a strong partner for our path of trust and cooperation . " high turnout prior to the run-off election there were growing fears that the start of summer holidays in poland would make voters prefer baltic beaches to polling stations , though this did not materialize . at 52 percent , turnout was much higher than expected .
analysts said it was a clear sign of the mobilization of the two electorates : the traditional , conservative , euroskeptic and mostly rural supporters of kaczynski , and the more reform-minded , pro-european urban voters .
that division was apparent in a sampling of views among voters in warsaw . " we just need to stop kaczynski from winning .
he 's stuck in the past and he 's bad for poland 's position in the eu , " a young businessman told deutsche welle at a polling station in the leafy middle class warsaw suburb of jozefoslaw . " komorowski , together with the reformist prime minister , donald tusk , will lead us deeper into europe . "
however , a retired teacher offered this opinion of komorowski as she cast her ballot : " -lsb- he -rsb- represents those smug businesspeople who have been allowed to thrive at the expense of us pensioners .
i 'm voting for kaczynski , because he cares for people like me .
he 's a patriot who holds national values dear . ” european integration versus national values bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : komorowski insists poland must be closer to germany and france komorowski is a close ally of the prime minister .
both men argue that poland needs economic liberalization to maintain economic growth - the country was the only eu member to avoid recession last year , although growth slowed to 1.8 percent from 5 percent in 2008 . ahead of the run-off vote , kaczynski accused them both of plotting to privatize national health care and sell the country out to foreign investors at the expense of the poor .
komorowski has however insisted that european integration was his highest priority . " the number one issue is poland 's eu membership , strengthening its position there , developing the weimar triangle relationship with germany and france and building reconciliation with russia , " he said in a televised debate . " it is also in poland 's interests to serve as a champion of european integration with countries further east . " euroskeptic and nationalist kaczynski took a more nationalist tone .
while giving few specifics on foreign policy , he clearly stated his plans to carry on his late brother 's policies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : komorowski has secured the presidency " i wo n't let poland be treated as a minor partner by any other country in europe , " he said in the debate .
" foreign policy , which should clearly be the domain of the polish president , requires that the principle of sovereignty should be clearly adhered to , which does n't always happen under the present government . " critics say his unabashed euroskepticism , which he championed during his term as prime minister from 2006 to 2007 , alienated poland 's neighbors .
he said he currently has no interest in adopting the euro , pointing out that the free-floating zloty has helped poland ride out the economic crisis . " if we had pushed for the euro as the government wanted , we would today be in an economic catastrophe , " he said . author : david levitz / rafal kiepuszewski -lrb- reuters , afp , ap -rrb- editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

defense analysts suggest the region is still a major concern . if the german defense ministry is to be believed , the terrorist threat in the sea off the horn of africa has been reduced so significantly that it sees no further reason to deploy its force of 90 marines and a navy reconnaissance plane as part of the us-led operation enduring freedom .
due to an assessment that claims that the threat is now ' limited , ' germany has ended its involvement six months earlier than its mandate stipulated .
germany has been involved in the operation enduring freedom as part of the mission aimed at stopping islamic terrorists smuggling arms to groups in africa from the arabian peninsula for over eight years .
the german navy joined the task force in february 2002 , some five months after the united states established the operation after the 9/11 attacks on new york and washington .
with the last german troops completing their tours of duty in the gulf of aden and the indian ocean last week , germany 's naval focus now shifts to the mediterranean .
one german navy frigate will remain off the coast of africa as part of operation atalanta , a european union mission to protect aid shipments into somalia from pirate attack .
however , with increased al qaeda activity being reported across the gulf of aden in yemen , affiliated islamist groups continuing to battle for control of somalia and reports that osama bin laden 's terror network is extending its influence into kenya , the german decision has caused some surprise among security analysts .
somalia at the heart of region 's spreading extremism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al shabab is fighting to install an islamic caliphate in somalia " the terrorist threat emanating from the horn of africa is limited at the moment , " jeremy binnie , a terrorism expert at jane 's defence group , told deutsche welle .
" however , there is a lot of concern that somalia might turn into something akin to taliban-controlled afghanistan in the 1990s .
the pro-al qaeda group there , the shabab , controls much of the south of the country and is currently threatening to overrun mogadishu .
the only thing stopping them is a small force of african peacekeepers .
so there are worries that southern somalia could become a safe haven for jihadists from other countries and a base for training . "
" there are already indications that the shabab is being supported by a small number of foreign jihadists and has recruited possibly hundreds of young men from europe and north america , most of them somalis , " binnie added .
" there have also been a few reports of yemen-based al qaeda operatives turning up in somalia .
the worry is that these guys could be used to carry out international terrorist attacks . "
" at the same time , there are worries about the geographical proximity between somalia and yemen , meaning it is possible that the shabab will link up with bin laden 's yemeni branch , al qaeda on the arabian peninsula . "
yemen supply lines still bringing arms , personnel to africa last year 's failed bombing of a detroit-bound airliner by an al qaeda suspect with links to yemen highlighted the country 's growing reputation as the new hub for terrorism in the region .
yemen is a blueprint nation for radical islamists ; it has a weak government , it is deeply divided by a tribalistic and violent civil war which is pushing the country toward the status of a failed state and has a culture in which most men carry weapons , therefore making identifying terrorists extremely difficult .
the land of osama bin laden 's ancestors has also become a melting pot of refugees from the conflict in somalia and returning jihadists from the wars in afghanistan and iraq .
with africa in its sights , it is thought that al qaeda sees yemen as an ideal staging point for fanning the flames of extremism across the gulf of aden in somalia and beyond .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda has targeted kenya since the us embassy attack despite having a less direct shipping connection to yemen than somalia , sharing a border with the failed state puts kenya at risk of infiltration by islamist terror groups .
instead of having to navigate through the international forces in indian ocean to reach the kenyan coastline , arab-based terrorists can smuggle weapons and personnel overland to kenya via somalia .
it has been reported for as long as germany was part of operation enduring freedom that al qaeda was seeking a foothold in kenya and that al qaeda operatives had infiltrated the country 's islamic communities on its indian ocean coast .
poor relations between kenya 's coastal muslims and the country 's inefficient security forces have provided al qaeda with a new base from which it can extend its growing network throughout eastern africa .
inland in kenya , border camps filled with refugees from somalia are reported to be just as fertile a breeding ground for young extremists .
meanwhile , kenya has its own home grown terror problem .
the kenyan saleh ali saleh nabhan was alleged to have been the leader of al qaeda in somalia and the mastermind behind the bombing of the paradise hotel in mombasa and the attempted downing of an israeli passenger jet in november 2002 .
he was also suspected of involvement in the 1998 us embassy bombings in nairobi and dar es salaam in tanzania .
he was killed by us special forces near mogadishu in september 2009 .
changing face of mission shifts threat focus david hartwell , an expert and risk analyst for the middle east and north africa , believes that the changing nature of operation enduring freedom has shifted the focus away from its original mission meaning that the horn of africa and land-based threats are now longer in its remit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops will leave but the threat will remain " the germans have made a fair assessment on enduring freedom but it 's one based on the level of threat within the operation 's initial mission which was to capture fleeing extremists and taliban from afghanistan and stop them getting to places like yemen , saudi arabia and oman , " hartwell told deutsche welle . " in its original form , it has n't recorded that many successes as there have been few significant arrests of wanted figures on the seas .
as such , enduring freedom has mutated into the anti-piracy mission which is having more success in containing the pirates .
but it has been agreed that there is less of a need for naval forces to be searching for fleeing extremists now , especially in the gulf of aden and indian ocean . " " the region itself is still unstable with civil wars and extremism in both somalia and yemen but those involved in enduring freedom are wary of getting involved in the internal politics in these countries so we 'll see more countries following germany 's decision and refocusing on the piracy mission , " he added . author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

defense analysts suggest the region is still a major concern . if the german defense ministry is to be believed , the terrorist threat in the sea off the horn of africa has been reduced so significantly that it sees no further reason to deploy its force of 90 marines and a navy reconnaissance plane as part of the us-led operation enduring freedom .
due to an assessment that claims that the threat is now ' limited , ' germany has ended its involvement six months earlier than its mandate stipulated .
germany has been involved in the operation enduring freedom as part of the mission aimed at stopping islamic terrorists smuggling arms to groups in africa from the arabian peninsula for over eight years .
the german navy joined the task force in february 2002 , some five months after the united states established the operation after the 9/11 attacks on new york and washington .
with the last german troops completing their tours of duty in the gulf of aden and the indian ocean last week , germany 's naval focus now shifts to the mediterranean .
one german navy frigate will remain off the coast of africa as part of operation atalanta , a european union mission to protect aid shipments into somalia from pirate attack .
however , with increased al qaeda activity being reported across the gulf of aden in yemen , affiliated islamist groups continuing to battle for control of somalia and reports that osama bin laden 's terror network is extending its influence into kenya , the german decision has caused some surprise among security analysts .
somalia at the heart of region 's spreading extremism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al shabab is fighting to install an islamic caliphate in somalia " the terrorist threat emanating from the horn of africa is limited at the moment , " jeremy binnie , a terrorism expert at jane 's defence group , told deutsche welle .
" however , there is a lot of concern that somalia might turn into something akin to taliban-controlled afghanistan in the 1990s .
the pro-al qaeda group there , the shabab , controls much of the south of the country and is currently threatening to overrun mogadishu .
the only thing stopping them is a small force of african peacekeepers .
so there are worries that southern somalia could become a safe haven for jihadists from other countries and a base for training . "
" there are already indications that the shabab is being supported by a small number of foreign jihadists and has recruited possibly hundreds of young men from europe and north america , most of them somalis , " binnie added .
" there have also been a few reports of yemen-based al qaeda operatives turning up in somalia .
the worry is that these guys could be used to carry out international terrorist attacks . "
" at the same time , there are worries about the geographical proximity between somalia and yemen , meaning it is possible that the shabab will link up with bin laden 's yemeni branch , al qaeda on the arabian peninsula . "
yemen supply lines still bringing arms , personnel to africa last year 's failed bombing of a detroit-bound airliner by an al qaeda suspect with links to yemen highlighted the country 's growing reputation as the new hub for terrorism in the region .
yemen is a blueprint nation for radical islamists ; it has a weak government , it is deeply divided by a tribalistic and violent civil war which is pushing the country toward the status of a failed state and has a culture in which most men carry weapons , therefore making identifying terrorists extremely difficult .
the land of osama bin laden 's ancestors has also become a melting pot of refugees from the conflict in somalia and returning jihadists from the wars in afghanistan and iraq .
with africa in its sights , it is thought that al qaeda sees yemen as an ideal staging point for fanning the flames of extremism across the gulf of aden in somalia and beyond .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda has targeted kenya since the us embassy attack despite having a less direct shipping connection to yemen than somalia , sharing a border with the failed state puts kenya at risk of infiltration by islamist terror groups .
instead of having to navigate through the international forces in indian ocean to reach the kenyan coastline , arab-based terrorists can smuggle weapons and personnel overland to kenya via somalia .
it has been reported for as long as germany was part of operation enduring freedom that al qaeda was seeking a foothold in kenya and that al qaeda operatives had infiltrated the country 's islamic communities on its indian ocean coast .
poor relations between kenya 's coastal muslims and the country 's inefficient security forces have provided al qaeda with a new base from which it can extend its growing network throughout eastern africa .
inland in kenya , border camps filled with refugees from somalia are reported to be just as fertile a breeding ground for young extremists .
meanwhile , kenya has its own home grown terror problem .
the kenyan saleh ali saleh nabhan was alleged to have been the leader of al qaeda in somalia and the mastermind behind the bombing of the paradise hotel in mombasa and the attempted downing of an israeli passenger jet in november 2002 .
he was also suspected of involvement in the 1998 us embassy bombings in nairobi and dar es salaam in tanzania .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de architecture -pipe- 05.07.2010 curators split over fate of germany 's nazi-era pavilion at venice biennale großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's past looms large in venice the german pavilion at the venice biennale was designed decades ago to reflect the aesthetic ideals of the nazis .
is it a hindrance to artists that should be demolished , or a piece of history that should be preserved ? in a few weeks , people from around the world will flock to venice for the 12th venice biennale of architecture , which showcases new projects by big-name architects and designers . altogether , 28 national pavilions will be open to visitors , including the controversial german pavilion , which is a prime example of nazi architecture .
now , the federal chamber of german architects -lrb- bak -rrb- has started a debate about the building 's future . the german pavilion building - situated in the southern part of venice 's giardini park , where the biennale is held - is not particularly inviting .
the entry is large , with four imposing pillars supporting a heavy-looking roof .
the room inside has windows high above the ground , not offering any views of the surrounding area . ' unsuitable for art ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biennale takes places in venice 's giardini arno sighard schmid , president of the federal chamber of german architects , does not think that the temple-like nazi-era building represents modern germany .
he wants to see it torn down , saying that it is " neither suitable for art , nor for architecture " and has " no connection to the venetian skyline . " instead , he finds that it reflects the character of the nazi era , which brings an emotional aspect into the debate . the german pavilion was first erected in 1909 as the bavarian pavilion , based on the designs of a venetian architect .
with its ionic-style columns , it bore a resemblance to an ancient temple .
in 1938 , it was altered to reflect the nazi regime 's aesthetic ideals . then , in 1993 , german conceptual artist hans haacke smashed the travertine floor of the pavilion 's hall , where hitler and mussolini had once stood , leaving the fragments lying on the ground .
he called the work " failed hope . " a place for expression but according to susanne gaensheimer , director of the frankfurt museum for modern art and curator of the 2011 art biennale - the building is suitable for showcasing contemporary art , though it does represent a challenge for the artists . " there are many examples of exhibition halls with ideological or ideology-related architecture that show that this very confrontation with architecture has led to fantastic projects and artworks , " said gaensheimer .
" you need to differentiate between the outer architecture and what happens on the inside . " fantastic works of art have been presented in the german pavilion , she added - " and that is what represents this country . " bildunterschrift : in 2006 , the german curator team highlighted the most attractive aspect of the pavilion : the roof one example was the german presentation at the 2006 architecture biennale , which was titled " convertible city . "
the team of curators , from the architecture firm gruentuch ernst , positioned a bright red staircase through the window on the side of the pavilion , which allowed visitors to climb up onto the roof .
from there , they had a magnificent view of venice . the project was a good idea , conceded arno sighard schmid , but not one that can be repeated over and over . constructing the staircase " was a difficult undertaking , but showed that the roof offers such wonderful possibilities , " said schmid .
" and that 's the reason i 've proposed that our current democratic republic should present itself abroad in other ways than what this pavilion allows . " ' history ca n't be erased ' however , the curator for next year 's art biennale , susanne gaensheimer , maintains that history ca n't just be torn down . " demolishing architecture does n't mean that you can change history , " said gaensheimer .
" on the contrary , we can use architecture to preserve our consciousness of history . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlingensief has n't yet commented on his plans for the german pavilion in 2011 the curator has invited german performance artist christoph schlingensief to design the pavilion for 2011 .
schlingensief , who is battling lung cancer , has not yet commented on his plans .
however , he has been quoted as saying that he wished the german pavilion could be erased with a mouse-click . gaensheimer does not interpret this to mean that schlingensief favors the destruction of the building . " i can imagine that he meant he would like to make this whole discussion disappear with the click of a mouse , " she said .
" that 's what holds us up , always getting caught up in this discussion . " in his personal blog , schlingensief has called the idea of tearing down the pavilion " idiotic , " saying it was just a quick , unimaginative solution . author : sigrid hoff -lrb- ew / kjb -rrb- editor : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

two turkish newspapers had quoted davutoglu as saying ties with israel would be severed unless turkey received an apology for the flotilla raid or israel accepted the outcome of an independent inquiry into the incident .
in response to davutoglu 's alleged remarks , israeli foreign minister avigdor lieberman said during a trip to latvia that israel did n't " have any intention to apologize . "
later on monday , however , a spokesman for the turkish government told the reuters news agency that davutoglu had been misquoted in the newspaper reports .
the official claimed that davutoglu actually said that relations with israel would not improve if an apology was not issued .
the two countries have been on bad terms since the may 31 raid on a gaza-bound aid flotilla .
nine turkish nationals died after israeli military personnel boarded one of the ships . each side subsequently blamed the other for starting the violent confrontation .

the official claimed that davutoglu actually said that relations with israel would not improve if an apology was not issued .
the two countries have been on bad terms since the may 31 raid on a gaza-bound aid flotilla .
nine turkish nationals died after israeli military personnel boarded one of the ships . each side subsequently blamed the other for starting the violent confrontation .

but this does n't mean ankara is turning its back on europe , says bahaeddin guengoer of deutsche welle 's turkish service . turkey can explain itself however it likes .
but its latest diplomatic actions - its " no " to iran sanctions in the un security council ; its goal of carrying out a zero-problem policy with all its neighbors - are being met in the west with anxious questions .
is turkey turning away from the west ?
does it see its future in the islamic camp ?
the answer to such questions is a definite " no . "
turkey is not turning its back on the west !
yes , the goal of eu accession is losing priority in ankara 's current policy .
turkey is acting with a new level of self-confidence in the international diplomatic arena , and no one should resent the country for trying to build up its status as a regional power - or for trying to look beyond the narrow confines of europe .
turkey seeks new responsibility tacticians from washington , brazil and brussels to tehran , the middle east and moscow have been trying to instrumentalize nato-member turkey to serve their own diplomatic goals for nearly 60 years .
now , turkey wants to take on more responsibility : in conflict regions like the middle east and the caucasus , as an arbitrator in atomic negotiations with iran , and not least as a reliable energy route for the west .
questioning whether turkey belongs in the european or the oriental camp is easy to understand - but its not justifiable .
since its founding nearly nine decades ago , the modern turkish republic has decided in favor of europe , and therefore , in favor of the west .
despite this , ankara ca n't look forward to being greeted with open arms in its efforts to join the european union - nor does the islamic world celebrate turkey 's western orientation .
its dialog with hamas as an unspoken condition for a dialog with iran , and its over-eager actions toward reprimanding israel , have led to a great deal of resentment in europe and the us - and at the same time , done serious damage to its relations with the jewish state .
two sides of a coin purely in terms of numbers , turkey has what it takes to back up its ambitions of strength .
the country has seen nearly 12 percent economic growth in the first quarter of the year , along with being the 16th-strongest economy in the world , and the 7th in europe .
but that is just one side of the coin .
on the other side is the growing polarization between the religious and the secular in a turkey whose population has yet to taste many of the fruits of economic growth .
the continuous lack of democratic process , the weak grasp of the concept of press freedom in a gray zone , or the unwillingness of prime minsiter erdogan to deal with criticism of either himself or his policies , are all alarming threats to domestic stability .
turkey belongs in europe !
europe and turkey need one another like never before .
turkey needs europe in order to build itself up as a regional power and to give it more weight in its influence on its neighbors .
for its part , without turkey , europe reduces its chances of succeeding in its global goals and strategies .
europe 's unified rejection of turkey needs to give way .
instead of explaining why turkey should n't accede to the eu , the heads of the european states should be racking their brains about how to make accession happen - or at least how to begin the process , since full membership is unlikely in the near future .
meanwhile , turkey is right to intensively build up its status as a regional power , instead of trying at all cost to become a member of a weaker , crisis-plagued eu .

but this does n't mean ankara is turning its back on europe , says bahaeddin guengoer of deutsche welle 's turkish service . turkey can explain itself however it likes .
but its latest diplomatic actions - its " no " to iran sanctions in the un security council ; its goal of carrying out a zero-problem policy with all its neighbors - are being met in the west with anxious questions .
is turkey turning away from the west ?
does it see its future in the islamic camp ?
the answer to such questions is a definite " no . "
turkey is not turning its back on the west !
yes , the goal of eu accession is losing priority in ankara 's current policy .
turkey is acting with a new level of self-confidence in the international diplomatic arena , and no one should resent the country for trying to build up its status as a regional power - or for trying to look beyond the narrow confines of europe .
turkey seeks new responsibility tacticians from washington , brazil and brussels to tehran , the middle east and moscow have been trying to instrumentalize nato-member turkey to serve their own diplomatic goals for nearly 60 years .
now , turkey wants to take on more responsibility : in conflict regions like the middle east and the caucasus , as an arbitrator in atomic negotiations with iran , and not least as a reliable energy route for the west .
questioning whether turkey belongs in the european or the oriental camp is easy to understand - but its not justifiable .
since its founding nearly nine decades ago , the modern turkish republic has decided in favor of europe , and therefore , in favor of the west .
despite this , ankara ca n't look forward to being greeted with open arms in its efforts to join the european union - nor does the islamic world celebrate turkey 's western orientation .
its dialog with hamas as an unspoken condition for a dialog with iran , and its over-eager actions toward reprimanding israel , have led to a great deal of resentment in europe and the us - and at the same time , done serious damage to its relations with the jewish state .
two sides of a coin purely in terms of numbers , turkey has what it takes to back up its ambitions of strength .

is it a hindrance to artists that should be demolished , or a piece of history that should be preserved ? in a few weeks , people from around the world will flock to venice for the 12th venice biennale of architecture , which showcases new projects by big-name architects and designers . altogether , 28 national pavilions will be open to visitors , including the controversial german pavilion , which is a prime example of nazi architecture .
now , the federal chamber of german architects -lrb- bak -rrb- has started a debate about the building 's future . the german pavilion building - situated in the southern part of venice 's giardini park , where the biennale is held - is not particularly inviting .
the entry is large , with four imposing pillars supporting a heavy-looking roof .
the room inside has windows high above the ground , not offering any views of the surrounding area . ' unsuitable for art ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biennale takes places in venice 's giardini arno sighard schmid , president of the federal chamber of german architects , does not think that the temple-like nazi-era building represents modern germany .
he wants to see it torn down , saying that it is " neither suitable for art , nor for architecture " and has " no connection to the venetian skyline . " instead , he finds that it reflects the character of the nazi era , which brings an emotional aspect into the debate . the german pavilion was first erected in 1909 as the bavarian pavilion , based on the designs of a venetian architect .
with its ionic-style columns , it bore a resemblance to an ancient temple .
in 1938 , it was altered to reflect the nazi regime 's aesthetic ideals . then , in 1993 , german conceptual artist hans haacke smashed the travertine floor of the pavilion 's hall , where hitler and mussolini had once stood , leaving the fragments lying on the ground .
he called the work " failed hope . " a place for expression but according to susanne gaensheimer , director of the frankfurt museum for modern art and curator of the 2011 art biennale - the building is suitable for showcasing contemporary art , though it does represent a challenge for the artists . " there are many examples of exhibition halls with ideological or ideology-related architecture that show that this very confrontation with architecture has led to fantastic projects and artworks , " said gaensheimer .
" you need to differentiate between the outer architecture and what happens on the inside . " fantastic works of art have been presented in the german pavilion , she added - " and that is what represents this country . " bildunterschrift : in 2006 , the german curator team highlighted the most attractive aspect of the pavilion : the roof one example was the german presentation at the 2006 architecture biennale , which was titled " convertible city . "
the team of curators , from the architecture firm gruentuch ernst , positioned a bright red staircase through the window on the side of the pavilion , which allowed visitors to climb up onto the roof .
from there , they had a magnificent view of venice . the project was a good idea , conceded arno sighard schmid , but not one that can be repeated over and over . constructing the staircase " was a difficult undertaking , but showed that the roof offers such wonderful possibilities , " said schmid .
" and that 's the reason i 've proposed that our current democratic republic should present itself abroad in other ways than what this pavilion allows . " ' history ca n't be erased ' however , the curator for next year 's art biennale , susanne gaensheimer , maintains that history ca n't just be torn down . " demolishing architecture does n't mean that you can change history , " said gaensheimer .
" on the contrary , we can use architecture to preserve our consciousness of history . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlingensief has n't yet commented on his plans for the german pavilion in 2011 the curator has invited german performance artist christoph schlingensief to design the pavilion for 2011 .
schlingensief , who is battling lung cancer , has not yet commented on his plans .
however , he has been quoted as saying that he wished the german pavilion could be erased with a mouse-click . gaensheimer does not interpret this to mean that schlingensief favors the destruction of the building . " i can imagine that he meant he would like to make this whole discussion disappear with the click of a mouse , " she said .
" that 's what holds us up , always getting caught up in this discussion .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 05.07.2010 netherlands , uruguay try to recapture past glory in first 2010 semifinal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of these teams will be playing on july 11 injuries and suspensions will force both the oranje and la celeste to improvise as they try to punch their ticket for the final .
and both will have to battle history in what could be a war of nerves . coming off their upset of brazil , and boasting a squad that features players from europe 's top clubs , holland are definitely the favorites .
but the dutch know all too well that in football , favorites do n't always win .
" we 're not strutting around all day doing the polonaise , " netherlands coach bert van marwijk said after his team 's stunning 2-1 defeat of the mighty selecao .
" we have n't yet reached our goal . "
holland are arguably soccer 's greatest underachievers .
the national team have never won a world cup and , despite consistently fielding some of the sport 's most innovative and entertaining teams , the last time they qualified for a final was way back in 1978 .
this time around they 're trying something different .
instead of total football , van marwijk - whose resume includes a stint at bundesliga side dortmund - has emphasized a control and efficiency reminiscent of past german teams .
bildunterschrift : the oranjes have been riding high without individual brilliance that has n't always sat well with free-wheeling stars like arjen robben , wesley sneijder and robin van persie , but it 's yielded results .
assistant coach frank de boer says the players have learned that winning ugly is better than losing beautifully .
" our goal was to gain stability , " de boer has told reporters .
" the team is mature and has internalized a system .
we 're now capable of getting off to poor starts and still winning matches . "
the oranje , however , will be missing two major sources of that stability , right-back gregory van der wiel and defensive midfielder nigel de jong , when they take to the pitch in cape town on tuesday .
both are suspended after picking up two yellow cards .
fortunately for the dutch , their opponents have far graver personnel issues .
bildunterschrift : suarez made a fine but costly save against ghana survival artists after his team 's heart-stopping victory over ghana on friday , uruguay coach oscar tabarez had spent much of his time defending striker luis suarez , whose last-second handball clearance would have done most goalkeepers proud - and earned the player a red card and a one-match ban .
now , tabarez will have to think about how to replace him - an unenviable task since none of his reserve strikers possess the pace or the touch of suarez .
much of the burden will fall on diego forlan .
uruguay 's one true superstar has had a stand-out tournament and has been one of the few players to be effective from distance .
but he 'll have to work harder than ever to create space for his shots .
bildunterschrift : forlan has been on the mark and the situation is even more troubling at the back .
left back jorge fucile is also suspended , while central defender and captain diego lugano is doubtful with a bruised knee - two potentially crushing blows for a defensively oriented team .
the main factor speaking for la celeste in this match is pride .
a two-time world cup winner -lrb- 1930 and 1950 -rrb- , uruguay has n't done this well since 1970 , and a trip to another final would be a massive achievement for a country of only 3.3 million inhabitants .
for that reason , holland are preaching caution .
" our next match is a very dangerous one , " van marwijk has said .
" uruguay 's players are tremendous fighters and survival artists . "
history in the making bildunterschrift : fans of both sides hope the party will continue given the personnel constellation , the likely course of this match is obvious .
the netherlands will have to attack while uruguay try to hang on , hoping for a goal against the run of play or a draw that would send the match to penalties .
the uglier the match , the better la celeste 's chances .
so uruguay are bound to try to irritate robben , sneijder and van persie with niggling fouls .
but can former reserves step up to fill the gaps and take some of the focus off forlan ?
uruguay 's captain , in any case , says the team is n't satisfied with just reaching the semis .
" we know that if we want to make history , we have to become champions , " diego lugano told reporters .
" we have two must-win matches to go .
it 's equally difficult and possible . "
the challenge for the oranje will be to keep their cool , stick with their game plan and trust that the superior quality will prevail , should they fail to break the match open with an early goal .
that 's a doable task - but one dutch sides have often been unequal to in the past .
one thing is certain : whichever team wins will reward long-suffering fans with their nation 's greatest world cup triumph in decades .
and that will add a bit of extra-tension to what 's already shaping up to be a nervy contest .

' unsuitable for art ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biennale takes places in venice 's giardini arno sighard schmid , president of the federal chamber of german architects , does not think that the temple-like nazi-era building represents modern germany .
he wants to see it torn down , saying that it is " neither suitable for art , nor for architecture " and has " no connection to the venetian skyline . " instead , he finds that it reflects the character of the nazi era , which brings an emotional aspect into the debate . the german pavilion was first erected in 1909 as the bavarian pavilion , based on the designs of a venetian architect .
with its ionic-style columns , it bore a resemblance to an ancient temple .
in 1938 , it was altered to reflect the nazi regime 's aesthetic ideals . then , in 1993 , german conceptual artist hans haacke smashed the travertine floor of the pavilion 's hall , where hitler and mussolini had once stood , leaving the fragments lying on the ground .
he called the work " failed hope . " a place for expression but according to susanne gaensheimer , director of the frankfurt museum for modern art and curator of the 2011 art biennale - the building is suitable for showcasing contemporary art , though it does represent a challenge for the artists . " there are many examples of exhibition halls with ideological or ideology-related architecture that show that this very confrontation with architecture has led to fantastic projects and artworks , " said gaensheimer .
" you need to differentiate between the outer architecture and what happens on the inside . " fantastic works of art have been presented in the german pavilion , she added - " and that is what represents this country . " bildunterschrift : in 2006 , the german curator team highlighted the most attractive aspect of the pavilion : the roof one example was the german presentation at the 2006 architecture biennale , which was titled " convertible city . "
the team of curators , from the architecture firm gruentuch ernst , positioned a bright red staircase through the window on the side of the pavilion , which allowed visitors to climb up onto the roof .
from there , they had a magnificent view of venice . the project was a good idea , conceded arno sighard schmid , but not one that can be repeated over and over . constructing the staircase " was a difficult undertaking , but showed that the roof offers such wonderful possibilities , " said schmid .
" and that 's the reason i 've proposed that our current democratic republic should present itself abroad in other ways than what this pavilion allows . " ' history ca n't be erased ' however , the curator for next year 's art biennale , susanne gaensheimer , maintains that history ca n't just be torn down . " demolishing architecture does n't mean that you can change history , " said gaensheimer .
" on the contrary , we can use architecture to preserve our consciousness of history . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlingensief has n't yet commented on his plans for the german pavilion in 2011 the curator has invited german performance artist christoph schlingensief to design the pavilion for 2011 .
schlingensief , who is battling lung cancer , has not yet commented on his plans .
however , he has been quoted as saying that he wished the german pavilion could be erased with a mouse-click . gaensheimer does not interpret this to mean that schlingensief favors the destruction of the building . " i can imagine that he meant he would like to make this whole discussion disappear with the click of a mouse , " she said .
" that 's what holds us up , always getting caught up in this discussion . " in his personal blog , schlingensief has called the idea of tearing down the pavilion " idiotic , " saying it was just a quick , unimaginative solution . author : sigrid hoff -lrb- ew / kjb -rrb- editor : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but defeated presidential candidate jaroslaw kaczynski also achieved considerable success in this election .
his 47 percent of the vote is a political base upon which his conservative law and justice party can build upon in the next parliamentary elections in 2011 .
komorowski 's kingmakers were poland 's left-of-center voters .
though rival jaroslaw kaczynski made a leftist , populist turn at the end of his campaign , it simply was not enough to win over left-of-center voters .
even kaczynski 's praise of communist-era social policies could not sway them .
two-thirds of the left-of-center voters marked komorowski 's name on their ballots , making him the country 's next president .
the close result of the election also demonstrates to what extent poland is politically divided .
while komorowski 's campaign spoke to younger , educated , urban voters , kaczynski tended to attract older , less educated and more rural voters .
there can also be no talk of true defeat in this election because , as leader of the largest opposition party , the power-hungry kaczynski will long remain a serious rival to liberal-conservative prime minister donald tusk and president-elect bronislaw komorowski .
therefore , kaczynski 's success at the polls must be heeded as a warning .
the path for kaczynski 's return to power would already be paved , should warsaw 's current coalition government wind up presiding over corruption , rising joblessness , or harsh social policies .
if kaczynski were to return as poland 's prime minister , he could throw poland back into the domestic and foreign confrontations that once dominated the country 's politics .
so komorowski 's election is not only good news not only poland but also for german-polish relations and for europe as a whole .
a cheerful , aimiable polish president with foreign affairs experience and good relations with other european leaders will make poland a stable pillar of european politics . this bodes well for the polish eu presidency in 2011 and the beleaguered european union .

defense analysts suggest the region is still a major concern . if the german defense ministry is to be believed , the terrorist threat in the sea off the horn of africa has been reduced so significantly that it sees no further reason to deploy its force of 90 marines and a navy reconnaissance plane as part of the us-led operation enduring freedom .
due to an assessment that claims that the threat is now ' limited , ' germany has ended its involvement six months earlier than its mandate stipulated .
germany has been involved in the operation enduring freedom as part of the mission aimed at stopping islamic terrorists smuggling arms to groups in africa from the arabian peninsula for over eight years .
the german navy joined the task force in february 2002 , some five months after the united states established the operation after the 9/11 attacks on new york and washington .
with the last german troops completing their tours of duty in the gulf of aden and the indian ocean last week , germany 's naval focus now shifts to the mediterranean .
one german navy frigate will remain off the coast of africa as part of operation atalanta , a european union mission to protect aid shipments into somalia from pirate attack .
however , with increased al qaeda activity being reported across the gulf of aden in yemen , affiliated islamist groups continuing to battle for control of somalia and reports that osama bin laden 's terror network is extending its influence into kenya , the german decision has caused some surprise among security analysts .
somalia at the heart of region 's spreading extremism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al shabab is fighting to install an islamic caliphate in somalia " the terrorist threat emanating from the horn of africa is limited at the moment , " jeremy binnie , a terrorism expert at jane 's defence group , told deutsche welle .
" however , there is a lot of concern that somalia might turn into something akin to taliban-controlled afghanistan in the 1990s .
the pro-al qaeda group there , the shabab , controls much of the south of the country and is currently threatening to overrun mogadishu .
the only thing stopping them is a small force of african peacekeepers .
so there are worries that southern somalia could become a safe haven for jihadists from other countries and a base for training . "
" there are already indications that the shabab is being supported by a small number of foreign jihadists and has recruited possibly hundreds of young men from europe and north america , most of them somalis , " binnie added .
" there have also been a few reports of yemen-based al qaeda operatives turning up in somalia .
the worry is that these guys could be used to carry out international terrorist attacks . "
" at the same time , there are worries about the geographical proximity between somalia and yemen , meaning it is possible that the shabab will link up with bin laden 's yemeni branch , al qaeda on the arabian peninsula . "
yemen supply lines still bringing arms , personnel to africa last year 's failed bombing of a detroit-bound airliner by an al qaeda suspect with links to yemen highlighted the country 's growing reputation as the new hub for terrorism in the region .
yemen is a blueprint nation for radical islamists ; it has a weak government , it is deeply divided by a tribalistic and violent civil war which is pushing the country toward the status of a failed state and has a culture in which most men carry weapons , therefore making identifying terrorists extremely difficult .
the land of osama bin laden 's ancestors has also become a melting pot of refugees from the conflict in somalia and returning jihadists from the wars in afghanistan and iraq .
with africa in its sights , it is thought that al qaeda sees yemen as an ideal staging point for fanning the flames of extremism across the gulf of aden in somalia and beyond .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda has targeted kenya since the us embassy attack despite having a less direct shipping connection to yemen than somalia , sharing a border with the failed state puts kenya at risk of infiltration by islamist terror groups .
instead of having to navigate through the international forces in indian ocean to reach the kenyan coastline , arab-based terrorists can smuggle weapons and personnel overland to kenya via somalia .
it has been reported for as long as germany was part of operation enduring freedom that al qaeda was seeking a foothold in kenya and that al qaeda operatives had infiltrated the country 's islamic communities on its indian ocean coast .
poor relations between kenya 's coastal muslims and the country 's inefficient security forces have provided al qaeda with a new base from which it can extend its growing network throughout eastern africa .
inland in kenya , border camps filled with refugees from somalia are reported to be just as fertile a breeding ground for young extremists .
meanwhile , kenya has its own home grown terror problem .
the kenyan saleh ali saleh nabhan was alleged to have been the leader of al qaeda in somalia and the mastermind behind the bombing of the paradise hotel in mombasa and the attempted downing of an israeli passenger jet in november 2002 .
he was also suspected of involvement in the 1998 us embassy bombings in nairobi and dar es salaam in tanzania .
he was killed by us special forces near mogadishu in september 2009 .
changing face of mission shifts threat focus david hartwell , an expert and risk analyst for the middle east and north africa , believes that the changing nature of operation enduring freedom has shifted the focus away from its original mission meaning that the horn of africa and land-based threats are now longer in its remit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops will leave but the threat will remain " the germans have made a fair assessment on enduring freedom but it 's one based on the level of threat within the operation 's initial mission which was to capture fleeing extremists and taliban from afghanistan and stop them getting to places like yemen , saudi arabia and oman , " hartwell told deutsche welle . " in its original form , it has n't recorded that many successes as there have been few significant arrests of wanted figures on the seas .
as such , enduring freedom has mutated into the anti-piracy mission which is having more success in containing the pirates .
but it has been agreed that there is less of a need for naval forces to be searching for fleeing extremists now , especially in the gulf of aden and indian ocean . " " the region itself is still unstable with civil wars and extremism in both somalia and yemen but those involved in enduring freedom are wary of getting involved in the internal politics in these countries so we 'll see more countries following germany 's decision and refocusing on the piracy mission , " he added . author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda has targeted kenya since the us embassy attack despite having a less direct shipping connection to yemen than somalia , sharing a border with the failed state puts kenya at risk of infiltration by islamist terror groups .
instead of having to navigate through the international forces in indian ocean to reach the kenyan coastline , arab-based terrorists can smuggle weapons and personnel overland to kenya via somalia .
it has been reported for as long as germany was part of operation enduring freedom that al qaeda was seeking a foothold in kenya and that al qaeda operatives had infiltrated the country 's islamic communities on its indian ocean coast .
poor relations between kenya 's coastal muslims and the country 's inefficient security forces have provided al qaeda with a new base from which it can extend its growing network throughout eastern africa .

defense analysts suggest the region is still a major concern . if the german defense ministry is to be believed , the terrorist threat in the sea off the horn of africa has been reduced so significantly that it sees no further reason to deploy its force of 90 marines and a navy reconnaissance plane as part of the us-led operation enduring freedom .
due to an assessment that claims that the threat is now ' limited , ' germany has ended its involvement six months earlier than its mandate stipulated .
germany has been involved in the operation enduring freedom as part of the mission aimed at stopping islamic terrorists smuggling arms to groups in africa from the arabian peninsula for over eight years .
the german navy joined the task force in february 2002 , some five months after the united states established the operation after the 9/11 attacks on new york and washington .
with the last german troops completing their tours of duty in the gulf of aden and the indian ocean last week , germany 's naval focus now shifts to the mediterranean .
one german navy frigate will remain off the coast of africa as part of operation atalanta , a european union mission to protect aid shipments into somalia from pirate attack .
however , with increased al qaeda activity being reported across the gulf of aden in yemen , affiliated islamist groups continuing to battle for control of somalia and reports that osama bin laden 's terror network is extending its influence into kenya , the german decision has caused some surprise among security analysts .
somalia at the heart of region 's spreading extremism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al shabab is fighting to install an islamic caliphate in somalia " the terrorist threat emanating from the horn of africa is limited at the moment , " jeremy binnie , a terrorism expert at jane 's defence group , told deutsche welle .
" however , there is a lot of concern that somalia might turn into something akin to taliban-controlled afghanistan in the 1990s .
the pro-al qaeda group there , the shabab , controls much of the south of the country and is currently threatening to overrun mogadishu .
the only thing stopping them is a small force of african peacekeepers .
so there are worries that southern somalia could become a safe haven for jihadists from other countries and a base for training . "
" there are already indications that the shabab is being supported by a small number of foreign jihadists and has recruited possibly hundreds of young men from europe and north america , most of them somalis , " binnie added .
" there have also been a few reports of yemen-based al qaeda operatives turning up in somalia .
the worry is that these guys could be used to carry out international terrorist attacks . "
" at the same time , there are worries about the geographical proximity between somalia and yemen , meaning it is possible that the shabab will link up with bin laden 's yemeni branch , al qaeda on the arabian peninsula . "
yemen supply lines still bringing arms , personnel to africa last year 's failed bombing of a detroit-bound airliner by an al qaeda suspect with links to yemen highlighted the country 's growing reputation as the new hub for terrorism in the region .
yemen is a blueprint nation for radical islamists ; it has a weak government , it is deeply divided by a tribalistic and violent civil war which is pushing the country toward the status of a failed state and has a culture in which most men carry weapons , therefore making identifying terrorists extremely difficult .
the land of osama bin laden 's ancestors has also become a melting pot of refugees from the conflict in somalia and returning jihadists from the wars in afghanistan and iraq .
with africa in its sights , it is thought that al qaeda sees yemen as an ideal staging point for fanning the flames of extremism across the gulf of aden in somalia and beyond .

dw ’ s bartosz dudek sees komorowski ’ s win as a victory for europe . president-elect bronislaw komorowski and his liberal conservative party civic platform stand for a europe-friendly and future-oriented poland .
they also value dialogue and compromise in their political dealings .
but defeated presidential candidate jaroslaw kaczynski also achieved considerable success in this election .
his 47 percent of the vote is a political base upon which his conservative law and justice party can build upon in the next parliamentary elections in 2011 .
komorowski 's kingmakers were poland 's left-of-center voters .
though rival jaroslaw kaczynski made a leftist , populist turn at the end of his campaign , it simply was not enough to win over left-of-center voters .
even kaczynski 's praise of communist-era social policies could not sway them .
two-thirds of the left-of-center voters marked komorowski 's name on their ballots , making him the country 's next president .
the close result of the election also demonstrates to what extent poland is politically divided .
while komorowski 's campaign spoke to younger , educated , urban voters , kaczynski tended to attract older , less educated and more rural voters .
there can also be no talk of true defeat in this election because , as leader of the largest opposition party , the power-hungry kaczynski will long remain a serious rival to liberal-conservative prime minister donald tusk and president-elect bronislaw komorowski .
therefore , kaczynski 's success at the polls must be heeded as a warning .
the path for kaczynski 's return to power would already be paved , should warsaw 's current coalition government wind up presiding over corruption , rising joblessness , or harsh social policies .
if kaczynski were to return as poland 's prime minister , he could throw poland back into the domestic and foreign confrontations that once dominated the country 's politics .
so komorowski 's election is not only good news not only poland but also for german-polish relations and for europe as a whole .
a cheerful , aimiable polish president with foreign affairs experience and good relations with other european leaders will make poland a stable pillar of european politics . this bodes well for the polish eu presidency in 2011 and the beleaguered european union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 05.07.2010 daimler plans electric motor scooter großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carmakers see market for city electric motor scooters daimler plans an electric scooter as the carmaker moves to build different types of electric vehicles for different market segments .
it 's not the first motorcycle , by the way , to come from the stuttgart-based car icon . the news came from the top .
in a television program over the weekend , daimler chief executive officer dieter zetsche said the german carmaker " will soon present an e-scooter . "
while many daimler car fans may wonder why the company would want to add e-scooters to its premium car and truck-dominated product portfolio , car analysts are n't surprised by the move .
" it 's all about the e-mobility push by the car industry , " christoph stuermer , an auto analyst with ihs global insight in frankfurt , told deutsche welle .
" a key element of this strategy is to build specific vehicles , like e-scooters , for specific market segments , such as short-distance travel in urban areas .
daimler aims to fill all these segments with products . "
bildunterschrift : lithium-ion batteries are powering a new wave of e-scooters global effort daimler spokeswoman eva wiese batted down speculation that daimler may hand over development of the new e-scooter to its new chinese electric vehicle partner , byd , which is specialized in car battery and drive technology .
" we will develop the e-scooter ourselves , using components , of course , from our global network of suppliers , " wiese told deutsche welle .
" it will be a global product , as all our products are . "
while motorcycle manufacturing , arguably , has not been a core competency of daimler , company co-founder gottlieb daimler is credited with having invented the first gasoline engine-powered motorcycle in 1885 .
essentially , it was a four-stroke internal combustion engine mounted on a wooden bicycle .
bmw and peugeot with head start much has happened in the way of motorcycle development since then , most recently in the area of electrically powered systems .
and perhaps to the dismay of daimler , some of its major competitors in europe , including bmw and peugeot , have a head start .
in the early 2000s , bmw launched the c1 , an enclosed scooter with many innovative features to protect the rider in an accident .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler now offers an electric version of its smart urban car last year , bmw , which manufacturers both cars and motorcycles , also unveiled an electric version of the scooter for the european safer urban motorcycling project .
the electric motor is powered by a lithium-ion battery with sufficient power for most inner-city driving conditions .
french carmaker peugeot , which mass-produced its first e-scooter 15 years ago , has launched yet another , the e-vivacity .
it is also equipped with lithium-ion battery capable of covering up to 100 kilometers on the road .
" it 's a logical move for daimler to build an e-scooter , " stuermer said .
" the company is engineering an electrical version of its smart urban car and hybrid models of its sedans for longer distances .
and now it plans a light vehicle for short city trips .
it 's filling all the gaps . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 05.07.2010 netherlands , uruguay try to recapture past glory in first 2010 semifinal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of these teams will be playing on july 11 injuries and suspensions will force both the oranje and la celeste to improvise as they try to punch their ticket for the final .
and both will have to battle history in what could be a war of nerves . coming off their upset of brazil , and boasting a squad that features players from europe 's top clubs , holland are definitely the favorites .
but the dutch know all too well that in football , favorites do n't always win .
" we 're not strutting around all day doing the polonaise , " netherlands coach bert van marwijk said after his team 's stunning 2-1 defeat of the mighty selecao .
" we have n't yet reached our goal . "
holland are arguably soccer 's greatest underachievers .
the national team have never won a world cup and , despite consistently fielding some of the sport 's most innovative and entertaining teams , the last time they qualified for a final was way back in 1978 .
this time around they 're trying something different .
instead of total football , van marwijk - whose resume includes a stint at bundesliga side dortmund - has emphasized a control and efficiency reminiscent of past german teams .
bildunterschrift : the oranjes have been riding high without individual brilliance that has n't always sat well with free-wheeling stars like arjen robben , wesley sneijder and robin van persie , but it 's yielded results .
assistant coach frank de boer says the players have learned that winning ugly is better than losing beautifully .
" our goal was to gain stability , " de boer has told reporters .
" the team is mature and has internalized a system .
we 're now capable of getting off to poor starts and still winning matches . "
the oranje , however , will be missing two major sources of that stability , right-back gregory van der wiel and defensive midfielder nigel de jong , when they take to the pitch in cape town on tuesday .
both are suspended after picking up two yellow cards .
fortunately for the dutch , their opponents have far graver personnel issues .
bildunterschrift : suarez made a fine but costly save against ghana survival artists after his team 's heart-stopping victory over ghana on friday , uruguay coach oscar tabarez had spent much of his time defending striker luis suarez , whose last-second handball clearance would have done most goalkeepers proud - and earned the player a red card and a one-match ban .
now , tabarez will have to think about how to replace him - an unenviable task since none of his reserve strikers possess the pace or the touch of suarez .
much of the burden will fall on diego forlan .
uruguay 's one true superstar has had a stand-out tournament and has been one of the few players to be effective from distance .
but he 'll have to work harder than ever to create space for his shots .
bildunterschrift : forlan has been on the mark and the situation is even more troubling at the back .
left back jorge fucile is also suspended , while central defender and captain diego lugano is doubtful with a bruised knee - two potentially crushing blows for a defensively oriented team .
the main factor speaking for la celeste in this match is pride .
a two-time world cup winner -lrb- 1930 and 1950 -rrb- , uruguay has n't done this well since 1970 , and a trip to another final would be a massive achievement for a country of only 3.3 million inhabitants .
for that reason , holland are preaching caution .
" our next match is a very dangerous one , " van marwijk has said .
" uruguay 's players are tremendous fighters and survival artists . "
history in the making bildunterschrift : fans of both sides hope the party will continue given the personnel constellation , the likely course of this match is obvious .
the netherlands will have to attack while uruguay try to hang on , hoping for a goal against the run of play or a draw that would send the match to penalties .
the uglier the match , the better la celeste 's chances .
so uruguay are bound to try to irritate robben , sneijder and van persie with niggling fouls .
but can former reserves step up to fill the gaps and take some of the focus off forlan ?
uruguay 's captain , in any case , says the team is n't satisfied with just reaching the semis .
" we know that if we want to make history , we have to become champions , " diego lugano told reporters .
" we have two must-win matches to go .
it 's equally difficult and possible . "
the challenge for the oranje will be to keep their cool , stick with their game plan and trust that the superior quality will prevail , should they fail to break the match open with an early goal .
that 's a doable task - but one dutch sides have often been unequal to in the past .
one thing is certain : whichever team wins will reward long-suffering fans with their nation 's greatest world cup triumph in decades .
and that will add a bit of extra-tension to what 's already shaping up to be a nervy contest .

two turkish newspapers had quoted davutoglu as saying ties with israel would be severed unless turkey received an apology for the flotilla raid or israel accepted the outcome of an independent inquiry into the incident .
in response to davutoglu 's alleged remarks , israeli foreign minister avigdor lieberman said during a trip to latvia that israel did n't " have any intention to apologize . "
later on monday , however , a spokesman for the turkish government told the reuters news agency that davutoglu had been misquoted in the newspaper reports .
the official claimed that davutoglu actually said that relations with israel would not improve if an apology was not issued .
the two countries have been on bad terms since the may 31 raid on a gaza-bound aid flotilla .
nine turkish nationals died after israeli military personnel boarded one of the ships . each side subsequently blamed the other for starting the violent confrontation .

the resignations from alain joyandet , state secretary for overseas development , and christian blanc , state secretary for the greater paris region , followed disclosures that both politicians had abused their office perks .
joyandet came under fire following press reports that he hired a private jet costing 116,500 euros to fly on official business to the caribbean , when he could have taken a regular scheduled flight .
he was also criticized last month over claims he was granted a permit illegally to build an extension to his house in saint tropez .
blanc 's office spent 12,000 euros -lrb- $ 14,680 -rrb- on cigars , and the minister himself admitted to smoking a third of them .
he was ordered to pay back the full bill . the revelations came as the french government was looking to promote ministerial sobriety and budget austerity in the face of a deficit set to hit a record high of eight percent of gdp .

but the president appeared unwilling to sacrifice his labor minister , eric woerth , who has also faced corruption accusations .
woerth has been the subject of daily scrutiny over the so-called ' bettancourt affair . '
french authorities have ordered a full review into the tax situation of liliane bettancourt , the 87-year-old heiress of the l 'oreal cosmetics group , after one of her advisors acknowledged there may have been financial irregularities .
opposition politicians have questioned why woerth never ordered a review while he was budget minister from 2007 to 2010 , suggesting it may have been because his wife then worked for the company that managed bettancourt 's wealth .
woerth has denied any wrongdoing and sarkozy has openly defended him .
leftist leaders say the furor over blanc and joyandet is a " fire shield " to distract voters from woerth 's ongoing difficulties .
in order for the state to save money , neither minister will be replaced .
sarkozy has also ordered that official use of planes and cars be restricted and departmental parties banned .

the resignations from alain joyandet , state secretary for overseas development , and christian blanc , state secretary for the greater paris region , followed disclosures that both politicians had abused their office perks .
joyandet came under fire following press reports that he hired a private jet costing 116,500 euros to fly on official business to the caribbean , when he could have taken a regular scheduled flight .
he was also criticized last month over claims he was granted a permit illegally to build an extension to his house in saint tropez .
blanc 's office spent 12,000 euros -lrb- $ 14,680 -rrb- on cigars , and the minister himself admitted to smoking a third of them .
he was ordered to pay back the full bill . the revelations came as the french government was looking to promote ministerial sobriety and budget austerity in the face of a deficit set to hit a record high of eight percent of gdp .
sarkozy asserts authority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both blanc -lrb- l . -rrb- and joyandet resigned on sunday the resignations came as a surprise , as two days previously sarkozy had publicly criticized the two men 's behavior and made clear they would be removed from their posts in the next cabinet reshuffle in october .
but the president appeared unwilling to sacrifice his labor minister , eric woerth , who has also faced corruption accusations .
woerth has been the subject of daily scrutiny over the so-called ' bettancourt affair . '
french authorities have ordered a full review into the tax situation of liliane bettancourt , the 87-year-old heiress of the l 'oreal cosmetics group , after one of her advisors acknowledged there may have been financial irregularities .
opposition politicians have questioned why woerth never ordered a review while he was budget minister from 2007 to 2010 , suggesting it may have been because his wife then worked for the company that managed bettancourt 's wealth .
woerth has denied any wrongdoing and sarkozy has openly defended him .
leftist leaders say the furor over blanc and joyandet is a " fire shield " to distract voters from woerth 's ongoing difficulties .
in order for the state to save money , neither minister will be replaced .
sarkozy has also ordered that official use of planes and cars be restricted and departmental parties banned .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 05.07.2010 enduring freedom 's shift in focus belies horn of africa 's security threat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german marines will now search for pirates not terrorists germany 's recent decision to pull out of operation enduring freedom was based on an assessment that labels the terror threat in the horn of africa as limited .
defense analysts suggest the region is still a major concern . if the german defense ministry is to be believed , the terrorist threat in the sea off the horn of africa has been reduced so significantly that it sees no further reason to deploy its force of 90 marines and a navy reconnaissance plane as part of the us-led operation enduring freedom .
due to an assessment that claims that the threat is now ' limited , ' germany has ended its involvement six months earlier than its mandate stipulated .
germany has been involved in the operation enduring freedom as part of the mission aimed at stopping islamic terrorists smuggling arms to groups in africa from the arabian peninsula for over eight years .
the german navy joined the task force in february 2002 , some five months after the united states established the operation after the 9/11 attacks on new york and washington .
with the last german troops completing their tours of duty in the gulf of aden and the indian ocean last week , germany 's naval focus now shifts to the mediterranean .
one german navy frigate will remain off the coast of africa as part of operation atalanta , a european union mission to protect aid shipments into somalia from pirate attack .
however , with increased al qaeda activity being reported across the gulf of aden in yemen , affiliated islamist groups continuing to battle for control of somalia and reports that osama bin laden 's terror network is extending its influence into kenya , the german decision has caused some surprise among security analysts .
somalia at the heart of region 's spreading extremism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al shabab is fighting to install an islamic caliphate in somalia " the terrorist threat emanating from the horn of africa is limited at the moment , " jeremy binnie , a terrorism expert at jane 's defence group , told deutsche welle .
" however , there is a lot of concern that somalia might turn into something akin to taliban-controlled afghanistan in the 1990s .
the pro-al qaeda group there , the shabab , controls much of the south of the country and is currently threatening to overrun mogadishu .
the only thing stopping them is a small force of african peacekeepers .
so there are worries that southern somalia could become a safe haven for jihadists from other countries and a base for training . "
" there are already indications that the shabab is being supported by a small number of foreign jihadists and has recruited possibly hundreds of young men from europe and north america , most of them somalis , " binnie added .
" there have also been a few reports of yemen-based al qaeda operatives turning up in somalia .
the worry is that these guys could be used to carry out international terrorist attacks . "
" at the same time , there are worries about the geographical proximity between somalia and yemen , meaning it is possible that the shabab will link up with bin laden 's yemeni branch , al qaeda on the arabian peninsula . "
yemen supply lines still bringing arms , personnel to africa last year 's failed bombing of a detroit-bound airliner by an al qaeda suspect with links to yemen highlighted the country 's growing reputation as the new hub for terrorism in the region .
yemen is a blueprint nation for radical islamists ; it has a weak government , it is deeply divided by a tribalistic and violent civil war which is pushing the country toward the status of a failed state and has a culture in which most men carry weapons , therefore making identifying terrorists extremely difficult .
the land of osama bin laden 's ancestors has also become a melting pot of refugees from the conflict in somalia and returning jihadists from the wars in afghanistan and iraq .
with africa in its sights , it is thought that al qaeda sees yemen as an ideal staging point for fanning the flames of extremism across the gulf of aden in somalia and beyond .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda has targeted kenya since the us embassy attack despite having a less direct shipping connection to yemen than somalia , sharing a border with the failed state puts kenya at risk of infiltration by islamist terror groups .
instead of having to navigate through the international forces in indian ocean to reach the kenyan coastline , arab-based terrorists can smuggle weapons and personnel overland to kenya via somalia .
it has been reported for as long as germany was part of operation enduring freedom that al qaeda was seeking a foothold in kenya and that al qaeda operatives had infiltrated the country 's islamic communities on its indian ocean coast .
poor relations between kenya 's coastal muslims and the country 's inefficient security forces have provided al qaeda with a new base from which it can extend its growing network throughout eastern africa .
inland in kenya , border camps filled with refugees from somalia are reported to be just as fertile a breeding ground for young extremists .
meanwhile , kenya has its own home grown terror problem .
the kenyan saleh ali saleh nabhan was alleged to have been the leader of al qaeda in somalia and the mastermind behind the bombing of the paradise hotel in mombasa and the attempted downing of an israeli passenger jet in november 2002 .
he was also suspected of involvement in the 1998 us embassy bombings in nairobi and dar es salaam in tanzania .
he was killed by us special forces near mogadishu in september 2009 .
changing face of mission shifts threat focus david hartwell , an expert and risk analyst for the middle east and north africa , believes that the changing nature of operation enduring freedom has shifted the focus away from its original mission meaning that the horn of africa and land-based threats are now longer in its remit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops will leave but the threat will remain " the germans have made a fair assessment on enduring freedom but it 's one based on the level of threat within the operation 's initial mission which was to capture fleeing extremists and taliban from afghanistan and stop them getting to places like yemen , saudi arabia and oman , " hartwell told deutsche welle . " in its original form , it has n't recorded that many successes as there have been few significant arrests of wanted figures on the seas .
as such , enduring freedom has mutated into the anti-piracy mission which is having more success in containing the pirates .
but it has been agreed that there is less of a need for naval forces to be searching for fleeing extremists now , especially in the gulf of aden and indian ocean . " " the region itself is still unstable with civil wars and extremism in both somalia and yemen but those involved in enduring freedom are wary of getting involved in the internal politics in these countries so we 'll see more countries following germany 's decision and refocusing on the piracy mission , " he added . author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 05.07.2010 netherlands , uruguay try to recapture past glory in first 2010 semifinal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of these teams will be playing on july 11 injuries and suspensions will force both the oranje and la celeste to improvise as they try to punch their ticket for the final .
and both will have to battle history in what could be a war of nerves . coming off their upset of brazil , and boasting a squad that features players from europe 's top clubs , holland are definitely the favorites .
but the dutch know all too well that in football , favorites do n't always win .
" we 're not strutting around all day doing the polonaise , " netherlands coach bert van marwijk said after his team 's stunning 2-1 defeat of the mighty selecao .
" we have n't yet reached our goal . "
holland are arguably soccer 's greatest underachievers .
the national team have never won a world cup and , despite consistently fielding some of the sport 's most innovative and entertaining teams , the last time they qualified for a final was way back in 1978 .
this time around they 're trying something different .
instead of total football , van marwijk - whose resume includes a stint at bundesliga side dortmund - has emphasized a control and efficiency reminiscent of past german teams .
bildunterschrift : the oranjes have been riding high without individual brilliance that has n't always sat well with free-wheeling stars like arjen robben , wesley sneijder and robin van persie , but it 's yielded results .
assistant coach frank de boer says the players have learned that winning ugly is better than losing beautifully .
" our goal was to gain stability , " de boer has told reporters .
" the team is mature and has internalized a system .
we 're now capable of getting off to poor starts and still winning matches . "
the oranje , however , will be missing two major sources of that stability , right-back gregory van der wiel and defensive midfielder nigel de jong , when they take to the pitch in cape town on tuesday .
both are suspended after picking up two yellow cards .
fortunately for the dutch , their opponents have far graver personnel issues .
bildunterschrift : suarez made a fine but costly save against ghana survival artists after his team 's heart-stopping victory over ghana on friday , uruguay coach oscar tabarez had spent much of his time defending striker luis suarez , whose last-second handball clearance would have done most goalkeepers proud - and earned the player a red card and a one-match ban .
now , tabarez will have to think about how to replace him - an unenviable task since none of his reserve strikers possess the pace or the touch of suarez .
much of the burden will fall on diego forlan .
uruguay 's one true superstar has had a stand-out tournament and has been one of the few players to be effective from distance .
but he 'll have to work harder than ever to create space for his shots .
bildunterschrift : forlan has been on the mark and the situation is even more troubling at the back .
left back jorge fucile is also suspended , while central defender and captain diego lugano is doubtful with a bruised knee - two potentially crushing blows for a defensively oriented team .
the main factor speaking for la celeste in this match is pride .
a two-time world cup winner -lrb- 1930 and 1950 -rrb- , uruguay has n't done this well since 1970 , and a trip to another final would be a massive achievement for a country of only 3.3 million inhabitants .
for that reason , holland are preaching caution .
" our next match is a very dangerous one , " van marwijk has said .
" uruguay 's players are tremendous fighters and survival artists . "
history in the making bildunterschrift : fans of both sides hope the party will continue given the personnel constellation , the likely course of this match is obvious .
the netherlands will have to attack while uruguay try to hang on , hoping for a goal against the run of play or a draw that would send the match to penalties .
the uglier the match , the better la celeste 's chances .
so uruguay are bound to try to irritate robben , sneijder and van persie with niggling fouls .
but can former reserves step up to fill the gaps and take some of the focus off forlan ?
uruguay 's captain , in any case , says the team is n't satisfied with just reaching the semis .
" we know that if we want to make history , we have to become champions , " diego lugano told reporters .
" we have two must-win matches to go .
it 's equally difficult and possible . "
the challenge for the oranje will be to keep their cool , stick with their game plan and trust that the superior quality will prevail , should they fail to break the match open with an early goal .
that 's a doable task - but one dutch sides have often been unequal to in the past .
one thing is certain : whichever team wins will reward long-suffering fans with their nation 's greatest world cup triumph in decades .
and that will add a bit of extra-tension to what 's already shaping up to be a nervy contest .

and both will have to battle history in what could be a war of nerves . coming off their upset of brazil , and boasting a squad that features players from europe 's top clubs , holland are definitely the favorites .
but the dutch know all too well that in football , favorites do n't always win .
" we 're not strutting around all day doing the polonaise , " netherlands coach bert van marwijk said after his team 's stunning 2-1 defeat of the mighty selecao .
" we have n't yet reached our goal . "
holland are arguably soccer 's greatest underachievers .
the national team have never won a world cup and , despite consistently fielding some of the sport 's most innovative and entertaining teams , the last time they qualified for a final was way back in 1978 .
this time around they 're trying something different .
instead of total football , van marwijk - whose resume includes a stint at bundesliga side dortmund - has emphasized a control and efficiency reminiscent of past german teams .
bildunterschrift : the oranjes have been riding high without individual brilliance that has n't always sat well with free-wheeling stars like arjen robben , wesley sneijder and robin van persie , but it 's yielded results .
assistant coach frank de boer says the players have learned that winning ugly is better than losing beautifully .
" our goal was to gain stability , " de boer has told reporters .
" the team is mature and has internalized a system .
we 're now capable of getting off to poor starts and still winning matches . "
the oranje , however , will be missing two major sources of that stability , right-back gregory van der wiel and defensive midfielder nigel de jong , when they take to the pitch in cape town on tuesday .
both are suspended after picking up two yellow cards .
fortunately for the dutch , their opponents have far graver personnel issues .
bildunterschrift : suarez made a fine but costly save against ghana survival artists after his team 's heart-stopping victory over ghana on friday , uruguay coach oscar tabarez had spent much of his time defending striker luis suarez , whose last-second handball clearance would have done most goalkeepers proud - and earned the player a red card and a one-match ban .

the resignations from alain joyandet , state secretary for overseas development , and christian blanc , state secretary for the greater paris region , followed disclosures that both politicians had abused their office perks .
joyandet came under fire following press reports that he hired a private jet costing 116,500 euros to fly on official business to the caribbean , when he could have taken a regular scheduled flight .
he was also criticized last month over claims he was granted a permit illegally to build an extension to his house in saint tropez .
blanc 's office spent 12,000 euros -lrb- $ 14,680 -rrb- on cigars , and the minister himself admitted to smoking a third of them .
he was ordered to pay back the full bill . the revelations came as the french government was looking to promote ministerial sobriety and budget austerity in the face of a deficit set to hit a record high of eight percent of gdp .
sarkozy asserts authority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both blanc -lrb- l . -rrb- and joyandet resigned on sunday the resignations came as a surprise , as two days previously sarkozy had publicly criticized the two men 's behavior and made clear they would be removed from their posts in the next cabinet reshuffle in october .
but the president appeared unwilling to sacrifice his labor minister , eric woerth , who has also faced corruption accusations .
woerth has been the subject of daily scrutiny over the so-called ' bettancourt affair . '
french authorities have ordered a full review into the tax situation of liliane bettancourt , the 87-year-old heiress of the l 'oreal cosmetics group , after one of her advisors acknowledged there may have been financial irregularities .
opposition politicians have questioned why woerth never ordered a review while he was budget minister from 2007 to 2010 , suggesting it may have been because his wife then worked for the company that managed bettancourt 's wealth .
woerth has denied any wrongdoing and sarkozy has openly defended him .
leftist leaders say the furor over blanc and joyandet is a " fire shield " to distract voters from woerth 's ongoing difficulties .
in order for the state to save money , neither minister will be replaced .
sarkozy has also ordered that official use of planes and cars be restricted and departmental parties banned .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 05.07.2010 komorowski wins polish presidential election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : komorowski says the european union is his top priority bronislaw komorowski , the candidate of poland 's ruling pro-business civic platform party , has become the country 's next president .
komorowski beat jaroslaw kaczynski by a margin of seven percent of the vote . liberal parliamentary speaker and acting president bronislaw komorowski has won poland 's presidential run-off election . with all votes counted , komorowski earned 53 percent of the vote , while his opponent , nationalist opposition leader jaroslaw kaczynski , gained 47 percent of the votes , according to the election commission . jaroslaw is the twin brother of former president lech kaczynski , who died in a plane crash on april 10 .
the election was triggered by the former leader 's sudden death , along with his wife and 95 others , in the crash . sunday 's election followed a first round of voting on june 20 , in which neither candidate secured a majority . ' good for poland ' on hearing early results , a beaming komorowski said that polish democracy had emerged the winner . " today democracy has won , our polish democracy , " komorowski said before a crowd of cheering supporters , adding that it was " important not to foment divisions , but to build a sense of unity . " kaczynski admitted defeat shortly after komorowski 's speech . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski has performed better than expected " i congratulate the winner .
i congratulate bronislaw komorowski , " kaczynski said from his campaign headquarters . german foreign minister guido westerwelle also offered his congratulations , describing the result as a step in the right direction for closer cooperation between poland and europe . " the polish people 's decision to elect komorowski is a strong pro-european signal , " westerwelle said in berlin .
" with president komorowski , as well as prime minister donald tusk and foreign minister radoslaw sikorski , we will have a strong partner for our path of trust and cooperation . " high turnout prior to the run-off election there were growing fears that the start of summer holidays in poland would make voters prefer baltic beaches to polling stations , though this did not materialize . at 52 percent , turnout was much higher than expected .
analysts said it was a clear sign of the mobilization of the two electorates : the traditional , conservative , euroskeptic and mostly rural supporters of kaczynski , and the more reform-minded , pro-european urban voters .
that division was apparent in a sampling of views among voters in warsaw . " we just need to stop kaczynski from winning .
he 's stuck in the past and he 's bad for poland 's position in the eu , " a young businessman told deutsche welle at a polling station in the leafy middle class warsaw suburb of jozefoslaw . " komorowski , together with the reformist prime minister , donald tusk , will lead us deeper into europe . "
however , a retired teacher offered this opinion of komorowski as she cast her ballot : " -lsb- he -rsb- represents those smug businesspeople who have been allowed to thrive at the expense of us pensioners .
i 'm voting for kaczynski , because he cares for people like me .
he 's a patriot who holds national values dear . ” european integration versus national values bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : komorowski insists poland must be closer to germany and france komorowski is a close ally of the prime minister .
both men argue that poland needs economic liberalization to maintain economic growth - the country was the only eu member to avoid recession last year , although growth slowed to 1.8 percent from 5 percent in 2008 . ahead of the run-off vote , kaczynski accused them both of plotting to privatize national health care and sell the country out to foreign investors at the expense of the poor .
komorowski has however insisted that european integration was his highest priority . " the number one issue is poland 's eu membership , strengthening its position there , developing the weimar triangle relationship with germany and france and building reconciliation with russia , " he said in a televised debate . " it is also in poland 's interests to serve as a champion of european integration with countries further east . " euroskeptic and nationalist kaczynski took a more nationalist tone .
while giving few specifics on foreign policy , he clearly stated his plans to carry on his late brother 's policies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : komorowski has secured the presidency " i wo n't let poland be treated as a minor partner by any other country in europe , " he said in the debate .
" foreign policy , which should clearly be the domain of the polish president , requires that the principle of sovereignty should be clearly adhered to , which does n't always happen under the present government . " critics say his unabashed euroskepticism , which he championed during his term as prime minister from 2006 to 2007 , alienated poland 's neighbors .
he said he currently has no interest in adopting the euro , pointing out that the free-floating zloty has helped poland ride out the economic crisis . " if we had pushed for the euro as the government wanted , we would today be in an economic catastrophe , " he said . author : david levitz / rafal kiepuszewski -lrb- reuters , afp , ap -rrb- editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and both will have to battle history in what could be a war of nerves . coming off their upset of brazil , and boasting a squad that features players from europe 's top clubs , holland are definitely the favorites .
but the dutch know all too well that in football , favorites do n't always win .
" we 're not strutting around all day doing the polonaise , " netherlands coach bert van marwijk said after his team 's stunning 2-1 defeat of the mighty selecao .
" we have n't yet reached our goal . "
holland are arguably soccer 's greatest underachievers .
the national team have never won a world cup and , despite consistently fielding some of the sport 's most innovative and entertaining teams , the last time they qualified for a final was way back in 1978 .
this time around they 're trying something different .
instead of total football , van marwijk - whose resume includes a stint at bundesliga side dortmund - has emphasized a control and efficiency reminiscent of past german teams .
bildunterschrift : the oranjes have been riding high without individual brilliance that has n't always sat well with free-wheeling stars like arjen robben , wesley sneijder and robin van persie , but it 's yielded results .
assistant coach frank de boer says the players have learned that winning ugly is better than losing beautifully .
" our goal was to gain stability , " de boer has told reporters .
" the team is mature and has internalized a system .
we 're now capable of getting off to poor starts and still winning matches . "
the oranje , however , will be missing two major sources of that stability , right-back gregory van der wiel and defensive midfielder nigel de jong , when they take to the pitch in cape town on tuesday .
both are suspended after picking up two yellow cards .
fortunately for the dutch , their opponents have far graver personnel issues .
bildunterschrift : suarez made a fine but costly save against ghana survival artists after his team 's heart-stopping victory over ghana on friday , uruguay coach oscar tabarez had spent much of his time defending striker luis suarez , whose last-second handball clearance would have done most goalkeepers proud - and earned the player a red card and a one-match ban .
now , tabarez will have to think about how to replace him - an unenviable task since none of his reserve strikers possess the pace or the touch of suarez .
much of the burden will fall on diego forlan .
uruguay 's one true superstar has had a stand-out tournament and has been one of the few players to be effective from distance .
but he 'll have to work harder than ever to create space for his shots .
bildunterschrift : forlan has been on the mark and the situation is even more troubling at the back .
left back jorge fucile is also suspended , while central defender and captain diego lugano is doubtful with a bruised knee - two potentially crushing blows for a defensively oriented team .
the main factor speaking for la celeste in this match is pride .
a two-time world cup winner -lrb- 1930 and 1950 -rrb- , uruguay has n't done this well since 1970 , and a trip to another final would be a massive achievement for a country of only 3.3 million inhabitants .
for that reason , holland are preaching caution .
" our next match is a very dangerous one , " van marwijk has said .
" uruguay 's players are tremendous fighters and survival artists . "
history in the making bildunterschrift : fans of both sides hope the party will continue given the personnel constellation , the likely course of this match is obvious .
the netherlands will have to attack while uruguay try to hang on , hoping for a goal against the run of play or a draw that would send the match to penalties .
the uglier the match , the better la celeste 's chances .
so uruguay are bound to try to irritate robben , sneijder and van persie with niggling fouls .
but can former reserves step up to fill the gaps and take some of the focus off forlan ?
uruguay 's captain , in any case , says the team is n't satisfied with just reaching the semis .
" we know that if we want to make history , we have to become champions , " diego lugano told reporters .
" we have two must-win matches to go .
it 's equally difficult and possible . "
the challenge for the oranje will be to keep their cool , stick with their game plan and trust that the superior quality will prevail , should they fail to break the match open with an early goal .
that 's a doable task - but one dutch sides have often been unequal to in the past .
one thing is certain : whichever team wins will reward long-suffering fans with their nation 's greatest world cup triumph in decades .
and that will add a bit of extra-tension to what 's already shaping up to be a nervy contest .

speaking a day after scoring a brace in germany 's 4-0 demolition of argentina in the quarters , klose said he had his eyes on becoming the all-time world cup top scorer .
" i want to score at least five goals at the world cup .
and i will be very satisfied if i score six , " klose told a news conference .
the 32-year-old scored five goals in world cups in 2002 and 2006 and has so far netted four times in the 2010 tournament .
that puts him one goal behind record scorer ronaldo of brazil , who netted 15 world cup goals between 1998 and 2006 .
measured , yet confident klose said that his team would n't get carried away after several resounding victories throughout the competition , including a 4-1 win over england and a 4-0 thumping of australia .
" spain is better than england and argentina , no question .
they are not unbeatable , and we will try to expose their weaknesses ...
we are better than 2008 and want to show that on the pitch , " said klose .
the germans will line up against spain without young forward thomas mueller , whose red-hot form has been one of the pillars of germany 's effectiveness .
the 20-year-old was given a yellow card in the win against argentina and will miss the semifinal clash .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller has been a revelation this world cup germany coach joachim loew sought to downplay worries over having to rejig his lineup , insisting he had enough talent at his disposal to cover the loss of mueller .
" it 's clear it 's a blow for us - he has shown himself to be dangerous in front of goal .
but we have players who can replace him , " loew said .
possible replacements for mueller include hamburg attacking midfielder piotr trochowski and young bayern attacker toni kroos , both of whom have been given game time in south africa .
stuttgart-based striker cacau is also an option , but rumors still persist about an abdominal muscle strain that kept him out of the quarterfinals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 05.07.2010 netherlands , uruguay try to recapture past glory in first 2010 semifinal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of these teams will be playing on july 11 injuries and suspensions will force both the oranje and la celeste to improvise as they try to punch their ticket for the final .
and both will have to battle history in what could be a war of nerves . coming off their upset of brazil , and boasting a squad that features players from europe 's top clubs , holland are definitely the favorites .
but the dutch know all too well that in football , favorites do n't always win .
" we 're not strutting around all day doing the polonaise , " netherlands coach bert van marwijk said after his team 's stunning 2-1 defeat of the mighty selecao .
" we have n't yet reached our goal . "
holland are arguably soccer 's greatest underachievers .
the national team have never won a world cup and , despite consistently fielding some of the sport 's most innovative and entertaining teams , the last time they qualified for a final was way back in 1978 .
this time around they 're trying something different .
instead of total football , van marwijk - whose resume includes a stint at bundesliga side dortmund - has emphasized a control and efficiency reminiscent of past german teams .
bildunterschrift : the oranjes have been riding high without individual brilliance that has n't always sat well with free-wheeling stars like arjen robben , wesley sneijder and robin van persie , but it 's yielded results .
assistant coach frank de boer says the players have learned that winning ugly is better than losing beautifully .
" our goal was to gain stability , " de boer has told reporters .
" the team is mature and has internalized a system .
we 're now capable of getting off to poor starts and still winning matches . "
the oranje , however , will be missing two major sources of that stability , right-back gregory van der wiel and defensive midfielder nigel de jong , when they take to the pitch in cape town on tuesday .
both are suspended after picking up two yellow cards .
fortunately for the dutch , their opponents have far graver personnel issues .
bildunterschrift : suarez made a fine but costly save against ghana survival artists after his team 's heart-stopping victory over ghana on friday , uruguay coach oscar tabarez had spent much of his time defending striker luis suarez , whose last-second handball clearance would have done most goalkeepers proud - and earned the player a red card and a one-match ban .
now , tabarez will have to think about how to replace him - an unenviable task since none of his reserve strikers possess the pace or the touch of suarez .
much of the burden will fall on diego forlan .
uruguay 's one true superstar has had a stand-out tournament and has been one of the few players to be effective from distance .
but he 'll have to work harder than ever to create space for his shots .
bildunterschrift : forlan has been on the mark and the situation is even more troubling at the back .
left back jorge fucile is also suspended , while central defender and captain diego lugano is doubtful with a bruised knee - two potentially crushing blows for a defensively oriented team .
the main factor speaking for la celeste in this match is pride .
a two-time world cup winner -lrb- 1930 and 1950 -rrb- , uruguay has n't done this well since 1970 , and a trip to another final would be a massive achievement for a country of only 3.3 million inhabitants .
for that reason , holland are preaching caution .
" our next match is a very dangerous one , " van marwijk has said .
" uruguay 's players are tremendous fighters and survival artists . "
history in the making bildunterschrift : fans of both sides hope the party will continue given the personnel constellation , the likely course of this match is obvious .
the netherlands will have to attack while uruguay try to hang on , hoping for a goal against the run of play or a draw that would send the match to penalties .
the uglier the match , the better la celeste 's chances .
so uruguay are bound to try to irritate robben , sneijder and van persie with niggling fouls .
but can former reserves step up to fill the gaps and take some of the focus off forlan ?
uruguay 's captain , in any case , says the team is n't satisfied with just reaching the semis .
" we know that if we want to make history , we have to become champions , " diego lugano told reporters .
" we have two must-win matches to go .
it 's equally difficult and possible . "
the challenge for the oranje will be to keep their cool , stick with their game plan and trust that the superior quality will prevail , should they fail to break the match open with an early goal .
that 's a doable task - but one dutch sides have often been unequal to in the past .
one thing is certain : whichever team wins will reward long-suffering fans with their nation 's greatest world cup triumph in decades .
and that will add a bit of extra-tension to what 's already shaping up to be a nervy contest .

two turkish newspapers had quoted davutoglu as saying ties with israel would be severed unless turkey received an apology for the flotilla raid or israel accepted the outcome of an independent inquiry into the incident .
in response to davutoglu 's alleged remarks , israeli foreign minister avigdor lieberman said during a trip to latvia that israel did n't " have any intention to apologize . "
later on monday , however , a spokesman for the turkish government told the reuters news agency that davutoglu had been misquoted in the newspaper reports .
the official claimed that davutoglu actually said that relations with israel would not improve if an apology was not issued .
the two countries have been on bad terms since the may 31 raid on a gaza-bound aid flotilla .
nine turkish nationals died after israeli military personnel boarded one of the ships . each side subsequently blamed the other for starting the violent confrontation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 05.07.2010 opinion : poland voted for europe by electing komorowski großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with a lean majority at 53 percent of the vote , liberal conservative leader bronislaw komorowski is set to become poland ’ s next president .
dw ’ s bartosz dudek sees komorowski ’ s win as a victory for europe . president-elect bronislaw komorowski and his liberal conservative party civic platform stand for a europe-friendly and future-oriented poland .
they also value dialogue and compromise in their political dealings .
but defeated presidential candidate jaroslaw kaczynski also achieved considerable success in this election .
his 47 percent of the vote is a political base upon which his conservative law and justice party can build upon in the next parliamentary elections in 2011 .
komorowski 's kingmakers were poland 's left-of-center voters .
though rival jaroslaw kaczynski made a leftist , populist turn at the end of his campaign , it simply was not enough to win over left-of-center voters .
even kaczynski 's praise of communist-era social policies could not sway them .
two-thirds of the left-of-center voters marked komorowski 's name on their ballots , making him the country 's next president .
the close result of the election also demonstrates to what extent poland is politically divided .
while komorowski 's campaign spoke to younger , educated , urban voters , kaczynski tended to attract older , less educated and more rural voters .
there can also be no talk of true defeat in this election because , as leader of the largest opposition party , the power-hungry kaczynski will long remain a serious rival to liberal-conservative prime minister donald tusk and president-elect bronislaw komorowski .
therefore , kaczynski 's success at the polls must be heeded as a warning .
the path for kaczynski 's return to power would already be paved , should warsaw 's current coalition government wind up presiding over corruption , rising joblessness , or harsh social policies .
if kaczynski were to return as poland 's prime minister , he could throw poland back into the domestic and foreign confrontations that once dominated the country 's politics .
so komorowski 's election is not only good news not only poland but also for german-polish relations and for europe as a whole .
a cheerful , aimiable polish president with foreign affairs experience and good relations with other european leaders will make poland a stable pillar of european politics . this bodes well for the polish eu presidency in 2011 and the beleaguered european union .

speaking a day after scoring a brace in germany 's 4-0 demolition of argentina in the quarters , klose said he had his eyes on becoming the all-time world cup top scorer .
" i want to score at least five goals at the world cup .
and i will be very satisfied if i score six , " klose told a news conference .
the 32-year-old scored five goals in world cups in 2002 and 2006 and has so far netted four times in the 2010 tournament .
that puts him one goal behind record scorer ronaldo of brazil , who netted 15 world cup goals between 1998 and 2006 .
measured , yet confident klose said that his team would n't get carried away after several resounding victories throughout the competition , including a 4-1 win over england and a 4-0 thumping of australia .
" spain is better than england and argentina , no question .
they are not unbeatable , and we will try to expose their weaknesses ...
we are better than 2008 and want to show that on the pitch , " said klose .
the germans will line up against spain without young forward thomas mueller , whose red-hot form has been one of the pillars of germany 's effectiveness .
the 20-year-old was given a yellow card in the win against argentina and will miss the semifinal clash .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller has been a revelation this world cup germany coach joachim loew sought to downplay worries over having to rejig his lineup , insisting he had enough talent at his disposal to cover the loss of mueller .
" it 's clear it 's a blow for us - he has shown himself to be dangerous in front of goal .
but we have players who can replace him , " loew said .
possible replacements for mueller include hamburg attacking midfielder piotr trochowski and young bayern attacker toni kroos , both of whom have been given game time in south africa .
stuttgart-based striker cacau is also an option , but rumors still persist about an abdominal muscle strain that kept him out of the quarterfinals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 05.07.2010 daimler plans electric motor scooter großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carmakers see market for city electric motor scooters daimler plans an electric scooter as the carmaker moves to build different types of electric vehicles for different market segments .
it 's not the first motorcycle , by the way , to come from the stuttgart-based car icon . the news came from the top .
in a television program over the weekend , daimler chief executive officer dieter zetsche said the german carmaker " will soon present an e-scooter . "
while many daimler car fans may wonder why the company would want to add e-scooters to its premium car and truck-dominated product portfolio , car analysts are n't surprised by the move .
" it 's all about the e-mobility push by the car industry , " christoph stuermer , an auto analyst with ihs global insight in frankfurt , told deutsche welle .
" a key element of this strategy is to build specific vehicles , like e-scooters , for specific market segments , such as short-distance travel in urban areas .
daimler aims to fill all these segments with products . "
bildunterschrift : lithium-ion batteries are powering a new wave of e-scooters global effort daimler spokeswoman eva wiese batted down speculation that daimler may hand over development of the new e-scooter to its new chinese electric vehicle partner , byd , which is specialized in car battery and drive technology .
" we will develop the e-scooter ourselves , using components , of course , from our global network of suppliers , " wiese told deutsche welle .
" it will be a global product , as all our products are . "
while motorcycle manufacturing , arguably , has not been a core competency of daimler , company co-founder gottlieb daimler is credited with having invented the first gasoline engine-powered motorcycle in 1885 .
essentially , it was a four-stroke internal combustion engine mounted on a wooden bicycle .
bmw and peugeot with head start much has happened in the way of motorcycle development since then , most recently in the area of electrically powered systems .
and perhaps to the dismay of daimler , some of its major competitors in europe , including bmw and peugeot , have a head start .
in the early 2000s , bmw launched the c1 , an enclosed scooter with many innovative features to protect the rider in an accident .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler now offers an electric version of its smart urban car last year , bmw , which manufacturers both cars and motorcycles , also unveiled an electric version of the scooter for the european safer urban motorcycling project .
the electric motor is powered by a lithium-ion battery with sufficient power for most inner-city driving conditions .
french carmaker peugeot , which mass-produced its first e-scooter 15 years ago , has launched yet another , the e-vivacity .
it is also equipped with lithium-ion battery capable of covering up to 100 kilometers on the road .
" it 's a logical move for daimler to build an e-scooter , " stuermer said .
" the company is engineering an electrical version of its smart urban car and hybrid models of its sedans for longer distances .
and now it plans a light vehicle for short city trips .
it 's filling all the gaps . "

and both will have to battle history in what could be a war of nerves . coming off their upset of brazil , and boasting a squad that features players from europe 's top clubs , holland are definitely the favorites .
but the dutch know all too well that in football , favorites do n't always win .
" we 're not strutting around all day doing the polonaise , " netherlands coach bert van marwijk said after his team 's stunning 2-1 defeat of the mighty selecao .
" we have n't yet reached our goal . "
holland are arguably soccer 's greatest underachievers .
the national team have never won a world cup and , despite consistently fielding some of the sport 's most innovative and entertaining teams , the last time they qualified for a final was way back in 1978 .
this time around they 're trying something different .
instead of total football , van marwijk - whose resume includes a stint at bundesliga side dortmund - has emphasized a control and efficiency reminiscent of past german teams .
bildunterschrift : the oranjes have been riding high without individual brilliance that has n't always sat well with free-wheeling stars like arjen robben , wesley sneijder and robin van persie , but it 's yielded results .
assistant coach frank de boer says the players have learned that winning ugly is better than losing beautifully .
" our goal was to gain stability , " de boer has told reporters .
" the team is mature and has internalized a system .
we 're now capable of getting off to poor starts and still winning matches . "
the oranje , however , will be missing two major sources of that stability , right-back gregory van der wiel and defensive midfielder nigel de jong , when they take to the pitch in cape town on tuesday .
both are suspended after picking up two yellow cards .
fortunately for the dutch , their opponents have far graver personnel issues .
bildunterschrift : suarez made a fine but costly save against ghana survival artists after his team 's heart-stopping victory over ghana on friday , uruguay coach oscar tabarez had spent much of his time defending striker luis suarez , whose last-second handball clearance would have done most goalkeepers proud - and earned the player a red card and a one-match ban .
now , tabarez will have to think about how to replace him - an unenviable task since none of his reserve strikers possess the pace or the touch of suarez .
much of the burden will fall on diego forlan .
uruguay 's one true superstar has had a stand-out tournament and has been one of the few players to be effective from distance .
but he 'll have to work harder than ever to create space for his shots .
bildunterschrift : forlan has been on the mark and the situation is even more troubling at the back .
left back jorge fucile is also suspended , while central defender and captain diego lugano is doubtful with a bruised knee - two potentially crushing blows for a defensively oriented team .
the main factor speaking for la celeste in this match is pride .
a two-time world cup winner -lrb- 1930 and 1950 -rrb- , uruguay has n't done this well since 1970 , and a trip to another final would be a massive achievement for a country of only 3.3 million inhabitants .
for that reason , holland are preaching caution .
" our next match is a very dangerous one , " van marwijk has said .
" uruguay 's players are tremendous fighters and survival artists . "
history in the making bildunterschrift : fans of both sides hope the party will continue given the personnel constellation , the likely course of this match is obvious .
the netherlands will have to attack while uruguay try to hang on , hoping for a goal against the run of play or a draw that would send the match to penalties .
the uglier the match , the better la celeste 's chances .
so uruguay are bound to try to irritate robben , sneijder and van persie with niggling fouls .
but can former reserves step up to fill the gaps and take some of the focus off forlan ?
uruguay 's captain , in any case , says the team is n't satisfied with just reaching the semis .
" we know that if we want to make history , we have to become champions , " diego lugano told reporters .
" we have two must-win matches to go .
it 's equally difficult and possible . "
the challenge for the oranje will be to keep their cool , stick with their game plan and trust that the superior quality will prevail , should they fail to break the match open with an early goal .
that 's a doable task - but one dutch sides have often been unequal to in the past .
one thing is certain : whichever team wins will reward long-suffering fans with their nation 's greatest world cup triumph in decades .
and that will add a bit of extra-tension to what 's already shaping up to be a nervy contest .

but this does n't mean ankara is turning its back on europe , says bahaeddin guengoer of deutsche welle 's turkish service . turkey can explain itself however it likes .
but its latest diplomatic actions - its " no " to iran sanctions in the un security council ; its goal of carrying out a zero-problem policy with all its neighbors - are being met in the west with anxious questions .
is turkey turning away from the west ?
does it see its future in the islamic camp ?
the answer to such questions is a definite " no . "
turkey is not turning its back on the west !
yes , the goal of eu accession is losing priority in ankara 's current policy .
turkey is acting with a new level of self-confidence in the international diplomatic arena , and no one should resent the country for trying to build up its status as a regional power - or for trying to look beyond the narrow confines of europe .
turkey seeks new responsibility tacticians from washington , brazil and brussels to tehran , the middle east and moscow have been trying to instrumentalize nato-member turkey to serve their own diplomatic goals for nearly 60 years .
now , turkey wants to take on more responsibility : in conflict regions like the middle east and the caucasus , as an arbitrator in atomic negotiations with iran , and not least as a reliable energy route for the west .
questioning whether turkey belongs in the european or the oriental camp is easy to understand - but its not justifiable .
since its founding nearly nine decades ago , the modern turkish republic has decided in favor of europe , and therefore , in favor of the west .
despite this , ankara ca n't look forward to being greeted with open arms in its efforts to join the european union - nor does the islamic world celebrate turkey 's western orientation .
its dialog with hamas as an unspoken condition for a dialog with iran , and its over-eager actions toward reprimanding israel , have led to a great deal of resentment in europe and the us - and at the same time , done serious damage to its relations with the jewish state .
two sides of a coin purely in terms of numbers , turkey has what it takes to back up its ambitions of strength .
the country has seen nearly 12 percent economic growth in the first quarter of the year , along with being the 16th-strongest economy in the world , and the 7th in europe .
but that is just one side of the coin .
on the other side is the growing polarization between the religious and the secular in a turkey whose population has yet to taste many of the fruits of economic growth .
the continuous lack of democratic process , the weak grasp of the concept of press freedom in a gray zone , or the unwillingness of prime minsiter erdogan to deal with criticism of either himself or his policies , are all alarming threats to domestic stability .
turkey belongs in europe !
europe and turkey need one another like never before .
turkey needs europe in order to build itself up as a regional power and to give it more weight in its influence on its neighbors .
for its part , without turkey , europe reduces its chances of succeeding in its global goals and strategies .
europe 's unified rejection of turkey needs to give way .
instead of explaining why turkey should n't accede to the eu , the heads of the european states should be racking their brains about how to make accession happen - or at least how to begin the process , since full membership is unlikely in the near future .
meanwhile , turkey is right to intensively build up its status as a regional power , instead of trying at all cost to become a member of a weaker , crisis-plagued eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 05.07.2010 daimler plans electric motor scooter großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carmakers see market for city electric motor scooters daimler plans an electric scooter as the carmaker moves to build different types of electric vehicles for different market segments .
it 's not the first motorcycle , by the way , to come from the stuttgart-based car icon . the news came from the top .
in a television program over the weekend , daimler chief executive officer dieter zetsche said the german carmaker " will soon present an e-scooter . "
while many daimler car fans may wonder why the company would want to add e-scooters to its premium car and truck-dominated product portfolio , car analysts are n't surprised by the move .
" it 's all about the e-mobility push by the car industry , " christoph stuermer , an auto analyst with ihs global insight in frankfurt , told deutsche welle .
" a key element of this strategy is to build specific vehicles , like e-scooters , for specific market segments , such as short-distance travel in urban areas .
daimler aims to fill all these segments with products . "
bildunterschrift : lithium-ion batteries are powering a new wave of e-scooters global effort daimler spokeswoman eva wiese batted down speculation that daimler may hand over development of the new e-scooter to its new chinese electric vehicle partner , byd , which is specialized in car battery and drive technology .
" we will develop the e-scooter ourselves , using components , of course , from our global network of suppliers , " wiese told deutsche welle .
" it will be a global product , as all our products are . "
while motorcycle manufacturing , arguably , has not been a core competency of daimler , company co-founder gottlieb daimler is credited with having invented the first gasoline engine-powered motorcycle in 1885 .
essentially , it was a four-stroke internal combustion engine mounted on a wooden bicycle .
bmw and peugeot with head start much has happened in the way of motorcycle development since then , most recently in the area of electrically powered systems .
and perhaps to the dismay of daimler , some of its major competitors in europe , including bmw and peugeot , have a head start .
in the early 2000s , bmw launched the c1 , an enclosed scooter with many innovative features to protect the rider in an accident .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler now offers an electric version of its smart urban car last year , bmw , which manufacturers both cars and motorcycles , also unveiled an electric version of the scooter for the european safer urban motorcycling project .
the electric motor is powered by a lithium-ion battery with sufficient power for most inner-city driving conditions .
french carmaker peugeot , which mass-produced its first e-scooter 15 years ago , has launched yet another , the e-vivacity .
it is also equipped with lithium-ion battery capable of covering up to 100 kilometers on the road .
" it 's a logical move for daimler to build an e-scooter , " stuermer said .
" the company is engineering an electrical version of its smart urban car and hybrid models of its sedans for longer distances .
and now it plans a light vehicle for short city trips .
it 's filling all the gaps . "

dw ’ s bartosz dudek sees komorowski ’ s win as a victory for europe . president-elect bronislaw komorowski and his liberal conservative party civic platform stand for a europe-friendly and future-oriented poland .
they also value dialogue and compromise in their political dealings .
but defeated presidential candidate jaroslaw kaczynski also achieved considerable success in this election .
his 47 percent of the vote is a political base upon which his conservative law and justice party can build upon in the next parliamentary elections in 2011 .
komorowski 's kingmakers were poland 's left-of-center voters .
though rival jaroslaw kaczynski made a leftist , populist turn at the end of his campaign , it simply was not enough to win over left-of-center voters .
even kaczynski 's praise of communist-era social policies could not sway them .
two-thirds of the left-of-center voters marked komorowski 's name on their ballots , making him the country 's next president .
the close result of the election also demonstrates to what extent poland is politically divided .
while komorowski 's campaign spoke to younger , educated , urban voters , kaczynski tended to attract older , less educated and more rural voters .
there can also be no talk of true defeat in this election because , as leader of the largest opposition party , the power-hungry kaczynski will long remain a serious rival to liberal-conservative prime minister donald tusk and president-elect bronislaw komorowski .
therefore , kaczynski 's success at the polls must be heeded as a warning .
the path for kaczynski 's return to power would already be paved , should warsaw 's current coalition government wind up presiding over corruption , rising joblessness , or harsh social policies .
if kaczynski were to return as poland 's prime minister , he could throw poland back into the domestic and foreign confrontations that once dominated the country 's politics .
so komorowski 's election is not only good news not only poland but also for german-polish relations and for europe as a whole .
a cheerful , aimiable polish president with foreign affairs experience and good relations with other european leaders will make poland a stable pillar of european politics . this bodes well for the polish eu presidency in 2011 and the beleaguered european union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 05.07.2010 netherlands , uruguay try to recapture past glory in first 2010 semifinal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of these teams will be playing on july 11 injuries and suspensions will force both the oranje and la celeste to improvise as they try to punch their ticket for the final .
and both will have to battle history in what could be a war of nerves . coming off their upset of brazil , and boasting a squad that features players from europe 's top clubs , holland are definitely the favorites .
but the dutch know all too well that in football , favorites do n't always win .
" we 're not strutting around all day doing the polonaise , " netherlands coach bert van marwijk said after his team 's stunning 2-1 defeat of the mighty selecao .
" we have n't yet reached our goal . "
holland are arguably soccer 's greatest underachievers .
the national team have never won a world cup and , despite consistently fielding some of the sport 's most innovative and entertaining teams , the last time they qualified for a final was way back in 1978 .
this time around they 're trying something different .
instead of total football , van marwijk - whose resume includes a stint at bundesliga side dortmund - has emphasized a control and efficiency reminiscent of past german teams .
bildunterschrift : the oranjes have been riding high without individual brilliance that has n't always sat well with free-wheeling stars like arjen robben , wesley sneijder and robin van persie , but it 's yielded results .
assistant coach frank de boer says the players have learned that winning ugly is better than losing beautifully .
" our goal was to gain stability , " de boer has told reporters .
" the team is mature and has internalized a system .
we 're now capable of getting off to poor starts and still winning matches . "
the oranje , however , will be missing two major sources of that stability , right-back gregory van der wiel and defensive midfielder nigel de jong , when they take to the pitch in cape town on tuesday .
both are suspended after picking up two yellow cards .
fortunately for the dutch , their opponents have far graver personnel issues .
bildunterschrift : suarez made a fine but costly save against ghana survival artists after his team 's heart-stopping victory over ghana on friday , uruguay coach oscar tabarez had spent much of his time defending striker luis suarez , whose last-second handball clearance would have done most goalkeepers proud - and earned the player a red card and a one-match ban .
now , tabarez will have to think about how to replace him - an unenviable task since none of his reserve strikers possess the pace or the touch of suarez .
much of the burden will fall on diego forlan .
uruguay 's one true superstar has had a stand-out tournament and has been one of the few players to be effective from distance .
but he 'll have to work harder than ever to create space for his shots .
bildunterschrift : forlan has been on the mark and the situation is even more troubling at the back .
left back jorge fucile is also suspended , while central defender and captain diego lugano is doubtful with a bruised knee - two potentially crushing blows for a defensively oriented team .
the main factor speaking for la celeste in this match is pride .
a two-time world cup winner -lrb- 1930 and 1950 -rrb- , uruguay has n't done this well since 1970 , and a trip to another final would be a massive achievement for a country of only 3.3 million inhabitants .
for that reason , holland are preaching caution .
" our next match is a very dangerous one , " van marwijk has said .
" uruguay 's players are tremendous fighters and survival artists . "
history in the making bildunterschrift : fans of both sides hope the party will continue given the personnel constellation , the likely course of this match is obvious .
the netherlands will have to attack while uruguay try to hang on , hoping for a goal against the run of play or a draw that would send the match to penalties .
the uglier the match , the better la celeste 's chances .
so uruguay are bound to try to irritate robben , sneijder and van persie with niggling fouls .
but can former reserves step up to fill the gaps and take some of the focus off forlan ?
uruguay 's captain , in any case , says the team is n't satisfied with just reaching the semis .
" we know that if we want to make history , we have to become champions , " diego lugano told reporters .
" we have two must-win matches to go .
it 's equally difficult and possible . "
the challenge for the oranje will be to keep their cool , stick with their game plan and trust that the superior quality will prevail , should they fail to break the match open with an early goal .
that 's a doable task - but one dutch sides have often been unequal to in the past .
one thing is certain : whichever team wins will reward long-suffering fans with their nation 's greatest world cup triumph in decades .
and that will add a bit of extra-tension to what 's already shaping up to be a nervy contest .

two turkish newspapers had quoted davutoglu as saying ties with israel would be severed unless turkey received an apology for the flotilla raid or israel accepted the outcome of an independent inquiry into the incident .
in response to davutoglu 's alleged remarks , israeli foreign minister avigdor lieberman said during a trip to latvia that israel did n't " have any intention to apologize . "
later on monday , however , a spokesman for the turkish government told the reuters news agency that davutoglu had been misquoted in the newspaper reports .
the official claimed that davutoglu actually said that relations with israel would not improve if an apology was not issued .
the two countries have been on bad terms since the may 31 raid on a gaza-bound aid flotilla .
nine turkish nationals died after israeli military personnel boarded one of the ships . each side subsequently blamed the other for starting the violent confrontation .

the resignations from alain joyandet , state secretary for overseas development , and christian blanc , state secretary for the greater paris region , followed disclosures that both politicians had abused their office perks .
joyandet came under fire following press reports that he hired a private jet costing 116,500 euros to fly on official business to the caribbean , when he could have taken a regular scheduled flight .
he was also criticized last month over claims he was granted a permit illegally to build an extension to his house in saint tropez .
blanc 's office spent 12,000 euros -lrb- $ 14,680 -rrb- on cigars , and the minister himself admitted to smoking a third of them .
he was ordered to pay back the full bill . the revelations came as the french government was looking to promote ministerial sobriety and budget austerity in the face of a deficit set to hit a record high of eight percent of gdp .

woerth has been the subject of daily scrutiny over the so-called ' bettancourt affair . '
french authorities have ordered a full review into the tax situation of liliane bettancourt , the 87-year-old heiress of the l 'oreal cosmetics group , after one of her advisors acknowledged there may have been financial irregularities .
opposition politicians have questioned why woerth never ordered a review while he was budget minister from 2007 to 2010 , suggesting it may have been because his wife then worked for the company that managed bettancourt 's wealth .
woerth has denied any wrongdoing and sarkozy has openly defended him .
leftist leaders say the furor over blanc and joyandet is a " fire shield " to distract voters from woerth 's ongoing difficulties .
in order for the state to save money , neither minister will be replaced .
sarkozy has also ordered that official use of planes and cars be restricted and departmental parties banned .

speaking a day after scoring a brace in germany 's 4-0 demolition of argentina in the quarters , klose said he had his eyes on becoming the all-time world cup top scorer .
" i want to score at least five goals at the world cup .
and i will be very satisfied if i score six , " klose told a news conference .
the 32-year-old scored five goals in world cups in 2002 and 2006 and has so far netted four times in the 2010 tournament .
that puts him one goal behind record scorer ronaldo of brazil , who netted 15 world cup goals between 1998 and 2006 .
measured , yet confident klose said that his team would n't get carried away after several resounding victories throughout the competition , including a 4-1 win over england and a 4-0 thumping of australia .
" spain is better than england and argentina , no question .
they are not unbeatable , and we will try to expose their weaknesses ...
we are better than 2008 and want to show that on the pitch , " said klose .
the germans will line up against spain without young forward thomas mueller , whose red-hot form has been one of the pillars of germany 's effectiveness .
the 20-year-old was given a yellow card in the win against argentina and will miss the semifinal clash .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller has been a revelation this world cup germany coach joachim loew sought to downplay worries over having to rejig his lineup , insisting he had enough talent at his disposal to cover the loss of mueller .
" it 's clear it 's a blow for us - he has shown himself to be dangerous in front of goal .
but we have players who can replace him , " loew said .
possible replacements for mueller include hamburg attacking midfielder piotr trochowski and young bayern attacker toni kroos , both of whom have been given game time in south africa .
stuttgart-based striker cacau is also an option , but rumors still persist about an abdominal muscle strain that kept him out of the quarterfinals .

speaking a day after scoring a brace in germany 's 4-0 demolition of argentina in the quarters , klose said he had his eyes on becoming the all-time world cup top scorer .
" i want to score at least five goals at the world cup .
and i will be very satisfied if i score six , " klose told a news conference .
the 32-year-old scored five goals in world cups in 2002 and 2006 and has so far netted four times in the 2010 tournament .
that puts him one goal behind record scorer ronaldo of brazil , who netted 15 world cup goals between 1998 and 2006 .
measured , yet confident klose said that his team would n't get carried away after several resounding victories throughout the competition , including a 4-1 win over england and a 4-0 thumping of australia .
" spain is better than england and argentina , no question .
they are not unbeatable , and we will try to expose their weaknesses ...
we are better than 2008 and want to show that on the pitch , " said klose .
the germans will line up against spain without young forward thomas mueller , whose red-hot form has been one of the pillars of germany 's effectiveness .
the 20-year-old was given a yellow card in the win against argentina and will miss the semifinal clash .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller has been a revelation this world cup germany coach joachim loew sought to downplay worries over having to rejig his lineup , insisting he had enough talent at his disposal to cover the loss of mueller .
" it 's clear it 's a blow for us - he has shown himself to be dangerous in front of goal .
but we have players who can replace him , " loew said .
possible replacements for mueller include hamburg attacking midfielder piotr trochowski and young bayern attacker toni kroos , both of whom have been given game time in south africa .
stuttgart-based striker cacau is also an option , but rumors still persist about an abdominal muscle strain that kept him out of the quarterfinals .

but this does n't mean ankara is turning its back on europe , says bahaeddin guengoer of deutsche welle 's turkish service . turkey can explain itself however it likes .
but its latest diplomatic actions - its " no " to iran sanctions in the un security council ; its goal of carrying out a zero-problem policy with all its neighbors - are being met in the west with anxious questions .
is turkey turning away from the west ?
does it see its future in the islamic camp ?
the answer to such questions is a definite " no . "
turkey is not turning its back on the west !
yes , the goal of eu accession is losing priority in ankara 's current policy .
turkey is acting with a new level of self-confidence in the international diplomatic arena , and no one should resent the country for trying to build up its status as a regional power - or for trying to look beyond the narrow confines of europe .
turkey seeks new responsibility tacticians from washington , brazil and brussels to tehran , the middle east and moscow have been trying to instrumentalize nato-member turkey to serve their own diplomatic goals for nearly 60 years .
now , turkey wants to take on more responsibility : in conflict regions like the middle east and the caucasus , as an arbitrator in atomic negotiations with iran , and not least as a reliable energy route for the west .
questioning whether turkey belongs in the european or the oriental camp is easy to understand - but its not justifiable .
since its founding nearly nine decades ago , the modern turkish republic has decided in favor of europe , and therefore , in favor of the west .
despite this , ankara ca n't look forward to being greeted with open arms in its efforts to join the european union - nor does the islamic world celebrate turkey 's western orientation .
its dialog with hamas as an unspoken condition for a dialog with iran , and its over-eager actions toward reprimanding israel , have led to a great deal of resentment in europe and the us - and at the same time , done serious damage to its relations with the jewish state .
two sides of a coin purely in terms of numbers , turkey has what it takes to back up its ambitions of strength .
the country has seen nearly 12 percent economic growth in the first quarter of the year , along with being the 16th-strongest economy in the world , and the 7th in europe .
but that is just one side of the coin .
on the other side is the growing polarization between the religious and the secular in a turkey whose population has yet to taste many of the fruits of economic growth .
the continuous lack of democratic process , the weak grasp of the concept of press freedom in a gray zone , or the unwillingness of prime minsiter erdogan to deal with criticism of either himself or his policies , are all alarming threats to domestic stability .
turkey belongs in europe !
europe and turkey need one another like never before .
turkey needs europe in order to build itself up as a regional power and to give it more weight in its influence on its neighbors .
for its part , without turkey , europe reduces its chances of succeeding in its global goals and strategies .
europe 's unified rejection of turkey needs to give way .
instead of explaining why turkey should n't accede to the eu , the heads of the european states should be racking their brains about how to make accession happen - or at least how to begin the process , since full membership is unlikely in the near future .
meanwhile , turkey is right to intensively build up its status as a regional power , instead of trying at all cost to become a member of a weaker , crisis-plagued eu .

but this does n't mean ankara is turning its back on europe , says bahaeddin guengoer of deutsche welle 's turkish service . turkey can explain itself however it likes .
but its latest diplomatic actions - its " no " to iran sanctions in the un security council ; its goal of carrying out a zero-problem policy with all its neighbors - are being met in the west with anxious questions .
is turkey turning away from the west ?
does it see its future in the islamic camp ?
the answer to such questions is a definite " no . "
turkey is not turning its back on the west !
yes , the goal of eu accession is losing priority in ankara 's current policy .
turkey is acting with a new level of self-confidence in the international diplomatic arena , and no one should resent the country for trying to build up its status as a regional power - or for trying to look beyond the narrow confines of europe .
turkey seeks new responsibility tacticians from washington , brazil and brussels to tehran , the middle east and moscow have been trying to instrumentalize nato-member turkey to serve their own diplomatic goals for nearly 60 years .
now , turkey wants to take on more responsibility : in conflict regions like the middle east and the caucasus , as an arbitrator in atomic negotiations with iran , and not least as a reliable energy route for the west .
questioning whether turkey belongs in the european or the oriental camp is easy to understand - but its not justifiable .
since its founding nearly nine decades ago , the modern turkish republic has decided in favor of europe , and therefore , in favor of the west .
despite this , ankara ca n't look forward to being greeted with open arms in its efforts to join the european union - nor does the islamic world celebrate turkey 's western orientation .
its dialog with hamas as an unspoken condition for a dialog with iran , and its over-eager actions toward reprimanding israel , have led to a great deal of resentment in europe and the us - and at the same time , done serious damage to its relations with the jewish state .
two sides of a coin purely in terms of numbers , turkey has what it takes to back up its ambitions of strength .
the country has seen nearly 12 percent economic growth in the first quarter of the year , along with being the 16th-strongest economy in the world , and the 7th in europe .
but that is just one side of the coin .
on the other side is the growing polarization between the religious and the secular in a turkey whose population has yet to taste many of the fruits of economic growth .
the continuous lack of democratic process , the weak grasp of the concept of press freedom in a gray zone , or the unwillingness of prime minsiter erdogan to deal with criticism of either himself or his policies , are all alarming threats to domestic stability .
turkey belongs in europe !
europe and turkey need one another like never before .
turkey needs europe in order to build itself up as a regional power and to give it more weight in its influence on its neighbors .
for its part , without turkey , europe reduces its chances of succeeding in its global goals and strategies .
europe 's unified rejection of turkey needs to give way .
instead of explaining why turkey should n't accede to the eu , the heads of the european states should be racking their brains about how to make accession happen - or at least how to begin the process , since full membership is unlikely in the near future .
meanwhile , turkey is right to intensively build up its status as a regional power , instead of trying at all cost to become a member of a weaker , crisis-plagued eu .

you 're lucky to have merkel but this team is the best gift for the new germany .
you deserve to be the leaders of europe . - constantin , greece i was and still am quite confident that germany will rise up as the new 2010 world cup champions with their new football philosophy which will dominate the future of football tactics in the whole world . - anas , sudan i have loved german football since 1972 as a schoolboy but have not until now been so thrilled by their style and panache .
they can really win the world cup . - zaid , trinidad and tobago their game against an experienced england side last week was a harder game , however , both were equally satisfying , but mueller 's yellow card was wrongly given and is of great concern to me .
i guess we have to do it the hard way … good luck germany ! - simon , trinidad and tobago what a wonderful display of soccer by the young lads from germany .
the world cup is the only time i enjoy following the game , and i am always reminded of how far behind the usa lags in talent .
good luck versus spain . - richard , us apart from the upset win by serbia in the group stage matches germany have been unstoppable , and since my revised tip is now gone , my new tip is germany .
jogi loew did the correct thing by checking the ghana versus australia match after germany was beaten by serbia in the group stage .
you learn from your mistakes and germany certainly did .
i am certain that germany will dedicate the world cup , if won , to the memory of robert enke .

go germany , go ! - d.d. , india there was never any doubt in my mind that our team was going to win against argentina .
i live in a small town in the niagara falls area , and during and after the game my neighbors displayed the german colors , after the italian , portuguese , south american flags and , yes , the us flags disappeared .
the parties on this canada day and fourth of july weekend now have a german accent .
outstanding performance germany , but mueller did not deserve the yellow card !
good luck germany , we are rooting for you ! - gerhard , canada every brazilian was cheering for germany .
your victory was awesome .

congratulations . - edgardo , argentina to the magnificent german team , congratulations !
i heard it said , spain plays elegantly , but the germans are going to win !

we would like to see you win the cup !
with best wishes from india . - jayanta , india i just want to thank you germans for taking argentina out of the world cup . - claudio , brazil a fitting article by you on a game that was completely controlled by germany .

and both will have to battle history in what could be a war of nerves . coming off their upset of brazil , and boasting a squad that features players from europe 's top clubs , holland are definitely the favorites .
but the dutch know all too well that in football , favorites do n't always win .
" we 're not strutting around all day doing the polonaise , " netherlands coach bert van marwijk said after his team 's stunning 2-1 defeat of the mighty selecao .
" we have n't yet reached our goal . "
holland are arguably soccer 's greatest underachievers .
the national team have never won a world cup and , despite consistently fielding some of the sport 's most innovative and entertaining teams , the last time they qualified for a final was way back in 1978 .
this time around they 're trying something different .
instead of total football , van marwijk - whose resume includes a stint at bundesliga side dortmund - has emphasized a control and efficiency reminiscent of past german teams .
bildunterschrift : the oranjes have been riding high without individual brilliance that has n't always sat well with free-wheeling stars like arjen robben , wesley sneijder and robin van persie , but it 's yielded results .
assistant coach frank de boer says the players have learned that winning ugly is better than losing beautifully .
" our goal was to gain stability , " de boer has told reporters .
" the team is mature and has internalized a system .
we 're now capable of getting off to poor starts and still winning matches . "
the oranje , however , will be missing two major sources of that stability , right-back gregory van der wiel and defensive midfielder nigel de jong , when they take to the pitch in cape town on tuesday .
both are suspended after picking up two yellow cards .
fortunately for the dutch , their opponents have far graver personnel issues .
bildunterschrift : suarez made a fine but costly save against ghana survival artists after his team 's heart-stopping victory over ghana on friday , uruguay coach oscar tabarez had spent much of his time defending striker luis suarez , whose last-second handball clearance would have done most goalkeepers proud - and earned the player a red card and a one-match ban .
now , tabarez will have to think about how to replace him - an unenviable task since none of his reserve strikers possess the pace or the touch of suarez .
much of the burden will fall on diego forlan .
uruguay 's one true superstar has had a stand-out tournament and has been one of the few players to be effective from distance .
but he 'll have to work harder than ever to create space for his shots .
bildunterschrift : forlan has been on the mark and the situation is even more troubling at the back .
left back jorge fucile is also suspended , while central defender and captain diego lugano is doubtful with a bruised knee - two potentially crushing blows for a defensively oriented team .
the main factor speaking for la celeste in this match is pride .
a two-time world cup winner -lrb- 1930 and 1950 -rrb- , uruguay has n't done this well since 1970 , and a trip to another final would be a massive achievement for a country of only 3.3 million inhabitants .
for that reason , holland are preaching caution .
" our next match is a very dangerous one , " van marwijk has said .
" uruguay 's players are tremendous fighters and survival artists . "
history in the making bildunterschrift : fans of both sides hope the party will continue given the personnel constellation , the likely course of this match is obvious .
the netherlands will have to attack while uruguay try to hang on , hoping for a goal against the run of play or a draw that would send the match to penalties .
the uglier the match , the better la celeste 's chances .
so uruguay are bound to try to irritate robben , sneijder and van persie with niggling fouls .
but can former reserves step up to fill the gaps and take some of the focus off forlan ?
uruguay 's captain , in any case , says the team is n't satisfied with just reaching the semis .
" we know that if we want to make history , we have to become champions , " diego lugano told reporters .
" we have two must-win matches to go .
it 's equally difficult and possible . "
the challenge for the oranje will be to keep their cool , stick with their game plan and trust that the superior quality will prevail , should they fail to break the match open with an early goal .
that 's a doable task - but one dutch sides have often been unequal to in the past .
one thing is certain : whichever team wins will reward long-suffering fans with their nation 's greatest world cup triumph in decades .
and that will add a bit of extra-tension to what 's already shaping up to be a nervy contest .

and both will have to battle history in what could be a war of nerves . coming off their upset of brazil , and boasting a squad that features players from europe 's top clubs , holland are definitely the favorites .
but the dutch know all too well that in football , favorites do n't always win .
" we 're not strutting around all day doing the polonaise , " netherlands coach bert van marwijk said after his team 's stunning 2-1 defeat of the mighty selecao .
" we have n't yet reached our goal . "
holland are arguably soccer 's greatest underachievers .
the national team have never won a world cup and , despite consistently fielding some of the sport 's most innovative and entertaining teams , the last time they qualified for a final was way back in 1978 .
this time around they 're trying something different .
instead of total football , van marwijk - whose resume includes a stint at bundesliga side dortmund - has emphasized a control and efficiency reminiscent of past german teams .
bildunterschrift : the oranjes have been riding high without individual brilliance that has n't always sat well with free-wheeling stars like arjen robben , wesley sneijder and robin van persie , but it 's yielded results .
assistant coach frank de boer says the players have learned that winning ugly is better than losing beautifully .
" our goal was to gain stability , " de boer has told reporters .
" the team is mature and has internalized a system .
we 're now capable of getting off to poor starts and still winning matches . "
the oranje , however , will be missing two major sources of that stability , right-back gregory van der wiel and defensive midfielder nigel de jong , when they take to the pitch in cape town on tuesday .
both are suspended after picking up two yellow cards .
fortunately for the dutch , their opponents have far graver personnel issues .
bildunterschrift : suarez made a fine but costly save against ghana survival artists after his team 's heart-stopping victory over ghana on friday , uruguay coach oscar tabarez had spent much of his time defending striker luis suarez , whose last-second handball clearance would have done most goalkeepers proud - and earned the player a red card and a one-match ban .
now , tabarez will have to think about how to replace him - an unenviable task since none of his reserve strikers possess the pace or the touch of suarez .
much of the burden will fall on diego forlan .
uruguay 's one true superstar has had a stand-out tournament and has been one of the few players to be effective from distance .
but he 'll have to work harder than ever to create space for his shots .
bildunterschrift : forlan has been on the mark and the situation is even more troubling at the back .
left back jorge fucile is also suspended , while central defender and captain diego lugano is doubtful with a bruised knee - two potentially crushing blows for a defensively oriented team .
the main factor speaking for la celeste in this match is pride .
a two-time world cup winner -lrb- 1930 and 1950 -rrb- , uruguay has n't done this well since 1970 , and a trip to another final would be a massive achievement for a country of only 3.3 million inhabitants .
for that reason , holland are preaching caution .
" our next match is a very dangerous one , " van marwijk has said .
" uruguay 's players are tremendous fighters and survival artists . "
history in the making bildunterschrift : fans of both sides hope the party will continue given the personnel constellation , the likely course of this match is obvious .
the netherlands will have to attack while uruguay try to hang on , hoping for a goal against the run of play or a draw that would send the match to penalties .
the uglier the match , the better la celeste 's chances .
so uruguay are bound to try to irritate robben , sneijder and van persie with niggling fouls .
but can former reserves step up to fill the gaps and take some of the focus off forlan ?
uruguay 's captain , in any case , says the team is n't satisfied with just reaching the semis .
" we know that if we want to make history , we have to become champions , " diego lugano told reporters .
" we have two must-win matches to go .
it 's equally difficult and possible . "
the challenge for the oranje will be to keep their cool , stick with their game plan and trust that the superior quality will prevail , should they fail to break the match open with an early goal .
that 's a doable task - but one dutch sides have often been unequal to in the past .
one thing is certain : whichever team wins will reward long-suffering fans with their nation 's greatest world cup triumph in decades .
and that will add a bit of extra-tension to what 's already shaping up to be a nervy contest .

bildunterschrift : suarez made a fine but costly save against ghana survival artists after his team 's heart-stopping victory over ghana on friday , uruguay coach oscar tabarez had spent much of his time defending striker luis suarez , whose last-second handball clearance would have done most goalkeepers proud - and earned the player a red card and a one-match ban .
now , tabarez will have to think about how to replace him - an unenviable task since none of his reserve strikers possess the pace or the touch of suarez .
much of the burden will fall on diego forlan .
uruguay 's one true superstar has had a stand-out tournament and has been one of the few players to be effective from distance .
but he 'll have to work harder than ever to create space for his shots .
bildunterschrift : forlan has been on the mark and the situation is even more troubling at the back .
left back jorge fucile is also suspended , while central defender and captain diego lugano is doubtful with a bruised knee - two potentially crushing blows for a defensively oriented team .
the main factor speaking for la celeste in this match is pride .
a two-time world cup winner -lrb- 1930 and 1950 -rrb- , uruguay has n't done this well since 1970 , and a trip to another final would be a massive achievement for a country of only 3.3 million inhabitants .
for that reason , holland are preaching caution .
" our next match is a very dangerous one , " van marwijk has said .
" uruguay 's players are tremendous fighters and survival artists . "
history in the making bildunterschrift : fans of both sides hope the party will continue given the personnel constellation , the likely course of this match is obvious .
the netherlands will have to attack while uruguay try to hang on , hoping for a goal against the run of play or a draw that would send the match to penalties .
the uglier the match , the better la celeste 's chances .
so uruguay are bound to try to irritate robben , sneijder and van persie with niggling fouls .
but can former reserves step up to fill the gaps and take some of the focus off forlan ?
uruguay 's captain , in any case , says the team is n't satisfied with just reaching the semis .
" we know that if we want to make history , we have to become champions , " diego lugano told reporters .
" we have two must-win matches to go .
it 's equally difficult and possible . "
the challenge for the oranje will be to keep their cool , stick with their game plan and trust that the superior quality will prevail , should they fail to break the match open with an early goal .
that 's a doable task - but one dutch sides have often been unequal to in the past .
one thing is certain : whichever team wins will reward long-suffering fans with their nation 's greatest world cup triumph in decades .
and that will add a bit of extra-tension to what 's already shaping up to be a nervy contest .

and both will have to battle history in what could be a war of nerves . coming off their upset of brazil , and boasting a squad that features players from europe 's top clubs , holland are definitely the favorites .
but the dutch know all too well that in football , favorites do n't always win .
" we 're not strutting around all day doing the polonaise , " netherlands coach bert van marwijk said after his team 's stunning 2-1 defeat of the mighty selecao .
" we have n't yet reached our goal . "
holland are arguably soccer 's greatest underachievers .
the national team have never won a world cup and , despite consistently fielding some of the sport 's most innovative and entertaining teams , the last time they qualified for a final was way back in 1978 .
this time around they 're trying something different .
instead of total football , van marwijk - whose resume includes a stint at bundesliga side dortmund - has emphasized a control and efficiency reminiscent of past german teams .
bildunterschrift : the oranjes have been riding high without individual brilliance that has n't always sat well with free-wheeling stars like arjen robben , wesley sneijder and robin van persie , but it 's yielded results .
assistant coach frank de boer says the players have learned that winning ugly is better than losing beautifully .
" our goal was to gain stability , " de boer has told reporters .
" the team is mature and has internalized a system .
we 're now capable of getting off to poor starts and still winning matches . "
the oranje , however , will be missing two major sources of that stability , right-back gregory van der wiel and defensive midfielder nigel de jong , when they take to the pitch in cape town on tuesday .
both are suspended after picking up two yellow cards .
fortunately for the dutch , their opponents have far graver personnel issues .
bildunterschrift : suarez made a fine but costly save against ghana survival artists after his team 's heart-stopping victory over ghana on friday , uruguay coach oscar tabarez had spent much of his time defending striker luis suarez , whose last-second handball clearance would have done most goalkeepers proud - and earned the player a red card and a one-match ban .
now , tabarez will have to think about how to replace him - an unenviable task since none of his reserve strikers possess the pace or the touch of suarez .
much of the burden will fall on diego forlan .
uruguay 's one true superstar has had a stand-out tournament and has been one of the few players to be effective from distance .
but he 'll have to work harder than ever to create space for his shots .
bildunterschrift : forlan has been on the mark and the situation is even more troubling at the back .
left back jorge fucile is also suspended , while central defender and captain diego lugano is doubtful with a bruised knee - two potentially crushing blows for a defensively oriented team .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 05.07.2010 daimler plans electric motor scooter großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carmakers see market for city electric motor scooters daimler plans an electric scooter as the carmaker moves to build different types of electric vehicles for different market segments .
it 's not the first motorcycle , by the way , to come from the stuttgart-based car icon . the news came from the top .
in a television program over the weekend , daimler chief executive officer dieter zetsche said the german carmaker " will soon present an e-scooter . "
while many daimler car fans may wonder why the company would want to add e-scooters to its premium car and truck-dominated product portfolio , car analysts are n't surprised by the move .
" it 's all about the e-mobility push by the car industry , " christoph stuermer , an auto analyst with ihs global insight in frankfurt , told deutsche welle .
" a key element of this strategy is to build specific vehicles , like e-scooters , for specific market segments , such as short-distance travel in urban areas .
daimler aims to fill all these segments with products . "
bildunterschrift : lithium-ion batteries are powering a new wave of e-scooters global effort daimler spokeswoman eva wiese batted down speculation that daimler may hand over development of the new e-scooter to its new chinese electric vehicle partner , byd , which is specialized in car battery and drive technology .
" we will develop the e-scooter ourselves , using components , of course , from our global network of suppliers , " wiese told deutsche welle .
" it will be a global product , as all our products are . "
while motorcycle manufacturing , arguably , has not been a core competency of daimler , company co-founder gottlieb daimler is credited with having invented the first gasoline engine-powered motorcycle in 1885 .
essentially , it was a four-stroke internal combustion engine mounted on a wooden bicycle .
bmw and peugeot with head start much has happened in the way of motorcycle development since then , most recently in the area of electrically powered systems .
and perhaps to the dismay of daimler , some of its major competitors in europe , including bmw and peugeot , have a head start .
in the early 2000s , bmw launched the c1 , an enclosed scooter with many innovative features to protect the rider in an accident .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler now offers an electric version of its smart urban car last year , bmw , which manufacturers both cars and motorcycles , also unveiled an electric version of the scooter for the european safer urban motorcycling project .
the electric motor is powered by a lithium-ion battery with sufficient power for most inner-city driving conditions .
french carmaker peugeot , which mass-produced its first e-scooter 15 years ago , has launched yet another , the e-vivacity .
it is also equipped with lithium-ion battery capable of covering up to 100 kilometers on the road .
" it 's a logical move for daimler to build an e-scooter , " stuermer said .
" the company is engineering an electrical version of its smart urban car and hybrid models of its sedans for longer distances .
and now it plans a light vehicle for short city trips .
it 's filling all the gaps . "

dw ’ s bartosz dudek sees komorowski ’ s win as a victory for europe . president-elect bronislaw komorowski and his liberal conservative party civic platform stand for a europe-friendly and future-oriented poland .
they also value dialogue and compromise in their political dealings .
but defeated presidential candidate jaroslaw kaczynski also achieved considerable success in this election .
his 47 percent of the vote is a political base upon which his conservative law and justice party can build upon in the next parliamentary elections in 2011 .
komorowski 's kingmakers were poland 's left-of-center voters .
though rival jaroslaw kaczynski made a leftist , populist turn at the end of his campaign , it simply was not enough to win over left-of-center voters .
even kaczynski 's praise of communist-era social policies could not sway them .
two-thirds of the left-of-center voters marked komorowski 's name on their ballots , making him the country 's next president .
the close result of the election also demonstrates to what extent poland is politically divided .
while komorowski 's campaign spoke to younger , educated , urban voters , kaczynski tended to attract older , less educated and more rural voters .
there can also be no talk of true defeat in this election because , as leader of the largest opposition party , the power-hungry kaczynski will long remain a serious rival to liberal-conservative prime minister donald tusk and president-elect bronislaw komorowski .
therefore , kaczynski 's success at the polls must be heeded as a warning .
the path for kaczynski 's return to power would already be paved , should warsaw 's current coalition government wind up presiding over corruption , rising joblessness , or harsh social policies .
if kaczynski were to return as poland 's prime minister , he could throw poland back into the domestic and foreign confrontations that once dominated the country 's politics .
so komorowski 's election is not only good news not only poland but also for german-polish relations and for europe as a whole .
a cheerful , aimiable polish president with foreign affairs experience and good relations with other european leaders will make poland a stable pillar of european politics . this bodes well for the polish eu presidency in 2011 and the beleaguered european union .

dw ’ s bartosz dudek sees komorowski ’ s win as a victory for europe . president-elect bronislaw komorowski and his liberal conservative party civic platform stand for a europe-friendly and future-oriented poland .
they also value dialogue and compromise in their political dealings .
but defeated presidential candidate jaroslaw kaczynski also achieved considerable success in this election .
his 47 percent of the vote is a political base upon which his conservative law and justice party can build upon in the next parliamentary elections in 2011 .
komorowski 's kingmakers were poland 's left-of-center voters .
though rival jaroslaw kaczynski made a leftist , populist turn at the end of his campaign , it simply was not enough to win over left-of-center voters .
even kaczynski 's praise of communist-era social policies could not sway them .
two-thirds of the left-of-center voters marked komorowski 's name on their ballots , making him the country 's next president .
the close result of the election also demonstrates to what extent poland is politically divided .
while komorowski 's campaign spoke to younger , educated , urban voters , kaczynski tended to attract older , less educated and more rural voters .
there can also be no talk of true defeat in this election because , as leader of the largest opposition party , the power-hungry kaczynski will long remain a serious rival to liberal-conservative prime minister donald tusk and president-elect bronislaw komorowski .
therefore , kaczynski 's success at the polls must be heeded as a warning .
the path for kaczynski 's return to power would already be paved , should warsaw 's current coalition government wind up presiding over corruption , rising joblessness , or harsh social policies .
if kaczynski were to return as poland 's prime minister , he could throw poland back into the domestic and foreign confrontations that once dominated the country 's politics .
so komorowski 's election is not only good news not only poland but also for german-polish relations and for europe as a whole .
a cheerful , aimiable polish president with foreign affairs experience and good relations with other european leaders will make poland a stable pillar of european politics . this bodes well for the polish eu presidency in 2011 and the beleaguered european union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 05.07.2010 dalai lama turns 75 : question over his succession remains großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 14th dalai lama , tenzin gyatso the tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama turns 75 on tuesday .
as the nobel laureate gets older , concerns are mounting over his succession . the present dalai lama tenzin gyatso fled tibet in 1959 following a failed uprising against chinese rule .
he has since been living in the northern indian town of dharamsala .
many tibetans revere him as a living god and therefore the issue of his succession is sensitive as well as complicated . " traditionally the dalai lama has been both a monk and also the head of the state in tibet , " explains paul williams , an expert at the university of bristol .
" in addition , the dalai lama is someone who is considered by the tibetans to be spiritually so advanced that when he dies it is possible for him to control his reincarnation .
of course , tibetans and other buddhists believe in reincarnation .
so when we talk about the successor to the dalai lama , do we mean the person who will be considered to be the reincarnation of the current dalai lama or do we mean by the successor to the dalai lama who will be considered to be politically the head of the tibetan government in exile ? "
bildunterschrift : dharamsala , the seat of the tibetan government in exile political responsibilities the current dalai lama has however in recent years clearly separated his political responsibility from his spiritual work .
" as far as his political responsibilities are concerned , his holiness says he is in semi-retirement , " says thubten samphel , the spokesperson of the tibetan government in exile .
" he has passed on much of his political responsibilities to the elected leadership . the spiritual responsibilities of his holiness the dalai lama will be a carried on by his successor . " yet it remains unclear how the tibetans in exile will actually choose his successor .
thubten samphel says the elected political leadership will oversee the succession process .
the spiritual leader himself has indicated in the past that his successor could be appointed before his death or even democratically elected .
thubten samphel explains the provision is there , but the final decision is in the hands of the dalai lama only : " there is a legacy in tibetan history to recognize and incarnate the dalai lama before his predecessor passes away .
this tradition is there .
but at this moment i can not say whether this will be carried forward by his holiness .
it is for his holiness to decide . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese-appointed panchen lama in lhasa chinese interference the succession issue has become pricklier ever since the dalai lama anointed a six year old child as the reincarnation of the panchen lama , the second-most powerful figure in tibetan buddhism in 1995 .
the child soon disappeared and beijing chose its own panchen lama .
observers say that the communist and largely atheist chinese leadership is likely to actively interfere and manipulate things again after the dalai lama dies and will install its own leader . " the chinese could say we have discovered the correct , the real reincarnation . he is here in tibet with us and we are going to train him , bring him up and when he is older we will announce to everyone that this is the dalai lama and he should be the head of tibet of course under chinese control , " says paul williams . the heat can already be felt as a senior chinese leader last week said that all the reincarnations of tibetan spiritual leaders must be approved by the central government in beijing . author : disha uppal editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

two turkish newspapers had quoted davutoglu as saying ties with israel would be severed unless turkey received an apology for the flotilla raid or israel accepted the outcome of an independent inquiry into the incident .
in response to davutoglu 's alleged remarks , israeli foreign minister avigdor lieberman said during a trip to latvia that israel did n't " have any intention to apologize . "
later on monday , however , a spokesman for the turkish government told the reuters news agency that davutoglu had been misquoted in the newspaper reports .
the official claimed that davutoglu actually said that relations with israel would not improve if an apology was not issued .
the two countries have been on bad terms since the may 31 raid on a gaza-bound aid flotilla .
nine turkish nationals died after israeli military personnel boarded one of the ships . each side subsequently blamed the other for starting the violent confrontation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 05.07.2010 religious casting show is a hit in malaysia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ten contestants participate in the reality tv show " imam muda " tv casting shows modeled on the british " pop idol " or " american idol " have become extremely popular all over asia .
a malaysian show is now extending this format to select the best young talent to become an imam . " imam muda " or " young imam " is the name of a reality tv competition in malaysia , where 10 young men try to convince the audience that they deserve a scholarship to be trained as an imam by the al-madinah university in saudi arabia .
the audience votes out one candidate in each show .
wearing dark suits and black caps , which are common among malaysian muslims , the candidates have to fulfil several tasks .
during the very first show , the would-be imams got a tough assignment : they were asked to wash corpses in front of live cameras , and bury the bodies of the deceased according to muslim tradition .
one of the deceased even was an hiv-infected person , whose body , according to newspaper reports had been lying in a mosque for weeks because nobody was willing to touch the corpse .
huge interest " i think it 's great that i can participate here " , says 26-year-old asyraf mohd ridzuan , one of the candidates . " presenting religion on tv just like american idol is something unheard of .
i am really enthusiastic about it . "
more than 1,000 malaysians from all parts of the country originally applied to go on the show .
those selected are between 19 and 27 years old , and none of them had any previous religious training .
one was a farmer , another worked in a bank .
that 's exactly what has made the program such a success , argues producer izelan basar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taufek noh is one of the contestants in " imam muda " " we want to show that islam is a modern religion .
and we seem to have touched on a sensitive issue .
many people call us and want our candidates to become their sons-in-law or husbands .
why is that ?
because at last someone is able to reconcile religion with everyday life . "
winner gets laptop and trip to mecca the winner will get the job of leading prayers at kuala lumpur 's biggest mosque .
he will be paid a trip to mecca to participate in the hajj pilgrimage and receive a laptop as well .
but there 's still a long way to go .
the candidates must live under one roof for three months , almost as in the big brother reality show , and they have to study hard to master the challenges .
hassan mahmoud al-hafiz , who heads the channel 's jury , describes what is needed to win : " a good imam should make people understand religion .
and at the same time , he should understand the people .
our candidates , who all are ordinary people , are well suited to do that . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hassan mahmoud al-hafiz heads the channel 's jury tv audiences love the show , which is only broadcast by astro oasis , a religious pay tv channel . a woman from kuala lumpur says young people do n't go to the mosque much but the show is changing all that : " if an imam is young , is their age , it will attract them .
you know , i think it 's beautiful ! "
imam muda 's facebook page has already more than 30,000 fans .

two turkish newspapers had quoted davutoglu as saying ties with israel would be severed unless turkey received an apology for the flotilla raid or israel accepted the outcome of an independent inquiry into the incident .
in response to davutoglu 's alleged remarks , israeli foreign minister avigdor lieberman said during a trip to latvia that israel did n't " have any intention to apologize . "
later on monday , however , a spokesman for the turkish government told the reuters news agency that davutoglu had been misquoted in the newspaper reports .
the official claimed that davutoglu actually said that relations with israel would not improve if an apology was not issued .
the two countries have been on bad terms since the may 31 raid on a gaza-bound aid flotilla .
nine turkish nationals died after israeli military personnel boarded one of the ships . each side subsequently blamed the other for starting the violent confrontation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 05.07.2010 opinion : poland voted for europe by electing komorowski großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with a lean majority at 53 percent of the vote , liberal conservative leader bronislaw komorowski is set to become poland ’ s next president .
dw ’ s bartosz dudek sees komorowski ’ s win as a victory for europe . president-elect bronislaw komorowski and his liberal conservative party civic platform stand for a europe-friendly and future-oriented poland .
they also value dialogue and compromise in their political dealings .
but defeated presidential candidate jaroslaw kaczynski also achieved considerable success in this election .
his 47 percent of the vote is a political base upon which his conservative law and justice party can build upon in the next parliamentary elections in 2011 .
komorowski 's kingmakers were poland 's left-of-center voters .
though rival jaroslaw kaczynski made a leftist , populist turn at the end of his campaign , it simply was not enough to win over left-of-center voters .
even kaczynski 's praise of communist-era social policies could not sway them .
two-thirds of the left-of-center voters marked komorowski 's name on their ballots , making him the country 's next president .
the close result of the election also demonstrates to what extent poland is politically divided .
while komorowski 's campaign spoke to younger , educated , urban voters , kaczynski tended to attract older , less educated and more rural voters .
there can also be no talk of true defeat in this election because , as leader of the largest opposition party , the power-hungry kaczynski will long remain a serious rival to liberal-conservative prime minister donald tusk and president-elect bronislaw komorowski .
therefore , kaczynski 's success at the polls must be heeded as a warning .
the path for kaczynski 's return to power would already be paved , should warsaw 's current coalition government wind up presiding over corruption , rising joblessness , or harsh social policies .
if kaczynski were to return as poland 's prime minister , he could throw poland back into the domestic and foreign confrontations that once dominated the country 's politics .

dw ’ s bartosz dudek sees komorowski ’ s win as a victory for europe . president-elect bronislaw komorowski and his liberal conservative party civic platform stand for a europe-friendly and future-oriented poland .
they also value dialogue and compromise in their political dealings .
but defeated presidential candidate jaroslaw kaczynski also achieved considerable success in this election .
his 47 percent of the vote is a political base upon which his conservative law and justice party can build upon in the next parliamentary elections in 2011 .
komorowski 's kingmakers were poland 's left-of-center voters .
though rival jaroslaw kaczynski made a leftist , populist turn at the end of his campaign , it simply was not enough to win over left-of-center voters .
even kaczynski 's praise of communist-era social policies could not sway them .
two-thirds of the left-of-center voters marked komorowski 's name on their ballots , making him the country 's next president .
the close result of the election also demonstrates to what extent poland is politically divided .
while komorowski 's campaign spoke to younger , educated , urban voters , kaczynski tended to attract older , less educated and more rural voters .
there can also be no talk of true defeat in this election because , as leader of the largest opposition party , the power-hungry kaczynski will long remain a serious rival to liberal-conservative prime minister donald tusk and president-elect bronislaw komorowski .
therefore , kaczynski 's success at the polls must be heeded as a warning .
the path for kaczynski 's return to power would already be paved , should warsaw 's current coalition government wind up presiding over corruption , rising joblessness , or harsh social policies .
if kaczynski were to return as poland 's prime minister , he could throw poland back into the domestic and foreign confrontations that once dominated the country 's politics .
so komorowski 's election is not only good news not only poland but also for german-polish relations and for europe as a whole .

you 're lucky to have merkel but this team is the best gift for the new germany .

they can really win the world cup . - zaid , trinidad and tobago their game against an experienced england side last week was a harder game , however , both were equally satisfying , but mueller 's yellow card was wrongly given and is of great concern to me .
i guess we have to do it the hard way … good luck germany ! - simon , trinidad and tobago what a wonderful display of soccer by the young lads from germany .
the world cup is the only time i enjoy following the game , and i am always reminded of how far behind the usa lags in talent .
good luck versus spain . - richard , us apart from the upset win by serbia in the group stage matches germany have been unstoppable , and since my revised tip is now gone , my new tip is germany .
jogi loew did the correct thing by checking the ghana versus australia match after germany was beaten by serbia in the group stage .
you learn from your mistakes and germany certainly did .
i am certain that germany will dedicate the world cup , if won , to the memory of robert enke .

i wonder also about 2014 , with this side so young , we might also win our fifth in brazil ! - daeld , australia great play again from the german team , but too bad that argentina did n't live up to their potential .
teamwork and discipline as well as youth - all in good balance - go a long way .
go germany , go ! - d.d. , india there was never any doubt in my mind that our team was going to win against argentina .
i live in a small town in the niagara falls area , and during and after the game my neighbors displayed the german colors , after the italian , portuguese , south american flags and , yes , the us flags disappeared .
the parties on this canada day and fourth of july weekend now have a german accent .

dw-world.de press review : harsh criticism for argentina , praise for germany argentina 's press shows no mercy in their assessment of saturday 's 4-0 blowout against germany .
international papers , meanwhile , shower germany with praise for what some describe as the team 's best game yet .
-lrb- 04.07.2010 -rrb- germany dealt post-match praise after dismantling argentina from ordinary fans right up to the country 's leader , germans everywhere have heaped praise on their national football team after it ran riot against diego maradona 's argentina in their world cup quarterfinal clash .
-lrb- 04.07.2010 -rrb- germany swamp argentina as maradona 's stars wilt in the spotlight the game was billed as a match-up of argentina 's offensive superstars versus germany 's scrappy collection of well-organized youngsters .
and so it was , but few had predicted what a mismatch that would be .
-lrb- 03.07.2010 -rrb- germany in semifinals after thrashing argentina 4-0 germany stormed into the world cup semifinals on saturday with a 4-0 drubbing of argentina in cape town .
miroslav klose scored twice , along with goals from thomas mueller and defender arne friedrich .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 05.07.2010 netherlands , uruguay try to recapture past glory in first 2010 semifinal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of these teams will be playing on july 11 injuries and suspensions will force both the oranje and la celeste to improvise as they try to punch their ticket for the final .
and both will have to battle history in what could be a war of nerves . coming off their upset of brazil , and boasting a squad that features players from europe 's top clubs , holland are definitely the favorites .
but the dutch know all too well that in football , favorites do n't always win .
" we 're not strutting around all day doing the polonaise , " netherlands coach bert van marwijk said after his team 's stunning 2-1 defeat of the mighty selecao .
" we have n't yet reached our goal . "
holland are arguably soccer 's greatest underachievers .
the national team have never won a world cup and , despite consistently fielding some of the sport 's most innovative and entertaining teams , the last time they qualified for a final was way back in 1978 .
this time around they 're trying something different .
instead of total football , van marwijk - whose resume includes a stint at bundesliga side dortmund - has emphasized a control and efficiency reminiscent of past german teams .
bildunterschrift : the oranjes have been riding high without individual brilliance that has n't always sat well with free-wheeling stars like arjen robben , wesley sneijder and robin van persie , but it 's yielded results .
assistant coach frank de boer says the players have learned that winning ugly is better than losing beautifully .
" our goal was to gain stability , " de boer has told reporters .
" the team is mature and has internalized a system .
we 're now capable of getting off to poor starts and still winning matches . "
the oranje , however , will be missing two major sources of that stability , right-back gregory van der wiel and defensive midfielder nigel de jong , when they take to the pitch in cape town on tuesday .
both are suspended after picking up two yellow cards .
fortunately for the dutch , their opponents have far graver personnel issues .
bildunterschrift : suarez made a fine but costly save against ghana survival artists after his team 's heart-stopping victory over ghana on friday , uruguay coach oscar tabarez had spent much of his time defending striker luis suarez , whose last-second handball clearance would have done most goalkeepers proud - and earned the player a red card and a one-match ban .
now , tabarez will have to think about how to replace him - an unenviable task since none of his reserve strikers possess the pace or the touch of suarez .
much of the burden will fall on diego forlan .
uruguay 's one true superstar has had a stand-out tournament and has been one of the few players to be effective from distance .
but he 'll have to work harder than ever to create space for his shots .
bildunterschrift : forlan has been on the mark and the situation is even more troubling at the back .
left back jorge fucile is also suspended , while central defender and captain diego lugano is doubtful with a bruised knee - two potentially crushing blows for a defensively oriented team .
the main factor speaking for la celeste in this match is pride .
a two-time world cup winner -lrb- 1930 and 1950 -rrb- , uruguay has n't done this well since 1970 , and a trip to another final would be a massive achievement for a country of only 3.3 million inhabitants .
for that reason , holland are preaching caution .
" our next match is a very dangerous one , " van marwijk has said .
" uruguay 's players are tremendous fighters and survival artists . "
history in the making bildunterschrift : fans of both sides hope the party will continue given the personnel constellation , the likely course of this match is obvious .
the netherlands will have to attack while uruguay try to hang on , hoping for a goal against the run of play or a draw that would send the match to penalties .
the uglier the match , the better la celeste 's chances .
so uruguay are bound to try to irritate robben , sneijder and van persie with niggling fouls .
but can former reserves step up to fill the gaps and take some of the focus off forlan ?
uruguay 's captain , in any case , says the team is n't satisfied with just reaching the semis .
" we know that if we want to make history , we have to become champions , " diego lugano told reporters .
" we have two must-win matches to go .
it 's equally difficult and possible . "
the challenge for the oranje will be to keep their cool , stick with their game plan and trust that the superior quality will prevail , should they fail to break the match open with an early goal .
that 's a doable task - but one dutch sides have often been unequal to in the past .
one thing is certain : whichever team wins will reward long-suffering fans with their nation 's greatest world cup triumph in decades .
and that will add a bit of extra-tension to what 's already shaping up to be a nervy contest .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 05.07.2010 netherlands , uruguay try to recapture past glory in first 2010 semifinal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of these teams will be playing on july 11 injuries and suspensions will force both the oranje and la celeste to improvise as they try to punch their ticket for the final .
and both will have to battle history in what could be a war of nerves . coming off their upset of brazil , and boasting a squad that features players from europe 's top clubs , holland are definitely the favorites .
but the dutch know all too well that in football , favorites do n't always win .
" we 're not strutting around all day doing the polonaise , " netherlands coach bert van marwijk said after his team 's stunning 2-1 defeat of the mighty selecao .
" we have n't yet reached our goal . "
holland are arguably soccer 's greatest underachievers .
the national team have never won a world cup and , despite consistently fielding some of the sport 's most innovative and entertaining teams , the last time they qualified for a final was way back in 1978 .
this time around they 're trying something different .
instead of total football , van marwijk - whose resume includes a stint at bundesliga side dortmund - has emphasized a control and efficiency reminiscent of past german teams .
bildunterschrift : the oranjes have been riding high without individual brilliance that has n't always sat well with free-wheeling stars like arjen robben , wesley sneijder and robin van persie , but it 's yielded results .
assistant coach frank de boer says the players have learned that winning ugly is better than losing beautifully .
" our goal was to gain stability , " de boer has told reporters .
" the team is mature and has internalized a system .
we 're now capable of getting off to poor starts and still winning matches . "
the oranje , however , will be missing two major sources of that stability , right-back gregory van der wiel and defensive midfielder nigel de jong , when they take to the pitch in cape town on tuesday .
both are suspended after picking up two yellow cards .
fortunately for the dutch , their opponents have far graver personnel issues .
bildunterschrift : suarez made a fine but costly save against ghana survival artists after his team 's heart-stopping victory over ghana on friday , uruguay coach oscar tabarez had spent much of his time defending striker luis suarez , whose last-second handball clearance would have done most goalkeepers proud - and earned the player a red card and a one-match ban .
now , tabarez will have to think about how to replace him - an unenviable task since none of his reserve strikers possess the pace or the touch of suarez .
much of the burden will fall on diego forlan .
uruguay 's one true superstar has had a stand-out tournament and has been one of the few players to be effective from distance .
but he 'll have to work harder than ever to create space for his shots .
bildunterschrift : forlan has been on the mark and the situation is even more troubling at the back .
left back jorge fucile is also suspended , while central defender and captain diego lugano is doubtful with a bruised knee - two potentially crushing blows for a defensively oriented team .
the main factor speaking for la celeste in this match is pride .
a two-time world cup winner -lrb- 1930 and 1950 -rrb- , uruguay has n't done this well since 1970 , and a trip to another final would be a massive achievement for a country of only 3.3 million inhabitants .
for that reason , holland are preaching caution .
" our next match is a very dangerous one , " van marwijk has said .
" uruguay 's players are tremendous fighters and survival artists . "
history in the making bildunterschrift : fans of both sides hope the party will continue given the personnel constellation , the likely course of this match is obvious .
the netherlands will have to attack while uruguay try to hang on , hoping for a goal against the run of play or a draw that would send the match to penalties .
the uglier the match , the better la celeste 's chances .
so uruguay are bound to try to irritate robben , sneijder and van persie with niggling fouls .
but can former reserves step up to fill the gaps and take some of the focus off forlan ?
uruguay 's captain , in any case , says the team is n't satisfied with just reaching the semis .
" we know that if we want to make history , we have to become champions , " diego lugano told reporters .
" we have two must-win matches to go .
it 's equally difficult and possible . "
the challenge for the oranje will be to keep their cool , stick with their game plan and trust that the superior quality will prevail , should they fail to break the match open with an early goal .
that 's a doable task - but one dutch sides have often been unequal to in the past .
one thing is certain : whichever team wins will reward long-suffering fans with their nation 's greatest world cup triumph in decades .
and that will add a bit of extra-tension to what 's already shaping up to be a nervy contest .

dw ’ s bartosz dudek sees komorowski ’ s win as a victory for europe . president-elect bronislaw komorowski and his liberal conservative party civic platform stand for a europe-friendly and future-oriented poland .
they also value dialogue and compromise in their political dealings .
but defeated presidential candidate jaroslaw kaczynski also achieved considerable success in this election .
his 47 percent of the vote is a political base upon which his conservative law and justice party can build upon in the next parliamentary elections in 2011 .
komorowski 's kingmakers were poland 's left-of-center voters .
though rival jaroslaw kaczynski made a leftist , populist turn at the end of his campaign , it simply was not enough to win over left-of-center voters .
even kaczynski 's praise of communist-era social policies could not sway them .
two-thirds of the left-of-center voters marked komorowski 's name on their ballots , making him the country 's next president .
the close result of the election also demonstrates to what extent poland is politically divided .
while komorowski 's campaign spoke to younger , educated , urban voters , kaczynski tended to attract older , less educated and more rural voters .
there can also be no talk of true defeat in this election because , as leader of the largest opposition party , the power-hungry kaczynski will long remain a serious rival to liberal-conservative prime minister donald tusk and president-elect bronislaw komorowski .
therefore , kaczynski 's success at the polls must be heeded as a warning .
the path for kaczynski 's return to power would already be paved , should warsaw 's current coalition government wind up presiding over corruption , rising joblessness , or harsh social policies .
if kaczynski were to return as poland 's prime minister , he could throw poland back into the domestic and foreign confrontations that once dominated the country 's politics .
so komorowski 's election is not only good news not only poland but also for german-polish relations and for europe as a whole .
a cheerful , aimiable polish president with foreign affairs experience and good relations with other european leaders will make poland a stable pillar of european politics . this bodes well for the polish eu presidency in 2011 and the beleaguered european union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 05.07.2010 daimler plans electric motor scooter großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carmakers see market for city electric motor scooters daimler plans an electric scooter as the carmaker moves to build different types of electric vehicles for different market segments .
it 's not the first motorcycle , by the way , to come from the stuttgart-based car icon . the news came from the top .
in a television program over the weekend , daimler chief executive officer dieter zetsche said the german carmaker " will soon present an e-scooter . "
while many daimler car fans may wonder why the company would want to add e-scooters to its premium car and truck-dominated product portfolio , car analysts are n't surprised by the move .
" it 's all about the e-mobility push by the car industry , " christoph stuermer , an auto analyst with ihs global insight in frankfurt , told deutsche welle .
" a key element of this strategy is to build specific vehicles , like e-scooters , for specific market segments , such as short-distance travel in urban areas .
daimler aims to fill all these segments with products . "
bildunterschrift : lithium-ion batteries are powering a new wave of e-scooters global effort daimler spokeswoman eva wiese batted down speculation that daimler may hand over development of the new e-scooter to its new chinese electric vehicle partner , byd , which is specialized in car battery and drive technology .
" we will develop the e-scooter ourselves , using components , of course , from our global network of suppliers , " wiese told deutsche welle .
" it will be a global product , as all our products are . "
while motorcycle manufacturing , arguably , has not been a core competency of daimler , company co-founder gottlieb daimler is credited with having invented the first gasoline engine-powered motorcycle in 1885 .
essentially , it was a four-stroke internal combustion engine mounted on a wooden bicycle .
bmw and peugeot with head start much has happened in the way of motorcycle development since then , most recently in the area of electrically powered systems .
and perhaps to the dismay of daimler , some of its major competitors in europe , including bmw and peugeot , have a head start .
in the early 2000s , bmw launched the c1 , an enclosed scooter with many innovative features to protect the rider in an accident .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler now offers an electric version of its smart urban car last year , bmw , which manufacturers both cars and motorcycles , also unveiled an electric version of the scooter for the european safer urban motorcycling project .
the electric motor is powered by a lithium-ion battery with sufficient power for most inner-city driving conditions .
french carmaker peugeot , which mass-produced its first e-scooter 15 years ago , has launched yet another , the e-vivacity .
it is also equipped with lithium-ion battery capable of covering up to 100 kilometers on the road .
" it 's a logical move for daimler to build an e-scooter , " stuermer said .
" the company is engineering an electrical version of its smart urban car and hybrid models of its sedans for longer distances .
and now it plans a light vehicle for short city trips .
it 's filling all the gaps . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eu expansion -pipe- 05.07.2010 opinion : cooling ties or not , turkey and the eu need each other großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recently , much has been made of the notion that eu accession is losing importance for turkey .
but this does n't mean ankara is turning its back on europe , says bahaeddin guengoer of deutsche welle 's turkish service . turkey can explain itself however it likes .
but its latest diplomatic actions - its " no " to iran sanctions in the un security council ; its goal of carrying out a zero-problem policy with all its neighbors - are being met in the west with anxious questions .
is turkey turning away from the west ?
does it see its future in the islamic camp ?
the answer to such questions is a definite " no . "
turkey is not turning its back on the west !
yes , the goal of eu accession is losing priority in ankara 's current policy .
turkey is acting with a new level of self-confidence in the international diplomatic arena , and no one should resent the country for trying to build up its status as a regional power - or for trying to look beyond the narrow confines of europe .
turkey seeks new responsibility tacticians from washington , brazil and brussels to tehran , the middle east and moscow have been trying to instrumentalize nato-member turkey to serve their own diplomatic goals for nearly 60 years .
now , turkey wants to take on more responsibility : in conflict regions like the middle east and the caucasus , as an arbitrator in atomic negotiations with iran , and not least as a reliable energy route for the west .
questioning whether turkey belongs in the european or the oriental camp is easy to understand - but its not justifiable .
since its founding nearly nine decades ago , the modern turkish republic has decided in favor of europe , and therefore , in favor of the west .
despite this , ankara ca n't look forward to being greeted with open arms in its efforts to join the european union - nor does the islamic world celebrate turkey 's western orientation .
its dialog with hamas as an unspoken condition for a dialog with iran , and its over-eager actions toward reprimanding israel , have led to a great deal of resentment in europe and the us - and at the same time , done serious damage to its relations with the jewish state .
two sides of a coin purely in terms of numbers , turkey has what it takes to back up its ambitions of strength .
the country has seen nearly 12 percent economic growth in the first quarter of the year , along with being the 16th-strongest economy in the world , and the 7th in europe .
but that is just one side of the coin .
on the other side is the growing polarization between the religious and the secular in a turkey whose population has yet to taste many of the fruits of economic growth .
the continuous lack of democratic process , the weak grasp of the concept of press freedom in a gray zone , or the unwillingness of prime minsiter erdogan to deal with criticism of either himself or his policies , are all alarming threats to domestic stability .
turkey belongs in europe !
europe and turkey need one another like never before .
turkey needs europe in order to build itself up as a regional power and to give it more weight in its influence on its neighbors .
for its part , without turkey , europe reduces its chances of succeeding in its global goals and strategies .
europe 's unified rejection of turkey needs to give way .
instead of explaining why turkey should n't accede to the eu , the heads of the european states should be racking their brains about how to make accession happen - or at least how to begin the process , since full membership is unlikely in the near future .
meanwhile , turkey is right to intensively build up its status as a regional power , instead of trying at all cost to become a member of a weaker , crisis-plagued eu .

two turkish newspapers had quoted davutoglu as saying ties with israel would be severed unless turkey received an apology for the flotilla raid or israel accepted the outcome of an independent inquiry into the incident .
in response to davutoglu 's alleged remarks , israeli foreign minister avigdor lieberman said during a trip to latvia that israel did n't " have any intention to apologize . "
later on monday , however , a spokesman for the turkish government told the reuters news agency that davutoglu had been misquoted in the newspaper reports .
the official claimed that davutoglu actually said that relations with israel would not improve if an apology was not issued .
the two countries have been on bad terms since the may 31 raid on a gaza-bound aid flotilla .
nine turkish nationals died after israeli military personnel boarded one of the ships . each side subsequently blamed the other for starting the violent confrontation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 05.07.2010 daimler plans electric motor scooter großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carmakers see market for city electric motor scooters daimler plans an electric scooter as the carmaker moves to build different types of electric vehicles for different market segments .
it 's not the first motorcycle , by the way , to come from the stuttgart-based car icon . the news came from the top .
in a television program over the weekend , daimler chief executive officer dieter zetsche said the german carmaker " will soon present an e-scooter . "
while many daimler car fans may wonder why the company would want to add e-scooters to its premium car and truck-dominated product portfolio , car analysts are n't surprised by the move .
" it 's all about the e-mobility push by the car industry , " christoph stuermer , an auto analyst with ihs global insight in frankfurt , told deutsche welle .
" a key element of this strategy is to build specific vehicles , like e-scooters , for specific market segments , such as short-distance travel in urban areas .
daimler aims to fill all these segments with products . "
bildunterschrift : lithium-ion batteries are powering a new wave of e-scooters global effort daimler spokeswoman eva wiese batted down speculation that daimler may hand over development of the new e-scooter to its new chinese electric vehicle partner , byd , which is specialized in car battery and drive technology .
" we will develop the e-scooter ourselves , using components , of course , from our global network of suppliers , " wiese told deutsche welle .
" it will be a global product , as all our products are . "
while motorcycle manufacturing , arguably , has not been a core competency of daimler , company co-founder gottlieb daimler is credited with having invented the first gasoline engine-powered motorcycle in 1885 .
essentially , it was a four-stroke internal combustion engine mounted on a wooden bicycle .
bmw and peugeot with head start much has happened in the way of motorcycle development since then , most recently in the area of electrically powered systems .
and perhaps to the dismay of daimler , some of its major competitors in europe , including bmw and peugeot , have a head start .
in the early 2000s , bmw launched the c1 , an enclosed scooter with many innovative features to protect the rider in an accident .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler now offers an electric version of its smart urban car last year , bmw , which manufacturers both cars and motorcycles , also unveiled an electric version of the scooter for the european safer urban motorcycling project .
the electric motor is powered by a lithium-ion battery with sufficient power for most inner-city driving conditions .
french carmaker peugeot , which mass-produced its first e-scooter 15 years ago , has launched yet another , the e-vivacity .
it is also equipped with lithium-ion battery capable of covering up to 100 kilometers on the road .
" it 's a logical move for daimler to build an e-scooter , " stuermer said .
" the company is engineering an electrical version of its smart urban car and hybrid models of its sedans for longer distances .
and now it plans a light vehicle for short city trips .
it 's filling all the gaps . "

but this does n't mean ankara is turning its back on europe , says bahaeddin guengoer of deutsche welle 's turkish service . turkey can explain itself however it likes .
but its latest diplomatic actions - its " no " to iran sanctions in the un security council ; its goal of carrying out a zero-problem policy with all its neighbors - are being met in the west with anxious questions .
is turkey turning away from the west ?
does it see its future in the islamic camp ?
the answer to such questions is a definite " no . "
turkey is not turning its back on the west !
yes , the goal of eu accession is losing priority in ankara 's current policy .
turkey is acting with a new level of self-confidence in the international diplomatic arena , and no one should resent the country for trying to build up its status as a regional power - or for trying to look beyond the narrow confines of europe .
turkey seeks new responsibility tacticians from washington , brazil and brussels to tehran , the middle east and moscow have been trying to instrumentalize nato-member turkey to serve their own diplomatic goals for nearly 60 years .
now , turkey wants to take on more responsibility : in conflict regions like the middle east and the caucasus , as an arbitrator in atomic negotiations with iran , and not least as a reliable energy route for the west .
questioning whether turkey belongs in the european or the oriental camp is easy to understand - but its not justifiable .
since its founding nearly nine decades ago , the modern turkish republic has decided in favor of europe , and therefore , in favor of the west .
despite this , ankara ca n't look forward to being greeted with open arms in its efforts to join the european union - nor does the islamic world celebrate turkey 's western orientation .
its dialog with hamas as an unspoken condition for a dialog with iran , and its over-eager actions toward reprimanding israel , have led to a great deal of resentment in europe and the us - and at the same time , done serious damage to its relations with the jewish state .
two sides of a coin purely in terms of numbers , turkey has what it takes to back up its ambitions of strength .
the country has seen nearly 12 percent economic growth in the first quarter of the year , along with being the 16th-strongest economy in the world , and the 7th in europe .
but that is just one side of the coin .
on the other side is the growing polarization between the religious and the secular in a turkey whose population has yet to taste many of the fruits of economic growth .
the continuous lack of democratic process , the weak grasp of the concept of press freedom in a gray zone , or the unwillingness of prime minsiter erdogan to deal with criticism of either himself or his policies , are all alarming threats to domestic stability .
turkey belongs in europe !
europe and turkey need one another like never before .
turkey needs europe in order to build itself up as a regional power and to give it more weight in its influence on its neighbors .
for its part , without turkey , europe reduces its chances of succeeding in its global goals and strategies .
europe 's unified rejection of turkey needs to give way .
instead of explaining why turkey should n't accede to the eu , the heads of the european states should be racking their brains about how to make accession happen - or at least how to begin the process , since full membership is unlikely in the near future .
meanwhile , turkey is right to intensively build up its status as a regional power , instead of trying at all cost to become a member of a weaker , crisis-plagued eu .

but this does n't mean ankara is turning its back on europe , says bahaeddin guengoer of deutsche welle 's turkish service . turkey can explain itself however it likes .
but its latest diplomatic actions - its " no " to iran sanctions in the un security council ; its goal of carrying out a zero-problem policy with all its neighbors - are being met in the west with anxious questions .
is turkey turning away from the west ?
does it see its future in the islamic camp ?
the answer to such questions is a definite " no . "
turkey is not turning its back on the west !
yes , the goal of eu accession is losing priority in ankara 's current policy .
turkey is acting with a new level of self-confidence in the international diplomatic arena , and no one should resent the country for trying to build up its status as a regional power - or for trying to look beyond the narrow confines of europe .
turkey seeks new responsibility tacticians from washington , brazil and brussels to tehran , the middle east and moscow have been trying to instrumentalize nato-member turkey to serve their own diplomatic goals for nearly 60 years .
now , turkey wants to take on more responsibility : in conflict regions like the middle east and the caucasus , as an arbitrator in atomic negotiations with iran , and not least as a reliable energy route for the west .
questioning whether turkey belongs in the european or the oriental camp is easy to understand - but its not justifiable .
since its founding nearly nine decades ago , the modern turkish republic has decided in favor of europe , and therefore , in favor of the west .
despite this , ankara ca n't look forward to being greeted with open arms in its efforts to join the european union - nor does the islamic world celebrate turkey 's western orientation .
its dialog with hamas as an unspoken condition for a dialog with iran , and its over-eager actions toward reprimanding israel , have led to a great deal of resentment in europe and the us - and at the same time , done serious damage to its relations with the jewish state .
two sides of a coin purely in terms of numbers , turkey has what it takes to back up its ambitions of strength .
the country has seen nearly 12 percent economic growth in the first quarter of the year , along with being the 16th-strongest economy in the world , and the 7th in europe .
but that is just one side of the coin .
on the other side is the growing polarization between the religious and the secular in a turkey whose population has yet to taste many of the fruits of economic growth .
the continuous lack of democratic process , the weak grasp of the concept of press freedom in a gray zone , or the unwillingness of prime minsiter erdogan to deal with criticism of either himself or his policies , are all alarming threats to domestic stability .
turkey belongs in europe !
europe and turkey need one another like never before .
turkey needs europe in order to build itself up as a regional power and to give it more weight in its influence on its neighbors .
for its part , without turkey , europe reduces its chances of succeeding in its global goals and strategies .
europe 's unified rejection of turkey needs to give way .
instead of explaining why turkey should n't accede to the eu , the heads of the european states should be racking their brains about how to make accession happen - or at least how to begin the process , since full membership is unlikely in the near future .
meanwhile , turkey is right to intensively build up its status as a regional power , instead of trying at all cost to become a member of a weaker , crisis-plagued eu .

komorowski 's party has made eurozone membership for poland a top priority . european leaders have recognized a new political ally in bronislaw komorowski , the winner of sunday 's presidential election in poland .
komorowski narrowly edged jaroslaw kaczynski in the run-off election that followed the first round of voting on june 20 .
kaczynski is the twin brother of poland 's late president lech kaczynski , who died in a plane crash on april 10 .
german chancellor angela merkel wished komorowski the best on monday afternoon in a congratulatory letter , saying she looked forward to deepening the close relationship between germany and poland and working together with komorowski " for a good future in a united europe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurozone membership could be on the horizon for poland french president nicolas sarkozy pledged his full support to komorowski in a written message and hoped for regular personal talks between the two .
observers believe komorowski 's election will improve ties between the three countries of the so-called weimar triangle : poland , germany , and france .
the annual meetings of the weimar triangle were originally established in 1991 as a means of preparing poland for european union membership but have since shifted focus to foster political dialogue between the three countries .
a vote for the eu european commission president jose manuel barroso sent a similar note to komorowski .
" i 'm sure that under your presidency , poland will continue to be strongly prosperous and a positive force for developing democracy in the european union , " wrote barroso .
komorowski 's victory is also being seen as bringing poland a step closer to membership in the eurozone .
the country 's prime minister , donald tusk , has long been for poland 's admission to the eu and the eurozone , but faced opposition from the late president lech kaczynski .
komorowski is a member of tusk 's civic platform party , which will now have one year of control in government and the presidency before the next parliamentary elections .

kaczynski is the twin brother of poland 's late president lech kaczynski , who died in a plane crash on april 10 .
german chancellor angela merkel wished komorowski the best on monday afternoon in a congratulatory letter , saying she looked forward to deepening the close relationship between germany and poland and working together with komorowski " for a good future in a united europe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurozone membership could be on the horizon for poland french president nicolas sarkozy pledged his full support to komorowski in a written message and hoped for regular personal talks between the two .
observers believe komorowski 's election will improve ties between the three countries of the so-called weimar triangle : poland , germany , and france .
the annual meetings of the weimar triangle were originally established in 1991 as a means of preparing poland for european union membership but have since shifted focus to foster political dialogue between the three countries .
a vote for the eu european commission president jose manuel barroso sent a similar note to komorowski .
" i 'm sure that under your presidency , poland will continue to be strongly prosperous and a positive force for developing democracy in the european union , " wrote barroso .
komorowski 's victory is also being seen as bringing poland a step closer to membership in the eurozone .
the country 's prime minister , donald tusk , has long been for poland 's admission to the eu and the eurozone , but faced opposition from the late president lech kaczynski .
komorowski is a member of tusk 's civic platform party , which will now have one year of control in government and the presidency before the next parliamentary elections .

the resignations from alain joyandet , state secretary for overseas development , and christian blanc , state secretary for the greater paris region , followed disclosures that both politicians had abused their office perks .
joyandet came under fire following press reports that he hired a private jet costing 116,500 euros to fly on official business to the caribbean , when he could have taken a regular scheduled flight .

french authorities have ordered a full review into the tax situation of liliane bettancourt , the 87-year-old heiress of the l 'oreal cosmetics group , after one of her advisors acknowledged there may have been financial irregularities .
opposition politicians have questioned why woerth never ordered a review while he was budget minister from 2007 to 2010 , suggesting it may have been because his wife then worked for the company that managed bettancourt 's wealth .
woerth has denied any wrongdoing and sarkozy has openly defended him .
leftist leaders say the furor over blanc and joyandet is a " fire shield " to distract voters from woerth 's ongoing difficulties .

and both will have to battle history in what could be a war of nerves . coming off their upset of brazil , and boasting a squad that features players from europe 's top clubs , holland are definitely the favorites .
but the dutch know all too well that in football , favorites do n't always win .
" we 're not strutting around all day doing the polonaise , " netherlands coach bert van marwijk said after his team 's stunning 2-1 defeat of the mighty selecao .
" we have n't yet reached our goal . "
holland are arguably soccer 's greatest underachievers .
the national team have never won a world cup and , despite consistently fielding some of the sport 's most innovative and entertaining teams , the last time they qualified for a final was way back in 1978 .
this time around they 're trying something different .
instead of total football , van marwijk - whose resume includes a stint at bundesliga side dortmund - has emphasized a control and efficiency reminiscent of past german teams .
bildunterschrift : the oranjes have been riding high without individual brilliance that has n't always sat well with free-wheeling stars like arjen robben , wesley sneijder and robin van persie , but it 's yielded results .
assistant coach frank de boer says the players have learned that winning ugly is better than losing beautifully .
" our goal was to gain stability , " de boer has told reporters .
" the team is mature and has internalized a system .
we 're now capable of getting off to poor starts and still winning matches . "
the oranje , however , will be missing two major sources of that stability , right-back gregory van der wiel and defensive midfielder nigel de jong , when they take to the pitch in cape town on tuesday .
both are suspended after picking up two yellow cards .
fortunately for the dutch , their opponents have far graver personnel issues .
bildunterschrift : suarez made a fine but costly save against ghana survival artists after his team 's heart-stopping victory over ghana on friday , uruguay coach oscar tabarez had spent much of his time defending striker luis suarez , whose last-second handball clearance would have done most goalkeepers proud - and earned the player a red card and a one-match ban .
now , tabarez will have to think about how to replace him - an unenviable task since none of his reserve strikers possess the pace or the touch of suarez .
much of the burden will fall on diego forlan .
uruguay 's one true superstar has had a stand-out tournament and has been one of the few players to be effective from distance .
but he 'll have to work harder than ever to create space for his shots .
bildunterschrift : forlan has been on the mark and the situation is even more troubling at the back .
left back jorge fucile is also suspended , while central defender and captain diego lugano is doubtful with a bruised knee - two potentially crushing blows for a defensively oriented team .
the main factor speaking for la celeste in this match is pride .
a two-time world cup winner -lrb- 1930 and 1950 -rrb- , uruguay has n't done this well since 1970 , and a trip to another final would be a massive achievement for a country of only 3.3 million inhabitants .
for that reason , holland are preaching caution .
" our next match is a very dangerous one , " van marwijk has said .
" uruguay 's players are tremendous fighters and survival artists . "
history in the making bildunterschrift : fans of both sides hope the party will continue given the personnel constellation , the likely course of this match is obvious .
the netherlands will have to attack while uruguay try to hang on , hoping for a goal against the run of play or a draw that would send the match to penalties .
the uglier the match , the better la celeste 's chances .
so uruguay are bound to try to irritate robben , sneijder and van persie with niggling fouls .
but can former reserves step up to fill the gaps and take some of the focus off forlan ?
uruguay 's captain , in any case , says the team is n't satisfied with just reaching the semis .
" we know that if we want to make history , we have to become champions , " diego lugano told reporters .
" we have two must-win matches to go .
it 's equally difficult and possible . "
the challenge for the oranje will be to keep their cool , stick with their game plan and trust that the superior quality will prevail , should they fail to break the match open with an early goal .
that 's a doable task - but one dutch sides have often been unequal to in the past .
one thing is certain : whichever team wins will reward long-suffering fans with their nation 's greatest world cup triumph in decades .
and that will add a bit of extra-tension to what 's already shaping up to be a nervy contest .

dw ’ s bartosz dudek sees komorowski ’ s win as a victory for europe . president-elect bronislaw komorowski and his liberal conservative party civic platform stand for a europe-friendly and future-oriented poland .
they also value dialogue and compromise in their political dealings .
but defeated presidential candidate jaroslaw kaczynski also achieved considerable success in this election .
his 47 percent of the vote is a political base upon which his conservative law and justice party can build upon in the next parliamentary elections in 2011 .
komorowski 's kingmakers were poland 's left-of-center voters .
though rival jaroslaw kaczynski made a leftist , populist turn at the end of his campaign , it simply was not enough to win over left-of-center voters .
even kaczynski 's praise of communist-era social policies could not sway them .
two-thirds of the left-of-center voters marked komorowski 's name on their ballots , making him the country 's next president .
the close result of the election also demonstrates to what extent poland is politically divided .
while komorowski 's campaign spoke to younger , educated , urban voters , kaczynski tended to attract older , less educated and more rural voters .
there can also be no talk of true defeat in this election because , as leader of the largest opposition party , the power-hungry kaczynski will long remain a serious rival to liberal-conservative prime minister donald tusk and president-elect bronislaw komorowski .
therefore , kaczynski 's success at the polls must be heeded as a warning .
the path for kaczynski 's return to power would already be paved , should warsaw 's current coalition government wind up presiding over corruption , rising joblessness , or harsh social policies .
if kaczynski were to return as poland 's prime minister , he could throw poland back into the domestic and foreign confrontations that once dominated the country 's politics .
so komorowski 's election is not only good news not only poland but also for german-polish relations and for europe as a whole .
a cheerful , aimiable polish president with foreign affairs experience and good relations with other european leaders will make poland a stable pillar of european politics . this bodes well for the polish eu presidency in 2011 and the beleaguered european union .

but this does n't mean ankara is turning its back on europe , says bahaeddin guengoer of deutsche welle 's turkish service . turkey can explain itself however it likes .
but its latest diplomatic actions - its " no " to iran sanctions in the un security council ; its goal of carrying out a zero-problem policy with all its neighbors - are being met in the west with anxious questions .
is turkey turning away from the west ?
does it see its future in the islamic camp ?
the answer to such questions is a definite " no . "
turkey is not turning its back on the west !
yes , the goal of eu accession is losing priority in ankara 's current policy .
turkey is acting with a new level of self-confidence in the international diplomatic arena , and no one should resent the country for trying to build up its status as a regional power - or for trying to look beyond the narrow confines of europe .
turkey seeks new responsibility tacticians from washington , brazil and brussels to tehran , the middle east and moscow have been trying to instrumentalize nato-member turkey to serve their own diplomatic goals for nearly 60 years .
now , turkey wants to take on more responsibility : in conflict regions like the middle east and the caucasus , as an arbitrator in atomic negotiations with iran , and not least as a reliable energy route for the west .
questioning whether turkey belongs in the european or the oriental camp is easy to understand - but its not justifiable .
since its founding nearly nine decades ago , the modern turkish republic has decided in favor of europe , and therefore , in favor of the west .
despite this , ankara ca n't look forward to being greeted with open arms in its efforts to join the european union - nor does the islamic world celebrate turkey 's western orientation .
its dialog with hamas as an unspoken condition for a dialog with iran , and its over-eager actions toward reprimanding israel , have led to a great deal of resentment in europe and the us - and at the same time , done serious damage to its relations with the jewish state .
two sides of a coin purely in terms of numbers , turkey has what it takes to back up its ambitions of strength .
the country has seen nearly 12 percent economic growth in the first quarter of the year , along with being the 16th-strongest economy in the world , and the 7th in europe .
but that is just one side of the coin .
on the other side is the growing polarization between the religious and the secular in a turkey whose population has yet to taste many of the fruits of economic growth .
the continuous lack of democratic process , the weak grasp of the concept of press freedom in a gray zone , or the unwillingness of prime minsiter erdogan to deal with criticism of either himself or his policies , are all alarming threats to domestic stability .
turkey belongs in europe !
europe and turkey need one another like never before .
turkey needs europe in order to build itself up as a regional power and to give it more weight in its influence on its neighbors .
for its part , without turkey , europe reduces its chances of succeeding in its global goals and strategies .
europe 's unified rejection of turkey needs to give way .
instead of explaining why turkey should n't accede to the eu , the heads of the european states should be racking their brains about how to make accession happen - or at least how to begin the process , since full membership is unlikely in the near future .
meanwhile , turkey is right to intensively build up its status as a regional power , instead of trying at all cost to become a member of a weaker , crisis-plagued eu .

turkey seeks new responsibility tacticians from washington , brazil and brussels to tehran , the middle east and moscow have been trying to instrumentalize nato-member turkey to serve their own diplomatic goals for nearly 60 years .
now , turkey wants to take on more responsibility : in conflict regions like the middle east and the caucasus , as an arbitrator in atomic negotiations with iran , and not least as a reliable energy route for the west .
questioning whether turkey belongs in the european or the oriental camp is easy to understand - but its not justifiable .
since its founding nearly nine decades ago , the modern turkish republic has decided in favor of europe , and therefore , in favor of the west .
despite this , ankara ca n't look forward to being greeted with open arms in its efforts to join the european union - nor does the islamic world celebrate turkey 's western orientation .
its dialog with hamas as an unspoken condition for a dialog with iran , and its over-eager actions toward reprimanding israel , have led to a great deal of resentment in europe and the us - and at the same time , done serious damage to its relations with the jewish state .
two sides of a coin purely in terms of numbers , turkey has what it takes to back up its ambitions of strength .
the country has seen nearly 12 percent economic growth in the first quarter of the year , along with being the 16th-strongest economy in the world , and the 7th in europe .
but that is just one side of the coin .
on the other side is the growing polarization between the religious and the secular in a turkey whose population has yet to taste many of the fruits of economic growth .
the continuous lack of democratic process , the weak grasp of the concept of press freedom in a gray zone , or the unwillingness of prime minsiter erdogan to deal with criticism of either himself or his policies , are all alarming threats to domestic stability .
turkey belongs in europe !
europe and turkey need one another like never before .
turkey needs europe in order to build itself up as a regional power and to give it more weight in its influence on its neighbors .
for its part , without turkey , europe reduces its chances of succeeding in its global goals and strategies .
europe 's unified rejection of turkey needs to give way .
instead of explaining why turkey should n't accede to the eu , the heads of the european states should be racking their brains about how to make accession happen - or at least how to begin the process , since full membership is unlikely in the near future .
meanwhile , turkey is right to intensively build up its status as a regional power , instead of trying at all cost to become a member of a weaker , crisis-plagued eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 05.07.2010 klose aims to break world cup goal scoring record großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose is sitting on 14 world cup goals ahead of their semifinal match against spain , german striker miroslav klose insists ' die mannschaft ' have what it takes to beat the european champions . germany has the class to beat european champions spain in their world cup semifinal showdown on wednesday , said bayern munich and germany striker miroslav klose .
speaking a day after scoring a brace in germany 's 4-0 demolition of argentina in the quarters , klose said he had his eyes on becoming the all-time world cup top scorer .
" i want to score at least five goals at the world cup .
and i will be very satisfied if i score six , " klose told a news conference .
the 32-year-old scored five goals in world cups in 2002 and 2006 and has so far netted four times in the 2010 tournament .
that puts him one goal behind record scorer ronaldo of brazil , who netted 15 world cup goals between 1998 and 2006 .
measured , yet confident klose said that his team would n't get carried away after several resounding victories throughout the competition , including a 4-1 win over england and a 4-0 thumping of australia .
" spain is better than england and argentina , no question .
they are not unbeatable , and we will try to expose their weaknesses ...
we are better than 2008 and want to show that on the pitch , " said klose .
the germans will line up against spain without young forward thomas mueller , whose red-hot form has been one of the pillars of germany 's effectiveness .
the 20-year-old was given a yellow card in the win against argentina and will miss the semifinal clash .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller has been a revelation this world cup germany coach joachim loew sought to downplay worries over having to rejig his lineup , insisting he had enough talent at his disposal to cover the loss of mueller .
" it 's clear it 's a blow for us - he has shown himself to be dangerous in front of goal .
but we have players who can replace him , " loew said .
possible replacements for mueller include hamburg attacking midfielder piotr trochowski and young bayern attacker toni kroos , both of whom have been given game time in south africa .
stuttgart-based striker cacau is also an option , but rumors still persist about an abdominal muscle strain that kept him out of the quarterfinals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 05.07.2010 french junior ministers resign over perks scandals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one politician lost his job over a penchant for cigars two french junior ministers have resigned over spending scandals , as the government attempts to regain political credibility following a series of setbacks . french president nicolas sarkozy has accepted the resignation of two of his junior ministers after separate spending scandals .
the resignations from alain joyandet , state secretary for overseas development , and christian blanc , state secretary for the greater paris region , followed disclosures that both politicians had abused their office perks .
joyandet came under fire following press reports that he hired a private jet costing 116,500 euros to fly on official business to the caribbean , when he could have taken a regular scheduled flight .
he was also criticized last month over claims he was granted a permit illegally to build an extension to his house in saint tropez .
blanc 's office spent 12,000 euros -lrb- $ 14,680 -rrb- on cigars , and the minister himself admitted to smoking a third of them .
he was ordered to pay back the full bill . the revelations came as the french government was looking to promote ministerial sobriety and budget austerity in the face of a deficit set to hit a record high of eight percent of gdp .
sarkozy asserts authority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both blanc -lrb- l . -rrb- and joyandet resigned on sunday the resignations came as a surprise , as two days previously sarkozy had publicly criticized the two men 's behavior and made clear they would be removed from their posts in the next cabinet reshuffle in october .
but the president appeared unwilling to sacrifice his labor minister , eric woerth , who has also faced corruption accusations .
woerth has been the subject of daily scrutiny over the so-called ' bettancourt affair . '
french authorities have ordered a full review into the tax situation of liliane bettancourt , the 87-year-old heiress of the l 'oreal cosmetics group , after one of her advisors acknowledged there may have been financial irregularities .
opposition politicians have questioned why woerth never ordered a review while he was budget minister from 2007 to 2010 , suggesting it may have been because his wife then worked for the company that managed bettancourt 's wealth .
woerth has denied any wrongdoing and sarkozy has openly defended him .
leftist leaders say the furor over blanc and joyandet is a " fire shield " to distract voters from woerth 's ongoing difficulties .
in order for the state to save money , neither minister will be replaced .
sarkozy has also ordered that official use of planes and cars be restricted and departmental parties banned .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 05.07.2010 netherlands , uruguay try to recapture past glory in first 2010 semifinal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of these teams will be playing on july 11 injuries and suspensions will force both the oranje and la celeste to improvise as they try to punch their ticket for the final .
and both will have to battle history in what could be a war of nerves . coming off their upset of brazil , and boasting a squad that features players from europe 's top clubs , holland are definitely the favorites .
but the dutch know all too well that in football , favorites do n't always win .
" we 're not strutting around all day doing the polonaise , " netherlands coach bert van marwijk said after his team 's stunning 2-1 defeat of the mighty selecao .
" we have n't yet reached our goal . "
holland are arguably soccer 's greatest underachievers .
the national team have never won a world cup and , despite consistently fielding some of the sport 's most innovative and entertaining teams , the last time they qualified for a final was way back in 1978 .
this time around they 're trying something different .
instead of total football , van marwijk - whose resume includes a stint at bundesliga side dortmund - has emphasized a control and efficiency reminiscent of past german teams .
bildunterschrift : the oranjes have been riding high without individual brilliance that has n't always sat well with free-wheeling stars like arjen robben , wesley sneijder and robin van persie , but it 's yielded results .
assistant coach frank de boer says the players have learned that winning ugly is better than losing beautifully .
" our goal was to gain stability , " de boer has told reporters .
" the team is mature and has internalized a system .
we 're now capable of getting off to poor starts and still winning matches . "
the oranje , however , will be missing two major sources of that stability , right-back gregory van der wiel and defensive midfielder nigel de jong , when they take to the pitch in cape town on tuesday .
both are suspended after picking up two yellow cards .
fortunately for the dutch , their opponents have far graver personnel issues .
bildunterschrift : suarez made a fine but costly save against ghana survival artists after his team 's heart-stopping victory over ghana on friday , uruguay coach oscar tabarez had spent much of his time defending striker luis suarez , whose last-second handball clearance would have done most goalkeepers proud - and earned the player a red card and a one-match ban .
now , tabarez will have to think about how to replace him - an unenviable task since none of his reserve strikers possess the pace or the touch of suarez .
much of the burden will fall on diego forlan .
uruguay 's one true superstar has had a stand-out tournament and has been one of the few players to be effective from distance .
but he 'll have to work harder than ever to create space for his shots .
bildunterschrift : forlan has been on the mark and the situation is even more troubling at the back .
left back jorge fucile is also suspended , while central defender and captain diego lugano is doubtful with a bruised knee - two potentially crushing blows for a defensively oriented team .
the main factor speaking for la celeste in this match is pride .
a two-time world cup winner -lrb- 1930 and 1950 -rrb- , uruguay has n't done this well since 1970 , and a trip to another final would be a massive achievement for a country of only 3.3 million inhabitants .
for that reason , holland are preaching caution .
" our next match is a very dangerous one , " van marwijk has said .
" uruguay 's players are tremendous fighters and survival artists . "
history in the making bildunterschrift : fans of both sides hope the party will continue given the personnel constellation , the likely course of this match is obvious .
the netherlands will have to attack while uruguay try to hang on , hoping for a goal against the run of play or a draw that would send the match to penalties .
the uglier the match , the better la celeste 's chances .
so uruguay are bound to try to irritate robben , sneijder and van persie with niggling fouls .
but can former reserves step up to fill the gaps and take some of the focus off forlan ?
uruguay 's captain , in any case , says the team is n't satisfied with just reaching the semis .
" we know that if we want to make history , we have to become champions , " diego lugano told reporters .
" we have two must-win matches to go .
it 's equally difficult and possible . "
the challenge for the oranje will be to keep their cool , stick with their game plan and trust that the superior quality will prevail , should they fail to break the match open with an early goal .
that 's a doable task - but one dutch sides have often been unequal to in the past .
one thing is certain : whichever team wins will reward long-suffering fans with their nation 's greatest world cup triumph in decades .
and that will add a bit of extra-tension to what 's already shaping up to be a nervy contest .

the resignations from alain joyandet , state secretary for overseas development , and christian blanc , state secretary for the greater paris region , followed disclosures that both politicians had abused their office perks .
joyandet came under fire following press reports that he hired a private jet costing 116,500 euros to fly on official business to the caribbean , when he could have taken a regular scheduled flight .
he was also criticized last month over claims he was granted a permit illegally to build an extension to his house in saint tropez .

french authorities have ordered a full review into the tax situation of liliane bettancourt , the 87-year-old heiress of the l 'oreal cosmetics group , after one of her advisors acknowledged there may have been financial irregularities .
opposition politicians have questioned why woerth never ordered a review while he was budget minister from 2007 to 2010 , suggesting it may have been because his wife then worked for the company that managed bettancourt 's wealth .
woerth has denied any wrongdoing and sarkozy has openly defended him .
leftist leaders say the furor over blanc and joyandet is a " fire shield " to distract voters from woerth 's ongoing difficulties .
in order for the state to save money , neither minister will be replaced .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 05.07.2010 opinion : poland voted for europe by electing komorowski großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with a lean majority at 53 percent of the vote , liberal conservative leader bronislaw komorowski is set to become poland ’ s next president .
dw ’ s bartosz dudek sees komorowski ’ s win as a victory for europe . president-elect bronislaw komorowski and his liberal conservative party civic platform stand for a europe-friendly and future-oriented poland .
they also value dialogue and compromise in their political dealings .
but defeated presidential candidate jaroslaw kaczynski also achieved considerable success in this election .
his 47 percent of the vote is a political base upon which his conservative law and justice party can build upon in the next parliamentary elections in 2011 .
komorowski 's kingmakers were poland 's left-of-center voters .
though rival jaroslaw kaczynski made a leftist , populist turn at the end of his campaign , it simply was not enough to win over left-of-center voters .
even kaczynski 's praise of communist-era social policies could not sway them .
two-thirds of the left-of-center voters marked komorowski 's name on their ballots , making him the country 's next president .
the close result of the election also demonstrates to what extent poland is politically divided .
while komorowski 's campaign spoke to younger , educated , urban voters , kaczynski tended to attract older , less educated and more rural voters .
there can also be no talk of true defeat in this election because , as leader of the largest opposition party , the power-hungry kaczynski will long remain a serious rival to liberal-conservative prime minister donald tusk and president-elect bronislaw komorowski .
therefore , kaczynski 's success at the polls must be heeded as a warning .
the path for kaczynski 's return to power would already be paved , should warsaw 's current coalition government wind up presiding over corruption , rising joblessness , or harsh social policies .
if kaczynski were to return as poland 's prime minister , he could throw poland back into the domestic and foreign confrontations that once dominated the country 's politics .
so komorowski 's election is not only good news not only poland but also for german-polish relations and for europe as a whole .
a cheerful , aimiable polish president with foreign affairs experience and good relations with other european leaders will make poland a stable pillar of european politics . this bodes well for the polish eu presidency in 2011 and the beleaguered european union .

and both will have to battle history in what could be a war of nerves . coming off their upset of brazil , and boasting a squad that features players from europe 's top clubs , holland are definitely the favorites .
but the dutch know all too well that in football , favorites do n't always win .
" we 're not strutting around all day doing the polonaise , " netherlands coach bert van marwijk said after his team 's stunning 2-1 defeat of the mighty selecao .
" we have n't yet reached our goal . "
holland are arguably soccer 's greatest underachievers .
the national team have never won a world cup and , despite consistently fielding some of the sport 's most innovative and entertaining teams , the last time they qualified for a final was way back in 1978 .
this time around they 're trying something different .
instead of total football , van marwijk - whose resume includes a stint at bundesliga side dortmund - has emphasized a control and efficiency reminiscent of past german teams .
bildunterschrift : the oranjes have been riding high without individual brilliance that has n't always sat well with free-wheeling stars like arjen robben , wesley sneijder and robin van persie , but it 's yielded results .
assistant coach frank de boer says the players have learned that winning ugly is better than losing beautifully .
" our goal was to gain stability , " de boer has told reporters .
" the team is mature and has internalized a system .
we 're now capable of getting off to poor starts and still winning matches . "
the oranje , however , will be missing two major sources of that stability , right-back gregory van der wiel and defensive midfielder nigel de jong , when they take to the pitch in cape town on tuesday .
both are suspended after picking up two yellow cards .
fortunately for the dutch , their opponents have far graver personnel issues .
bildunterschrift : suarez made a fine but costly save against ghana survival artists after his team 's heart-stopping victory over ghana on friday , uruguay coach oscar tabarez had spent much of his time defending striker luis suarez , whose last-second handball clearance would have done most goalkeepers proud - and earned the player a red card and a one-match ban .
now , tabarez will have to think about how to replace him - an unenviable task since none of his reserve strikers possess the pace or the touch of suarez .
much of the burden will fall on diego forlan .
uruguay 's one true superstar has had a stand-out tournament and has been one of the few players to be effective from distance .
but he 'll have to work harder than ever to create space for his shots .
bildunterschrift : forlan has been on the mark and the situation is even more troubling at the back .
left back jorge fucile is also suspended , while central defender and captain diego lugano is doubtful with a bruised knee - two potentially crushing blows for a defensively oriented team .
the main factor speaking for la celeste in this match is pride .
a two-time world cup winner -lrb- 1930 and 1950 -rrb- , uruguay has n't done this well since 1970 , and a trip to another final would be a massive achievement for a country of only 3.3 million inhabitants .
for that reason , holland are preaching caution .
" our next match is a very dangerous one , " van marwijk has said .
" uruguay 's players are tremendous fighters and survival artists . "
history in the making bildunterschrift : fans of both sides hope the party will continue given the personnel constellation , the likely course of this match is obvious .
the netherlands will have to attack while uruguay try to hang on , hoping for a goal against the run of play or a draw that would send the match to penalties .
the uglier the match , the better la celeste 's chances .
so uruguay are bound to try to irritate robben , sneijder and van persie with niggling fouls .
but can former reserves step up to fill the gaps and take some of the focus off forlan ?
uruguay 's captain , in any case , says the team is n't satisfied with just reaching the semis .
" we know that if we want to make history , we have to become champions , " diego lugano told reporters .
" we have two must-win matches to go .
it 's equally difficult and possible . "
the challenge for the oranje will be to keep their cool , stick with their game plan and trust that the superior quality will prevail , should they fail to break the match open with an early goal .
that 's a doable task - but one dutch sides have often been unequal to in the past .
one thing is certain : whichever team wins will reward long-suffering fans with their nation 's greatest world cup triumph in decades .
and that will add a bit of extra-tension to what 's already shaping up to be a nervy contest .

uruguay 's one true superstar has had a stand-out tournament and has been one of the few players to be effective from distance .
but he 'll have to work harder than ever to create space for his shots .
bildunterschrift : forlan has been on the mark and the situation is even more troubling at the back .
left back jorge fucile is also suspended , while central defender and captain diego lugano is doubtful with a bruised knee - two potentially crushing blows for a defensively oriented team .
the main factor speaking for la celeste in this match is pride .
a two-time world cup winner -lrb- 1930 and 1950 -rrb- , uruguay has n't done this well since 1970 , and a trip to another final would be a massive achievement for a country of only 3.3 million inhabitants .
for that reason , holland are preaching caution .
" our next match is a very dangerous one , " van marwijk has said .
" uruguay 's players are tremendous fighters and survival artists . "
history in the making bildunterschrift : fans of both sides hope the party will continue given the personnel constellation , the likely course of this match is obvious .
the netherlands will have to attack while uruguay try to hang on , hoping for a goal against the run of play or a draw that would send the match to penalties .
the uglier the match , the better la celeste 's chances .
so uruguay are bound to try to irritate robben , sneijder and van persie with niggling fouls .
but can former reserves step up to fill the gaps and take some of the focus off forlan ?
uruguay 's captain , in any case , says the team is n't satisfied with just reaching the semis .
" we know that if we want to make history , we have to become champions , " diego lugano told reporters .
" we have two must-win matches to go .
it 's equally difficult and possible . "
the challenge for the oranje will be to keep their cool , stick with their game plan and trust that the superior quality will prevail , should they fail to break the match open with an early goal .
that 's a doable task - but one dutch sides have often been unequal to in the past .
one thing is certain : whichever team wins will reward long-suffering fans with their nation 's greatest world cup triumph in decades .
and that will add a bit of extra-tension to what 's already shaping up to be a nervy contest .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 05.07.2010 daimler plans electric motor scooter großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carmakers see market for city electric motor scooters daimler plans an electric scooter as the carmaker moves to build different types of electric vehicles for different market segments .
it 's not the first motorcycle , by the way , to come from the stuttgart-based car icon . the news came from the top .
in a television program over the weekend , daimler chief executive officer dieter zetsche said the german carmaker " will soon present an e-scooter . "
while many daimler car fans may wonder why the company would want to add e-scooters to its premium car and truck-dominated product portfolio , car analysts are n't surprised by the move .
" it 's all about the e-mobility push by the car industry , " christoph stuermer , an auto analyst with ihs global insight in frankfurt , told deutsche welle .
" a key element of this strategy is to build specific vehicles , like e-scooters , for specific market segments , such as short-distance travel in urban areas .
daimler aims to fill all these segments with products . "
bildunterschrift : lithium-ion batteries are powering a new wave of e-scooters global effort daimler spokeswoman eva wiese batted down speculation that daimler may hand over development of the new e-scooter to its new chinese electric vehicle partner , byd , which is specialized in car battery and drive technology .
" we will develop the e-scooter ourselves , using components , of course , from our global network of suppliers , " wiese told deutsche welle .
" it will be a global product , as all our products are . "
while motorcycle manufacturing , arguably , has not been a core competency of daimler , company co-founder gottlieb daimler is credited with having invented the first gasoline engine-powered motorcycle in 1885 .
essentially , it was a four-stroke internal combustion engine mounted on a wooden bicycle .
bmw and peugeot with head start much has happened in the way of motorcycle development since then , most recently in the area of electrically powered systems .
and perhaps to the dismay of daimler , some of its major competitors in europe , including bmw and peugeot , have a head start .
in the early 2000s , bmw launched the c1 , an enclosed scooter with many innovative features to protect the rider in an accident .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler now offers an electric version of its smart urban car last year , bmw , which manufacturers both cars and motorcycles , also unveiled an electric version of the scooter for the european safer urban motorcycling project .
the electric motor is powered by a lithium-ion battery with sufficient power for most inner-city driving conditions .
french carmaker peugeot , which mass-produced its first e-scooter 15 years ago , has launched yet another , the e-vivacity .
it is also equipped with lithium-ion battery capable of covering up to 100 kilometers on the road .
" it 's a logical move for daimler to build an e-scooter , " stuermer said .
" the company is engineering an electrical version of its smart urban car and hybrid models of its sedans for longer distances .
and now it plans a light vehicle for short city trips .
it 's filling all the gaps . "

speaking a day after scoring a brace in germany 's 4-0 demolition of argentina in the quarters , klose said he had his eyes on becoming the all-time world cup top scorer .
" i want to score at least five goals at the world cup .
and i will be very satisfied if i score six , " klose told a news conference .
the 32-year-old scored five goals in world cups in 2002 and 2006 and has so far netted four times in the 2010 tournament .
that puts him one goal behind record scorer ronaldo of brazil , who netted 15 world cup goals between 1998 and 2006 .

" spain is better than england and argentina , no question .
they are not unbeatable , and we will try to expose their weaknesses ...
we are better than 2008 and want to show that on the pitch , " said klose .
the germans will line up against spain without young forward thomas mueller , whose red-hot form has been one of the pillars of germany 's effectiveness .
the 20-year-old was given a yellow card in the win against argentina and will miss the semifinal clash .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller has been a revelation this world cup germany coach joachim loew sought to downplay worries over having to rejig his lineup , insisting he had enough talent at his disposal to cover the loss of mueller .
" it 's clear it 's a blow for us - he has shown himself to be dangerous in front of goal .
but we have players who can replace him , " loew said .
possible replacements for mueller include hamburg attacking midfielder piotr trochowski and young bayern attacker toni kroos , both of whom have been given game time in south africa .
stuttgart-based striker cacau is also an option , but rumors still persist about an abdominal muscle strain that kept him out of the quarterfinals .

two turkish newspapers had quoted davutoglu as saying ties with israel would be severed unless turkey received an apology for the flotilla raid or israel accepted the outcome of an independent inquiry into the incident .
in response to davutoglu 's alleged remarks , israeli foreign minister avigdor lieberman said during a trip to latvia that israel did n't " have any intention to apologize . "
later on monday , however , a spokesman for the turkish government told the reuters news agency that davutoglu had been misquoted in the newspaper reports .
the official claimed that davutoglu actually said that relations with israel would not improve if an apology was not issued .
the two countries have been on bad terms since the may 31 raid on a gaza-bound aid flotilla .
nine turkish nationals died after israeli military personnel boarded one of the ships . each side subsequently blamed the other for starting the violent confrontation .

defense analysts suggest the region is still a major concern . if the german defense ministry is to be believed , the terrorist threat in the sea off the horn of africa has been reduced so significantly that it sees no further reason to deploy its force of 90 marines and a navy reconnaissance plane as part of the us-led operation enduring freedom .
due to an assessment that claims that the threat is now ' limited , ' germany has ended its involvement six months earlier than its mandate stipulated .
germany has been involved in the operation enduring freedom as part of the mission aimed at stopping islamic terrorists smuggling arms to groups in africa from the arabian peninsula for over eight years .
the german navy joined the task force in february 2002 , some five months after the united states established the operation after the 9/11 attacks on new york and washington .
with the last german troops completing their tours of duty in the gulf of aden and the indian ocean last week , germany 's naval focus now shifts to the mediterranean .
one german navy frigate will remain off the coast of africa as part of operation atalanta , a european union mission to protect aid shipments into somalia from pirate attack .
however , with increased al qaeda activity being reported across the gulf of aden in yemen , affiliated islamist groups continuing to battle for control of somalia and reports that osama bin laden 's terror network is extending its influence into kenya , the german decision has caused some surprise among security analysts .
somalia at the heart of region 's spreading extremism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al shabab is fighting to install an islamic caliphate in somalia " the terrorist threat emanating from the horn of africa is limited at the moment , " jeremy binnie , a terrorism expert at jane 's defence group , told deutsche welle .
" however , there is a lot of concern that somalia might turn into something akin to taliban-controlled afghanistan in the 1990s .
the pro-al qaeda group there , the shabab , controls much of the south of the country and is currently threatening to overrun mogadishu .
the only thing stopping them is a small force of african peacekeepers .
so there are worries that southern somalia could become a safe haven for jihadists from other countries and a base for training . "
" there are already indications that the shabab is being supported by a small number of foreign jihadists and has recruited possibly hundreds of young men from europe and north america , most of them somalis , " binnie added .
" there have also been a few reports of yemen-based al qaeda operatives turning up in somalia .
the worry is that these guys could be used to carry out international terrorist attacks . "
" at the same time , there are worries about the geographical proximity between somalia and yemen , meaning it is possible that the shabab will link up with bin laden 's yemeni branch , al qaeda on the arabian peninsula . "
yemen supply lines still bringing arms , personnel to africa last year 's failed bombing of a detroit-bound airliner by an al qaeda suspect with links to yemen highlighted the country 's growing reputation as the new hub for terrorism in the region .
yemen is a blueprint nation for radical islamists ; it has a weak government , it is deeply divided by a tribalistic and violent civil war which is pushing the country toward the status of a failed state and has a culture in which most men carry weapons , therefore making identifying terrorists extremely difficult .
the land of osama bin laden 's ancestors has also become a melting pot of refugees from the conflict in somalia and returning jihadists from the wars in afghanistan and iraq .
with africa in its sights , it is thought that al qaeda sees yemen as an ideal staging point for fanning the flames of extremism across the gulf of aden in somalia and beyond .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda has targeted kenya since the us embassy attack despite having a less direct shipping connection to yemen than somalia , sharing a border with the failed state puts kenya at risk of infiltration by islamist terror groups .
instead of having to navigate through the international forces in indian ocean to reach the kenyan coastline , arab-based terrorists can smuggle weapons and personnel overland to kenya via somalia .
it has been reported for as long as germany was part of operation enduring freedom that al qaeda was seeking a foothold in kenya and that al qaeda operatives had infiltrated the country 's islamic communities on its indian ocean coast .
poor relations between kenya 's coastal muslims and the country 's inefficient security forces have provided al qaeda with a new base from which it can extend its growing network throughout eastern africa .
inland in kenya , border camps filled with refugees from somalia are reported to be just as fertile a breeding ground for young extremists .
meanwhile , kenya has its own home grown terror problem .
the kenyan saleh ali saleh nabhan was alleged to have been the leader of al qaeda in somalia and the mastermind behind the bombing of the paradise hotel in mombasa and the attempted downing of an israeli passenger jet in november 2002 .
he was also suspected of involvement in the 1998 us embassy bombings in nairobi and dar es salaam in tanzania .
he was killed by us special forces near mogadishu in september 2009 .
changing face of mission shifts threat focus david hartwell , an expert and risk analyst for the middle east and north africa , believes that the changing nature of operation enduring freedom has shifted the focus away from its original mission meaning that the horn of africa and land-based threats are now longer in its remit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops will leave but the threat will remain " the germans have made a fair assessment on enduring freedom but it 's one based on the level of threat within the operation 's initial mission which was to capture fleeing extremists and taliban from afghanistan and stop them getting to places like yemen , saudi arabia and oman , " hartwell told deutsche welle . " in its original form , it has n't recorded that many successes as there have been few significant arrests of wanted figures on the seas .
as such , enduring freedom has mutated into the anti-piracy mission which is having more success in containing the pirates .
but it has been agreed that there is less of a need for naval forces to be searching for fleeing extremists now , especially in the gulf of aden and indian ocean . " " the region itself is still unstable with civil wars and extremism in both somalia and yemen but those involved in enduring freedom are wary of getting involved in the internal politics in these countries so we 'll see more countries following germany 's decision and refocusing on the piracy mission , " he added . author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

is it a hindrance to artists that should be demolished , or a piece of history that should be preserved ? in a few weeks , people from around the world will flock to venice for the 12th venice biennale of architecture , which showcases new projects by big-name architects and designers . altogether , 28 national pavilions will be open to visitors , including the controversial german pavilion , which is a prime example of nazi architecture .
now , the federal chamber of german architects -lrb- bak -rrb- has started a debate about the building 's future . the german pavilion building - situated in the southern part of venice 's giardini park , where the biennale is held - is not particularly inviting .
the entry is large , with four imposing pillars supporting a heavy-looking roof .
the room inside has windows high above the ground , not offering any views of the surrounding area . ' unsuitable for art ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biennale takes places in venice 's giardini arno sighard schmid , president of the federal chamber of german architects , does not think that the temple-like nazi-era building represents modern germany .
he wants to see it torn down , saying that it is " neither suitable for art , nor for architecture " and has " no connection to the venetian skyline . " instead , he finds that it reflects the character of the nazi era , which brings an emotional aspect into the debate . the german pavilion was first erected in 1909 as the bavarian pavilion , based on the designs of a venetian architect .
with its ionic-style columns , it bore a resemblance to an ancient temple .
in 1938 , it was altered to reflect the nazi regime 's aesthetic ideals . then , in 1993 , german conceptual artist hans haacke smashed the travertine floor of the pavilion 's hall , where hitler and mussolini had once stood , leaving the fragments lying on the ground .
he called the work " failed hope . " a place for expression but according to susanne gaensheimer , director of the frankfurt museum for modern art and curator of the 2011 art biennale - the building is suitable for showcasing contemporary art , though it does represent a challenge for the artists . " there are many examples of exhibition halls with ideological or ideology-related architecture that show that this very confrontation with architecture has led to fantastic projects and artworks , " said gaensheimer .
" you need to differentiate between the outer architecture and what happens on the inside . " fantastic works of art have been presented in the german pavilion , she added - " and that is what represents this country . " bildunterschrift : in 2006 , the german curator team highlighted the most attractive aspect of the pavilion : the roof one example was the german presentation at the 2006 architecture biennale , which was titled " convertible city . "
the team of curators , from the architecture firm gruentuch ernst , positioned a bright red staircase through the window on the side of the pavilion , which allowed visitors to climb up onto the roof .
from there , they had a magnificent view of venice . the project was a good idea , conceded arno sighard schmid , but not one that can be repeated over and over . constructing the staircase " was a difficult undertaking , but showed that the roof offers such wonderful possibilities , " said schmid .
" and that 's the reason i 've proposed that our current democratic republic should present itself abroad in other ways than what this pavilion allows . " ' history ca n't be erased ' however , the curator for next year 's art biennale , susanne gaensheimer , maintains that history ca n't just be torn down . " demolishing architecture does n't mean that you can change history , " said gaensheimer .
" on the contrary , we can use architecture to preserve our consciousness of history . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlingensief has n't yet commented on his plans for the german pavilion in 2011 the curator has invited german performance artist christoph schlingensief to design the pavilion for 2011 .
schlingensief , who is battling lung cancer , has not yet commented on his plans .
however , he has been quoted as saying that he wished the german pavilion could be erased with a mouse-click . gaensheimer does not interpret this to mean that schlingensief favors the destruction of the building . " i can imagine that he meant he would like to make this whole discussion disappear with the click of a mouse , " she said .
" that 's what holds us up , always getting caught up in this discussion . " in his personal blog , schlingensief has called the idea of tearing down the pavilion " idiotic , " saying it was just a quick , unimaginative solution . author : sigrid hoff -lrb- ew / kjb -rrb- editor : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a report issued last month says that progress has been slow . two decades of civil war in sudan between the country 's mostly arab muslim north and the predominantly christian black african south left two million people dead .
armies from both sides enlisted children in their ranks .
in 2005 , a peace agreement signed to end the war also required a demobilization , disarmament and reintegration effort to send these children home .
but five years later and just months ahead of the december deadline , reports suggest there are still several hundred child soldiers in southern sudan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demobilization of child soldiers was part of a 2005 sudan peace deal learning to handle a gun jonathan , whose name has been changed to protect his identity , was 11 years old when soldiers from the sudan people ’ s liberation army -lrb- spla -rrb- forced him into the military .
" when the spla came to us , the older people ran away .
i did n't run because i was a child , " he said .
" so they captured me .
when i refused , they kept beating me .
i did n't want to go , but they forced me to join the spla . "
for the next five years , jonathan carried the soldiers ' bags , washed their clothes , cooked their food and collected firewood for them .
he said refusing to work would have meant being beaten by three or four people .
eventually , jonathan was trained to use a gun .
he was given his own ak-47 assault rifle and sent to the frontlines to battle the messiria , a tribe of arab nomads who bring their cattle to graze on land in southern sudan .
jonathan says he shot at them but never killed anyone .
" i think it was very bad for me to be in the military when i was 12 or 13 years old , but there was no other option for me , " he said .
" because if i wanted to go away , these people - they would look for me , really . "
" i found it difficult for me to be in the army when i was that young , " jonathan said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demobilized children rely on supplies from groups like the un 's world food programme spla ' a persistent violator ' in a may report , the united nations named the sudan people ’ s liberation army a " persistent violator " of children in armed conflict .
the spla signed an action plan last year with the un to get all children out of its ranks before december 2010 .
another report issued in june by the research organization small arms survey said progress for the demobilization has been " slow , " and communities receiving ex-combatants are faced with a dual economic and social burden .
in the capital of unity state , jonathan was one of 91 children demobilized in southern sudan on april 29 .
when government officials came to his military barracks , he thought they were lying when they said they were going to take him home .
but that ’ s exactly what happened .
glad to be home while it took a little while for jonathan to adjust to civilian life , he said he feels comfortable now and is glad to be home .
he plays soccer with friends on the weekends .
" i found it very nice for me to be home because i found some friends here , " he said .
" and also my family told me they missed me a lot . "
" now , if they tell me to go back to the army , i will refuse because i missed my family very much when i was in the army , " he added .
the un 's may report found that 33 former child soldiers had been demobilized last year only to be recruited once more by the south 's army .
charles machieng , the head of the south sudan demobilization , disarmament and reintegration commission for unity state , said when he prepares the children to leave the military , they ask him questions about their future back at home .
" children are actually asking us , ' why are you removing us from the army and taking us to the village where we do not get clean water , where we are not getting schooling , we 're not getting medication , and we ’ re not getting enough food ? " '
machieng said .
bildunterschrift : the spla agreed to demobilize children from its ranks by december 2010 lack of funds but the demobilization commission does n't have the resources to give material support to demobilized children .
the government relies on international organizations such as the un 's world food programme to provide the children with food .
the commission is asking the international community to contribute more aid to keep children from returning to the barracks .
bismarck swangin , a communications officer for unicef in southern sudan , said demobilized children have the same needs as those who haven ’ t been in in the military . the south sudan government , he said , could do more to help the demobilized children .
" we are aware of the challenges , the challenges of these children who are coming out of the military - the same challenges of the children who are even in the homes , including even those who stay with their parents , " he said .
" but i think there is an opportunity to do more .
i think the government needs to step up in terms of allocating more resources . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armies in both north and south sudan enlisted child soldiers during the civil war limited success today , about 900 children are still believed to be serving in the south ’ s military , down from an estimated 3,000 in 2005 .
" i think the process is working , " swangin said .
" but sometimes not up to expectations . "
unlike many children who worked as child soldiers for the spla , jonathan , though an orphan , is lucky to have an uncle with the resources to afford him an education .
he said he plans to get a doctorate .
" what i dream for , if i finish my studies - i can become like general salva kiir mayardit , or i can become president like omar al bashir , " he added .
but , unlike bashir who seized power in a 1989 military coup , jonathan has had enough of the military .

defense analysts suggest the region is still a major concern . if the german defense ministry is to be believed , the terrorist threat in the sea off the horn of africa has been reduced so significantly that it sees no further reason to deploy its force of 90 marines and a navy reconnaissance plane as part of the us-led operation enduring freedom .
due to an assessment that claims that the threat is now ' limited , ' germany has ended its involvement six months earlier than its mandate stipulated .
germany has been involved in the operation enduring freedom as part of the mission aimed at stopping islamic terrorists smuggling arms to groups in africa from the arabian peninsula for over eight years .
the german navy joined the task force in february 2002 , some five months after the united states established the operation after the 9/11 attacks on new york and washington .
with the last german troops completing their tours of duty in the gulf of aden and the indian ocean last week , germany 's naval focus now shifts to the mediterranean .
one german navy frigate will remain off the coast of africa as part of operation atalanta , a european union mission to protect aid shipments into somalia from pirate attack .
however , with increased al qaeda activity being reported across the gulf of aden in yemen , affiliated islamist groups continuing to battle for control of somalia and reports that osama bin laden 's terror network is extending its influence into kenya , the german decision has caused some surprise among security analysts .
somalia at the heart of region 's spreading extremism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al shabab is fighting to install an islamic caliphate in somalia " the terrorist threat emanating from the horn of africa is limited at the moment , " jeremy binnie , a terrorism expert at jane 's defence group , told deutsche welle .
" however , there is a lot of concern that somalia might turn into something akin to taliban-controlled afghanistan in the 1990s .
the pro-al qaeda group there , the shabab , controls much of the south of the country and is currently threatening to overrun mogadishu .
the only thing stopping them is a small force of african peacekeepers .
so there are worries that southern somalia could become a safe haven for jihadists from other countries and a base for training . "
" there are already indications that the shabab is being supported by a small number of foreign jihadists and has recruited possibly hundreds of young men from europe and north america , most of them somalis , " binnie added .
" there have also been a few reports of yemen-based al qaeda operatives turning up in somalia .
the worry is that these guys could be used to carry out international terrorist attacks . "
" at the same time , there are worries about the geographical proximity between somalia and yemen , meaning it is possible that the shabab will link up with bin laden 's yemeni branch , al qaeda on the arabian peninsula . "
yemen supply lines still bringing arms , personnel to africa last year 's failed bombing of a detroit-bound airliner by an al qaeda suspect with links to yemen highlighted the country 's growing reputation as the new hub for terrorism in the region .
yemen is a blueprint nation for radical islamists ; it has a weak government , it is deeply divided by a tribalistic and violent civil war which is pushing the country toward the status of a failed state and has a culture in which most men carry weapons , therefore making identifying terrorists extremely difficult .
the land of osama bin laden 's ancestors has also become a melting pot of refugees from the conflict in somalia and returning jihadists from the wars in afghanistan and iraq .
with africa in its sights , it is thought that al qaeda sees yemen as an ideal staging point for fanning the flames of extremism across the gulf of aden in somalia and beyond .

it has been reported for as long as germany was part of operation enduring freedom that al qaeda was seeking a foothold in kenya and that al qaeda operatives had infiltrated the country 's islamic communities on its indian ocean coast .
poor relations between kenya 's coastal muslims and the country 's inefficient security forces have provided al qaeda with a new base from which it can extend its growing network throughout eastern africa .
inland in kenya , border camps filled with refugees from somalia are reported to be just as fertile a breeding ground for young extremists .
meanwhile , kenya has its own home grown terror problem .
the kenyan saleh ali saleh nabhan was alleged to have been the leader of al qaeda in somalia and the mastermind behind the bombing of the paradise hotel in mombasa and the attempted downing of an israeli passenger jet in november 2002 .
he was also suspected of involvement in the 1998 us embassy bombings in nairobi and dar es salaam in tanzania .
he was killed by us special forces near mogadishu in september 2009 .
changing face of mission shifts threat focus david hartwell , an expert and risk analyst for the middle east and north africa , believes that the changing nature of operation enduring freedom has shifted the focus away from its original mission meaning that the horn of africa and land-based threats are now longer in its remit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops will leave but the threat will remain " the germans have made a fair assessment on enduring freedom but it 's one based on the level of threat within the operation 's initial mission which was to capture fleeing extremists and taliban from afghanistan and stop them getting to places like yemen , saudi arabia and oman , " hartwell told deutsche welle .

defense analysts suggest the region is still a major concern . if the german defense ministry is to be believed , the terrorist threat in the sea off the horn of africa has been reduced so significantly that it sees no further reason to deploy its force of 90 marines and a navy reconnaissance plane as part of the us-led operation enduring freedom .
due to an assessment that claims that the threat is now ' limited , ' germany has ended its involvement six months earlier than its mandate stipulated .
germany has been involved in the operation enduring freedom as part of the mission aimed at stopping islamic terrorists smuggling arms to groups in africa from the arabian peninsula for over eight years .
the german navy joined the task force in february 2002 , some five months after the united states established the operation after the 9/11 attacks on new york and washington .
with the last german troops completing their tours of duty in the gulf of aden and the indian ocean last week , germany 's naval focus now shifts to the mediterranean .
one german navy frigate will remain off the coast of africa as part of operation atalanta , a european union mission to protect aid shipments into somalia from pirate attack .
however , with increased al qaeda activity being reported across the gulf of aden in yemen , affiliated islamist groups continuing to battle for control of somalia and reports that osama bin laden 's terror network is extending its influence into kenya , the german decision has caused some surprise among security analysts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 05.07.2010 komorowski wins polish presidential election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : komorowski says the european union is his top priority bronislaw komorowski , the candidate of poland 's ruling pro-business civic platform party , has become the country 's next president .
komorowski beat jaroslaw kaczynski by a margin of seven percent of the vote . liberal parliamentary speaker and acting president bronislaw komorowski has won poland 's presidential run-off election . with all votes counted , komorowski earned 53 percent of the vote , while his opponent , nationalist opposition leader jaroslaw kaczynski , gained 47 percent of the votes , according to the election commission . jaroslaw is the twin brother of former president lech kaczynski , who died in a plane crash on april 10 .
the election was triggered by the former leader 's sudden death , along with his wife and 95 others , in the crash . sunday 's election followed a first round of voting on june 20 , in which neither candidate secured a majority . ' good for poland ' on hearing early results , a beaming komorowski said that polish democracy had emerged the winner . " today democracy has won , our polish democracy , " komorowski said before a crowd of cheering supporters , adding that it was " important not to foment divisions , but to build a sense of unity . " kaczynski admitted defeat shortly after komorowski 's speech . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski has performed better than expected " i congratulate the winner .
i congratulate bronislaw komorowski , " kaczynski said from his campaign headquarters . german foreign minister guido westerwelle also offered his congratulations , describing the result as a step in the right direction for closer cooperation between poland and europe . " the polish people 's decision to elect komorowski is a strong pro-european signal , " westerwelle said in berlin .
" with president komorowski , as well as prime minister donald tusk and foreign minister radoslaw sikorski , we will have a strong partner for our path of trust and cooperation . " high turnout prior to the run-off election there were growing fears that the start of summer holidays in poland would make voters prefer baltic beaches to polling stations , though this did not materialize . at 52 percent , turnout was much higher than expected .
analysts said it was a clear sign of the mobilization of the two electorates : the traditional , conservative , euroskeptic and mostly rural supporters of kaczynski , and the more reform-minded , pro-european urban voters .
that division was apparent in a sampling of views among voters in warsaw . " we just need to stop kaczynski from winning .
he 's stuck in the past and he 's bad for poland 's position in the eu , " a young businessman told deutsche welle at a polling station in the leafy middle class warsaw suburb of jozefoslaw . " komorowski , together with the reformist prime minister , donald tusk , will lead us deeper into europe . "
however , a retired teacher offered this opinion of komorowski as she cast her ballot : " -lsb- he -rsb- represents those smug businesspeople who have been allowed to thrive at the expense of us pensioners .
i 'm voting for kaczynski , because he cares for people like me .
he 's a patriot who holds national values dear . ” european integration versus national values bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : komorowski insists poland must be closer to germany and france komorowski is a close ally of the prime minister .
both men argue that poland needs economic liberalization to maintain economic growth - the country was the only eu member to avoid recession last year , although growth slowed to 1.8 percent from 5 percent in 2008 . ahead of the run-off vote , kaczynski accused them both of plotting to privatize national health care and sell the country out to foreign investors at the expense of the poor .
komorowski has however insisted that european integration was his highest priority . " the number one issue is poland 's eu membership , strengthening its position there , developing the weimar triangle relationship with germany and france and building reconciliation with russia , " he said in a televised debate . " it is also in poland 's interests to serve as a champion of european integration with countries further east . " euroskeptic and nationalist kaczynski took a more nationalist tone .
while giving few specifics on foreign policy , he clearly stated his plans to carry on his late brother 's policies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : komorowski has secured the presidency " i wo n't let poland be treated as a minor partner by any other country in europe , " he said in the debate .
" foreign policy , which should clearly be the domain of the polish president , requires that the principle of sovereignty should be clearly adhered to , which does n't always happen under the present government . " critics say his unabashed euroskepticism , which he championed during his term as prime minister from 2006 to 2007 , alienated poland 's neighbors .
he said he currently has no interest in adopting the euro , pointing out that the free-floating zloty has helped poland ride out the economic crisis . " if we had pushed for the euro as the government wanted , we would today be in an economic catastrophe , " he said . author : david levitz / rafal kiepuszewski -lrb- reuters , afp , ap -rrb- editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as such , enduring freedom has mutated into the anti-piracy mission which is having more success in containing the pirates .
but it has been agreed that there is less of a need for naval forces to be searching for fleeing extremists now , especially in the gulf of aden and indian ocean . " " the region itself is still unstable with civil wars and extremism in both somalia and yemen but those involved in enduring freedom are wary of getting involved in the internal politics in these countries so we 'll see more countries following germany 's decision and refocusing on the piracy mission , " he added . author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eu expansion -pipe- 05.07.2010 opinion : cooling ties or not , turkey and the eu need each other großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recently , much has been made of the notion that eu accession is losing importance for turkey .
but this does n't mean ankara is turning its back on europe , says bahaeddin guengoer of deutsche welle 's turkish service . turkey can explain itself however it likes .
but its latest diplomatic actions - its " no " to iran sanctions in the un security council ; its goal of carrying out a zero-problem policy with all its neighbors - are being met in the west with anxious questions .
is turkey turning away from the west ?
does it see its future in the islamic camp ?
the answer to such questions is a definite " no . "
turkey is not turning its back on the west !
yes , the goal of eu accession is losing priority in ankara 's current policy .
turkey is acting with a new level of self-confidence in the international diplomatic arena , and no one should resent the country for trying to build up its status as a regional power - or for trying to look beyond the narrow confines of europe .
turkey seeks new responsibility tacticians from washington , brazil and brussels to tehran , the middle east and moscow have been trying to instrumentalize nato-member turkey to serve their own diplomatic goals for nearly 60 years .
now , turkey wants to take on more responsibility : in conflict regions like the middle east and the caucasus , as an arbitrator in atomic negotiations with iran , and not least as a reliable energy route for the west .
questioning whether turkey belongs in the european or the oriental camp is easy to understand - but its not justifiable .
since its founding nearly nine decades ago , the modern turkish republic has decided in favor of europe , and therefore , in favor of the west .
despite this , ankara ca n't look forward to being greeted with open arms in its efforts to join the european union - nor does the islamic world celebrate turkey 's western orientation .
its dialog with hamas as an unspoken condition for a dialog with iran , and its over-eager actions toward reprimanding israel , have led to a great deal of resentment in europe and the us - and at the same time , done serious damage to its relations with the jewish state .
two sides of a coin purely in terms of numbers , turkey has what it takes to back up its ambitions of strength .
the country has seen nearly 12 percent economic growth in the first quarter of the year , along with being the 16th-strongest economy in the world , and the 7th in europe .
but that is just one side of the coin .
on the other side is the growing polarization between the religious and the secular in a turkey whose population has yet to taste many of the fruits of economic growth .
the continuous lack of democratic process , the weak grasp of the concept of press freedom in a gray zone , or the unwillingness of prime minsiter erdogan to deal with criticism of either himself or his policies , are all alarming threats to domestic stability .
turkey belongs in europe !
europe and turkey need one another like never before .
turkey needs europe in order to build itself up as a regional power and to give it more weight in its influence on its neighbors .
for its part , without turkey , europe reduces its chances of succeeding in its global goals and strategies .
europe 's unified rejection of turkey needs to give way .
instead of explaining why turkey should n't accede to the eu , the heads of the european states should be racking their brains about how to make accession happen - or at least how to begin the process , since full membership is unlikely in the near future .
meanwhile , turkey is right to intensively build up its status as a regional power , instead of trying at all cost to become a member of a weaker , crisis-plagued eu .

two turkish newspapers had quoted davutoglu as saying ties with israel would be severed unless turkey received an apology for the flotilla raid or israel accepted the outcome of an independent inquiry into the incident .
in response to davutoglu 's alleged remarks , israeli foreign minister avigdor lieberman said during a trip to latvia that israel did n't " have any intention to apologize . "
later on monday , however , a spokesman for the turkish government told the reuters news agency that davutoglu had been misquoted in the newspaper reports .
the official claimed that davutoglu actually said that relations with israel would not improve if an apology was not issued .
the two countries have been on bad terms since the may 31 raid on a gaza-bound aid flotilla .
nine turkish nationals died after israeli military personnel boarded one of the ships . each side subsequently blamed the other for starting the violent confrontation .

now , the federal chamber of german architects -lrb- bak -rrb- has started a debate about the building 's future . the german pavilion building - situated in the southern part of venice 's giardini park , where the biennale is held - is not particularly inviting .
the entry is large , with four imposing pillars supporting a heavy-looking roof .
the room inside has windows high above the ground , not offering any views of the surrounding area . ' unsuitable for art ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biennale takes places in venice 's giardini arno sighard schmid , president of the federal chamber of german architects , does not think that the temple-like nazi-era building represents modern germany .
he wants to see it torn down , saying that it is " neither suitable for art , nor for architecture " and has " no connection to the venetian skyline . " instead , he finds that it reflects the character of the nazi era , which brings an emotional aspect into the debate . the german pavilion was first erected in 1909 as the bavarian pavilion , based on the designs of a venetian architect .
with its ionic-style columns , it bore a resemblance to an ancient temple .
in 1938 , it was altered to reflect the nazi regime 's aesthetic ideals . then , in 1993 , german conceptual artist hans haacke smashed the travertine floor of the pavilion 's hall , where hitler and mussolini had once stood , leaving the fragments lying on the ground .
he called the work " failed hope . " a place for expression but according to susanne gaensheimer , director of the frankfurt museum for modern art and curator of the 2011 art biennale - the building is suitable for showcasing contemporary art , though it does represent a challenge for the artists . " there are many examples of exhibition halls with ideological or ideology-related architecture that show that this very confrontation with architecture has led to fantastic projects and artworks , " said gaensheimer .
" you need to differentiate between the outer architecture and what happens on the inside . " fantastic works of art have been presented in the german pavilion , she added - " and that is what represents this country . " bildunterschrift : in 2006 , the german curator team highlighted the most attractive aspect of the pavilion : the roof one example was the german presentation at the 2006 architecture biennale , which was titled " convertible city . "
the team of curators , from the architecture firm gruentuch ernst , positioned a bright red staircase through the window on the side of the pavilion , which allowed visitors to climb up onto the roof .
from there , they had a magnificent view of venice . the project was a good idea , conceded arno sighard schmid , but not one that can be repeated over and over . constructing the staircase " was a difficult undertaking , but showed that the roof offers such wonderful possibilities , " said schmid .
" and that 's the reason i 've proposed that our current democratic republic should present itself abroad in other ways than what this pavilion allows . " ' history ca n't be erased ' however , the curator for next year 's art biennale , susanne gaensheimer , maintains that history ca n't just be torn down .

speaking a day after scoring a brace in germany 's 4-0 demolition of argentina in the quarters , klose said he had his eyes on becoming the all-time world cup top scorer .
" i want to score at least five goals at the world cup .
and i will be very satisfied if i score six , " klose told a news conference .
the 32-year-old scored five goals in world cups in 2002 and 2006 and has so far netted four times in the 2010 tournament .
that puts him one goal behind record scorer ronaldo of brazil , who netted 15 world cup goals between 1998 and 2006 .
measured , yet confident klose said that his team would n't get carried away after several resounding victories throughout the competition , including a 4-1 win over england and a 4-0 thumping of australia .
" spain is better than england and argentina , no question .
they are not unbeatable , and we will try to expose their weaknesses ...
we are better than 2008 and want to show that on the pitch , " said klose .
the germans will line up against spain without young forward thomas mueller , whose red-hot form has been one of the pillars of germany 's effectiveness .
the 20-year-old was given a yellow card in the win against argentina and will miss the semifinal clash .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller has been a revelation this world cup germany coach joachim loew sought to downplay worries over having to rejig his lineup , insisting he had enough talent at his disposal to cover the loss of mueller .
" it 's clear it 's a blow for us - he has shown himself to be dangerous in front of goal .
but we have players who can replace him , " loew said .
possible replacements for mueller include hamburg attacking midfielder piotr trochowski and young bayern attacker toni kroos , both of whom have been given game time in south africa .
stuttgart-based striker cacau is also an option , but rumors still persist about an abdominal muscle strain that kept him out of the quarterfinals .

is it a hindrance to artists that should be demolished , or a piece of history that should be preserved ? in a few weeks , people from around the world will flock to venice for the 12th venice biennale of architecture , which showcases new projects by big-name architects and designers . altogether , 28 national pavilions will be open to visitors , including the controversial german pavilion , which is a prime example of nazi architecture .
now , the federal chamber of german architects -lrb- bak -rrb- has started a debate about the building 's future . the german pavilion building - situated in the southern part of venice 's giardini park , where the biennale is held - is not particularly inviting .
the entry is large , with four imposing pillars supporting a heavy-looking roof .
the room inside has windows high above the ground , not offering any views of the surrounding area . ' unsuitable for art ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biennale takes places in venice 's giardini arno sighard schmid , president of the federal chamber of german architects , does not think that the temple-like nazi-era building represents modern germany .
he wants to see it torn down , saying that it is " neither suitable for art , nor for architecture " and has " no connection to the venetian skyline . " instead , he finds that it reflects the character of the nazi era , which brings an emotional aspect into the debate . the german pavilion was first erected in 1909 as the bavarian pavilion , based on the designs of a venetian architect .
with its ionic-style columns , it bore a resemblance to an ancient temple .
in 1938 , it was altered to reflect the nazi regime 's aesthetic ideals . then , in 1993 , german conceptual artist hans haacke smashed the travertine floor of the pavilion 's hall , where hitler and mussolini had once stood , leaving the fragments lying on the ground .
he called the work " failed hope . " a place for expression but according to susanne gaensheimer , director of the frankfurt museum for modern art and curator of the 2011 art biennale - the building is suitable for showcasing contemporary art , though it does represent a challenge for the artists . " there are many examples of exhibition halls with ideological or ideology-related architecture that show that this very confrontation with architecture has led to fantastic projects and artworks , " said gaensheimer .
" you need to differentiate between the outer architecture and what happens on the inside . " fantastic works of art have been presented in the german pavilion , she added - " and that is what represents this country . " bildunterschrift : in 2006 , the german curator team highlighted the most attractive aspect of the pavilion : the roof one example was the german presentation at the 2006 architecture biennale , which was titled " convertible city . "
the team of curators , from the architecture firm gruentuch ernst , positioned a bright red staircase through the window on the side of the pavilion , which allowed visitors to climb up onto the roof .
from there , they had a magnificent view of venice . the project was a good idea , conceded arno sighard schmid , but not one that can be repeated over and over . constructing the staircase " was a difficult undertaking , but showed that the roof offers such wonderful possibilities , " said schmid .
" and that 's the reason i 've proposed that our current democratic republic should present itself abroad in other ways than what this pavilion allows . " ' history ca n't be erased ' however , the curator for next year 's art biennale , susanne gaensheimer , maintains that history ca n't just be torn down .

speaking a day after scoring a brace in germany 's 4-0 demolition of argentina in the quarters , klose said he had his eyes on becoming the all-time world cup top scorer .
" i want to score at least five goals at the world cup .
and i will be very satisfied if i score six , " klose told a news conference .
the 32-year-old scored five goals in world cups in 2002 and 2006 and has so far netted four times in the 2010 tournament .
that puts him one goal behind record scorer ronaldo of brazil , who netted 15 world cup goals between 1998 and 2006 .
measured , yet confident klose said that his team would n't get carried away after several resounding victories throughout the competition , including a 4-1 win over england and a 4-0 thumping of australia .
" spain is better than england and argentina , no question .
they are not unbeatable , and we will try to expose their weaknesses ...
we are better than 2008 and want to show that on the pitch , " said klose .
the germans will line up against spain without young forward thomas mueller , whose red-hot form has been one of the pillars of germany 's effectiveness .
the 20-year-old was given a yellow card in the win against argentina and will miss the semifinal clash .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller has been a revelation this world cup germany coach joachim loew sought to downplay worries over having to rejig his lineup , insisting he had enough talent at his disposal to cover the loss of mueller .
" it 's clear it 's a blow for us - he has shown himself to be dangerous in front of goal .
but we have players who can replace him , " loew said .
possible replacements for mueller include hamburg attacking midfielder piotr trochowski and young bayern attacker toni kroos , both of whom have been given game time in south africa .
stuttgart-based striker cacau is also an option , but rumors still persist about an abdominal muscle strain that kept him out of the quarterfinals .

defense analysts suggest the region is still a major concern . if the german defense ministry is to be believed , the terrorist threat in the sea off the horn of africa has been reduced so significantly that it sees no further reason to deploy its force of 90 marines and a navy reconnaissance plane as part of the us-led operation enduring freedom .
due to an assessment that claims that the threat is now ' limited , ' germany has ended its involvement six months earlier than its mandate stipulated .
germany has been involved in the operation enduring freedom as part of the mission aimed at stopping islamic terrorists smuggling arms to groups in africa from the arabian peninsula for over eight years .
the german navy joined the task force in february 2002 , some five months after the united states established the operation after the 9/11 attacks on new york and washington .
with the last german troops completing their tours of duty in the gulf of aden and the indian ocean last week , germany 's naval focus now shifts to the mediterranean .
one german navy frigate will remain off the coast of africa as part of operation atalanta , a european union mission to protect aid shipments into somalia from pirate attack .
however , with increased al qaeda activity being reported across the gulf of aden in yemen , affiliated islamist groups continuing to battle for control of somalia and reports that osama bin laden 's terror network is extending its influence into kenya , the german decision has caused some surprise among security analysts .
somalia at the heart of region 's spreading extremism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al shabab is fighting to install an islamic caliphate in somalia " the terrorist threat emanating from the horn of africa is limited at the moment , " jeremy binnie , a terrorism expert at jane 's defence group , told deutsche welle .
" however , there is a lot of concern that somalia might turn into something akin to taliban-controlled afghanistan in the 1990s .
the pro-al qaeda group there , the shabab , controls much of the south of the country and is currently threatening to overrun mogadishu .
the only thing stopping them is a small force of african peacekeepers .
so there are worries that southern somalia could become a safe haven for jihadists from other countries and a base for training . "
" there are already indications that the shabab is being supported by a small number of foreign jihadists and has recruited possibly hundreds of young men from europe and north america , most of them somalis , " binnie added .
" there have also been a few reports of yemen-based al qaeda operatives turning up in somalia .
the worry is that these guys could be used to carry out international terrorist attacks . "
" at the same time , there are worries about the geographical proximity between somalia and yemen , meaning it is possible that the shabab will link up with bin laden 's yemeni branch , al qaeda on the arabian peninsula . "
yemen supply lines still bringing arms , personnel to africa last year 's failed bombing of a detroit-bound airliner by an al qaeda suspect with links to yemen highlighted the country 's growing reputation as the new hub for terrorism in the region .
yemen is a blueprint nation for radical islamists ; it has a weak government , it is deeply divided by a tribalistic and violent civil war which is pushing the country toward the status of a failed state and has a culture in which most men carry weapons , therefore making identifying terrorists extremely difficult .
the land of osama bin laden 's ancestors has also become a melting pot of refugees from the conflict in somalia and returning jihadists from the wars in afghanistan and iraq .
with africa in its sights , it is thought that al qaeda sees yemen as an ideal staging point for fanning the flames of extremism across the gulf of aden in somalia and beyond .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda has targeted kenya since the us embassy attack despite having a less direct shipping connection to yemen than somalia , sharing a border with the failed state puts kenya at risk of infiltration by islamist terror groups .
instead of having to navigate through the international forces in indian ocean to reach the kenyan coastline , arab-based terrorists can smuggle weapons and personnel overland to kenya via somalia .
it has been reported for as long as germany was part of operation enduring freedom that al qaeda was seeking a foothold in kenya and that al qaeda operatives had infiltrated the country 's islamic communities on its indian ocean coast .
poor relations between kenya 's coastal muslims and the country 's inefficient security forces have provided al qaeda with a new base from which it can extend its growing network throughout eastern africa .
inland in kenya , border camps filled with refugees from somalia are reported to be just as fertile a breeding ground for young extremists .
meanwhile , kenya has its own home grown terror problem .
the kenyan saleh ali saleh nabhan was alleged to have been the leader of al qaeda in somalia and the mastermind behind the bombing of the paradise hotel in mombasa and the attempted downing of an israeli passenger jet in november 2002 .
he was also suspected of involvement in the 1998 us embassy bombings in nairobi and dar es salaam in tanzania .
he was killed by us special forces near mogadishu in september 2009 .
changing face of mission shifts threat focus david hartwell , an expert and risk analyst for the middle east and north africa , believes that the changing nature of operation enduring freedom has shifted the focus away from its original mission meaning that the horn of africa and land-based threats are now longer in its remit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops will leave but the threat will remain " the germans have made a fair assessment on enduring freedom but it 's one based on the level of threat within the operation 's initial mission which was to capture fleeing extremists and taliban from afghanistan and stop them getting to places like yemen , saudi arabia and oman , " hartwell told deutsche welle . " in its original form , it has n't recorded that many successes as there have been few significant arrests of wanted figures on the seas .
as such , enduring freedom has mutated into the anti-piracy mission which is having more success in containing the pirates .
but it has been agreed that there is less of a need for naval forces to be searching for fleeing extremists now , especially in the gulf of aden and indian ocean . " " the region itself is still unstable with civil wars and extremism in both somalia and yemen but those involved in enduring freedom are wary of getting involved in the internal politics in these countries so we 'll see more countries following germany 's decision and refocusing on the piracy mission , " he added . author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

defense analysts suggest the region is still a major concern . if the german defense ministry is to be believed , the terrorist threat in the sea off the horn of africa has been reduced so significantly that it sees no further reason to deploy its force of 90 marines and a navy reconnaissance plane as part of the us-led operation enduring freedom .
due to an assessment that claims that the threat is now ' limited , ' germany has ended its involvement six months earlier than its mandate stipulated .
germany has been involved in the operation enduring freedom as part of the mission aimed at stopping islamic terrorists smuggling arms to groups in africa from the arabian peninsula for over eight years .
the german navy joined the task force in february 2002 , some five months after the united states established the operation after the 9/11 attacks on new york and washington .
with the last german troops completing their tours of duty in the gulf of aden and the indian ocean last week , germany 's naval focus now shifts to the mediterranean .
one german navy frigate will remain off the coast of africa as part of operation atalanta , a european union mission to protect aid shipments into somalia from pirate attack .
however , with increased al qaeda activity being reported across the gulf of aden in yemen , affiliated islamist groups continuing to battle for control of somalia and reports that osama bin laden 's terror network is extending its influence into kenya , the german decision has caused some surprise among security analysts .
somalia at the heart of region 's spreading extremism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al shabab is fighting to install an islamic caliphate in somalia " the terrorist threat emanating from the horn of africa is limited at the moment , " jeremy binnie , a terrorism expert at jane 's defence group , told deutsche welle .
" however , there is a lot of concern that somalia might turn into something akin to taliban-controlled afghanistan in the 1990s .
the pro-al qaeda group there , the shabab , controls much of the south of the country and is currently threatening to overrun mogadishu .
the only thing stopping them is a small force of african peacekeepers .
so there are worries that southern somalia could become a safe haven for jihadists from other countries and a base for training . "
" there are already indications that the shabab is being supported by a small number of foreign jihadists and has recruited possibly hundreds of young men from europe and north america , most of them somalis , " binnie added .
" there have also been a few reports of yemen-based al qaeda operatives turning up in somalia .
the worry is that these guys could be used to carry out international terrorist attacks . "
" at the same time , there are worries about the geographical proximity between somalia and yemen , meaning it is possible that the shabab will link up with bin laden 's yemeni branch , al qaeda on the arabian peninsula . "
yemen supply lines still bringing arms , personnel to africa last year 's failed bombing of a detroit-bound airliner by an al qaeda suspect with links to yemen highlighted the country 's growing reputation as the new hub for terrorism in the region .
yemen is a blueprint nation for radical islamists ; it has a weak government , it is deeply divided by a tribalistic and violent civil war which is pushing the country toward the status of a failed state and has a culture in which most men carry weapons , therefore making identifying terrorists extremely difficult .
the land of osama bin laden 's ancestors has also become a melting pot of refugees from the conflict in somalia and returning jihadists from the wars in afghanistan and iraq .
with africa in its sights , it is thought that al qaeda sees yemen as an ideal staging point for fanning the flames of extremism across the gulf of aden in somalia and beyond .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda has targeted kenya since the us embassy attack despite having a less direct shipping connection to yemen than somalia , sharing a border with the failed state puts kenya at risk of infiltration by islamist terror groups .
instead of having to navigate through the international forces in indian ocean to reach the kenyan coastline , arab-based terrorists can smuggle weapons and personnel overland to kenya via somalia .
it has been reported for as long as germany was part of operation enduring freedom that al qaeda was seeking a foothold in kenya and that al qaeda operatives had infiltrated the country 's islamic communities on its indian ocean coast .
poor relations between kenya 's coastal muslims and the country 's inefficient security forces have provided al qaeda with a new base from which it can extend its growing network throughout eastern africa .
inland in kenya , border camps filled with refugees from somalia are reported to be just as fertile a breeding ground for young extremists .
meanwhile , kenya has its own home grown terror problem .
the kenyan saleh ali saleh nabhan was alleged to have been the leader of al qaeda in somalia and the mastermind behind the bombing of the paradise hotel in mombasa and the attempted downing of an israeli passenger jet in november 2002 .
he was also suspected of involvement in the 1998 us embassy bombings in nairobi and dar es salaam in tanzania .
he was killed by us special forces near mogadishu in september 2009 .
changing face of mission shifts threat focus david hartwell , an expert and risk analyst for the middle east and north africa , believes that the changing nature of operation enduring freedom has shifted the focus away from its original mission meaning that the horn of africa and land-based threats are now longer in its remit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops will leave but the threat will remain " the germans have made a fair assessment on enduring freedom but it 's one based on the level of threat within the operation 's initial mission which was to capture fleeing extremists and taliban from afghanistan and stop them getting to places like yemen , saudi arabia and oman , " hartwell told deutsche welle . " in its original form , it has n't recorded that many successes as there have been few significant arrests of wanted figures on the seas .
as such , enduring freedom has mutated into the anti-piracy mission which is having more success in containing the pirates .
but it has been agreed that there is less of a need for naval forces to be searching for fleeing extremists now , especially in the gulf of aden and indian ocean . " " the region itself is still unstable with civil wars and extremism in both somalia and yemen but those involved in enduring freedom are wary of getting involved in the internal politics in these countries so we 'll see more countries following germany 's decision and refocusing on the piracy mission , " he added . author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

speaking a day after scoring a brace in germany 's 4-0 demolition of argentina in the quarters , klose said he had his eyes on becoming the all-time world cup top scorer .
" i want to score at least five goals at the world cup .
and i will be very satisfied if i score six , " klose told a news conference .
the 32-year-old scored five goals in world cups in 2002 and 2006 and has so far netted four times in the 2010 tournament .
that puts him one goal behind record scorer ronaldo of brazil , who netted 15 world cup goals between 1998 and 2006 .
measured , yet confident klose said that his team would n't get carried away after several resounding victories throughout the competition , including a 4-1 win over england and a 4-0 thumping of australia .
" spain is better than england and argentina , no question .
they are not unbeatable , and we will try to expose their weaknesses ...
we are better than 2008 and want to show that on the pitch , " said klose .
the germans will line up against spain without young forward thomas mueller , whose red-hot form has been one of the pillars of germany 's effectiveness .
the 20-year-old was given a yellow card in the win against argentina and will miss the semifinal clash .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller has been a revelation this world cup germany coach joachim loew sought to downplay worries over having to rejig his lineup , insisting he had enough talent at his disposal to cover the loss of mueller .
" it 's clear it 's a blow for us - he has shown himself to be dangerous in front of goal .
but we have players who can replace him , " loew said .
possible replacements for mueller include hamburg attacking midfielder piotr trochowski and young bayern attacker toni kroos , both of whom have been given game time in south africa .
stuttgart-based striker cacau is also an option , but rumors still persist about an abdominal muscle strain that kept him out of the quarterfinals .

is it a hindrance to artists that should be demolished , or a piece of history that should be preserved ? in a few weeks , people from around the world will flock to venice for the 12th venice biennale of architecture , which showcases new projects by big-name architects and designers . altogether , 28 national pavilions will be open to visitors , including the controversial german pavilion , which is a prime example of nazi architecture .
now , the federal chamber of german architects -lrb- bak -rrb- has started a debate about the building 's future . the german pavilion building - situated in the southern part of venice 's giardini park , where the biennale is held - is not particularly inviting .
the entry is large , with four imposing pillars supporting a heavy-looking roof .
the room inside has windows high above the ground , not offering any views of the surrounding area . ' unsuitable for art ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biennale takes places in venice 's giardini arno sighard schmid , president of the federal chamber of german architects , does not think that the temple-like nazi-era building represents modern germany .
he wants to see it torn down , saying that it is " neither suitable for art , nor for architecture " and has " no connection to the venetian skyline . " instead , he finds that it reflects the character of the nazi era , which brings an emotional aspect into the debate . the german pavilion was first erected in 1909 as the bavarian pavilion , based on the designs of a venetian architect .
with its ionic-style columns , it bore a resemblance to an ancient temple .
in 1938 , it was altered to reflect the nazi regime 's aesthetic ideals . then , in 1993 , german conceptual artist hans haacke smashed the travertine floor of the pavilion 's hall , where hitler and mussolini had once stood , leaving the fragments lying on the ground .
he called the work " failed hope . " a place for expression but according to susanne gaensheimer , director of the frankfurt museum for modern art and curator of the 2011 art biennale - the building is suitable for showcasing contemporary art , though it does represent a challenge for the artists . " there are many examples of exhibition halls with ideological or ideology-related architecture that show that this very confrontation with architecture has led to fantastic projects and artworks , " said gaensheimer .
" you need to differentiate between the outer architecture and what happens on the inside . " fantastic works of art have been presented in the german pavilion , she added - " and that is what represents this country . " bildunterschrift : in 2006 , the german curator team highlighted the most attractive aspect of the pavilion : the roof one example was the german presentation at the 2006 architecture biennale , which was titled " convertible city . "
the team of curators , from the architecture firm gruentuch ernst , positioned a bright red staircase through the window on the side of the pavilion , which allowed visitors to climb up onto the roof .
from there , they had a magnificent view of venice . the project was a good idea , conceded arno sighard schmid , but not one that can be repeated over and over . constructing the staircase " was a difficult undertaking , but showed that the roof offers such wonderful possibilities , " said schmid .
" and that 's the reason i 've proposed that our current democratic republic should present itself abroad in other ways than what this pavilion allows . " ' history ca n't be erased ' however , the curator for next year 's art biennale , susanne gaensheimer , maintains that history ca n't just be torn down . " demolishing architecture does n't mean that you can change history , " said gaensheimer .

however , he has been quoted as saying that he wished the german pavilion could be erased with a mouse-click . gaensheimer does not interpret this to mean that schlingensief favors the destruction of the building .

komorowski beat jaroslaw kaczynski by a margin of seven percent of the vote . liberal parliamentary speaker and acting president bronislaw komorowski has won poland 's presidential run-off election . with all votes counted , komorowski earned 53 percent of the vote , while his opponent , nationalist opposition leader jaroslaw kaczynski , gained 47 percent of the votes , according to the election commission . jaroslaw is the twin brother of former president lech kaczynski , who died in a plane crash on april 10 .
the election was triggered by the former leader 's sudden death , along with his wife and 95 others , in the crash . sunday 's election followed a first round of voting on june 20 , in which neither candidate secured a majority . ' good for poland ' on hearing early results , a beaming komorowski said that polish democracy had emerged the winner . " today democracy has won , our polish democracy , " komorowski said before a crowd of cheering supporters , adding that it was " important not to foment divisions , but to build a sense of unity . " kaczynski admitted defeat shortly after komorowski 's speech . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski has performed better than expected " i congratulate the winner .
i congratulate bronislaw komorowski , " kaczynski said from his campaign headquarters . german foreign minister guido westerwelle also offered his congratulations , describing the result as a step in the right direction for closer cooperation between poland and europe . " the polish people 's decision to elect komorowski is a strong pro-european signal , " westerwelle said in berlin .
" with president komorowski , as well as prime minister donald tusk and foreign minister radoslaw sikorski , we will have a strong partner for our path of trust and cooperation . " high turnout prior to the run-off election there were growing fears that the start of summer holidays in poland would make voters prefer baltic beaches to polling stations , though this did not materialize . at 52 percent , turnout was much higher than expected .
analysts said it was a clear sign of the mobilization of the two electorates : the traditional , conservative , euroskeptic and mostly rural supporters of kaczynski , and the more reform-minded , pro-european urban voters .
that division was apparent in a sampling of views among voters in warsaw . " we just need to stop kaczynski from winning .
he 's stuck in the past and he 's bad for poland 's position in the eu , " a young businessman told deutsche welle at a polling station in the leafy middle class warsaw suburb of jozefoslaw . " komorowski , together with the reformist prime minister , donald tusk , will lead us deeper into europe . "
however , a retired teacher offered this opinion of komorowski as she cast her ballot : " -lsb- he -rsb- represents those smug businesspeople who have been allowed to thrive at the expense of us pensioners .

both men argue that poland needs economic liberalization to maintain economic growth - the country was the only eu member to avoid recession last year , although growth slowed to 1.8 percent from 5 percent in 2008 . ahead of the run-off vote , kaczynski accused them both of plotting to privatize national health care and sell the country out to foreign investors at the expense of the poor .
komorowski has however insisted that european integration was his highest priority . " the number one issue is poland 's eu membership , strengthening its position there , developing the weimar triangle relationship with germany and france and building reconciliation with russia , " he said in a televised debate . " it is also in poland 's interests to serve as a champion of european integration with countries further east . " euroskeptic and nationalist kaczynski took a more nationalist tone .

" foreign policy , which should clearly be the domain of the polish president , requires that the principle of sovereignty should be clearly adhered to , which does n't always happen under the present government . " critics say his unabashed euroskepticism , which he championed during his term as prime minister from 2006 to 2007 , alienated poland 's neighbors .
he said he currently has no interest in adopting the euro , pointing out that the free-floating zloty has helped poland ride out the economic crisis .

komorowski beat jaroslaw kaczynski by a margin of seven percent of the vote . liberal parliamentary speaker and acting president bronislaw komorowski has won poland 's presidential run-off election . with all votes counted , komorowski earned 53 percent of the vote , while his opponent , nationalist opposition leader jaroslaw kaczynski , gained 47 percent of the votes , according to the election commission . jaroslaw is the twin brother of former president lech kaczynski , who died in a plane crash on april 10 .
the election was triggered by the former leader 's sudden death , along with his wife and 95 others , in the crash . sunday 's election followed a first round of voting on june 20 , in which neither candidate secured a majority . ' good for poland ' on hearing early results , a beaming komorowski said that polish democracy had emerged the winner . " today democracy has won , our polish democracy , " komorowski said before a crowd of cheering supporters , adding that it was " important not to foment divisions , but to build a sense of unity . " kaczynski admitted defeat shortly after komorowski 's speech . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski has performed better than expected " i congratulate the winner .
i congratulate bronislaw komorowski , " kaczynski said from his campaign headquarters . german foreign minister guido westerwelle also offered his congratulations , describing the result as a step in the right direction for closer cooperation between poland and europe . " the polish people 's decision to elect komorowski is a strong pro-european signal , " westerwelle said in berlin .
" with president komorowski , as well as prime minister donald tusk and foreign minister radoslaw sikorski , we will have a strong partner for our path of trust and cooperation . " high turnout prior to the run-off election there were growing fears that the start of summer holidays in poland would make voters prefer baltic beaches to polling stations , though this did not materialize . at 52 percent , turnout was much higher than expected .
analysts said it was a clear sign of the mobilization of the two electorates : the traditional , conservative , euroskeptic and mostly rural supporters of kaczynski , and the more reform-minded , pro-european urban voters .
that division was apparent in a sampling of views among voters in warsaw . " we just need to stop kaczynski from winning .
he 's stuck in the past and he 's bad for poland 's position in the eu , " a young businessman told deutsche welle at a polling station in the leafy middle class warsaw suburb of jozefoslaw . " komorowski , together with the reformist prime minister , donald tusk , will lead us deeper into europe . "
however , a retired teacher offered this opinion of komorowski as she cast her ballot : " -lsb- he -rsb- represents those smug businesspeople who have been allowed to thrive at the expense of us pensioners .
i 'm voting for kaczynski , because he cares for people like me .
he 's a patriot who holds national values dear . ” european integration versus national values bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : komorowski insists poland must be closer to germany and france komorowski is a close ally of the prime minister .
both men argue that poland needs economic liberalization to maintain economic growth - the country was the only eu member to avoid recession last year , although growth slowed to 1.8 percent from 5 percent in 2008 . ahead of the run-off vote , kaczynski accused them both of plotting to privatize national health care and sell the country out to foreign investors at the expense of the poor .
komorowski has however insisted that european integration was his highest priority . " the number one issue is poland 's eu membership , strengthening its position there , developing the weimar triangle relationship with germany and france and building reconciliation with russia , " he said in a televised debate . " it is also in poland 's interests to serve as a champion of european integration with countries further east . " euroskeptic and nationalist kaczynski took a more nationalist tone .
while giving few specifics on foreign policy , he clearly stated his plans to carry on his late brother 's policies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : komorowski has secured the presidency " i wo n't let poland be treated as a minor partner by any other country in europe , " he said in the debate .
" foreign policy , which should clearly be the domain of the polish president , requires that the principle of sovereignty should be clearly adhered to , which does n't always happen under the present government . " critics say his unabashed euroskepticism , which he championed during his term as prime minister from 2006 to 2007 , alienated poland 's neighbors .

is it a hindrance to artists that should be demolished , or a piece of history that should be preserved ? in a few weeks , people from around the world will flock to venice for the 12th venice biennale of architecture , which showcases new projects by big-name architects and designers . altogether , 28 national pavilions will be open to visitors , including the controversial german pavilion , which is a prime example of nazi architecture .
now , the federal chamber of german architects -lrb- bak -rrb- has started a debate about the building 's future . the german pavilion building - situated in the southern part of venice 's giardini park , where the biennale is held - is not particularly inviting .
the entry is large , with four imposing pillars supporting a heavy-looking roof .
the room inside has windows high above the ground , not offering any views of the surrounding area .

komorowski beat jaroslaw kaczynski by a margin of seven percent of the vote . liberal parliamentary speaker and acting president bronislaw komorowski has won poland 's presidential run-off election . with all votes counted , komorowski earned 53 percent of the vote , while his opponent , nationalist opposition leader jaroslaw kaczynski , gained 47 percent of the votes , according to the election commission . jaroslaw is the twin brother of former president lech kaczynski , who died in a plane crash on april 10 .
the election was triggered by the former leader 's sudden death , along with his wife and 95 others , in the crash . sunday 's election followed a first round of voting on june 20 , in which neither candidate secured a majority . ' good for poland ' on hearing early results , a beaming komorowski said that polish democracy had emerged the winner . " today democracy has won , our polish democracy , " komorowski said before a crowd of cheering supporters , adding that it was " important not to foment divisions , but to build a sense of unity . " kaczynski admitted defeat shortly after komorowski 's speech . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski has performed better than expected " i congratulate the winner .
i congratulate bronislaw komorowski , " kaczynski said from his campaign headquarters . german foreign minister guido westerwelle also offered his congratulations , describing the result as a step in the right direction for closer cooperation between poland and europe . " the polish people 's decision to elect komorowski is a strong pro-european signal , " westerwelle said in berlin .
" with president komorowski , as well as prime minister donald tusk and foreign minister radoslaw sikorski , we will have a strong partner for our path of trust and cooperation . " high turnout prior to the run-off election there were growing fears that the start of summer holidays in poland would make voters prefer baltic beaches to polling stations , though this did not materialize . at 52 percent , turnout was much higher than expected .
analysts said it was a clear sign of the mobilization of the two electorates : the traditional , conservative , euroskeptic and mostly rural supporters of kaczynski , and the more reform-minded , pro-european urban voters .
that division was apparent in a sampling of views among voters in warsaw . " we just need to stop kaczynski from winning .
he 's stuck in the past and he 's bad for poland 's position in the eu , " a young businessman told deutsche welle at a polling station in the leafy middle class warsaw suburb of jozefoslaw . " komorowski , together with the reformist prime minister , donald tusk , will lead us deeper into europe . "
however , a retired teacher offered this opinion of komorowski as she cast her ballot : " -lsb- he -rsb- represents those smug businesspeople who have been allowed to thrive at the expense of us pensioners .
i 'm voting for kaczynski , because he cares for people like me .
he 's a patriot who holds national values dear . ” european integration versus national values bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : komorowski insists poland must be closer to germany and france komorowski is a close ally of the prime minister .
both men argue that poland needs economic liberalization to maintain economic growth - the country was the only eu member to avoid recession last year , although growth slowed to 1.8 percent from 5 percent in 2008 . ahead of the run-off vote , kaczynski accused them both of plotting to privatize national health care and sell the country out to foreign investors at the expense of the poor .
komorowski has however insisted that european integration was his highest priority . " the number one issue is poland 's eu membership , strengthening its position there , developing the weimar triangle relationship with germany and france and building reconciliation with russia , " he said in a televised debate . " it is also in poland 's interests to serve as a champion of european integration with countries further east . " euroskeptic and nationalist kaczynski took a more nationalist tone .
while giving few specifics on foreign policy , he clearly stated his plans to carry on his late brother 's policies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : komorowski has secured the presidency " i wo n't let poland be treated as a minor partner by any other country in europe , " he said in the debate .
" foreign policy , which should clearly be the domain of the polish president , requires that the principle of sovereignty should be clearly adhered to , which does n't always happen under the present government . " critics say his unabashed euroskepticism , which he championed during his term as prime minister from 2006 to 2007 , alienated poland 's neighbors .
he said he currently has no interest in adopting the euro , pointing out that the free-floating zloty has helped poland ride out the economic crisis . " if we had pushed for the euro as the government wanted , we would today be in an economic catastrophe , " he said . author : david levitz / rafal kiepuszewski -lrb- reuters , afp , ap -rrb- editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" foreign policy , which should clearly be the domain of the polish president , requires that the principle of sovereignty should be clearly adhered to , which does n't always happen under the present government . " critics say his unabashed euroskepticism , which he championed during his term as prime minister from 2006 to 2007 , alienated poland 's neighbors .
he said he currently has no interest in adopting the euro , pointing out that the free-floating zloty has helped poland ride out the economic crisis . " if we had pushed for the euro as the government wanted , we would today be in an economic catastrophe , " he said . author : david levitz / rafal kiepuszewski -lrb- reuters , afp , ap -rrb- editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

defense analysts suggest the region is still a major concern . if the german defense ministry is to be believed , the terrorist threat in the sea off the horn of africa has been reduced so significantly that it sees no further reason to deploy its force of 90 marines and a navy reconnaissance plane as part of the us-led operation enduring freedom .
due to an assessment that claims that the threat is now ' limited , ' germany has ended its involvement six months earlier than its mandate stipulated .
germany has been involved in the operation enduring freedom as part of the mission aimed at stopping islamic terrorists smuggling arms to groups in africa from the arabian peninsula for over eight years .
the german navy joined the task force in february 2002 , some five months after the united states established the operation after the 9/11 attacks on new york and washington .
with the last german troops completing their tours of duty in the gulf of aden and the indian ocean last week , germany 's naval focus now shifts to the mediterranean .
one german navy frigate will remain off the coast of africa as part of operation atalanta , a european union mission to protect aid shipments into somalia from pirate attack .
however , with increased al qaeda activity being reported across the gulf of aden in yemen , affiliated islamist groups continuing to battle for control of somalia and reports that osama bin laden 's terror network is extending its influence into kenya , the german decision has caused some surprise among security analysts .
somalia at the heart of region 's spreading extremism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al shabab is fighting to install an islamic caliphate in somalia " the terrorist threat emanating from the horn of africa is limited at the moment , " jeremy binnie , a terrorism expert at jane 's defence group , told deutsche welle .
" however , there is a lot of concern that somalia might turn into something akin to taliban-controlled afghanistan in the 1990s .
the pro-al qaeda group there , the shabab , controls much of the south of the country and is currently threatening to overrun mogadishu .
the only thing stopping them is a small force of african peacekeepers .
so there are worries that southern somalia could become a safe haven for jihadists from other countries and a base for training . "
" there are already indications that the shabab is being supported by a small number of foreign jihadists and has recruited possibly hundreds of young men from europe and north america , most of them somalis , " binnie added .
" there have also been a few reports of yemen-based al qaeda operatives turning up in somalia .
the worry is that these guys could be used to carry out international terrorist attacks . "
" at the same time , there are worries about the geographical proximity between somalia and yemen , meaning it is possible that the shabab will link up with bin laden 's yemeni branch , al qaeda on the arabian peninsula . "
yemen supply lines still bringing arms , personnel to africa last year 's failed bombing of a detroit-bound airliner by an al qaeda suspect with links to yemen highlighted the country 's growing reputation as the new hub for terrorism in the region .
yemen is a blueprint nation for radical islamists ; it has a weak government , it is deeply divided by a tribalistic and violent civil war which is pushing the country toward the status of a failed state and has a culture in which most men carry weapons , therefore making identifying terrorists extremely difficult .
the land of osama bin laden 's ancestors has also become a melting pot of refugees from the conflict in somalia and returning jihadists from the wars in afghanistan and iraq .
with africa in its sights , it is thought that al qaeda sees yemen as an ideal staging point for fanning the flames of extremism across the gulf of aden in somalia and beyond .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda has targeted kenya since the us embassy attack despite having a less direct shipping connection to yemen than somalia , sharing a border with the failed state puts kenya at risk of infiltration by islamist terror groups .
instead of having to navigate through the international forces in indian ocean to reach the kenyan coastline , arab-based terrorists can smuggle weapons and personnel overland to kenya via somalia .
it has been reported for as long as germany was part of operation enduring freedom that al qaeda was seeking a foothold in kenya and that al qaeda operatives had infiltrated the country 's islamic communities on its indian ocean coast .
poor relations between kenya 's coastal muslims and the country 's inefficient security forces have provided al qaeda with a new base from which it can extend its growing network throughout eastern africa .
inland in kenya , border camps filled with refugees from somalia are reported to be just as fertile a breeding ground for young extremists .
meanwhile , kenya has its own home grown terror problem .
the kenyan saleh ali saleh nabhan was alleged to have been the leader of al qaeda in somalia and the mastermind behind the bombing of the paradise hotel in mombasa and the attempted downing of an israeli passenger jet in november 2002 .
he was also suspected of involvement in the 1998 us embassy bombings in nairobi and dar es salaam in tanzania .
he was killed by us special forces near mogadishu in september 2009 .
changing face of mission shifts threat focus david hartwell , an expert and risk analyst for the middle east and north africa , believes that the changing nature of operation enduring freedom has shifted the focus away from its original mission meaning that the horn of africa and land-based threats are now longer in its remit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops will leave but the threat will remain " the germans have made a fair assessment on enduring freedom but it 's one based on the level of threat within the operation 's initial mission which was to capture fleeing extremists and taliban from afghanistan and stop them getting to places like yemen , saudi arabia and oman , " hartwell told deutsche welle . " in its original form , it has n't recorded that many successes as there have been few significant arrests of wanted figures on the seas .
as such , enduring freedom has mutated into the anti-piracy mission which is having more success in containing the pirates .
but it has been agreed that there is less of a need for naval forces to be searching for fleeing extremists now , especially in the gulf of aden and indian ocean . " " the region itself is still unstable with civil wars and extremism in both somalia and yemen but those involved in enduring freedom are wary of getting involved in the internal politics in these countries so we 'll see more countries following germany 's decision and refocusing on the piracy mission , " he added . author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

defense analysts suggest the region is still a major concern . if the german defense ministry is to be believed , the terrorist threat in the sea off the horn of africa has been reduced so significantly that it sees no further reason to deploy its force of 90 marines and a navy reconnaissance plane as part of the us-led operation enduring freedom .
due to an assessment that claims that the threat is now ' limited , ' germany has ended its involvement six months earlier than its mandate stipulated .
germany has been involved in the operation enduring freedom as part of the mission aimed at stopping islamic terrorists smuggling arms to groups in africa from the arabian peninsula for over eight years .
the german navy joined the task force in february 2002 , some five months after the united states established the operation after the 9/11 attacks on new york and washington .
with the last german troops completing their tours of duty in the gulf of aden and the indian ocean last week , germany 's naval focus now shifts to the mediterranean .
one german navy frigate will remain off the coast of africa as part of operation atalanta , a european union mission to protect aid shipments into somalia from pirate attack .
however , with increased al qaeda activity being reported across the gulf of aden in yemen , affiliated islamist groups continuing to battle for control of somalia and reports that osama bin laden 's terror network is extending its influence into kenya , the german decision has caused some surprise among security analysts .
somalia at the heart of region 's spreading extremism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al shabab is fighting to install an islamic caliphate in somalia " the terrorist threat emanating from the horn of africa is limited at the moment , " jeremy binnie , a terrorism expert at jane 's defence group , told deutsche welle .
" however , there is a lot of concern that somalia might turn into something akin to taliban-controlled afghanistan in the 1990s .
the pro-al qaeda group there , the shabab , controls much of the south of the country and is currently threatening to overrun mogadishu .
the only thing stopping them is a small force of african peacekeepers .
so there are worries that southern somalia could become a safe haven for jihadists from other countries and a base for training . "
" there are already indications that the shabab is being supported by a small number of foreign jihadists and has recruited possibly hundreds of young men from europe and north america , most of them somalis , " binnie added .
" there have also been a few reports of yemen-based al qaeda operatives turning up in somalia .
the worry is that these guys could be used to carry out international terrorist attacks . "
" at the same time , there are worries about the geographical proximity between somalia and yemen , meaning it is possible that the shabab will link up with bin laden 's yemeni branch , al qaeda on the arabian peninsula . "
yemen supply lines still bringing arms , personnel to africa last year 's failed bombing of a detroit-bound airliner by an al qaeda suspect with links to yemen highlighted the country 's growing reputation as the new hub for terrorism in the region .
yemen is a blueprint nation for radical islamists ; it has a weak government , it is deeply divided by a tribalistic and violent civil war which is pushing the country toward the status of a failed state and has a culture in which most men carry weapons , therefore making identifying terrorists extremely difficult .
the land of osama bin laden 's ancestors has also become a melting pot of refugees from the conflict in somalia and returning jihadists from the wars in afghanistan and iraq .
with africa in its sights , it is thought that al qaeda sees yemen as an ideal staging point for fanning the flames of extremism across the gulf of aden in somalia and beyond .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda has targeted kenya since the us embassy attack despite having a less direct shipping connection to yemen than somalia , sharing a border with the failed state puts kenya at risk of infiltration by islamist terror groups .
instead of having to navigate through the international forces in indian ocean to reach the kenyan coastline , arab-based terrorists can smuggle weapons and personnel overland to kenya via somalia .
it has been reported for as long as germany was part of operation enduring freedom that al qaeda was seeking a foothold in kenya and that al qaeda operatives had infiltrated the country 's islamic communities on its indian ocean coast .
poor relations between kenya 's coastal muslims and the country 's inefficient security forces have provided al qaeda with a new base from which it can extend its growing network throughout eastern africa .
inland in kenya , border camps filled with refugees from somalia are reported to be just as fertile a breeding ground for young extremists .
meanwhile , kenya has its own home grown terror problem .
the kenyan saleh ali saleh nabhan was alleged to have been the leader of al qaeda in somalia and the mastermind behind the bombing of the paradise hotel in mombasa and the attempted downing of an israeli passenger jet in november 2002 .
he was also suspected of involvement in the 1998 us embassy bombings in nairobi and dar es salaam in tanzania .
he was killed by us special forces near mogadishu in september 2009 .
changing face of mission shifts threat focus david hartwell , an expert and risk analyst for the middle east and north africa , believes that the changing nature of operation enduring freedom has shifted the focus away from its original mission meaning that the horn of africa and land-based threats are now longer in its remit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops will leave but the threat will remain " the germans have made a fair assessment on enduring freedom but it 's one based on the level of threat within the operation 's initial mission which was to capture fleeing extremists and taliban from afghanistan and stop them getting to places like yemen , saudi arabia and oman , " hartwell told deutsche welle . " in its original form , it has n't recorded that many successes as there have been few significant arrests of wanted figures on the seas .
as such , enduring freedom has mutated into the anti-piracy mission which is having more success in containing the pirates .
but it has been agreed that there is less of a need for naval forces to be searching for fleeing extremists now , especially in the gulf of aden and indian ocean . " " the region itself is still unstable with civil wars and extremism in both somalia and yemen but those involved in enduring freedom are wary of getting involved in the internal politics in these countries so we 'll see more countries following germany 's decision and refocusing on the piracy mission , " he added . author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

somalia at the heart of region 's spreading extremism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al shabab is fighting to install an islamic caliphate in somalia " the terrorist threat emanating from the horn of africa is limited at the moment , " jeremy binnie , a terrorism expert at jane 's defence group , told deutsche welle .
" however , there is a lot of concern that somalia might turn into something akin to taliban-controlled afghanistan in the 1990s .
the pro-al qaeda group there , the shabab , controls much of the south of the country and is currently threatening to overrun mogadishu .
the only thing stopping them is a small force of african peacekeepers .
so there are worries that southern somalia could become a safe haven for jihadists from other countries and a base for training . "
" there are already indications that the shabab is being supported by a small number of foreign jihadists and has recruited possibly hundreds of young men from europe and north america , most of them somalis , " binnie added .
" there have also been a few reports of yemen-based al qaeda operatives turning up in somalia .
the worry is that these guys could be used to carry out international terrorist attacks . "
" at the same time , there are worries about the geographical proximity between somalia and yemen , meaning it is possible that the shabab will link up with bin laden 's yemeni branch , al qaeda on the arabian peninsula . "
yemen supply lines still bringing arms , personnel to africa last year 's failed bombing of a detroit-bound airliner by an al qaeda suspect with links to yemen highlighted the country 's growing reputation as the new hub for terrorism in the region .
yemen is a blueprint nation for radical islamists ; it has a weak government , it is deeply divided by a tribalistic and violent civil war which is pushing the country toward the status of a failed state and has a culture in which most men carry weapons , therefore making identifying terrorists extremely difficult .
the land of osama bin laden 's ancestors has also become a melting pot of refugees from the conflict in somalia and returning jihadists from the wars in afghanistan and iraq .
with africa in its sights , it is thought that al qaeda sees yemen as an ideal staging point for fanning the flames of extremism across the gulf of aden in somalia and beyond .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda has targeted kenya since the us embassy attack despite having a less direct shipping connection to yemen than somalia , sharing a border with the failed state puts kenya at risk of infiltration by islamist terror groups .
instead of having to navigate through the international forces in indian ocean to reach the kenyan coastline , arab-based terrorists can smuggle weapons and personnel overland to kenya via somalia .
it has been reported for as long as germany was part of operation enduring freedom that al qaeda was seeking a foothold in kenya and that al qaeda operatives had infiltrated the country 's islamic communities on its indian ocean coast .
poor relations between kenya 's coastal muslims and the country 's inefficient security forces have provided al qaeda with a new base from which it can extend its growing network throughout eastern africa .
inland in kenya , border camps filled with refugees from somalia are reported to be just as fertile a breeding ground for young extremists .
meanwhile , kenya has its own home grown terror problem .
the kenyan saleh ali saleh nabhan was alleged to have been the leader of al qaeda in somalia and the mastermind behind the bombing of the paradise hotel in mombasa and the attempted downing of an israeli passenger jet in november 2002 .
he was also suspected of involvement in the 1998 us embassy bombings in nairobi and dar es salaam in tanzania .
he was killed by us special forces near mogadishu in september 2009 .
changing face of mission shifts threat focus david hartwell , an expert and risk analyst for the middle east and north africa , believes that the changing nature of operation enduring freedom has shifted the focus away from its original mission meaning that the horn of africa and land-based threats are now longer in its remit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops will leave but the threat will remain " the germans have made a fair assessment on enduring freedom but it 's one based on the level of threat within the operation 's initial mission which was to capture fleeing extremists and taliban from afghanistan and stop them getting to places like yemen , saudi arabia and oman , " hartwell told deutsche welle . " in its original form , it has n't recorded that many successes as there have been few significant arrests of wanted figures on the seas .
as such , enduring freedom has mutated into the anti-piracy mission which is having more success in containing the pirates .
but it has been agreed that there is less of a need for naval forces to be searching for fleeing extremists now , especially in the gulf of aden and indian ocean . " " the region itself is still unstable with civil wars and extremism in both somalia and yemen but those involved in enduring freedom are wary of getting involved in the internal politics in these countries so we 'll see more countries following germany 's decision and refocusing on the piracy mission , " he added . author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a report issued last month says that progress has been slow . two decades of civil war in sudan between the country 's mostly arab muslim north and the predominantly christian black african south left two million people dead .
armies from both sides enlisted children in their ranks .
in 2005 , a peace agreement signed to end the war also required a demobilization , disarmament and reintegration effort to send these children home .
but five years later and just months ahead of the december deadline , reports suggest there are still several hundred child soldiers in southern sudan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demobilization of child soldiers was part of a 2005 sudan peace deal learning to handle a gun jonathan , whose name has been changed to protect his identity , was 11 years old when soldiers from the sudan people ’ s liberation army -lrb- spla -rrb- forced him into the military .
" when the spla came to us , the older people ran away .
i did n't run because i was a child , " he said .
" so they captured me .
when i refused , they kept beating me .
i did n't want to go , but they forced me to join the spla . "
for the next five years , jonathan carried the soldiers ' bags , washed their clothes , cooked their food and collected firewood for them .
he said refusing to work would have meant being beaten by three or four people .
eventually , jonathan was trained to use a gun .
he was given his own ak-47 assault rifle and sent to the frontlines to battle the messiria , a tribe of arab nomads who bring their cattle to graze on land in southern sudan .
jonathan says he shot at them but never killed anyone .
" i think it was very bad for me to be in the military when i was 12 or 13 years old , but there was no other option for me , " he said .
" because if i wanted to go away , these people - they would look for me , really . "
" i found it difficult for me to be in the army when i was that young , " jonathan said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demobilized children rely on supplies from groups like the un 's world food programme spla ' a persistent violator ' in a may report , the united nations named the sudan people ’ s liberation army a " persistent violator " of children in armed conflict .
the spla signed an action plan last year with the un to get all children out of its ranks before december 2010 .
another report issued in june by the research organization small arms survey said progress for the demobilization has been " slow , " and communities receiving ex-combatants are faced with a dual economic and social burden .
in the capital of unity state , jonathan was one of 91 children demobilized in southern sudan on april 29 .
when government officials came to his military barracks , he thought they were lying when they said they were going to take him home .
but that ’ s exactly what happened .
glad to be home while it took a little while for jonathan to adjust to civilian life , he said he feels comfortable now and is glad to be home .
he plays soccer with friends on the weekends .
" i found it very nice for me to be home because i found some friends here , " he said .
" and also my family told me they missed me a lot . "
" now , if they tell me to go back to the army , i will refuse because i missed my family very much when i was in the army , " he added .
the un 's may report found that 33 former child soldiers had been demobilized last year only to be recruited once more by the south 's army .
charles machieng , the head of the south sudan demobilization , disarmament and reintegration commission for unity state , said when he prepares the children to leave the military , they ask him questions about their future back at home .
" children are actually asking us , ' why are you removing us from the army and taking us to the village where we do not get clean water , where we are not getting schooling , we 're not getting medication , and we ’ re not getting enough food ? " '
machieng said .
bildunterschrift : the spla agreed to demobilize children from its ranks by december 2010 lack of funds but the demobilization commission does n't have the resources to give material support to demobilized children .
the government relies on international organizations such as the un 's world food programme to provide the children with food .
the commission is asking the international community to contribute more aid to keep children from returning to the barracks .
bismarck swangin , a communications officer for unicef in southern sudan , said demobilized children have the same needs as those who haven ’ t been in in the military . the south sudan government , he said , could do more to help the demobilized children .
" we are aware of the challenges , the challenges of these children who are coming out of the military - the same challenges of the children who are even in the homes , including even those who stay with their parents , " he said .
" but i think there is an opportunity to do more .
i think the government needs to step up in terms of allocating more resources . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armies in both north and south sudan enlisted child soldiers during the civil war limited success today , about 900 children are still believed to be serving in the south ’ s military , down from an estimated 3,000 in 2005 .
" i think the process is working , " swangin said .
" but sometimes not up to expectations . "
unlike many children who worked as child soldiers for the spla , jonathan , though an orphan , is lucky to have an uncle with the resources to afford him an education .
he said he plans to get a doctorate .
" what i dream for , if i finish my studies - i can become like general salva kiir mayardit , or i can become president like omar al bashir , " he added .
but , unlike bashir who seized power in a 1989 military coup , jonathan has had enough of the military .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 05.07.2010 komorowski wins polish presidential election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : komorowski says the european union is his top priority bronislaw komorowski , the candidate of poland 's ruling pro-business civic platform party , has become the country 's next president .
komorowski beat jaroslaw kaczynski by a margin of seven percent of the vote . liberal parliamentary speaker and acting president bronislaw komorowski has won poland 's presidential run-off election . with all votes counted , komorowski earned 53 percent of the vote , while his opponent , nationalist opposition leader jaroslaw kaczynski , gained 47 percent of the votes , according to the election commission . jaroslaw is the twin brother of former president lech kaczynski , who died in a plane crash on april 10 .
the election was triggered by the former leader 's sudden death , along with his wife and 95 others , in the crash . sunday 's election followed a first round of voting on june 20 , in which neither candidate secured a majority . ' good for poland ' on hearing early results , a beaming komorowski said that polish democracy had emerged the winner . " today democracy has won , our polish democracy , " komorowski said before a crowd of cheering supporters , adding that it was " important not to foment divisions , but to build a sense of unity . " kaczynski admitted defeat shortly after komorowski 's speech . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski has performed better than expected " i congratulate the winner .
i congratulate bronislaw komorowski , " kaczynski said from his campaign headquarters . german foreign minister guido westerwelle also offered his congratulations , describing the result as a step in the right direction for closer cooperation between poland and europe . " the polish people 's decision to elect komorowski is a strong pro-european signal , " westerwelle said in berlin .
" with president komorowski , as well as prime minister donald tusk and foreign minister radoslaw sikorski , we will have a strong partner for our path of trust and cooperation . " high turnout prior to the run-off election there were growing fears that the start of summer holidays in poland would make voters prefer baltic beaches to polling stations , though this did not materialize . at 52 percent , turnout was much higher than expected .
analysts said it was a clear sign of the mobilization of the two electorates : the traditional , conservative , euroskeptic and mostly rural supporters of kaczynski , and the more reform-minded , pro-european urban voters .
that division was apparent in a sampling of views among voters in warsaw . " we just need to stop kaczynski from winning .
he 's stuck in the past and he 's bad for poland 's position in the eu , " a young businessman told deutsche welle at a polling station in the leafy middle class warsaw suburb of jozefoslaw . " komorowski , together with the reformist prime minister , donald tusk , will lead us deeper into europe . "
however , a retired teacher offered this opinion of komorowski as she cast her ballot : " -lsb- he -rsb- represents those smug businesspeople who have been allowed to thrive at the expense of us pensioners .
i 'm voting for kaczynski , because he cares for people like me .
he 's a patriot who holds national values dear . ” european integration versus national values bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : komorowski insists poland must be closer to germany and france komorowski is a close ally of the prime minister .
both men argue that poland needs economic liberalization to maintain economic growth - the country was the only eu member to avoid recession last year , although growth slowed to 1.8 percent from 5 percent in 2008 . ahead of the run-off vote , kaczynski accused them both of plotting to privatize national health care and sell the country out to foreign investors at the expense of the poor .
komorowski has however insisted that european integration was his highest priority . " the number one issue is poland 's eu membership , strengthening its position there , developing the weimar triangle relationship with germany and france and building reconciliation with russia , " he said in a televised debate . " it is also in poland 's interests to serve as a champion of european integration with countries further east . " euroskeptic and nationalist kaczynski took a more nationalist tone .
while giving few specifics on foreign policy , he clearly stated his plans to carry on his late brother 's policies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : komorowski has secured the presidency " i wo n't let poland be treated as a minor partner by any other country in europe , " he said in the debate .
" foreign policy , which should clearly be the domain of the polish president , requires that the principle of sovereignty should be clearly adhered to , which does n't always happen under the present government .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 05.07.2010 komorowski wins polish presidential election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : komorowski says the european union is his top priority bronislaw komorowski , the candidate of poland 's ruling pro-business civic platform party , has become the country 's next president .
komorowski beat jaroslaw kaczynski by a margin of seven percent of the vote . liberal parliamentary speaker and acting president bronislaw komorowski has won poland 's presidential run-off election . with all votes counted , komorowski earned 53 percent of the vote , while his opponent , nationalist opposition leader jaroslaw kaczynski , gained 47 percent of the votes , according to the election commission . jaroslaw is the twin brother of former president lech kaczynski , who died in a plane crash on april 10 .
the election was triggered by the former leader 's sudden death , along with his wife and 95 others , in the crash . sunday 's election followed a first round of voting on june 20 , in which neither candidate secured a majority . ' good for poland ' on hearing early results , a beaming komorowski said that polish democracy had emerged the winner . " today democracy has won , our polish democracy , " komorowski said before a crowd of cheering supporters , adding that it was " important not to foment divisions , but to build a sense of unity . " kaczynski admitted defeat shortly after komorowski 's speech . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski has performed better than expected " i congratulate the winner .
i congratulate bronislaw komorowski , " kaczynski said from his campaign headquarters . german foreign minister guido westerwelle also offered his congratulations , describing the result as a step in the right direction for closer cooperation between poland and europe . " the polish people 's decision to elect komorowski is a strong pro-european signal , " westerwelle said in berlin .
" with president komorowski , as well as prime minister donald tusk and foreign minister radoslaw sikorski , we will have a strong partner for our path of trust and cooperation . " high turnout prior to the run-off election there were growing fears that the start of summer holidays in poland would make voters prefer baltic beaches to polling stations , though this did not materialize . at 52 percent , turnout was much higher than expected .
analysts said it was a clear sign of the mobilization of the two electorates : the traditional , conservative , euroskeptic and mostly rural supporters of kaczynski , and the more reform-minded , pro-european urban voters .
that division was apparent in a sampling of views among voters in warsaw . " we just need to stop kaczynski from winning .
he 's stuck in the past and he 's bad for poland 's position in the eu , " a young businessman told deutsche welle at a polling station in the leafy middle class warsaw suburb of jozefoslaw . " komorowski , together with the reformist prime minister , donald tusk , will lead us deeper into europe . "
however , a retired teacher offered this opinion of komorowski as she cast her ballot : " -lsb- he -rsb- represents those smug businesspeople who have been allowed to thrive at the expense of us pensioners .
i 'm voting for kaczynski , because he cares for people like me .
he 's a patriot who holds national values dear . ” european integration versus national values bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : komorowski insists poland must be closer to germany and france komorowski is a close ally of the prime minister .
both men argue that poland needs economic liberalization to maintain economic growth - the country was the only eu member to avoid recession last year , although growth slowed to 1.8 percent from 5 percent in 2008 . ahead of the run-off vote , kaczynski accused them both of plotting to privatize national health care and sell the country out to foreign investors at the expense of the poor .
komorowski has however insisted that european integration was his highest priority . " the number one issue is poland 's eu membership , strengthening its position there , developing the weimar triangle relationship with germany and france and building reconciliation with russia , " he said in a televised debate . " it is also in poland 's interests to serve as a champion of european integration with countries further east . " euroskeptic and nationalist kaczynski took a more nationalist tone .
while giving few specifics on foreign policy , he clearly stated his plans to carry on his late brother 's policies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : komorowski has secured the presidency " i wo n't let poland be treated as a minor partner by any other country in europe , " he said in the debate .
" foreign policy , which should clearly be the domain of the polish president , requires that the principle of sovereignty should be clearly adhered to , which does n't always happen under the present government . " critics say his unabashed euroskepticism , which he championed during his term as prime minister from 2006 to 2007 , alienated poland 's neighbors .
he said he currently has no interest in adopting the euro , pointing out that the free-floating zloty has helped poland ride out the economic crisis .

now , the federal chamber of german architects -lrb- bak -rrb- has started a debate about the building 's future . the german pavilion building - situated in the southern part of venice 's giardini park , where the biennale is held - is not particularly inviting .
the entry is large , with four imposing pillars supporting a heavy-looking roof .
the room inside has windows high above the ground , not offering any views of the surrounding area . ' unsuitable for art ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biennale takes places in venice 's giardini arno sighard schmid , president of the federal chamber of german architects , does not think that the temple-like nazi-era building represents modern germany .
he wants to see it torn down , saying that it is " neither suitable for art , nor for architecture " and has " no connection to the venetian skyline . " instead , he finds that it reflects the character of the nazi era , which brings an emotional aspect into the debate . the german pavilion was first erected in 1909 as the bavarian pavilion , based on the designs of a venetian architect .
with its ionic-style columns , it bore a resemblance to an ancient temple .
in 1938 , it was altered to reflect the nazi regime 's aesthetic ideals . then , in 1993 , german conceptual artist hans haacke smashed the travertine floor of the pavilion 's hall , where hitler and mussolini had once stood , leaving the fragments lying on the ground .
he called the work " failed hope . " a place for expression but according to susanne gaensheimer , director of the frankfurt museum for modern art and curator of the 2011 art biennale - the building is suitable for showcasing contemporary art , though it does represent a challenge for the artists . " there are many examples of exhibition halls with ideological or ideology-related architecture that show that this very confrontation with architecture has led to fantastic projects and artworks , " said gaensheimer .
" you need to differentiate between the outer architecture and what happens on the inside . " fantastic works of art have been presented in the german pavilion , she added - " and that is what represents this country . " bildunterschrift : in 2006 , the german curator team highlighted the most attractive aspect of the pavilion : the roof one example was the german presentation at the 2006 architecture biennale , which was titled " convertible city . "
the team of curators , from the architecture firm gruentuch ernst , positioned a bright red staircase through the window on the side of the pavilion , which allowed visitors to climb up onto the roof .
from there , they had a magnificent view of venice . the project was a good idea , conceded arno sighard schmid , but not one that can be repeated over and over . constructing the staircase " was a difficult undertaking , but showed that the roof offers such wonderful possibilities , " said schmid .
" and that 's the reason i 've proposed that our current democratic republic should present itself abroad in other ways than what this pavilion allows . " ' history ca n't be erased ' however , the curator for next year 's art biennale , susanne gaensheimer , maintains that history ca n't just be torn down .

is it a hindrance to artists that should be demolished , or a piece of history that should be preserved ? in a few weeks , people from around the world will flock to venice for the 12th venice biennale of architecture , which showcases new projects by big-name architects and designers . altogether , 28 national pavilions will be open to visitors , including the controversial german pavilion , which is a prime example of nazi architecture .
now , the federal chamber of german architects -lrb- bak -rrb- has started a debate about the building 's future . the german pavilion building - situated in the southern part of venice 's giardini park , where the biennale is held - is not particularly inviting .
the entry is large , with four imposing pillars supporting a heavy-looking roof .
the room inside has windows high above the ground , not offering any views of the surrounding area . ' unsuitable for art ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biennale takes places in venice 's giardini arno sighard schmid , president of the federal chamber of german architects , does not think that the temple-like nazi-era building represents modern germany .
he wants to see it torn down , saying that it is " neither suitable for art , nor for architecture " and has " no connection to the venetian skyline . " instead , he finds that it reflects the character of the nazi era , which brings an emotional aspect into the debate . the german pavilion was first erected in 1909 as the bavarian pavilion , based on the designs of a venetian architect .
with its ionic-style columns , it bore a resemblance to an ancient temple .
in 1938 , it was altered to reflect the nazi regime 's aesthetic ideals . then , in 1993 , german conceptual artist hans haacke smashed the travertine floor of the pavilion 's hall , where hitler and mussolini had once stood , leaving the fragments lying on the ground .
he called the work " failed hope .

komorowski beat jaroslaw kaczynski by a margin of seven percent of the vote . liberal parliamentary speaker and acting president bronislaw komorowski has won poland 's presidential run-off election . with all votes counted , komorowski earned 53 percent of the vote , while his opponent , nationalist opposition leader jaroslaw kaczynski , gained 47 percent of the votes , according to the election commission . jaroslaw is the twin brother of former president lech kaczynski , who died in a plane crash on april 10 .
the election was triggered by the former leader 's sudden death , along with his wife and 95 others , in the crash . sunday 's election followed a first round of voting on june 20 , in which neither candidate secured a majority . ' good for poland ' on hearing early results , a beaming komorowski said that polish democracy had emerged the winner . " today democracy has won , our polish democracy , " komorowski said before a crowd of cheering supporters , adding that it was " important not to foment divisions , but to build a sense of unity . " kaczynski admitted defeat shortly after komorowski 's speech . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski has performed better than expected " i congratulate the winner .
i congratulate bronislaw komorowski , " kaczynski said from his campaign headquarters . german foreign minister guido westerwelle also offered his congratulations , describing the result as a step in the right direction for closer cooperation between poland and europe . " the polish people 's decision to elect komorowski is a strong pro-european signal , " westerwelle said in berlin .
" with president komorowski , as well as prime minister donald tusk and foreign minister radoslaw sikorski , we will have a strong partner for our path of trust and cooperation . " high turnout prior to the run-off election there were growing fears that the start of summer holidays in poland would make voters prefer baltic beaches to polling stations , though this did not materialize . at 52 percent , turnout was much higher than expected .
analysts said it was a clear sign of the mobilization of the two electorates : the traditional , conservative , euroskeptic and mostly rural supporters of kaczynski , and the more reform-minded , pro-european urban voters .
that division was apparent in a sampling of views among voters in warsaw . " we just need to stop kaczynski from winning .
he 's stuck in the past and he 's bad for poland 's position in the eu , " a young businessman told deutsche welle at a polling station in the leafy middle class warsaw suburb of jozefoslaw . " komorowski , together with the reformist prime minister , donald tusk , will lead us deeper into europe . "
however , a retired teacher offered this opinion of komorowski as she cast her ballot : " -lsb- he -rsb- represents those smug businesspeople who have been allowed to thrive at the expense of us pensioners .
i 'm voting for kaczynski , because he cares for people like me .
he 's a patriot who holds national values dear . ” european integration versus national values bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : komorowski insists poland must be closer to germany and france komorowski is a close ally of the prime minister .
both men argue that poland needs economic liberalization to maintain economic growth - the country was the only eu member to avoid recession last year , although growth slowed to 1.8 percent from 5 percent in 2008 . ahead of the run-off vote , kaczynski accused them both of plotting to privatize national health care and sell the country out to foreign investors at the expense of the poor .
komorowski has however insisted that european integration was his highest priority . " the number one issue is poland 's eu membership , strengthening its position there , developing the weimar triangle relationship with germany and france and building reconciliation with russia , " he said in a televised debate . " it is also in poland 's interests to serve as a champion of european integration with countries further east . " euroskeptic and nationalist kaczynski took a more nationalist tone .
while giving few specifics on foreign policy , he clearly stated his plans to carry on his late brother 's policies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : komorowski has secured the presidency " i wo n't let poland be treated as a minor partner by any other country in europe , " he said in the debate .
" foreign policy , which should clearly be the domain of the polish president , requires that the principle of sovereignty should be clearly adhered to , which does n't always happen under the present government . " critics say his unabashed euroskepticism , which he championed during his term as prime minister from 2006 to 2007 , alienated poland 's neighbors .
he said he currently has no interest in adopting the euro , pointing out that the free-floating zloty has helped poland ride out the economic crisis . " if we had pushed for the euro as the government wanted , we would today be in an economic catastrophe , " he said . author : david levitz / rafal kiepuszewski -lrb- reuters , afp , ap -rrb- editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

two turkish newspapers had quoted davutoglu as saying ties with israel would be severed unless turkey received an apology for the flotilla raid or israel accepted the outcome of an independent inquiry into the incident .
in response to davutoglu 's alleged remarks , israeli foreign minister avigdor lieberman said during a trip to latvia that israel did n't " have any intention to apologize . "
later on monday , however , a spokesman for the turkish government told the reuters news agency that davutoglu had been misquoted in the newspaper reports .
the official claimed that davutoglu actually said that relations with israel would not improve if an apology was not issued .
the two countries have been on bad terms since the may 31 raid on a gaza-bound aid flotilla .
nine turkish nationals died after israeli military personnel boarded one of the ships . each side subsequently blamed the other for starting the violent confrontation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 05.07.2010 sudanese rebels reluctant to demobilize child soldiers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 900 children are still believed to be serving in sudan 's south military the sudan people 's liberation army signed an agreement with the un last year to get all children out of its ranks before december 2010 .
but a report issued last month says that progress has been slow . two decades of civil war in sudan between the country 's mostly arab muslim north and the predominantly christian black african south left two million people dead .
armies from both sides enlisted children in their ranks .
in 2005 , a peace agreement signed to end the war also required a demobilization , disarmament and reintegration effort to send these children home .
but five years later and just months ahead of the december deadline , reports suggest there are still several hundred child soldiers in southern sudan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demobilization of child soldiers was part of a 2005 sudan peace deal learning to handle a gun jonathan , whose name has been changed to protect his identity , was 11 years old when soldiers from the sudan people ’ s liberation army -lrb- spla -rrb- forced him into the military .
" when the spla came to us , the older people ran away .
i did n't run because i was a child , " he said .
" so they captured me .
when i refused , they kept beating me .
i did n't want to go , but they forced me to join the spla . "
for the next five years , jonathan carried the soldiers ' bags , washed their clothes , cooked their food and collected firewood for them .
he said refusing to work would have meant being beaten by three or four people .
eventually , jonathan was trained to use a gun .
he was given his own ak-47 assault rifle and sent to the frontlines to battle the messiria , a tribe of arab nomads who bring their cattle to graze on land in southern sudan .
jonathan says he shot at them but never killed anyone .
" i think it was very bad for me to be in the military when i was 12 or 13 years old , but there was no other option for me , " he said .
" because if i wanted to go away , these people - they would look for me , really . "
" i found it difficult for me to be in the army when i was that young , " jonathan said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demobilized children rely on supplies from groups like the un 's world food programme spla ' a persistent violator ' in a may report , the united nations named the sudan people ’ s liberation army a " persistent violator " of children in armed conflict .
the spla signed an action plan last year with the un to get all children out of its ranks before december 2010 .
another report issued in june by the research organization small arms survey said progress for the demobilization has been " slow , " and communities receiving ex-combatants are faced with a dual economic and social burden .
in the capital of unity state , jonathan was one of 91 children demobilized in southern sudan on april 29 .
when government officials came to his military barracks , he thought they were lying when they said they were going to take him home .
but that ’ s exactly what happened .
glad to be home while it took a little while for jonathan to adjust to civilian life , he said he feels comfortable now and is glad to be home .
he plays soccer with friends on the weekends .
" i found it very nice for me to be home because i found some friends here , " he said .
" and also my family told me they missed me a lot . "
" now , if they tell me to go back to the army , i will refuse because i missed my family very much when i was in the army , " he added .
the un 's may report found that 33 former child soldiers had been demobilized last year only to be recruited once more by the south 's army .
charles machieng , the head of the south sudan demobilization , disarmament and reintegration commission for unity state , said when he prepares the children to leave the military , they ask him questions about their future back at home .
" children are actually asking us , ' why are you removing us from the army and taking us to the village where we do not get clean water , where we are not getting schooling , we 're not getting medication , and we ’ re not getting enough food ? " '
machieng said .
bildunterschrift : the spla agreed to demobilize children from its ranks by december 2010 lack of funds but the demobilization commission does n't have the resources to give material support to demobilized children .
the government relies on international organizations such as the un 's world food programme to provide the children with food .
the commission is asking the international community to contribute more aid to keep children from returning to the barracks .
bismarck swangin , a communications officer for unicef in southern sudan , said demobilized children have the same needs as those who haven ’ t been in in the military . the south sudan government , he said , could do more to help the demobilized children .
" we are aware of the challenges , the challenges of these children who are coming out of the military - the same challenges of the children who are even in the homes , including even those who stay with their parents , " he said .
" but i think there is an opportunity to do more .
i think the government needs to step up in terms of allocating more resources . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armies in both north and south sudan enlisted child soldiers during the civil war limited success today , about 900 children are still believed to be serving in the south ’ s military , down from an estimated 3,000 in 2005 .
" i think the process is working , " swangin said .
" but sometimes not up to expectations . "
unlike many children who worked as child soldiers for the spla , jonathan , though an orphan , is lucky to have an uncle with the resources to afford him an education .
he said he plans to get a doctorate .
" what i dream for , if i finish my studies - i can become like general salva kiir mayardit , or i can become president like omar al bashir , " he added .
but , unlike bashir who seized power in a 1989 military coup , jonathan has had enough of the military .

komorowski beat jaroslaw kaczynski by a margin of seven percent of the vote . liberal parliamentary speaker and acting president bronislaw komorowski has won poland 's presidential run-off election . with all votes counted , komorowski earned 53 percent of the vote , while his opponent , nationalist opposition leader jaroslaw kaczynski , gained 47 percent of the votes , according to the election commission . jaroslaw is the twin brother of former president lech kaczynski , who died in a plane crash on april 10 .
the election was triggered by the former leader 's sudden death , along with his wife and 95 others , in the crash . sunday 's election followed a first round of voting on june 20 , in which neither candidate secured a majority . ' good for poland ' on hearing early results , a beaming komorowski said that polish democracy had emerged the winner . " today democracy has won , our polish democracy , " komorowski said before a crowd of cheering supporters , adding that it was " important not to foment divisions , but to build a sense of unity . " kaczynski admitted defeat shortly after komorowski 's speech . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski has performed better than expected " i congratulate the winner .
i congratulate bronislaw komorowski , " kaczynski said from his campaign headquarters . german foreign minister guido westerwelle also offered his congratulations , describing the result as a step in the right direction for closer cooperation between poland and europe . " the polish people 's decision to elect komorowski is a strong pro-european signal , " westerwelle said in berlin .
" with president komorowski , as well as prime minister donald tusk and foreign minister radoslaw sikorski , we will have a strong partner for our path of trust and cooperation . " high turnout prior to the run-off election there were growing fears that the start of summer holidays in poland would make voters prefer baltic beaches to polling stations , though this did not materialize . at 52 percent , turnout was much higher than expected .
analysts said it was a clear sign of the mobilization of the two electorates : the traditional , conservative , euroskeptic and mostly rural supporters of kaczynski , and the more reform-minded , pro-european urban voters .
that division was apparent in a sampling of views among voters in warsaw . " we just need to stop kaczynski from winning .
he 's stuck in the past and he 's bad for poland 's position in the eu , " a young businessman told deutsche welle at a polling station in the leafy middle class warsaw suburb of jozefoslaw . " komorowski , together with the reformist prime minister , donald tusk , will lead us deeper into europe . "
however , a retired teacher offered this opinion of komorowski as she cast her ballot : " -lsb- he -rsb- represents those smug businesspeople who have been allowed to thrive at the expense of us pensioners .
i 'm voting for kaczynski , because he cares for people like me .
he 's a patriot who holds national values dear . ” european integration versus national values bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : komorowski insists poland must be closer to germany and france komorowski is a close ally of the prime minister .
both men argue that poland needs economic liberalization to maintain economic growth - the country was the only eu member to avoid recession last year , although growth slowed to 1.8 percent from 5 percent in 2008 . ahead of the run-off vote , kaczynski accused them both of plotting to privatize national health care and sell the country out to foreign investors at the expense of the poor .
komorowski has however insisted that european integration was his highest priority . " the number one issue is poland 's eu membership , strengthening its position there , developing the weimar triangle relationship with germany and france and building reconciliation with russia , " he said in a televised debate . " it is also in poland 's interests to serve as a champion of european integration with countries further east . " euroskeptic and nationalist kaczynski took a more nationalist tone .
while giving few specifics on foreign policy , he clearly stated his plans to carry on his late brother 's policies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : komorowski has secured the presidency " i wo n't let poland be treated as a minor partner by any other country in europe , " he said in the debate .
" foreign policy , which should clearly be the domain of the polish president , requires that the principle of sovereignty should be clearly adhered to , which does n't always happen under the present government . " critics say his unabashed euroskepticism , which he championed during his term as prime minister from 2006 to 2007 , alienated poland 's neighbors .
he said he currently has no interest in adopting the euro , pointing out that the free-floating zloty has helped poland ride out the economic crisis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 05.07.2010 enduring freedom 's shift in focus belies horn of africa 's security threat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german marines will now search for pirates not terrorists germany 's recent decision to pull out of operation enduring freedom was based on an assessment that labels the terror threat in the horn of africa as limited .
defense analysts suggest the region is still a major concern . if the german defense ministry is to be believed , the terrorist threat in the sea off the horn of africa has been reduced so significantly that it sees no further reason to deploy its force of 90 marines and a navy reconnaissance plane as part of the us-led operation enduring freedom .
due to an assessment that claims that the threat is now ' limited , ' germany has ended its involvement six months earlier than its mandate stipulated .
germany has been involved in the operation enduring freedom as part of the mission aimed at stopping islamic terrorists smuggling arms to groups in africa from the arabian peninsula for over eight years .
the german navy joined the task force in february 2002 , some five months after the united states established the operation after the 9/11 attacks on new york and washington .
with the last german troops completing their tours of duty in the gulf of aden and the indian ocean last week , germany 's naval focus now shifts to the mediterranean .
one german navy frigate will remain off the coast of africa as part of operation atalanta , a european union mission to protect aid shipments into somalia from pirate attack .
however , with increased al qaeda activity being reported across the gulf of aden in yemen , affiliated islamist groups continuing to battle for control of somalia and reports that osama bin laden 's terror network is extending its influence into kenya , the german decision has caused some surprise among security analysts .
somalia at the heart of region 's spreading extremism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al shabab is fighting to install an islamic caliphate in somalia " the terrorist threat emanating from the horn of africa is limited at the moment , " jeremy binnie , a terrorism expert at jane 's defence group , told deutsche welle .
" however , there is a lot of concern that somalia might turn into something akin to taliban-controlled afghanistan in the 1990s .
the pro-al qaeda group there , the shabab , controls much of the south of the country and is currently threatening to overrun mogadishu .
the only thing stopping them is a small force of african peacekeepers .
so there are worries that southern somalia could become a safe haven for jihadists from other countries and a base for training . "
" there are already indications that the shabab is being supported by a small number of foreign jihadists and has recruited possibly hundreds of young men from europe and north america , most of them somalis , " binnie added .
" there have also been a few reports of yemen-based al qaeda operatives turning up in somalia .
the worry is that these guys could be used to carry out international terrorist attacks . "
" at the same time , there are worries about the geographical proximity between somalia and yemen , meaning it is possible that the shabab will link up with bin laden 's yemeni branch , al qaeda on the arabian peninsula . "
yemen supply lines still bringing arms , personnel to africa last year 's failed bombing of a detroit-bound airliner by an al qaeda suspect with links to yemen highlighted the country 's growing reputation as the new hub for terrorism in the region .
yemen is a blueprint nation for radical islamists ; it has a weak government , it is deeply divided by a tribalistic and violent civil war which is pushing the country toward the status of a failed state and has a culture in which most men carry weapons , therefore making identifying terrorists extremely difficult .
the land of osama bin laden 's ancestors has also become a melting pot of refugees from the conflict in somalia and returning jihadists from the wars in afghanistan and iraq .
with africa in its sights , it is thought that al qaeda sees yemen as an ideal staging point for fanning the flames of extremism across the gulf of aden in somalia and beyond .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda has targeted kenya since the us embassy attack despite having a less direct shipping connection to yemen than somalia , sharing a border with the failed state puts kenya at risk of infiltration by islamist terror groups .
instead of having to navigate through the international forces in indian ocean to reach the kenyan coastline , arab-based terrorists can smuggle weapons and personnel overland to kenya via somalia .
it has been reported for as long as germany was part of operation enduring freedom that al qaeda was seeking a foothold in kenya and that al qaeda operatives had infiltrated the country 's islamic communities on its indian ocean coast .
poor relations between kenya 's coastal muslims and the country 's inefficient security forces have provided al qaeda with a new base from which it can extend its growing network throughout eastern africa .
inland in kenya , border camps filled with refugees from somalia are reported to be just as fertile a breeding ground for young extremists .
meanwhile , kenya has its own home grown terror problem .
the kenyan saleh ali saleh nabhan was alleged to have been the leader of al qaeda in somalia and the mastermind behind the bombing of the paradise hotel in mombasa and the attempted downing of an israeli passenger jet in november 2002 .
he was also suspected of involvement in the 1998 us embassy bombings in nairobi and dar es salaam in tanzania .
he was killed by us special forces near mogadishu in september 2009 .
changing face of mission shifts threat focus david hartwell , an expert and risk analyst for the middle east and north africa , believes that the changing nature of operation enduring freedom has shifted the focus away from its original mission meaning that the horn of africa and land-based threats are now longer in its remit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops will leave but the threat will remain " the germans have made a fair assessment on enduring freedom but it 's one based on the level of threat within the operation 's initial mission which was to capture fleeing extremists and taliban from afghanistan and stop them getting to places like yemen , saudi arabia and oman , " hartwell told deutsche welle . " in its original form , it has n't recorded that many successes as there have been few significant arrests of wanted figures on the seas .
as such , enduring freedom has mutated into the anti-piracy mission which is having more success in containing the pirates .
but it has been agreed that there is less of a need for naval forces to be searching for fleeing extremists now , especially in the gulf of aden and indian ocean . " " the region itself is still unstable with civil wars and extremism in both somalia and yemen but those involved in enduring freedom are wary of getting involved in the internal politics in these countries so we 'll see more countries following germany 's decision and refocusing on the piracy mission , " he added . author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

defense analysts suggest the region is still a major concern . if the german defense ministry is to be believed , the terrorist threat in the sea off the horn of africa has been reduced so significantly that it sees no further reason to deploy its force of 90 marines and a navy reconnaissance plane as part of the us-led operation enduring freedom .
due to an assessment that claims that the threat is now ' limited , ' germany has ended its involvement six months earlier than its mandate stipulated .
germany has been involved in the operation enduring freedom as part of the mission aimed at stopping islamic terrorists smuggling arms to groups in africa from the arabian peninsula for over eight years .
the german navy joined the task force in february 2002 , some five months after the united states established the operation after the 9/11 attacks on new york and washington .
with the last german troops completing their tours of duty in the gulf of aden and the indian ocean last week , germany 's naval focus now shifts to the mediterranean .
one german navy frigate will remain off the coast of africa as part of operation atalanta , a european union mission to protect aid shipments into somalia from pirate attack .
however , with increased al qaeda activity being reported across the gulf of aden in yemen , affiliated islamist groups continuing to battle for control of somalia and reports that osama bin laden 's terror network is extending its influence into kenya , the german decision has caused some surprise among security analysts .
somalia at the heart of region 's spreading extremism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al shabab is fighting to install an islamic caliphate in somalia " the terrorist threat emanating from the horn of africa is limited at the moment , " jeremy binnie , a terrorism expert at jane 's defence group , told deutsche welle .
" however , there is a lot of concern that somalia might turn into something akin to taliban-controlled afghanistan in the 1990s .
the pro-al qaeda group there , the shabab , controls much of the south of the country and is currently threatening to overrun mogadishu .
the only thing stopping them is a small force of african peacekeepers .
so there are worries that southern somalia could become a safe haven for jihadists from other countries and a base for training . "
" there are already indications that the shabab is being supported by a small number of foreign jihadists and has recruited possibly hundreds of young men from europe and north america , most of them somalis , " binnie added .
" there have also been a few reports of yemen-based al qaeda operatives turning up in somalia .
the worry is that these guys could be used to carry out international terrorist attacks . "
" at the same time , there are worries about the geographical proximity between somalia and yemen , meaning it is possible that the shabab will link up with bin laden 's yemeni branch , al qaeda on the arabian peninsula . "
yemen supply lines still bringing arms , personnel to africa last year 's failed bombing of a detroit-bound airliner by an al qaeda suspect with links to yemen highlighted the country 's growing reputation as the new hub for terrorism in the region .
yemen is a blueprint nation for radical islamists ; it has a weak government , it is deeply divided by a tribalistic and violent civil war which is pushing the country toward the status of a failed state and has a culture in which most men carry weapons , therefore making identifying terrorists extremely difficult .
the land of osama bin laden 's ancestors has also become a melting pot of refugees from the conflict in somalia and returning jihadists from the wars in afghanistan and iraq .
with africa in its sights , it is thought that al qaeda sees yemen as an ideal staging point for fanning the flames of extremism across the gulf of aden in somalia and beyond .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda has targeted kenya since the us embassy attack despite having a less direct shipping connection to yemen than somalia , sharing a border with the failed state puts kenya at risk of infiltration by islamist terror groups .
instead of having to navigate through the international forces in indian ocean to reach the kenyan coastline , arab-based terrorists can smuggle weapons and personnel overland to kenya via somalia .
it has been reported for as long as germany was part of operation enduring freedom that al qaeda was seeking a foothold in kenya and that al qaeda operatives had infiltrated the country 's islamic communities on its indian ocean coast .
poor relations between kenya 's coastal muslims and the country 's inefficient security forces have provided al qaeda with a new base from which it can extend its growing network throughout eastern africa .
inland in kenya , border camps filled with refugees from somalia are reported to be just as fertile a breeding ground for young extremists .
meanwhile , kenya has its own home grown terror problem .
the kenyan saleh ali saleh nabhan was alleged to have been the leader of al qaeda in somalia and the mastermind behind the bombing of the paradise hotel in mombasa and the attempted downing of an israeli passenger jet in november 2002 .
he was also suspected of involvement in the 1998 us embassy bombings in nairobi and dar es salaam in tanzania .
he was killed by us special forces near mogadishu in september 2009 .
changing face of mission shifts threat focus david hartwell , an expert and risk analyst for the middle east and north africa , believes that the changing nature of operation enduring freedom has shifted the focus away from its original mission meaning that the horn of africa and land-based threats are now longer in its remit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops will leave but the threat will remain " the germans have made a fair assessment on enduring freedom but it 's one based on the level of threat within the operation 's initial mission which was to capture fleeing extremists and taliban from afghanistan and stop them getting to places like yemen , saudi arabia and oman , " hartwell told deutsche welle . " in its original form , it has n't recorded that many successes as there have been few significant arrests of wanted figures on the seas .
as such , enduring freedom has mutated into the anti-piracy mission which is having more success in containing the pirates .
but it has been agreed that there is less of a need for naval forces to be searching for fleeing extremists now , especially in the gulf of aden and indian ocean . " " the region itself is still unstable with civil wars and extremism in both somalia and yemen but those involved in enduring freedom are wary of getting involved in the internal politics in these countries so we 'll see more countries following germany 's decision and refocusing on the piracy mission , " he added . author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with the last german troops completing their tours of duty in the gulf of aden and the indian ocean last week , germany 's naval focus now shifts to the mediterranean .
one german navy frigate will remain off the coast of africa as part of operation atalanta , a european union mission to protect aid shipments into somalia from pirate attack .
however , with increased al qaeda activity being reported across the gulf of aden in yemen , affiliated islamist groups continuing to battle for control of somalia and reports that osama bin laden 's terror network is extending its influence into kenya , the german decision has caused some surprise among security analysts .
somalia at the heart of region 's spreading extremism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al shabab is fighting to install an islamic caliphate in somalia " the terrorist threat emanating from the horn of africa is limited at the moment , " jeremy binnie , a terrorism expert at jane 's defence group , told deutsche welle .
" however , there is a lot of concern that somalia might turn into something akin to taliban-controlled afghanistan in the 1990s .
the pro-al qaeda group there , the shabab , controls much of the south of the country and is currently threatening to overrun mogadishu .
the only thing stopping them is a small force of african peacekeepers .
so there are worries that southern somalia could become a safe haven for jihadists from other countries and a base for training . "
" there are already indications that the shabab is being supported by a small number of foreign jihadists and has recruited possibly hundreds of young men from europe and north america , most of them somalis , " binnie added .
" there have also been a few reports of yemen-based al qaeda operatives turning up in somalia .
the worry is that these guys could be used to carry out international terrorist attacks . "
" at the same time , there are worries about the geographical proximity between somalia and yemen , meaning it is possible that the shabab will link up with bin laden 's yemeni branch , al qaeda on the arabian peninsula . "
yemen supply lines still bringing arms , personnel to africa last year 's failed bombing of a detroit-bound airliner by an al qaeda suspect with links to yemen highlighted the country 's growing reputation as the new hub for terrorism in the region .
yemen is a blueprint nation for radical islamists ; it has a weak government , it is deeply divided by a tribalistic and violent civil war which is pushing the country toward the status of a failed state and has a culture in which most men carry weapons , therefore making identifying terrorists extremely difficult .
the land of osama bin laden 's ancestors has also become a melting pot of refugees from the conflict in somalia and returning jihadists from the wars in afghanistan and iraq .
with africa in its sights , it is thought that al qaeda sees yemen as an ideal staging point for fanning the flames of extremism across the gulf of aden in somalia and beyond .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda has targeted kenya since the us embassy attack despite having a less direct shipping connection to yemen than somalia , sharing a border with the failed state puts kenya at risk of infiltration by islamist terror groups .
instead of having to navigate through the international forces in indian ocean to reach the kenyan coastline , arab-based terrorists can smuggle weapons and personnel overland to kenya via somalia .
it has been reported for as long as germany was part of operation enduring freedom that al qaeda was seeking a foothold in kenya and that al qaeda operatives had infiltrated the country 's islamic communities on its indian ocean coast .
poor relations between kenya 's coastal muslims and the country 's inefficient security forces have provided al qaeda with a new base from which it can extend its growing network throughout eastern africa .
inland in kenya , border camps filled with refugees from somalia are reported to be just as fertile a breeding ground for young extremists .
meanwhile , kenya has its own home grown terror problem .
the kenyan saleh ali saleh nabhan was alleged to have been the leader of al qaeda in somalia and the mastermind behind the bombing of the paradise hotel in mombasa and the attempted downing of an israeli passenger jet in november 2002 .
he was also suspected of involvement in the 1998 us embassy bombings in nairobi and dar es salaam in tanzania .
he was killed by us special forces near mogadishu in september 2009 .
changing face of mission shifts threat focus david hartwell , an expert and risk analyst for the middle east and north africa , believes that the changing nature of operation enduring freedom has shifted the focus away from its original mission meaning that the horn of africa and land-based threats are now longer in its remit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops will leave but the threat will remain " the germans have made a fair assessment on enduring freedom but it 's one based on the level of threat within the operation 's initial mission which was to capture fleeing extremists and taliban from afghanistan and stop them getting to places like yemen , saudi arabia and oman , " hartwell told deutsche welle . " in its original form , it has n't recorded that many successes as there have been few significant arrests of wanted figures on the seas .
as such , enduring freedom has mutated into the anti-piracy mission which is having more success in containing the pirates .
but it has been agreed that there is less of a need for naval forces to be searching for fleeing extremists now , especially in the gulf of aden and indian ocean . " " the region itself is still unstable with civil wars and extremism in both somalia and yemen but those involved in enduring freedom are wary of getting involved in the internal politics in these countries so we 'll see more countries following germany 's decision and refocusing on the piracy mission , " he added . author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" instead , he finds that it reflects the character of the nazi era , which brings an emotional aspect into the debate . the german pavilion was first erected in 1909 as the bavarian pavilion , based on the designs of a venetian architect .

" there are many examples of exhibition halls with ideological or ideology-related architecture that show that this very confrontation with architecture has led to fantastic projects and artworks , " said gaensheimer .

is it a hindrance to artists that should be demolished , or a piece of history that should be preserved ? in a few weeks , people from around the world will flock to venice for the 12th venice biennale of architecture , which showcases new projects by big-name architects and designers . altogether , 28 national pavilions will be open to visitors , including the controversial german pavilion , which is a prime example of nazi architecture .
now , the federal chamber of german architects -lrb- bak -rrb- has started a debate about the building 's future . the german pavilion building - situated in the southern part of venice 's giardini park , where the biennale is held - is not particularly inviting .
the entry is large , with four imposing pillars supporting a heavy-looking roof .
the room inside has windows high above the ground , not offering any views of the surrounding area . ' unsuitable for art ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biennale takes places in venice 's giardini arno sighard schmid , president of the federal chamber of german architects , does not think that the temple-like nazi-era building represents modern germany .
he wants to see it torn down , saying that it is " neither suitable for art , nor for architecture " and has " no connection to the venetian skyline . " instead , he finds that it reflects the character of the nazi era , which brings an emotional aspect into the debate . the german pavilion was first erected in 1909 as the bavarian pavilion , based on the designs of a venetian architect .
with its ionic-style columns , it bore a resemblance to an ancient temple .
in 1938 , it was altered to reflect the nazi regime 's aesthetic ideals . then , in 1993 , german conceptual artist hans haacke smashed the travertine floor of the pavilion 's hall , where hitler and mussolini had once stood , leaving the fragments lying on the ground .
he called the work " failed hope . " a place for expression but according to susanne gaensheimer , director of the frankfurt museum for modern art and curator of the 2011 art biennale - the building is suitable for showcasing contemporary art , though it does represent a challenge for the artists . " there are many examples of exhibition halls with ideological or ideology-related architecture that show that this very confrontation with architecture has led to fantastic projects and artworks , " said gaensheimer .
" you need to differentiate between the outer architecture and what happens on the inside . " fantastic works of art have been presented in the german pavilion , she added - " and that is what represents this country . " bildunterschrift : in 2006 , the german curator team highlighted the most attractive aspect of the pavilion : the roof one example was the german presentation at the 2006 architecture biennale , which was titled " convertible city . "
the team of curators , from the architecture firm gruentuch ernst , positioned a bright red staircase through the window on the side of the pavilion , which allowed visitors to climb up onto the roof .
from there , they had a magnificent view of venice . the project was a good idea , conceded arno sighard schmid , but not one that can be repeated over and over . constructing the staircase " was a difficult undertaking , but showed that the roof offers such wonderful possibilities , " said schmid .
" and that 's the reason i 've proposed that our current democratic republic should present itself abroad in other ways than what this pavilion allows . " ' history ca n't be erased ' however , the curator for next year 's art biennale , susanne gaensheimer , maintains that history ca n't just be torn down . " demolishing architecture does n't mean that you can change history , " said gaensheimer .
" on the contrary , we can use architecture to preserve our consciousness of history .

schlingensief , who is battling lung cancer , has not yet commented on his plans .
however , he has been quoted as saying that he wished the german pavilion could be erased with a mouse-click . gaensheimer does not interpret this to mean that schlingensief favors the destruction of the building . " i can imagine that he meant he would like to make this whole discussion disappear with the click of a mouse , " she said .

speaking a day after scoring a brace in germany 's 4-0 demolition of argentina in the quarters , klose said he had his eyes on becoming the all-time world cup top scorer .
" i want to score at least five goals at the world cup .
and i will be very satisfied if i score six , " klose told a news conference .
the 32-year-old scored five goals in world cups in 2002 and 2006 and has so far netted four times in the 2010 tournament .
that puts him one goal behind record scorer ronaldo of brazil , who netted 15 world cup goals between 1998 and 2006 .
measured , yet confident klose said that his team would n't get carried away after several resounding victories throughout the competition , including a 4-1 win over england and a 4-0 thumping of australia .
" spain is better than england and argentina , no question .
they are not unbeatable , and we will try to expose their weaknesses ...
we are better than 2008 and want to show that on the pitch , " said klose .
the germans will line up against spain without young forward thomas mueller , whose red-hot form has been one of the pillars of germany 's effectiveness .
the 20-year-old was given a yellow card in the win against argentina and will miss the semifinal clash .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller has been a revelation this world cup germany coach joachim loew sought to downplay worries over having to rejig his lineup , insisting he had enough talent at his disposal to cover the loss of mueller .
" it 's clear it 's a blow for us - he has shown himself to be dangerous in front of goal .
but we have players who can replace him , " loew said .
possible replacements for mueller include hamburg attacking midfielder piotr trochowski and young bayern attacker toni kroos , both of whom have been given game time in south africa .
stuttgart-based striker cacau is also an option , but rumors still persist about an abdominal muscle strain that kept him out of the quarterfinals .

that puts him one goal behind record scorer ronaldo of brazil , who netted 15 world cup goals between 1998 and 2006 .
measured , yet confident klose said that his team would n't get carried away after several resounding victories throughout the competition , including a 4-1 win over england and a 4-0 thumping of australia .
" spain is better than england and argentina , no question .
they are not unbeatable , and we will try to expose their weaknesses ...
we are better than 2008 and want to show that on the pitch , " said klose .
the germans will line up against spain without young forward thomas mueller , whose red-hot form has been one of the pillars of germany 's effectiveness .
the 20-year-old was given a yellow card in the win against argentina and will miss the semifinal clash .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller has been a revelation this world cup germany coach joachim loew sought to downplay worries over having to rejig his lineup , insisting he had enough talent at his disposal to cover the loss of mueller .
" it 's clear it 's a blow for us - he has shown himself to be dangerous in front of goal .
but we have players who can replace him , " loew said .
possible replacements for mueller include hamburg attacking midfielder piotr trochowski and young bayern attacker toni kroos , both of whom have been given game time in south africa .
stuttgart-based striker cacau is also an option , but rumors still persist about an abdominal muscle strain that kept him out of the quarterfinals .

opposition politicians have questioned why woerth never ordered a review while he was budget minister from 2007 to 2010 , suggesting it may have been because his wife then worked for the company that managed bettancourt 's wealth .
woerth has denied any wrongdoing and sarkozy has openly defended him .
leftist leaders say the furor over blanc and joyandet is a " fire shield " to distract voters from woerth 's ongoing difficulties .

the resignations from alain joyandet , state secretary for overseas development , and christian blanc , state secretary for the greater paris region , followed disclosures that both politicians had abused their office perks .
joyandet came under fire following press reports that he hired a private jet costing 116,500 euros to fly on official business to the caribbean , when he could have taken a regular scheduled flight .
he was also criticized last month over claims he was granted a permit illegally to build an extension to his house in saint tropez .
blanc 's office spent 12,000 euros -lrb- $ 14,680 -rrb- on cigars , and the minister himself admitted to smoking a third of them .
he was ordered to pay back the full bill . the revelations came as the french government was looking to promote ministerial sobriety and budget austerity in the face of a deficit set to hit a record high of eight percent of gdp .
sarkozy asserts authority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both blanc -lrb- l . -rrb- and joyandet resigned on sunday the resignations came as a surprise , as two days previously sarkozy had publicly criticized the two men 's behavior and made clear they would be removed from their posts in the next cabinet reshuffle in october .
but the president appeared unwilling to sacrifice his labor minister , eric woerth , who has also faced corruption accusations .
woerth has been the subject of daily scrutiny over the so-called ' bettancourt affair . '
french authorities have ordered a full review into the tax situation of liliane bettancourt , the 87-year-old heiress of the l 'oreal cosmetics group , after one of her advisors acknowledged there may have been financial irregularities .
opposition politicians have questioned why woerth never ordered a review while he was budget minister from 2007 to 2010 , suggesting it may have been because his wife then worked for the company that managed bettancourt 's wealth .
woerth has denied any wrongdoing and sarkozy has openly defended him .
leftist leaders say the furor over blanc and joyandet is a " fire shield " to distract voters from woerth 's ongoing difficulties .
in order for the state to save money , neither minister will be replaced .
sarkozy has also ordered that official use of planes and cars be restricted and departmental parties banned .

but this does n't mean ankara is turning its back on europe , says bahaeddin guengoer of deutsche welle 's turkish service . turkey can explain itself however it likes .
but its latest diplomatic actions - its " no " to iran sanctions in the un security council ; its goal of carrying out a zero-problem policy with all its neighbors - are being met in the west with anxious questions .
is turkey turning away from the west ?
does it see its future in the islamic camp ?
the answer to such questions is a definite " no . "
turkey is not turning its back on the west !
yes , the goal of eu accession is losing priority in ankara 's current policy .
turkey is acting with a new level of self-confidence in the international diplomatic arena , and no one should resent the country for trying to build up its status as a regional power - or for trying to look beyond the narrow confines of europe .
turkey seeks new responsibility tacticians from washington , brazil and brussels to tehran , the middle east and moscow have been trying to instrumentalize nato-member turkey to serve their own diplomatic goals for nearly 60 years .
now , turkey wants to take on more responsibility : in conflict regions like the middle east and the caucasus , as an arbitrator in atomic negotiations with iran , and not least as a reliable energy route for the west .
questioning whether turkey belongs in the european or the oriental camp is easy to understand - but its not justifiable .
since its founding nearly nine decades ago , the modern turkish republic has decided in favor of europe , and therefore , in favor of the west .
despite this , ankara ca n't look forward to being greeted with open arms in its efforts to join the european union - nor does the islamic world celebrate turkey 's western orientation .
its dialog with hamas as an unspoken condition for a dialog with iran , and its over-eager actions toward reprimanding israel , have led to a great deal of resentment in europe and the us - and at the same time , done serious damage to its relations with the jewish state .
two sides of a coin purely in terms of numbers , turkey has what it takes to back up its ambitions of strength .
the country has seen nearly 12 percent economic growth in the first quarter of the year , along with being the 16th-strongest economy in the world , and the 7th in europe .
but that is just one side of the coin .
on the other side is the growing polarization between the religious and the secular in a turkey whose population has yet to taste many of the fruits of economic growth .
the continuous lack of democratic process , the weak grasp of the concept of press freedom in a gray zone , or the unwillingness of prime minsiter erdogan to deal with criticism of either himself or his policies , are all alarming threats to domestic stability .
turkey belongs in europe !
europe and turkey need one another like never before .
turkey needs europe in order to build itself up as a regional power and to give it more weight in its influence on its neighbors .
for its part , without turkey , europe reduces its chances of succeeding in its global goals and strategies .
europe 's unified rejection of turkey needs to give way .
instead of explaining why turkey should n't accede to the eu , the heads of the european states should be racking their brains about how to make accession happen - or at least how to begin the process , since full membership is unlikely in the near future .
meanwhile , turkey is right to intensively build up its status as a regional power , instead of trying at all cost to become a member of a weaker , crisis-plagued eu .

but this does n't mean ankara is turning its back on europe , says bahaeddin guengoer of deutsche welle 's turkish service . turkey can explain itself however it likes .
but its latest diplomatic actions - its " no " to iran sanctions in the un security council ; its goal of carrying out a zero-problem policy with all its neighbors - are being met in the west with anxious questions .
is turkey turning away from the west ?
does it see its future in the islamic camp ?
the answer to such questions is a definite " no . "
turkey is not turning its back on the west !
yes , the goal of eu accession is losing priority in ankara 's current policy .
turkey is acting with a new level of self-confidence in the international diplomatic arena , and no one should resent the country for trying to build up its status as a regional power - or for trying to look beyond the narrow confines of europe .
turkey seeks new responsibility tacticians from washington , brazil and brussels to tehran , the middle east and moscow have been trying to instrumentalize nato-member turkey to serve their own diplomatic goals for nearly 60 years .
now , turkey wants to take on more responsibility : in conflict regions like the middle east and the caucasus , as an arbitrator in atomic negotiations with iran , and not least as a reliable energy route for the west .
questioning whether turkey belongs in the european or the oriental camp is easy to understand - but its not justifiable .
since its founding nearly nine decades ago , the modern turkish republic has decided in favor of europe , and therefore , in favor of the west .
despite this , ankara ca n't look forward to being greeted with open arms in its efforts to join the european union - nor does the islamic world celebrate turkey 's western orientation .
its dialog with hamas as an unspoken condition for a dialog with iran , and its over-eager actions toward reprimanding israel , have led to a great deal of resentment in europe and the us - and at the same time , done serious damage to its relations with the jewish state .
two sides of a coin purely in terms of numbers , turkey has what it takes to back up its ambitions of strength .
the country has seen nearly 12 percent economic growth in the first quarter of the year , along with being the 16th-strongest economy in the world , and the 7th in europe .
but that is just one side of the coin .
on the other side is the growing polarization between the religious and the secular in a turkey whose population has yet to taste many of the fruits of economic growth .
the continuous lack of democratic process , the weak grasp of the concept of press freedom in a gray zone , or the unwillingness of prime minsiter erdogan to deal with criticism of either himself or his policies , are all alarming threats to domestic stability .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 05.07.2010 netherlands , uruguay try to recapture past glory in first 2010 semifinal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of these teams will be playing on july 11 injuries and suspensions will force both the oranje and la celeste to improvise as they try to punch their ticket for the final .
and both will have to battle history in what could be a war of nerves . coming off their upset of brazil , and boasting a squad that features players from europe 's top clubs , holland are definitely the favorites .
but the dutch know all too well that in football , favorites do n't always win .
" we 're not strutting around all day doing the polonaise , " netherlands coach bert van marwijk said after his team 's stunning 2-1 defeat of the mighty selecao .
" we have n't yet reached our goal . "
holland are arguably soccer 's greatest underachievers .
the national team have never won a world cup and , despite consistently fielding some of the sport 's most innovative and entertaining teams , the last time they qualified for a final was way back in 1978 .
this time around they 're trying something different .
instead of total football , van marwijk - whose resume includes a stint at bundesliga side dortmund - has emphasized a control and efficiency reminiscent of past german teams .
bildunterschrift : the oranjes have been riding high without individual brilliance that has n't always sat well with free-wheeling stars like arjen robben , wesley sneijder and robin van persie , but it 's yielded results .
assistant coach frank de boer says the players have learned that winning ugly is better than losing beautifully .
" our goal was to gain stability , " de boer has told reporters .
" the team is mature and has internalized a system .
we 're now capable of getting off to poor starts and still winning matches . "
the oranje , however , will be missing two major sources of that stability , right-back gregory van der wiel and defensive midfielder nigel de jong , when they take to the pitch in cape town on tuesday .
both are suspended after picking up two yellow cards .
fortunately for the dutch , their opponents have far graver personnel issues .
bildunterschrift : suarez made a fine but costly save against ghana survival artists after his team 's heart-stopping victory over ghana on friday , uruguay coach oscar tabarez had spent much of his time defending striker luis suarez , whose last-second handball clearance would have done most goalkeepers proud - and earned the player a red card and a one-match ban .
now , tabarez will have to think about how to replace him - an unenviable task since none of his reserve strikers possess the pace or the touch of suarez .
much of the burden will fall on diego forlan .
uruguay 's one true superstar has had a stand-out tournament and has been one of the few players to be effective from distance .
but he 'll have to work harder than ever to create space for his shots .
bildunterschrift : forlan has been on the mark and the situation is even more troubling at the back .
left back jorge fucile is also suspended , while central defender and captain diego lugano is doubtful with a bruised knee - two potentially crushing blows for a defensively oriented team .
the main factor speaking for la celeste in this match is pride .
a two-time world cup winner -lrb- 1930 and 1950 -rrb- , uruguay has n't done this well since 1970 , and a trip to another final would be a massive achievement for a country of only 3.3 million inhabitants .
for that reason , holland are preaching caution .
" our next match is a very dangerous one , " van marwijk has said .
" uruguay 's players are tremendous fighters and survival artists . "
history in the making bildunterschrift : fans of both sides hope the party will continue given the personnel constellation , the likely course of this match is obvious .
the netherlands will have to attack while uruguay try to hang on , hoping for a goal against the run of play or a draw that would send the match to penalties .
the uglier the match , the better la celeste 's chances .
so uruguay are bound to try to irritate robben , sneijder and van persie with niggling fouls .
but can former reserves step up to fill the gaps and take some of the focus off forlan ?
uruguay 's captain , in any case , says the team is n't satisfied with just reaching the semis .
" we know that if we want to make history , we have to become champions , " diego lugano told reporters .
" we have two must-win matches to go .
it 's equally difficult and possible . "
the challenge for the oranje will be to keep their cool , stick with their game plan and trust that the superior quality will prevail , should they fail to break the match open with an early goal .
that 's a doable task - but one dutch sides have often been unequal to in the past .
one thing is certain : whichever team wins will reward long-suffering fans with their nation 's greatest world cup triumph in decades .
and that will add a bit of extra-tension to what 's already shaping up to be a nervy contest .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 05.07.2010 netherlands , uruguay try to recapture past glory in first 2010 semifinal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of these teams will be playing on july 11 injuries and suspensions will force both the oranje and la celeste to improvise as they try to punch their ticket for the final .
and both will have to battle history in what could be a war of nerves . coming off their upset of brazil , and boasting a squad that features players from europe 's top clubs , holland are definitely the favorites .
but the dutch know all too well that in football , favorites do n't always win .
" we 're not strutting around all day doing the polonaise , " netherlands coach bert van marwijk said after his team 's stunning 2-1 defeat of the mighty selecao .
" we have n't yet reached our goal . "
holland are arguably soccer 's greatest underachievers .
the national team have never won a world cup and , despite consistently fielding some of the sport 's most innovative and entertaining teams , the last time they qualified for a final was way back in 1978 .
this time around they 're trying something different .
instead of total football , van marwijk - whose resume includes a stint at bundesliga side dortmund - has emphasized a control and efficiency reminiscent of past german teams .
bildunterschrift : the oranjes have been riding high without individual brilliance that has n't always sat well with free-wheeling stars like arjen robben , wesley sneijder and robin van persie , but it 's yielded results .
assistant coach frank de boer says the players have learned that winning ugly is better than losing beautifully .
" our goal was to gain stability , " de boer has told reporters .
" the team is mature and has internalized a system .
we 're now capable of getting off to poor starts and still winning matches . "
the oranje , however , will be missing two major sources of that stability , right-back gregory van der wiel and defensive midfielder nigel de jong , when they take to the pitch in cape town on tuesday .
both are suspended after picking up two yellow cards .
fortunately for the dutch , their opponents have far graver personnel issues .
bildunterschrift : suarez made a fine but costly save against ghana survival artists after his team 's heart-stopping victory over ghana on friday , uruguay coach oscar tabarez had spent much of his time defending striker luis suarez , whose last-second handball clearance would have done most goalkeepers proud - and earned the player a red card and a one-match ban .
now , tabarez will have to think about how to replace him - an unenviable task since none of his reserve strikers possess the pace or the touch of suarez .
much of the burden will fall on diego forlan .
uruguay 's one true superstar has had a stand-out tournament and has been one of the few players to be effective from distance .
but he 'll have to work harder than ever to create space for his shots .
bildunterschrift : forlan has been on the mark and the situation is even more troubling at the back .
left back jorge fucile is also suspended , while central defender and captain diego lugano is doubtful with a bruised knee - two potentially crushing blows for a defensively oriented team .
the main factor speaking for la celeste in this match is pride .
a two-time world cup winner -lrb- 1930 and 1950 -rrb- , uruguay has n't done this well since 1970 , and a trip to another final would be a massive achievement for a country of only 3.3 million inhabitants .
for that reason , holland are preaching caution .
" our next match is a very dangerous one , " van marwijk has said .
" uruguay 's players are tremendous fighters and survival artists . "
history in the making bildunterschrift : fans of both sides hope the party will continue given the personnel constellation , the likely course of this match is obvious .
the netherlands will have to attack while uruguay try to hang on , hoping for a goal against the run of play or a draw that would send the match to penalties .
the uglier the match , the better la celeste 's chances .
so uruguay are bound to try to irritate robben , sneijder and van persie with niggling fouls .
but can former reserves step up to fill the gaps and take some of the focus off forlan ?
uruguay 's captain , in any case , says the team is n't satisfied with just reaching the semis .
" we know that if we want to make history , we have to become champions , " diego lugano told reporters .
" we have two must-win matches to go .
it 's equally difficult and possible . "
the challenge for the oranje will be to keep their cool , stick with their game plan and trust that the superior quality will prevail , should they fail to break the match open with an early goal .
that 's a doable task - but one dutch sides have often been unequal to in the past .
one thing is certain : whichever team wins will reward long-suffering fans with their nation 's greatest world cup triumph in decades .
and that will add a bit of extra-tension to what 's already shaping up to be a nervy contest .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 05.07.2010 daimler plans electric motor scooter großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carmakers see market for city electric motor scooters daimler plans an electric scooter as the carmaker moves to build different types of electric vehicles for different market segments .
it 's not the first motorcycle , by the way , to come from the stuttgart-based car icon . the news came from the top .
in a television program over the weekend , daimler chief executive officer dieter zetsche said the german carmaker " will soon present an e-scooter . "
while many daimler car fans may wonder why the company would want to add e-scooters to its premium car and truck-dominated product portfolio , car analysts are n't surprised by the move .
" it 's all about the e-mobility push by the car industry , " christoph stuermer , an auto analyst with ihs global insight in frankfurt , told deutsche welle .
" a key element of this strategy is to build specific vehicles , like e-scooters , for specific market segments , such as short-distance travel in urban areas .
daimler aims to fill all these segments with products . "
bildunterschrift : lithium-ion batteries are powering a new wave of e-scooters global effort daimler spokeswoman eva wiese batted down speculation that daimler may hand over development of the new e-scooter to its new chinese electric vehicle partner , byd , which is specialized in car battery and drive technology .
" we will develop the e-scooter ourselves , using components , of course , from our global network of suppliers , " wiese told deutsche welle .
" it will be a global product , as all our products are . "
while motorcycle manufacturing , arguably , has not been a core competency of daimler , company co-founder gottlieb daimler is credited with having invented the first gasoline engine-powered motorcycle in 1885 .
essentially , it was a four-stroke internal combustion engine mounted on a wooden bicycle .
bmw and peugeot with head start much has happened in the way of motorcycle development since then , most recently in the area of electrically powered systems .
and perhaps to the dismay of daimler , some of its major competitors in europe , including bmw and peugeot , have a head start .
in the early 2000s , bmw launched the c1 , an enclosed scooter with many innovative features to protect the rider in an accident .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler now offers an electric version of its smart urban car last year , bmw , which manufacturers both cars and motorcycles , also unveiled an electric version of the scooter for the european safer urban motorcycling project .
the electric motor is powered by a lithium-ion battery with sufficient power for most inner-city driving conditions .
french carmaker peugeot , which mass-produced its first e-scooter 15 years ago , has launched yet another , the e-vivacity .
it is also equipped with lithium-ion battery capable of covering up to 100 kilometers on the road .
" it 's a logical move for daimler to build an e-scooter , " stuermer said .
" the company is engineering an electrical version of its smart urban car and hybrid models of its sedans for longer distances .
and now it plans a light vehicle for short city trips .
it 's filling all the gaps . "

dw ’ s bartosz dudek sees komorowski ’ s win as a victory for europe . president-elect bronislaw komorowski and his liberal conservative party civic platform stand for a europe-friendly and future-oriented poland .
they also value dialogue and compromise in their political dealings .
but defeated presidential candidate jaroslaw kaczynski also achieved considerable success in this election .
his 47 percent of the vote is a political base upon which his conservative law and justice party can build upon in the next parliamentary elections in 2011 .
komorowski 's kingmakers were poland 's left-of-center voters .
though rival jaroslaw kaczynski made a leftist , populist turn at the end of his campaign , it simply was not enough to win over left-of-center voters .
even kaczynski 's praise of communist-era social policies could not sway them .
two-thirds of the left-of-center voters marked komorowski 's name on their ballots , making him the country 's next president .
the close result of the election also demonstrates to what extent poland is politically divided .
while komorowski 's campaign spoke to younger , educated , urban voters , kaczynski tended to attract older , less educated and more rural voters .
there can also be no talk of true defeat in this election because , as leader of the largest opposition party , the power-hungry kaczynski will long remain a serious rival to liberal-conservative prime minister donald tusk and president-elect bronislaw komorowski .
therefore , kaczynski 's success at the polls must be heeded as a warning .
the path for kaczynski 's return to power would already be paved , should warsaw 's current coalition government wind up presiding over corruption , rising joblessness , or harsh social policies .
if kaczynski were to return as poland 's prime minister , he could throw poland back into the domestic and foreign confrontations that once dominated the country 's politics .
so komorowski 's election is not only good news not only poland but also for german-polish relations and for europe as a whole .
a cheerful , aimiable polish president with foreign affairs experience and good relations with other european leaders will make poland a stable pillar of european politics . this bodes well for the polish eu presidency in 2011 and the beleaguered european union .

as the nobel laureate gets older , concerns are mounting over his succession . the present dalai lama tenzin gyatso fled tibet in 1959 following a failed uprising against chinese rule .
he has since been living in the northern indian town of dharamsala .
many tibetans revere him as a living god and therefore the issue of his succession is sensitive as well as complicated . " traditionally the dalai lama has been both a monk and also the head of the state in tibet , " explains paul williams , an expert at the university of bristol .
" in addition , the dalai lama is someone who is considered by the tibetans to be spiritually so advanced that when he dies it is possible for him to control his reincarnation .
of course , tibetans and other buddhists believe in reincarnation .
so when we talk about the successor to the dalai lama , do we mean the person who will be considered to be the reincarnation of the current dalai lama or do we mean by the successor to the dalai lama who will be considered to be politically the head of the tibetan government in exile ? "
bildunterschrift : dharamsala , the seat of the tibetan government in exile political responsibilities the current dalai lama has however in recent years clearly separated his political responsibility from his spiritual work .
" as far as his political responsibilities are concerned , his holiness says he is in semi-retirement , " says thubten samphel , the spokesperson of the tibetan government in exile .
" he has passed on much of his political responsibilities to the elected leadership . the spiritual responsibilities of his holiness the dalai lama will be a carried on by his successor . " yet it remains unclear how the tibetans in exile will actually choose his successor .
thubten samphel says the elected political leadership will oversee the succession process .
the spiritual leader himself has indicated in the past that his successor could be appointed before his death or even democratically elected .
thubten samphel explains the provision is there , but the final decision is in the hands of the dalai lama only : " there is a legacy in tibetan history to recognize and incarnate the dalai lama before his predecessor passes away .
this tradition is there .
but at this moment i can not say whether this will be carried forward by his holiness .
it is for his holiness to decide . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese-appointed panchen lama in lhasa chinese interference the succession issue has become pricklier ever since the dalai lama anointed a six year old child as the reincarnation of the panchen lama , the second-most powerful figure in tibetan buddhism in 1995 .
the child soon disappeared and beijing chose its own panchen lama .
observers say that the communist and largely atheist chinese leadership is likely to actively interfere and manipulate things again after the dalai lama dies and will install its own leader . " the chinese could say we have discovered the correct , the real reincarnation . he is here in tibet with us and we are going to train him , bring him up and when he is older we will announce to everyone that this is the dalai lama and he should be the head of tibet of course under chinese control , " says paul williams . the heat can already be felt as a senior chinese leader last week said that all the reincarnations of tibetan spiritual leaders must be approved by the central government in beijing . author : disha uppal editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

two turkish newspapers had quoted davutoglu as saying ties with israel would be severed unless turkey received an apology for the flotilla raid or israel accepted the outcome of an independent inquiry into the incident .
in response to davutoglu 's alleged remarks , israeli foreign minister avigdor lieberman said during a trip to latvia that israel did n't " have any intention to apologize . "
later on monday , however , a spokesman for the turkish government told the reuters news agency that davutoglu had been misquoted in the newspaper reports .
the official claimed that davutoglu actually said that relations with israel would not improve if an apology was not issued .
the two countries have been on bad terms since the may 31 raid on a gaza-bound aid flotilla .
nine turkish nationals died after israeli military personnel boarded one of the ships . each side subsequently blamed the other for starting the violent confrontation .

defense analysts suggest the region is still a major concern . if the german defense ministry is to be believed , the terrorist threat in the sea off the horn of africa has been reduced so significantly that it sees no further reason to deploy its force of 90 marines and a navy reconnaissance plane as part of the us-led operation enduring freedom .
due to an assessment that claims that the threat is now ' limited , ' germany has ended its involvement six months earlier than its mandate stipulated .
germany has been involved in the operation enduring freedom as part of the mission aimed at stopping islamic terrorists smuggling arms to groups in africa from the arabian peninsula for over eight years .
the german navy joined the task force in february 2002 , some five months after the united states established the operation after the 9/11 attacks on new york and washington .
with the last german troops completing their tours of duty in the gulf of aden and the indian ocean last week , germany 's naval focus now shifts to the mediterranean .
one german navy frigate will remain off the coast of africa as part of operation atalanta , a european union mission to protect aid shipments into somalia from pirate attack .
however , with increased al qaeda activity being reported across the gulf of aden in yemen , affiliated islamist groups continuing to battle for control of somalia and reports that osama bin laden 's terror network is extending its influence into kenya , the german decision has caused some surprise among security analysts .
somalia at the heart of region 's spreading extremism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al shabab is fighting to install an islamic caliphate in somalia " the terrorist threat emanating from the horn of africa is limited at the moment , " jeremy binnie , a terrorism expert at jane 's defence group , told deutsche welle .
" however , there is a lot of concern that somalia might turn into something akin to taliban-controlled afghanistan in the 1990s .
the pro-al qaeda group there , the shabab , controls much of the south of the country and is currently threatening to overrun mogadishu .
the only thing stopping them is a small force of african peacekeepers .
so there are worries that southern somalia could become a safe haven for jihadists from other countries and a base for training . "
" there are already indications that the shabab is being supported by a small number of foreign jihadists and has recruited possibly hundreds of young men from europe and north america , most of them somalis , " binnie added .
" there have also been a few reports of yemen-based al qaeda operatives turning up in somalia .
the worry is that these guys could be used to carry out international terrorist attacks . "
" at the same time , there are worries about the geographical proximity between somalia and yemen , meaning it is possible that the shabab will link up with bin laden 's yemeni branch , al qaeda on the arabian peninsula . "
yemen supply lines still bringing arms , personnel to africa last year 's failed bombing of a detroit-bound airliner by an al qaeda suspect with links to yemen highlighted the country 's growing reputation as the new hub for terrorism in the region .
yemen is a blueprint nation for radical islamists ; it has a weak government , it is deeply divided by a tribalistic and violent civil war which is pushing the country toward the status of a failed state and has a culture in which most men carry weapons , therefore making identifying terrorists extremely difficult .
the land of osama bin laden 's ancestors has also become a melting pot of refugees from the conflict in somalia and returning jihadists from the wars in afghanistan and iraq .
with africa in its sights , it is thought that al qaeda sees yemen as an ideal staging point for fanning the flames of extremism across the gulf of aden in somalia and beyond .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda has targeted kenya since the us embassy attack despite having a less direct shipping connection to yemen than somalia , sharing a border with the failed state puts kenya at risk of infiltration by islamist terror groups .
instead of having to navigate through the international forces in indian ocean to reach the kenyan coastline , arab-based terrorists can smuggle weapons and personnel overland to kenya via somalia .
it has been reported for as long as germany was part of operation enduring freedom that al qaeda was seeking a foothold in kenya and that al qaeda operatives had infiltrated the country 's islamic communities on its indian ocean coast .
poor relations between kenya 's coastal muslims and the country 's inefficient security forces have provided al qaeda with a new base from which it can extend its growing network throughout eastern africa .
inland in kenya , border camps filled with refugees from somalia are reported to be just as fertile a breeding ground for young extremists .
meanwhile , kenya has its own home grown terror problem .
the kenyan saleh ali saleh nabhan was alleged to have been the leader of al qaeda in somalia and the mastermind behind the bombing of the paradise hotel in mombasa and the attempted downing of an israeli passenger jet in november 2002 .
he was also suspected of involvement in the 1998 us embassy bombings in nairobi and dar es salaam in tanzania .
he was killed by us special forces near mogadishu in september 2009 .
changing face of mission shifts threat focus david hartwell , an expert and risk analyst for the middle east and north africa , believes that the changing nature of operation enduring freedom has shifted the focus away from its original mission meaning that the horn of africa and land-based threats are now longer in its remit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops will leave but the threat will remain " the germans have made a fair assessment on enduring freedom but it 's one based on the level of threat within the operation 's initial mission which was to capture fleeing extremists and taliban from afghanistan and stop them getting to places like yemen , saudi arabia and oman , " hartwell told deutsche welle . " in its original form , it has n't recorded that many successes as there have been few significant arrests of wanted figures on the seas .
as such , enduring freedom has mutated into the anti-piracy mission which is having more success in containing the pirates .
but it has been agreed that there is less of a need for naval forces to be searching for fleeing extremists now , especially in the gulf of aden and indian ocean . " " the region itself is still unstable with civil wars and extremism in both somalia and yemen but those involved in enduring freedom are wary of getting involved in the internal politics in these countries so we 'll see more countries following germany 's decision and refocusing on the piracy mission , " he added . author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , the federal chamber of german architects -lrb- bak -rrb- has started a debate about the building 's future . the german pavilion building - situated in the southern part of venice 's giardini park , where the biennale is held - is not particularly inviting .
the entry is large , with four imposing pillars supporting a heavy-looking roof .

he wants to see it torn down , saying that it is " neither suitable for art , nor for architecture " and has " no connection to the venetian skyline . " instead , he finds that it reflects the character of the nazi era , which brings an emotional aspect into the debate . the german pavilion was first erected in 1909 as the bavarian pavilion , based on the designs of a venetian architect .
with its ionic-style columns , it bore a resemblance to an ancient temple .
in 1938 , it was altered to reflect the nazi regime 's aesthetic ideals . then , in 1993 , german conceptual artist hans haacke smashed the travertine floor of the pavilion 's hall , where hitler and mussolini had once stood , leaving the fragments lying on the ground .
he called the work " failed hope . " a place for expression but according to susanne gaensheimer , director of the frankfurt museum for modern art and curator of the 2011 art biennale - the building is suitable for showcasing contemporary art , though it does represent a challenge for the artists . " there are many examples of exhibition halls with ideological or ideology-related architecture that show that this very confrontation with architecture has led to fantastic projects and artworks , " said gaensheimer .

is it a hindrance to artists that should be demolished , or a piece of history that should be preserved ? in a few weeks , people from around the world will flock to venice for the 12th venice biennale of architecture , which showcases new projects by big-name architects and designers . altogether , 28 national pavilions will be open to visitors , including the controversial german pavilion , which is a prime example of nazi architecture .
now , the federal chamber of german architects -lrb- bak -rrb- has started a debate about the building 's future . the german pavilion building - situated in the southern part of venice 's giardini park , where the biennale is held - is not particularly inviting .
the entry is large , with four imposing pillars supporting a heavy-looking roof .
the room inside has windows high above the ground , not offering any views of the surrounding area . ' unsuitable for art ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biennale takes places in venice 's giardini arno sighard schmid , president of the federal chamber of german architects , does not think that the temple-like nazi-era building represents modern germany .
he wants to see it torn down , saying that it is " neither suitable for art , nor for architecture " and has " no connection to the venetian skyline . " instead , he finds that it reflects the character of the nazi era , which brings an emotional aspect into the debate . the german pavilion was first erected in 1909 as the bavarian pavilion , based on the designs of a venetian architect .
with its ionic-style columns , it bore a resemblance to an ancient temple .
in 1938 , it was altered to reflect the nazi regime 's aesthetic ideals . then , in 1993 , german conceptual artist hans haacke smashed the travertine floor of the pavilion 's hall , where hitler and mussolini had once stood , leaving the fragments lying on the ground .
he called the work " failed hope . " a place for expression but according to susanne gaensheimer , director of the frankfurt museum for modern art and curator of the 2011 art biennale - the building is suitable for showcasing contemporary art , though it does represent a challenge for the artists . " there are many examples of exhibition halls with ideological or ideology-related architecture that show that this very confrontation with architecture has led to fantastic projects and artworks , " said gaensheimer .
" you need to differentiate between the outer architecture and what happens on the inside . " fantastic works of art have been presented in the german pavilion , she added - " and that is what represents this country . " bildunterschrift : in 2006 , the german curator team highlighted the most attractive aspect of the pavilion : the roof one example was the german presentation at the 2006 architecture biennale , which was titled " convertible city . "
the team of curators , from the architecture firm gruentuch ernst , positioned a bright red staircase through the window on the side of the pavilion , which allowed visitors to climb up onto the roof .
from there , they had a magnificent view of venice . the project was a good idea , conceded arno sighard schmid , but not one that can be repeated over and over . constructing the staircase " was a difficult undertaking , but showed that the roof offers such wonderful possibilities , " said schmid .
" and that 's the reason i 've proposed that our current democratic republic should present itself abroad in other ways than what this pavilion allows . " ' history ca n't be erased ' however , the curator for next year 's art biennale , susanne gaensheimer , maintains that history ca n't just be torn down . " demolishing architecture does n't mean that you can change history , " said gaensheimer .
" on the contrary , we can use architecture to preserve our consciousness of history . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlingensief has n't yet commented on his plans for the german pavilion in 2011 the curator has invited german performance artist christoph schlingensief to design the pavilion for 2011 .
schlingensief , who is battling lung cancer , has not yet commented on his plans .
however , he has been quoted as saying that he wished the german pavilion could be erased with a mouse-click . gaensheimer does not interpret this to mean that schlingensief favors the destruction of the building . " i can imagine that he meant he would like to make this whole discussion disappear with the click of a mouse , " she said .
" that 's what holds us up , always getting caught up in this discussion . " in his personal blog , schlingensief has called the idea of tearing down the pavilion " idiotic , " saying it was just a quick , unimaginative solution . author : sigrid hoff -lrb- ew / kjb -rrb- editor : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

komorowski beat jaroslaw kaczynski by a margin of seven percent of the vote . liberal parliamentary speaker and acting president bronislaw komorowski has won poland 's presidential run-off election . with all votes counted , komorowski earned 53 percent of the vote , while his opponent , nationalist opposition leader jaroslaw kaczynski , gained 47 percent of the votes , according to the election commission . jaroslaw is the twin brother of former president lech kaczynski , who died in a plane crash on april 10 .
the election was triggered by the former leader 's sudden death , along with his wife and 95 others , in the crash . sunday 's election followed a first round of voting on june 20 , in which neither candidate secured a majority . ' good for poland ' on hearing early results , a beaming komorowski said that polish democracy had emerged the winner . " today democracy has won , our polish democracy , " komorowski said before a crowd of cheering supporters , adding that it was " important not to foment divisions , but to build a sense of unity . " kaczynski admitted defeat shortly after komorowski 's speech . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski has performed better than expected " i congratulate the winner .
i congratulate bronislaw komorowski , " kaczynski said from his campaign headquarters . german foreign minister guido westerwelle also offered his congratulations , describing the result as a step in the right direction for closer cooperation between poland and europe . " the polish people 's decision to elect komorowski is a strong pro-european signal , " westerwelle said in berlin .
" with president komorowski , as well as prime minister donald tusk and foreign minister radoslaw sikorski , we will have a strong partner for our path of trust and cooperation . " high turnout prior to the run-off election there were growing fears that the start of summer holidays in poland would make voters prefer baltic beaches to polling stations , though this did not materialize . at 52 percent , turnout was much higher than expected .
analysts said it was a clear sign of the mobilization of the two electorates : the traditional , conservative , euroskeptic and mostly rural supporters of kaczynski , and the more reform-minded , pro-european urban voters .
that division was apparent in a sampling of views among voters in warsaw . " we just need to stop kaczynski from winning .
he 's stuck in the past and he 's bad for poland 's position in the eu , " a young businessman told deutsche welle at a polling station in the leafy middle class warsaw suburb of jozefoslaw . " komorowski , together with the reformist prime minister , donald tusk , will lead us deeper into europe . "
however , a retired teacher offered this opinion of komorowski as she cast her ballot : " -lsb- he -rsb- represents those smug businesspeople who have been allowed to thrive at the expense of us pensioners .
i 'm voting for kaczynski , because he cares for people like me .
he 's a patriot who holds national values dear . ” european integration versus national values bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : komorowski insists poland must be closer to germany and france komorowski is a close ally of the prime minister .
both men argue that poland needs economic liberalization to maintain economic growth - the country was the only eu member to avoid recession last year , although growth slowed to 1.8 percent from 5 percent in 2008 . ahead of the run-off vote , kaczynski accused them both of plotting to privatize national health care and sell the country out to foreign investors at the expense of the poor .
komorowski has however insisted that european integration was his highest priority . " the number one issue is poland 's eu membership , strengthening its position there , developing the weimar triangle relationship with germany and france and building reconciliation with russia , " he said in a televised debate . " it is also in poland 's interests to serve as a champion of european integration with countries further east . " euroskeptic and nationalist kaczynski took a more nationalist tone .
while giving few specifics on foreign policy , he clearly stated his plans to carry on his late brother 's policies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : komorowski has secured the presidency " i wo n't let poland be treated as a minor partner by any other country in europe , " he said in the debate .
" foreign policy , which should clearly be the domain of the polish president , requires that the principle of sovereignty should be clearly adhered to , which does n't always happen under the present government . " critics say his unabashed euroskepticism , which he championed during his term as prime minister from 2006 to 2007 , alienated poland 's neighbors .
he said he currently has no interest in adopting the euro , pointing out that the free-floating zloty has helped poland ride out the economic crisis . " if we had pushed for the euro as the government wanted , we would today be in an economic catastrophe , " he said . author : david levitz / rafal kiepuszewski -lrb- reuters , afp , ap -rrb- editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

speaking a day after scoring a brace in germany 's 4-0 demolition of argentina in the quarters , klose said he had his eyes on becoming the all-time world cup top scorer .
" i want to score at least five goals at the world cup .
and i will be very satisfied if i score six , " klose told a news conference .
the 32-year-old scored five goals in world cups in 2002 and 2006 and has so far netted four times in the 2010 tournament .
that puts him one goal behind record scorer ronaldo of brazil , who netted 15 world cup goals between 1998 and 2006 .
measured , yet confident klose said that his team would n't get carried away after several resounding victories throughout the competition , including a 4-1 win over england and a 4-0 thumping of australia .
" spain is better than england and argentina , no question .
they are not unbeatable , and we will try to expose their weaknesses ...
we are better than 2008 and want to show that on the pitch , " said klose .
the germans will line up against spain without young forward thomas mueller , whose red-hot form has been one of the pillars of germany 's effectiveness .
the 20-year-old was given a yellow card in the win against argentina and will miss the semifinal clash .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller has been a revelation this world cup germany coach joachim loew sought to downplay worries over having to rejig his lineup , insisting he had enough talent at his disposal to cover the loss of mueller .
" it 's clear it 's a blow for us - he has shown himself to be dangerous in front of goal .
but we have players who can replace him , " loew said .
possible replacements for mueller include hamburg attacking midfielder piotr trochowski and young bayern attacker toni kroos , both of whom have been given game time in south africa .
stuttgart-based striker cacau is also an option , but rumors still persist about an abdominal muscle strain that kept him out of the quarterfinals .

dw ’ s bartosz dudek sees komorowski ’ s win as a victory for europe . president-elect bronislaw komorowski and his liberal conservative party civic platform stand for a europe-friendly and future-oriented poland .
they also value dialogue and compromise in their political dealings .
but defeated presidential candidate jaroslaw kaczynski also achieved considerable success in this election .
his 47 percent of the vote is a political base upon which his conservative law and justice party can build upon in the next parliamentary elections in 2011 .
komorowski 's kingmakers were poland 's left-of-center voters .
though rival jaroslaw kaczynski made a leftist , populist turn at the end of his campaign , it simply was not enough to win over left-of-center voters .
even kaczynski 's praise of communist-era social policies could not sway them .
two-thirds of the left-of-center voters marked komorowski 's name on their ballots , making him the country 's next president .
the close result of the election also demonstrates to what extent poland is politically divided .
while komorowski 's campaign spoke to younger , educated , urban voters , kaczynski tended to attract older , less educated and more rural voters .
there can also be no talk of true defeat in this election because , as leader of the largest opposition party , the power-hungry kaczynski will long remain a serious rival to liberal-conservative prime minister donald tusk and president-elect bronislaw komorowski .
therefore , kaczynski 's success at the polls must be heeded as a warning .
the path for kaczynski 's return to power would already be paved , should warsaw 's current coalition government wind up presiding over corruption , rising joblessness , or harsh social policies .
if kaczynski were to return as poland 's prime minister , he could throw poland back into the domestic and foreign confrontations that once dominated the country 's politics .
so komorowski 's election is not only good news not only poland but also for german-polish relations and for europe as a whole .
a cheerful , aimiable polish president with foreign affairs experience and good relations with other european leaders will make poland a stable pillar of european politics . this bodes well for the polish eu presidency in 2011 and the beleaguered european union .

two turkish newspapers had quoted davutoglu as saying ties with israel would be severed unless turkey received an apology for the flotilla raid or israel accepted the outcome of an independent inquiry into the incident .
in response to davutoglu 's alleged remarks , israeli foreign minister avigdor lieberman said during a trip to latvia that israel did n't " have any intention to apologize . "
later on monday , however , a spokesman for the turkish government told the reuters news agency that davutoglu had been misquoted in the newspaper reports .
the official claimed that davutoglu actually said that relations with israel would not improve if an apology was not issued .
the two countries have been on bad terms since the may 31 raid on a gaza-bound aid flotilla .
nine turkish nationals died after israeli military personnel boarded one of the ships . each side subsequently blamed the other for starting the violent confrontation .

dw ’ s bartosz dudek sees komorowski ’ s win as a victory for europe . president-elect bronislaw komorowski and his liberal conservative party civic platform stand for a europe-friendly and future-oriented poland .
they also value dialogue and compromise in their political dealings .
but defeated presidential candidate jaroslaw kaczynski also achieved considerable success in this election .
his 47 percent of the vote is a political base upon which his conservative law and justice party can build upon in the next parliamentary elections in 2011 .
komorowski 's kingmakers were poland 's left-of-center voters .
though rival jaroslaw kaczynski made a leftist , populist turn at the end of his campaign , it simply was not enough to win over left-of-center voters .
even kaczynski 's praise of communist-era social policies could not sway them .
two-thirds of the left-of-center voters marked komorowski 's name on their ballots , making him the country 's next president .
the close result of the election also demonstrates to what extent poland is politically divided .
while komorowski 's campaign spoke to younger , educated , urban voters , kaczynski tended to attract older , less educated and more rural voters .
there can also be no talk of true defeat in this election because , as leader of the largest opposition party , the power-hungry kaczynski will long remain a serious rival to liberal-conservative prime minister donald tusk and president-elect bronislaw komorowski .
therefore , kaczynski 's success at the polls must be heeded as a warning .
the path for kaczynski 's return to power would already be paved , should warsaw 's current coalition government wind up presiding over corruption , rising joblessness , or harsh social policies .
if kaczynski were to return as poland 's prime minister , he could throw poland back into the domestic and foreign confrontations that once dominated the country 's politics .
so komorowski 's election is not only good news not only poland but also for german-polish relations and for europe as a whole .
a cheerful , aimiable polish president with foreign affairs experience and good relations with other european leaders will make poland a stable pillar of european politics . this bodes well for the polish eu presidency in 2011 and the beleaguered european union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 05.07.2010 french junior ministers resign over perks scandals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one politician lost his job over a penchant for cigars two french junior ministers have resigned over spending scandals , as the government attempts to regain political credibility following a series of setbacks . french president nicolas sarkozy has accepted the resignation of two of his junior ministers after separate spending scandals .
the resignations from alain joyandet , state secretary for overseas development , and christian blanc , state secretary for the greater paris region , followed disclosures that both politicians had abused their office perks .
joyandet came under fire following press reports that he hired a private jet costing 116,500 euros to fly on official business to the caribbean , when he could have taken a regular scheduled flight .
he was also criticized last month over claims he was granted a permit illegally to build an extension to his house in saint tropez .
blanc 's office spent 12,000 euros -lrb- $ 14,680 -rrb- on cigars , and the minister himself admitted to smoking a third of them .
he was ordered to pay back the full bill . the revelations came as the french government was looking to promote ministerial sobriety and budget austerity in the face of a deficit set to hit a record high of eight percent of gdp .
sarkozy asserts authority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both blanc -lrb- l . -rrb- and joyandet resigned on sunday the resignations came as a surprise , as two days previously sarkozy had publicly criticized the two men 's behavior and made clear they would be removed from their posts in the next cabinet reshuffle in october .
but the president appeared unwilling to sacrifice his labor minister , eric woerth , who has also faced corruption accusations .
woerth has been the subject of daily scrutiny over the so-called ' bettancourt affair . '
french authorities have ordered a full review into the tax situation of liliane bettancourt , the 87-year-old heiress of the l 'oreal cosmetics group , after one of her advisors acknowledged there may have been financial irregularities .
opposition politicians have questioned why woerth never ordered a review while he was budget minister from 2007 to 2010 , suggesting it may have been because his wife then worked for the company that managed bettancourt 's wealth .
woerth has denied any wrongdoing and sarkozy has openly defended him .
leftist leaders say the furor over blanc and joyandet is a " fire shield " to distract voters from woerth 's ongoing difficulties .
in order for the state to save money , neither minister will be replaced .
sarkozy has also ordered that official use of planes and cars be restricted and departmental parties banned .

speaking a day after scoring a brace in germany 's 4-0 demolition of argentina in the quarters , klose said he had his eyes on becoming the all-time world cup top scorer .
" i want to score at least five goals at the world cup .
and i will be very satisfied if i score six , " klose told a news conference .
the 32-year-old scored five goals in world cups in 2002 and 2006 and has so far netted four times in the 2010 tournament .
that puts him one goal behind record scorer ronaldo of brazil , who netted 15 world cup goals between 1998 and 2006 .
measured , yet confident klose said that his team would n't get carried away after several resounding victories throughout the competition , including a 4-1 win over england and a 4-0 thumping of australia .
" spain is better than england and argentina , no question .
they are not unbeatable , and we will try to expose their weaknesses ...
we are better than 2008 and want to show that on the pitch , " said klose .
the germans will line up against spain without young forward thomas mueller , whose red-hot form has been one of the pillars of germany 's effectiveness .
the 20-year-old was given a yellow card in the win against argentina and will miss the semifinal clash .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller has been a revelation this world cup germany coach joachim loew sought to downplay worries over having to rejig his lineup , insisting he had enough talent at his disposal to cover the loss of mueller .
" it 's clear it 's a blow for us - he has shown himself to be dangerous in front of goal .
but we have players who can replace him , " loew said .
possible replacements for mueller include hamburg attacking midfielder piotr trochowski and young bayern attacker toni kroos , both of whom have been given game time in south africa .
stuttgart-based striker cacau is also an option , but rumors still persist about an abdominal muscle strain that kept him out of the quarterfinals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 05.07.2010 netherlands , uruguay try to recapture past glory in first 2010 semifinal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of these teams will be playing on july 11 injuries and suspensions will force both the oranje and la celeste to improvise as they try to punch their ticket for the final .
and both will have to battle history in what could be a war of nerves . coming off their upset of brazil , and boasting a squad that features players from europe 's top clubs , holland are definitely the favorites .
but the dutch know all too well that in football , favorites do n't always win .
" we 're not strutting around all day doing the polonaise , " netherlands coach bert van marwijk said after his team 's stunning 2-1 defeat of the mighty selecao .
" we have n't yet reached our goal . "
holland are arguably soccer 's greatest underachievers .
the national team have never won a world cup and , despite consistently fielding some of the sport 's most innovative and entertaining teams , the last time they qualified for a final was way back in 1978 .
this time around they 're trying something different .
instead of total football , van marwijk - whose resume includes a stint at bundesliga side dortmund - has emphasized a control and efficiency reminiscent of past german teams .
bildunterschrift : the oranjes have been riding high without individual brilliance that has n't always sat well with free-wheeling stars like arjen robben , wesley sneijder and robin van persie , but it 's yielded results .
assistant coach frank de boer says the players have learned that winning ugly is better than losing beautifully .
" our goal was to gain stability , " de boer has told reporters .
" the team is mature and has internalized a system .
we 're now capable of getting off to poor starts and still winning matches . "
the oranje , however , will be missing two major sources of that stability , right-back gregory van der wiel and defensive midfielder nigel de jong , when they take to the pitch in cape town on tuesday .
both are suspended after picking up two yellow cards .
fortunately for the dutch , their opponents have far graver personnel issues .
bildunterschrift : suarez made a fine but costly save against ghana survival artists after his team 's heart-stopping victory over ghana on friday , uruguay coach oscar tabarez had spent much of his time defending striker luis suarez , whose last-second handball clearance would have done most goalkeepers proud - and earned the player a red card and a one-match ban .
now , tabarez will have to think about how to replace him - an unenviable task since none of his reserve strikers possess the pace or the touch of suarez .
much of the burden will fall on diego forlan .
uruguay 's one true superstar has had a stand-out tournament and has been one of the few players to be effective from distance .
but he 'll have to work harder than ever to create space for his shots .
bildunterschrift : forlan has been on the mark and the situation is even more troubling at the back .
left back jorge fucile is also suspended , while central defender and captain diego lugano is doubtful with a bruised knee - two potentially crushing blows for a defensively oriented team .
the main factor speaking for la celeste in this match is pride .
a two-time world cup winner -lrb- 1930 and 1950 -rrb- , uruguay has n't done this well since 1970 , and a trip to another final would be a massive achievement for a country of only 3.3 million inhabitants .
for that reason , holland are preaching caution .
" our next match is a very dangerous one , " van marwijk has said .
" uruguay 's players are tremendous fighters and survival artists . "
history in the making bildunterschrift : fans of both sides hope the party will continue given the personnel constellation , the likely course of this match is obvious .
the netherlands will have to attack while uruguay try to hang on , hoping for a goal against the run of play or a draw that would send the match to penalties .
the uglier the match , the better la celeste 's chances .
so uruguay are bound to try to irritate robben , sneijder and van persie with niggling fouls .
but can former reserves step up to fill the gaps and take some of the focus off forlan ?
uruguay 's captain , in any case , says the team is n't satisfied with just reaching the semis .
" we know that if we want to make history , we have to become champions , " diego lugano told reporters .
" we have two must-win matches to go .
it 's equally difficult and possible . "
the challenge for the oranje will be to keep their cool , stick with their game plan and trust that the superior quality will prevail , should they fail to break the match open with an early goal .
that 's a doable task - but one dutch sides have often been unequal to in the past .
one thing is certain : whichever team wins will reward long-suffering fans with their nation 's greatest world cup triumph in decades .
and that will add a bit of extra-tension to what 's already shaping up to be a nervy contest .

and both will have to battle history in what could be a war of nerves . coming off their upset of brazil , and boasting a squad that features players from europe 's top clubs , holland are definitely the favorites .
but the dutch know all too well that in football , favorites do n't always win .
" we 're not strutting around all day doing the polonaise , " netherlands coach bert van marwijk said after his team 's stunning 2-1 defeat of the mighty selecao .
" we have n't yet reached our goal . "
holland are arguably soccer 's greatest underachievers .
the national team have never won a world cup and , despite consistently fielding some of the sport 's most innovative and entertaining teams , the last time they qualified for a final was way back in 1978 .
this time around they 're trying something different .
instead of total football , van marwijk - whose resume includes a stint at bundesliga side dortmund - has emphasized a control and efficiency reminiscent of past german teams .
bildunterschrift : the oranjes have been riding high without individual brilliance that has n't always sat well with free-wheeling stars like arjen robben , wesley sneijder and robin van persie , but it 's yielded results .
assistant coach frank de boer says the players have learned that winning ugly is better than losing beautifully .
" our goal was to gain stability , " de boer has told reporters .
" the team is mature and has internalized a system .
we 're now capable of getting off to poor starts and still winning matches . "
the oranje , however , will be missing two major sources of that stability , right-back gregory van der wiel and defensive midfielder nigel de jong , when they take to the pitch in cape town on tuesday .
both are suspended after picking up two yellow cards .
fortunately for the dutch , their opponents have far graver personnel issues .
bildunterschrift : suarez made a fine but costly save against ghana survival artists after his team 's heart-stopping victory over ghana on friday , uruguay coach oscar tabarez had spent much of his time defending striker luis suarez , whose last-second handball clearance would have done most goalkeepers proud - and earned the player a red card and a one-match ban .
now , tabarez will have to think about how to replace him - an unenviable task since none of his reserve strikers possess the pace or the touch of suarez .
much of the burden will fall on diego forlan .
uruguay 's one true superstar has had a stand-out tournament and has been one of the few players to be effective from distance .
but he 'll have to work harder than ever to create space for his shots .
bildunterschrift : forlan has been on the mark and the situation is even more troubling at the back .
left back jorge fucile is also suspended , while central defender and captain diego lugano is doubtful with a bruised knee - two potentially crushing blows for a defensively oriented team .
the main factor speaking for la celeste in this match is pride .
a two-time world cup winner -lrb- 1930 and 1950 -rrb- , uruguay has n't done this well since 1970 , and a trip to another final would be a massive achievement for a country of only 3.3 million inhabitants .
for that reason , holland are preaching caution .
" our next match is a very dangerous one , " van marwijk has said .
" uruguay 's players are tremendous fighters and survival artists . "
history in the making bildunterschrift : fans of both sides hope the party will continue given the personnel constellation , the likely course of this match is obvious .
the netherlands will have to attack while uruguay try to hang on , hoping for a goal against the run of play or a draw that would send the match to penalties .
the uglier the match , the better la celeste 's chances .
so uruguay are bound to try to irritate robben , sneijder and van persie with niggling fouls .
but can former reserves step up to fill the gaps and take some of the focus off forlan ?
uruguay 's captain , in any case , says the team is n't satisfied with just reaching the semis .
" we know that if we want to make history , we have to become champions , " diego lugano told reporters .
" we have two must-win matches to go .
it 's equally difficult and possible . "
the challenge for the oranje will be to keep their cool , stick with their game plan and trust that the superior quality will prevail , should they fail to break the match open with an early goal .
that 's a doable task - but one dutch sides have often been unequal to in the past .
one thing is certain : whichever team wins will reward long-suffering fans with their nation 's greatest world cup triumph in decades .
and that will add a bit of extra-tension to what 's already shaping up to be a nervy contest .

speaking a day after scoring a brace in germany 's 4-0 demolition of argentina in the quarters , klose said he had his eyes on becoming the all-time world cup top scorer .
" i want to score at least five goals at the world cup .
and i will be very satisfied if i score six , " klose told a news conference .
the 32-year-old scored five goals in world cups in 2002 and 2006 and has so far netted four times in the 2010 tournament .
that puts him one goal behind record scorer ronaldo of brazil , who netted 15 world cup goals between 1998 and 2006 .
measured , yet confident klose said that his team would n't get carried away after several resounding victories throughout the competition , including a 4-1 win over england and a 4-0 thumping of australia .
" spain is better than england and argentina , no question .
they are not unbeatable , and we will try to expose their weaknesses ...
we are better than 2008 and want to show that on the pitch , " said klose .
the germans will line up against spain without young forward thomas mueller , whose red-hot form has been one of the pillars of germany 's effectiveness .
the 20-year-old was given a yellow card in the win against argentina and will miss the semifinal clash .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller has been a revelation this world cup germany coach joachim loew sought to downplay worries over having to rejig his lineup , insisting he had enough talent at his disposal to cover the loss of mueller .
" it 's clear it 's a blow for us - he has shown himself to be dangerous in front of goal .
but we have players who can replace him , " loew said .
possible replacements for mueller include hamburg attacking midfielder piotr trochowski and young bayern attacker toni kroos , both of whom have been given game time in south africa .
stuttgart-based striker cacau is also an option , but rumors still persist about an abdominal muscle strain that kept him out of the quarterfinals .

the resignations from alain joyandet , state secretary for overseas development , and christian blanc , state secretary for the greater paris region , followed disclosures that both politicians had abused their office perks .
joyandet came under fire following press reports that he hired a private jet costing 116,500 euros to fly on official business to the caribbean , when he could have taken a regular scheduled flight .
he was also criticized last month over claims he was granted a permit illegally to build an extension to his house in saint tropez .
blanc 's office spent 12,000 euros -lrb- $ 14,680 -rrb- on cigars , and the minister himself admitted to smoking a third of them .
he was ordered to pay back the full bill . the revelations came as the french government was looking to promote ministerial sobriety and budget austerity in the face of a deficit set to hit a record high of eight percent of gdp .
sarkozy asserts authority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both blanc -lrb- l . -rrb- and joyandet resigned on sunday the resignations came as a surprise , as two days previously sarkozy had publicly criticized the two men 's behavior and made clear they would be removed from their posts in the next cabinet reshuffle in october .
but the president appeared unwilling to sacrifice his labor minister , eric woerth , who has also faced corruption accusations .
woerth has been the subject of daily scrutiny over the so-called ' bettancourt affair . '
french authorities have ordered a full review into the tax situation of liliane bettancourt , the 87-year-old heiress of the l 'oreal cosmetics group , after one of her advisors acknowledged there may have been financial irregularities .
opposition politicians have questioned why woerth never ordered a review while he was budget minister from 2007 to 2010 , suggesting it may have been because his wife then worked for the company that managed bettancourt 's wealth .
woerth has denied any wrongdoing and sarkozy has openly defended him .
leftist leaders say the furor over blanc and joyandet is a " fire shield " to distract voters from woerth 's ongoing difficulties .
in order for the state to save money , neither minister will be replaced .
sarkozy has also ordered that official use of planes and cars be restricted and departmental parties banned .

two turkish newspapers had quoted davutoglu as saying ties with israel would be severed unless turkey received an apology for the flotilla raid or israel accepted the outcome of an independent inquiry into the incident .
in response to davutoglu 's alleged remarks , israeli foreign minister avigdor lieberman said during a trip to latvia that israel did n't " have any intention to apologize . "
later on monday , however , a spokesman for the turkish government told the reuters news agency that davutoglu had been misquoted in the newspaper reports .
the official claimed that davutoglu actually said that relations with israel would not improve if an apology was not issued .
the two countries have been on bad terms since the may 31 raid on a gaza-bound aid flotilla .
nine turkish nationals died after israeli military personnel boarded one of the ships . each side subsequently blamed the other for starting the violent confrontation .

but this does n't mean ankara is turning its back on europe , says bahaeddin guengoer of deutsche welle 's turkish service . turkey can explain itself however it likes .
but its latest diplomatic actions - its " no " to iran sanctions in the un security council ; its goal of carrying out a zero-problem policy with all its neighbors - are being met in the west with anxious questions .
is turkey turning away from the west ?
does it see its future in the islamic camp ?
the answer to such questions is a definite " no . "
turkey is not turning its back on the west !
yes , the goal of eu accession is losing priority in ankara 's current policy .
turkey is acting with a new level of self-confidence in the international diplomatic arena , and no one should resent the country for trying to build up its status as a regional power - or for trying to look beyond the narrow confines of europe .
turkey seeks new responsibility tacticians from washington , brazil and brussels to tehran , the middle east and moscow have been trying to instrumentalize nato-member turkey to serve their own diplomatic goals for nearly 60 years .
now , turkey wants to take on more responsibility : in conflict regions like the middle east and the caucasus , as an arbitrator in atomic negotiations with iran , and not least as a reliable energy route for the west .
questioning whether turkey belongs in the european or the oriental camp is easy to understand - but its not justifiable .
since its founding nearly nine decades ago , the modern turkish republic has decided in favor of europe , and therefore , in favor of the west .
despite this , ankara ca n't look forward to being greeted with open arms in its efforts to join the european union - nor does the islamic world celebrate turkey 's western orientation .
its dialog with hamas as an unspoken condition for a dialog with iran , and its over-eager actions toward reprimanding israel , have led to a great deal of resentment in europe and the us - and at the same time , done serious damage to its relations with the jewish state .
two sides of a coin purely in terms of numbers , turkey has what it takes to back up its ambitions of strength .
the country has seen nearly 12 percent economic growth in the first quarter of the year , along with being the 16th-strongest economy in the world , and the 7th in europe .
but that is just one side of the coin .
on the other side is the growing polarization between the religious and the secular in a turkey whose population has yet to taste many of the fruits of economic growth .
the continuous lack of democratic process , the weak grasp of the concept of press freedom in a gray zone , or the unwillingness of prime minsiter erdogan to deal with criticism of either himself or his policies , are all alarming threats to domestic stability .
turkey belongs in europe !
europe and turkey need one another like never before .
turkey needs europe in order to build itself up as a regional power and to give it more weight in its influence on its neighbors .
for its part , without turkey , europe reduces its chances of succeeding in its global goals and strategies .
europe 's unified rejection of turkey needs to give way .
instead of explaining why turkey should n't accede to the eu , the heads of the european states should be racking their brains about how to make accession happen - or at least how to begin the process , since full membership is unlikely in the near future .
meanwhile , turkey is right to intensively build up its status as a regional power , instead of trying at all cost to become a member of a weaker , crisis-plagued eu .

turkey is acting with a new level of self-confidence in the international diplomatic arena , and no one should resent the country for trying to build up its status as a regional power - or for trying to look beyond the narrow confines of europe .
turkey seeks new responsibility tacticians from washington , brazil and brussels to tehran , the middle east and moscow have been trying to instrumentalize nato-member turkey to serve their own diplomatic goals for nearly 60 years .
now , turkey wants to take on more responsibility : in conflict regions like the middle east and the caucasus , as an arbitrator in atomic negotiations with iran , and not least as a reliable energy route for the west .
questioning whether turkey belongs in the european or the oriental camp is easy to understand - but its not justifiable .
since its founding nearly nine decades ago , the modern turkish republic has decided in favor of europe , and therefore , in favor of the west .
despite this , ankara ca n't look forward to being greeted with open arms in its efforts to join the european union - nor does the islamic world celebrate turkey 's western orientation .
its dialog with hamas as an unspoken condition for a dialog with iran , and its over-eager actions toward reprimanding israel , have led to a great deal of resentment in europe and the us - and at the same time , done serious damage to its relations with the jewish state .
two sides of a coin purely in terms of numbers , turkey has what it takes to back up its ambitions of strength .
the country has seen nearly 12 percent economic growth in the first quarter of the year , along with being the 16th-strongest economy in the world , and the 7th in europe .
but that is just one side of the coin .
on the other side is the growing polarization between the religious and the secular in a turkey whose population has yet to taste many of the fruits of economic growth .
the continuous lack of democratic process , the weak grasp of the concept of press freedom in a gray zone , or the unwillingness of prime minsiter erdogan to deal with criticism of either himself or his policies , are all alarming threats to domestic stability .
turkey belongs in europe !
europe and turkey need one another like never before .
turkey needs europe in order to build itself up as a regional power and to give it more weight in its influence on its neighbors .
for its part , without turkey , europe reduces its chances of succeeding in its global goals and strategies .
europe 's unified rejection of turkey needs to give way .
instead of explaining why turkey should n't accede to the eu , the heads of the european states should be racking their brains about how to make accession happen - or at least how to begin the process , since full membership is unlikely in the near future .
meanwhile , turkey is right to intensively build up its status as a regional power , instead of trying at all cost to become a member of a weaker , crisis-plagued eu .

but this does n't mean ankara is turning its back on europe , says bahaeddin guengoer of deutsche welle 's turkish service . turkey can explain itself however it likes .
but its latest diplomatic actions - its " no " to iran sanctions in the un security council ; its goal of carrying out a zero-problem policy with all its neighbors - are being met in the west with anxious questions .
is turkey turning away from the west ?
does it see its future in the islamic camp ?
the answer to such questions is a definite " no . "

two turkish newspapers had quoted davutoglu as saying ties with israel would be severed unless turkey received an apology for the flotilla raid or israel accepted the outcome of an independent inquiry into the incident .
in response to davutoglu 's alleged remarks , israeli foreign minister avigdor lieberman said during a trip to latvia that israel did n't " have any intention to apologize . "
later on monday , however , a spokesman for the turkish government told the reuters news agency that davutoglu had been misquoted in the newspaper reports .
the official claimed that davutoglu actually said that relations with israel would not improve if an apology was not issued .
the two countries have been on bad terms since the may 31 raid on a gaza-bound aid flotilla .
nine turkish nationals died after israeli military personnel boarded one of the ships . each side subsequently blamed the other for starting the violent confrontation .

dw ’ s bartosz dudek sees komorowski ’ s win as a victory for europe . president-elect bronislaw komorowski and his liberal conservative party civic platform stand for a europe-friendly and future-oriented poland .
they also value dialogue and compromise in their political dealings .
but defeated presidential candidate jaroslaw kaczynski also achieved considerable success in this election .
his 47 percent of the vote is a political base upon which his conservative law and justice party can build upon in the next parliamentary elections in 2011 .
komorowski 's kingmakers were poland 's left-of-center voters .
though rival jaroslaw kaczynski made a leftist , populist turn at the end of his campaign , it simply was not enough to win over left-of-center voters .
even kaczynski 's praise of communist-era social policies could not sway them .
two-thirds of the left-of-center voters marked komorowski 's name on their ballots , making him the country 's next president .
the close result of the election also demonstrates to what extent poland is politically divided .
while komorowski 's campaign spoke to younger , educated , urban voters , kaczynski tended to attract older , less educated and more rural voters .
there can also be no talk of true defeat in this election because , as leader of the largest opposition party , the power-hungry kaczynski will long remain a serious rival to liberal-conservative prime minister donald tusk and president-elect bronislaw komorowski .
therefore , kaczynski 's success at the polls must be heeded as a warning .
the path for kaczynski 's return to power would already be paved , should warsaw 's current coalition government wind up presiding over corruption , rising joblessness , or harsh social policies .
if kaczynski were to return as poland 's prime minister , he could throw poland back into the domestic and foreign confrontations that once dominated the country 's politics .
so komorowski 's election is not only good news not only poland but also for german-polish relations and for europe as a whole .
a cheerful , aimiable polish president with foreign affairs experience and good relations with other european leaders will make poland a stable pillar of european politics . this bodes well for the polish eu presidency in 2011 and the beleaguered european union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 05.07.2010 netherlands , uruguay try to recapture past glory in first 2010 semifinal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of these teams will be playing on july 11 injuries and suspensions will force both the oranje and la celeste to improvise as they try to punch their ticket for the final .
and both will have to battle history in what could be a war of nerves . coming off their upset of brazil , and boasting a squad that features players from europe 's top clubs , holland are definitely the favorites .
but the dutch know all too well that in football , favorites do n't always win .
" we 're not strutting around all day doing the polonaise , " netherlands coach bert van marwijk said after his team 's stunning 2-1 defeat of the mighty selecao .
" we have n't yet reached our goal . "
holland are arguably soccer 's greatest underachievers .
the national team have never won a world cup and , despite consistently fielding some of the sport 's most innovative and entertaining teams , the last time they qualified for a final was way back in 1978 .
this time around they 're trying something different .
instead of total football , van marwijk - whose resume includes a stint at bundesliga side dortmund - has emphasized a control and efficiency reminiscent of past german teams .
bildunterschrift : the oranjes have been riding high without individual brilliance that has n't always sat well with free-wheeling stars like arjen robben , wesley sneijder and robin van persie , but it 's yielded results .
assistant coach frank de boer says the players have learned that winning ugly is better than losing beautifully .
" our goal was to gain stability , " de boer has told reporters .
" the team is mature and has internalized a system .
we 're now capable of getting off to poor starts and still winning matches . "
the oranje , however , will be missing two major sources of that stability , right-back gregory van der wiel and defensive midfielder nigel de jong , when they take to the pitch in cape town on tuesday .
both are suspended after picking up two yellow cards .
fortunately for the dutch , their opponents have far graver personnel issues .
bildunterschrift : suarez made a fine but costly save against ghana survival artists after his team 's heart-stopping victory over ghana on friday , uruguay coach oscar tabarez had spent much of his time defending striker luis suarez , whose last-second handball clearance would have done most goalkeepers proud - and earned the player a red card and a one-match ban .
now , tabarez will have to think about how to replace him - an unenviable task since none of his reserve strikers possess the pace or the touch of suarez .
much of the burden will fall on diego forlan .
uruguay 's one true superstar has had a stand-out tournament and has been one of the few players to be effective from distance .
but he 'll have to work harder than ever to create space for his shots .
bildunterschrift : forlan has been on the mark and the situation is even more troubling at the back .
left back jorge fucile is also suspended , while central defender and captain diego lugano is doubtful with a bruised knee - two potentially crushing blows for a defensively oriented team .
the main factor speaking for la celeste in this match is pride .
a two-time world cup winner -lrb- 1930 and 1950 -rrb- , uruguay has n't done this well since 1970 , and a trip to another final would be a massive achievement for a country of only 3.3 million inhabitants .
for that reason , holland are preaching caution .
" our next match is a very dangerous one , " van marwijk has said .
" uruguay 's players are tremendous fighters and survival artists . "
history in the making bildunterschrift : fans of both sides hope the party will continue given the personnel constellation , the likely course of this match is obvious .
the netherlands will have to attack while uruguay try to hang on , hoping for a goal against the run of play or a draw that would send the match to penalties .
the uglier the match , the better la celeste 's chances .
so uruguay are bound to try to irritate robben , sneijder and van persie with niggling fouls .
but can former reserves step up to fill the gaps and take some of the focus off forlan ?
uruguay 's captain , in any case , says the team is n't satisfied with just reaching the semis .
" we know that if we want to make history , we have to become champions , " diego lugano told reporters .
" we have two must-win matches to go .
it 's equally difficult and possible . "
the challenge for the oranje will be to keep their cool , stick with their game plan and trust that the superior quality will prevail , should they fail to break the match open with an early goal .
that 's a doable task - but one dutch sides have often been unequal to in the past .
one thing is certain : whichever team wins will reward long-suffering fans with their nation 's greatest world cup triumph in decades .
and that will add a bit of extra-tension to what 's already shaping up to be a nervy contest .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 05.07.2010 french junior ministers resign over perks scandals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one politician lost his job over a penchant for cigars two french junior ministers have resigned over spending scandals , as the government attempts to regain political credibility following a series of setbacks . french president nicolas sarkozy has accepted the resignation of two of his junior ministers after separate spending scandals .
the resignations from alain joyandet , state secretary for overseas development , and christian blanc , state secretary for the greater paris region , followed disclosures that both politicians had abused their office perks .
joyandet came under fire following press reports that he hired a private jet costing 116,500 euros to fly on official business to the caribbean , when he could have taken a regular scheduled flight .
he was also criticized last month over claims he was granted a permit illegally to build an extension to his house in saint tropez .
blanc 's office spent 12,000 euros -lrb- $ 14,680 -rrb- on cigars , and the minister himself admitted to smoking a third of them .
he was ordered to pay back the full bill . the revelations came as the french government was looking to promote ministerial sobriety and budget austerity in the face of a deficit set to hit a record high of eight percent of gdp .
sarkozy asserts authority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both blanc -lrb- l . -rrb- and joyandet resigned on sunday the resignations came as a surprise , as two days previously sarkozy had publicly criticized the two men 's behavior and made clear they would be removed from their posts in the next cabinet reshuffle in october .
but the president appeared unwilling to sacrifice his labor minister , eric woerth , who has also faced corruption accusations .
woerth has been the subject of daily scrutiny over the so-called ' bettancourt affair . '
french authorities have ordered a full review into the tax situation of liliane bettancourt , the 87-year-old heiress of the l 'oreal cosmetics group , after one of her advisors acknowledged there may have been financial irregularities .
opposition politicians have questioned why woerth never ordered a review while he was budget minister from 2007 to 2010 , suggesting it may have been because his wife then worked for the company that managed bettancourt 's wealth .
woerth has denied any wrongdoing and sarkozy has openly defended him .
leftist leaders say the furor over blanc and joyandet is a " fire shield " to distract voters from woerth 's ongoing difficulties .
in order for the state to save money , neither minister will be replaced .
sarkozy has also ordered that official use of planes and cars be restricted and departmental parties banned .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 05.07.2010 enduring freedom 's shift in focus belies horn of africa 's security threat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german marines will now search for pirates not terrorists germany 's recent decision to pull out of operation enduring freedom was based on an assessment that labels the terror threat in the horn of africa as limited .
defense analysts suggest the region is still a major concern . if the german defense ministry is to be believed , the terrorist threat in the sea off the horn of africa has been reduced so significantly that it sees no further reason to deploy its force of 90 marines and a navy reconnaissance plane as part of the us-led operation enduring freedom .
due to an assessment that claims that the threat is now ' limited , ' germany has ended its involvement six months earlier than its mandate stipulated .
germany has been involved in the operation enduring freedom as part of the mission aimed at stopping islamic terrorists smuggling arms to groups in africa from the arabian peninsula for over eight years .
the german navy joined the task force in february 2002 , some five months after the united states established the operation after the 9/11 attacks on new york and washington .
with the last german troops completing their tours of duty in the gulf of aden and the indian ocean last week , germany 's naval focus now shifts to the mediterranean .
one german navy frigate will remain off the coast of africa as part of operation atalanta , a european union mission to protect aid shipments into somalia from pirate attack .
however , with increased al qaeda activity being reported across the gulf of aden in yemen , affiliated islamist groups continuing to battle for control of somalia and reports that osama bin laden 's terror network is extending its influence into kenya , the german decision has caused some surprise among security analysts .
somalia at the heart of region 's spreading extremism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al shabab is fighting to install an islamic caliphate in somalia " the terrorist threat emanating from the horn of africa is limited at the moment , " jeremy binnie , a terrorism expert at jane 's defence group , told deutsche welle .
" however , there is a lot of concern that somalia might turn into something akin to taliban-controlled afghanistan in the 1990s .
the pro-al qaeda group there , the shabab , controls much of the south of the country and is currently threatening to overrun mogadishu .
the only thing stopping them is a small force of african peacekeepers .
so there are worries that southern somalia could become a safe haven for jihadists from other countries and a base for training . "
" there are already indications that the shabab is being supported by a small number of foreign jihadists and has recruited possibly hundreds of young men from europe and north america , most of them somalis , " binnie added .
" there have also been a few reports of yemen-based al qaeda operatives turning up in somalia .
the worry is that these guys could be used to carry out international terrorist attacks . "
" at the same time , there are worries about the geographical proximity between somalia and yemen , meaning it is possible that the shabab will link up with bin laden 's yemeni branch , al qaeda on the arabian peninsula . "
yemen supply lines still bringing arms , personnel to africa last year 's failed bombing of a detroit-bound airliner by an al qaeda suspect with links to yemen highlighted the country 's growing reputation as the new hub for terrorism in the region .
yemen is a blueprint nation for radical islamists ; it has a weak government , it is deeply divided by a tribalistic and violent civil war which is pushing the country toward the status of a failed state and has a culture in which most men carry weapons , therefore making identifying terrorists extremely difficult .
the land of osama bin laden 's ancestors has also become a melting pot of refugees from the conflict in somalia and returning jihadists from the wars in afghanistan and iraq .
with africa in its sights , it is thought that al qaeda sees yemen as an ideal staging point for fanning the flames of extremism across the gulf of aden in somalia and beyond .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda has targeted kenya since the us embassy attack despite having a less direct shipping connection to yemen than somalia , sharing a border with the failed state puts kenya at risk of infiltration by islamist terror groups .
instead of having to navigate through the international forces in indian ocean to reach the kenyan coastline , arab-based terrorists can smuggle weapons and personnel overland to kenya via somalia .
it has been reported for as long as germany was part of operation enduring freedom that al qaeda was seeking a foothold in kenya and that al qaeda operatives had infiltrated the country 's islamic communities on its indian ocean coast .
poor relations between kenya 's coastal muslims and the country 's inefficient security forces have provided al qaeda with a new base from which it can extend its growing network throughout eastern africa .
inland in kenya , border camps filled with refugees from somalia are reported to be just as fertile a breeding ground for young extremists .
meanwhile , kenya has its own home grown terror problem .
the kenyan saleh ali saleh nabhan was alleged to have been the leader of al qaeda in somalia and the mastermind behind the bombing of the paradise hotel in mombasa and the attempted downing of an israeli passenger jet in november 2002 .
he was also suspected of involvement in the 1998 us embassy bombings in nairobi and dar es salaam in tanzania .
he was killed by us special forces near mogadishu in september 2009 .
changing face of mission shifts threat focus david hartwell , an expert and risk analyst for the middle east and north africa , believes that the changing nature of operation enduring freedom has shifted the focus away from its original mission meaning that the horn of africa and land-based threats are now longer in its remit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops will leave but the threat will remain " the germans have made a fair assessment on enduring freedom but it 's one based on the level of threat within the operation 's initial mission which was to capture fleeing extremists and taliban from afghanistan and stop them getting to places like yemen , saudi arabia and oman , " hartwell told deutsche welle . " in its original form , it has n't recorded that many successes as there have been few significant arrests of wanted figures on the seas .
as such , enduring freedom has mutated into the anti-piracy mission which is having more success in containing the pirates .
but it has been agreed that there is less of a need for naval forces to be searching for fleeing extremists now , especially in the gulf of aden and indian ocean . " " the region itself is still unstable with civil wars and extremism in both somalia and yemen but those involved in enduring freedom are wary of getting involved in the internal politics in these countries so we 'll see more countries following germany 's decision and refocusing on the piracy mission , " he added . author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

defense analysts suggest the region is still a major concern . if the german defense ministry is to be believed , the terrorist threat in the sea off the horn of africa has been reduced so significantly that it sees no further reason to deploy its force of 90 marines and a navy reconnaissance plane as part of the us-led operation enduring freedom .
due to an assessment that claims that the threat is now ' limited , ' germany has ended its involvement six months earlier than its mandate stipulated .
germany has been involved in the operation enduring freedom as part of the mission aimed at stopping islamic terrorists smuggling arms to groups in africa from the arabian peninsula for over eight years .
the german navy joined the task force in february 2002 , some five months after the united states established the operation after the 9/11 attacks on new york and washington .
with the last german troops completing their tours of duty in the gulf of aden and the indian ocean last week , germany 's naval focus now shifts to the mediterranean .
one german navy frigate will remain off the coast of africa as part of operation atalanta , a european union mission to protect aid shipments into somalia from pirate attack .
however , with increased al qaeda activity being reported across the gulf of aden in yemen , affiliated islamist groups continuing to battle for control of somalia and reports that osama bin laden 's terror network is extending its influence into kenya , the german decision has caused some surprise among security analysts .
somalia at the heart of region 's spreading extremism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al shabab is fighting to install an islamic caliphate in somalia " the terrorist threat emanating from the horn of africa is limited at the moment , " jeremy binnie , a terrorism expert at jane 's defence group , told deutsche welle .
" however , there is a lot of concern that somalia might turn into something akin to taliban-controlled afghanistan in the 1990s .
the pro-al qaeda group there , the shabab , controls much of the south of the country and is currently threatening to overrun mogadishu .
the only thing stopping them is a small force of african peacekeepers .
so there are worries that southern somalia could become a safe haven for jihadists from other countries and a base for training . "
" there are already indications that the shabab is being supported by a small number of foreign jihadists and has recruited possibly hundreds of young men from europe and north america , most of them somalis , " binnie added .
" there have also been a few reports of yemen-based al qaeda operatives turning up in somalia .
the worry is that these guys could be used to carry out international terrorist attacks . "
" at the same time , there are worries about the geographical proximity between somalia and yemen , meaning it is possible that the shabab will link up with bin laden 's yemeni branch , al qaeda on the arabian peninsula . "
yemen supply lines still bringing arms , personnel to africa last year 's failed bombing of a detroit-bound airliner by an al qaeda suspect with links to yemen highlighted the country 's growing reputation as the new hub for terrorism in the region .
yemen is a blueprint nation for radical islamists ; it has a weak government , it is deeply divided by a tribalistic and violent civil war which is pushing the country toward the status of a failed state and has a culture in which most men carry weapons , therefore making identifying terrorists extremely difficult .
the land of osama bin laden 's ancestors has also become a melting pot of refugees from the conflict in somalia and returning jihadists from the wars in afghanistan and iraq .
with africa in its sights , it is thought that al qaeda sees yemen as an ideal staging point for fanning the flames of extremism across the gulf of aden in somalia and beyond .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda has targeted kenya since the us embassy attack despite having a less direct shipping connection to yemen than somalia , sharing a border with the failed state puts kenya at risk of infiltration by islamist terror groups .
instead of having to navigate through the international forces in indian ocean to reach the kenyan coastline , arab-based terrorists can smuggle weapons and personnel overland to kenya via somalia .
it has been reported for as long as germany was part of operation enduring freedom that al qaeda was seeking a foothold in kenya and that al qaeda operatives had infiltrated the country 's islamic communities on its indian ocean coast .
poor relations between kenya 's coastal muslims and the country 's inefficient security forces have provided al qaeda with a new base from which it can extend its growing network throughout eastern africa .
inland in kenya , border camps filled with refugees from somalia are reported to be just as fertile a breeding ground for young extremists .
meanwhile , kenya has its own home grown terror problem .
the kenyan saleh ali saleh nabhan was alleged to have been the leader of al qaeda in somalia and the mastermind behind the bombing of the paradise hotel in mombasa and the attempted downing of an israeli passenger jet in november 2002 .
he was also suspected of involvement in the 1998 us embassy bombings in nairobi and dar es salaam in tanzania .
he was killed by us special forces near mogadishu in september 2009 .
changing face of mission shifts threat focus david hartwell , an expert and risk analyst for the middle east and north africa , believes that the changing nature of operation enduring freedom has shifted the focus away from its original mission meaning that the horn of africa and land-based threats are now longer in its remit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops will leave but the threat will remain " the germans have made a fair assessment on enduring freedom but it 's one based on the level of threat within the operation 's initial mission which was to capture fleeing extremists and taliban from afghanistan and stop them getting to places like yemen , saudi arabia and oman , " hartwell told deutsche welle . " in its original form , it has n't recorded that many successes as there have been few significant arrests of wanted figures on the seas .
as such , enduring freedom has mutated into the anti-piracy mission which is having more success in containing the pirates .
but it has been agreed that there is less of a need for naval forces to be searching for fleeing extremists now , especially in the gulf of aden and indian ocean . " " the region itself is still unstable with civil wars and extremism in both somalia and yemen but those involved in enduring freedom are wary of getting involved in the internal politics in these countries so we 'll see more countries following germany 's decision and refocusing on the piracy mission , " he added . author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

media requires javascript to play .
nottingham 's faith community have answered an artist 's call to record their prayers .
the prayers of 46 groups , including sunni muslims , orthodox jews , brahma kumaris and humanists have now been turned into an audio installation .
media artist james webb said he wanted to create what it would sound like to listen to all the prayers coming out of the city at one time in one place .
' prayer ' is on at the djanogly art gallery until sunday , 8 august 2010 .
minimalist installation the audio installation is situated in a room accessed through sound-proofed curtains .
the four surrounding walls are bare .
on the floor is a red carpet with 12 black speakers .
it is the only thing in the space .
it is a very visually minimalist installation .
the carpet acts in the same way as a plinth would to present the speakers that are broadcasting the recordings .
james webb explained : " by walking onto the carpet you are walking on to the artistic space .
there is a transformation of space just by that action . "
please turn on javascript .
media requires javascript to play .
the media artist explained that there are two ways of experiencing the work .
" one would be to listen to the entire work as an orchestral piece where you are listening to all the voices at once .
you will do this by wandering through the installation , the floor-based speakers .
" the second way would be to kneel down next to one of the speakers and to listen to that individual voice .
" this would be like wandering through an orchestra and sitting down next to the cello to listen to what the cellist is playing .
" the physical act involved is a reference to supplication or genuflection where the audience have to kneel down and meet that person praying on their knees , " he added .
when you enter the exhibition space it sounds like you are entering a gathering .
at any one time there are six prayers being broadcast at once .
mr webb said that it was up to the audience to decide whether prayer is being questioned or celebrated in the room .
" i believe i have created an image that people will react to depending on their own religious and philosophical beliefs .
i hope people share an intimate moment with these voices james webb , media artist however , he does hope people take the time to listen and " share an intimate moment with these voices . "
higher intelligence the media artist 's project was originally inspired by a story about a group of scientists who sent a pod into space containing information about human civilisation .
the idea was that if a higher intelligence discovered the pod they would be able to find out about the earth .
mr webb said : " this got me thinking as to what it might be like for a higher intelligence to listen to all the prayers that will be coming out of a city or the world at any one time . "
it led to the south african 's first prayer project in his home town of cape town in 2002 .
he now plans to record prayers in cities all over the world .
james webb 's exhibition prayer is on at the djanogly art gallery , lakeside arts centre , nottingham , from saturday , 26 june to sunday , 8 august 2010 .

" i went out right at the end , just before the truce in 1953 , " explained warren from llanfairfechan , who has been back to south korea this year .
" people tend to forget that the last uk troops did n't leave korea until 1957 .
and really , the war still has n't ended , even today , " he said .
the war began on 25 june 1950 when the soviet-backed north korean army invaded the american-backed south .
soon british and commonwealth armed forces were sent over to help fight for the democratic south , and chinese troops were sent in to bolster the communist army to the north .
warren had left friars grammar school , bangor , to start his national service when he found himself facing the formidable chinese army .
" i joined the royal artillery and most of the time i was a wireless officer , operating in front of the guns , " he said .
" it really was a dangerous theatre of war , wherever you were sent .
a peace treaty was never signed : the two koreas remain technically at war " one of the most difficult factors was the climate .
the summers were very hot , like it must be for the boys out in afghanistan now .
" then the winters were very cold , and temperatures could dip to 40 degrees below .
you had to melt the ice for water to wash and shave and starting up the tanks was a problem because sometimes the diesel would freeze .
" we were living in a hole in the ground - something which does n't happen anymore in the army , except for maybe special forces .
but it was back to being in trenches which could get very wet and muddy and in certain sectors compared to world war i. "
warren remembers hemorrhagic fever hitting the troops - a disease with symptoms similar to malaria which cause the skin to split and bleed .
" if it was n't treated within three days , you were dead , " he said .
while the american forces were lectured about their duty to fight for freedom against the communists , warren only remembers the british forces being told to get on with it .
" i was very conscious about what could happen , because i was an only child , and i would n't say i enjoyed it , but i definitely had a taste for it .
over 1000 british troops were killed , 2000 injured and 1000 taken prisoner " i had many friends who tried to be based in raf valley during their national service , so they could go home at weekends , but many have said they regret not taking the opportunity to do something different . "
it definitely gave warren a taste for travel because afterwards he enlisted with the colonial police force and travelled the commonwealth .
earlier this year he was invited to visit korea for the 60th anniversary commemorations .
" it was a very humbling experience , because people of all ages would come up to us , grasp our hands and thank us , " he said .
" it 's known as the forgotten war here , but in south korean schools british soldiers who won the victoria cross for their bravery are held up as heroes .
their vice president said they owed everything to us and our comrades . "
while the five mile-wide no man 's land between north and south reminded him of the continuing hostility , warren was amazed at the changes in seoul which was just piles of rubble last time he was there .
" it 's a beautiful city now , " he said .
" and it was good to be with other veterans who you could talk to openly about the war , sometimes with humour .
it was black humour , but at least it was there . "

bbc - north west wales - work starts to save iconic church / religion & ethics bbc local -pipe- north west wales -pipe- things to do -pipe- people & places -pipe- tv & radio -pipe- 09:26 gmt , monday , 5 july 2010 10:26 uk work starts to save iconic church work is beginning to restore one of anglesey 's most unusual churches , designed by a former italian prisoner of war to look like a ship .
our lady star of the sea and st winefride 's is the catholic church for amlwch , but has been closed since 2004 when increasing damp endangered the electrics .
now restoration project leader chris thomas has finally secured the funds to begin making this iconic building safe .
" trying to keep the water out has been a constant problem since this church was built in the 1930s , " admitted chris , who 's volunteered to help out with the project .
" we 've had an expert look at it and they 're going to use a specialist , flexible material which will move with the building and keep the damp out once and for all . "
chris has received much good will from the community who want to see this nautical-themed church saved for future use .
" it 's right on the anglesey coastal path and coaches come by especially to look at it , " he explained .
" it 's not a building you expect to come across there , so it 's become quite a landmark . "
our lady star of the sea was designed by italian engineer , giuseppe rinvolucri , who married a local girl after coming to britain as a prisoner of war during world war i. he designed a number of north wales catholic churches , including porthmadog and abergele .
but while they are in the more traditional , byzantine cross-style , he decided on something very different for amlwch .
" it 's shaped like an up-turned hull with portholes , " said chris .
giuseppe 's son told him his father would visit the site where he was going to build a church to soak up the atmosphere .
" he would then paint a picture and use that as the basis of his architectural work , " said chris .
" sadly , we do n't know any more about his thinking behind this unique church , although the family do still have that original drawing .
" but the beauty of his idea is that he created a church which respects where it is , set between the land and the sea . "
chris is particularly looking forward to seeing the effect of the light through the three glazed panels of the elliptical arch when the building is restored .
" they throw extraordinary light .
it 's almost like a lighthouse for sailors out on the sea , with three beams of light shooting up into the sky .
" and they bring exquisite natural light into the church , even on a dull day . "
as a practising catholic , chris sees the importance of re-opening the church as a house of prayer for local worshippers who 've had to travel to cemaes and benllech for mass .
he also hopes to secure further funds to build a hoist between the three levels of the church so older parishioners do n't have to negotiate the outside steps .
" it was hard to raise all the money during a recession , and amlwch is n't the most fashionable part of wales , right on the edge of the irish sea away from everything , " said chris .
" but there is still great enthusiasm , and once we have the place watertight it 's onwards and upwards . "
robert jones of beaumaris : i think it is worthy of mention how the whole mass of imitation stone frontage was done by one plasterer long gone called llew -lrb- inja rock -rrb- , whose pretty unique style of work is still to be seen elsewhere around town today .
he once showed me how it was done , all with a little teaspoon .
what patience and what a proven good job to stand the trial of time of 40-plus years without a great deal , if any , remedial work .
a sound memorial to a good working man .
