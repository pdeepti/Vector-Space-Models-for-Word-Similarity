deutsche welle talked with him about the reasons for this surprising conclusion . andrew mack is the director of the human security report project -lrb- hsrp -rrb- at canada 's simon fraser university and a faculty member of the university 's new school for international studies .
from 1998 to 2001 he was director of the strategic planning office in the executive office of un secretary-general kofi annan .
he has taught at several universities , including the london school of economics , and has published in numerous international newspapers and magazines .
deutsche welle : a lot of people 's perception is that the world is getting more dangerous and violent .
your report says otherwise .
are we being hoodwinked by the media ?
andrew mack : there are two reasons why people believe that the world is becoming more dangerous even though there has been a big decline in the number and deadliness of wars since the end of the cold war 20 years ago . first , media reporting tends to be driven by what might be called the , " if it bleeds , it leads " imperative . this means in practice that wars that start almost always get reported , while those that quietly peter out tend to be ignored .
second , no international organization collects data on the number or deadliness of wars .
so while we have millennium development goals that track national , global and regional trends in progress in health , education , economic and environmental issues , there are no millennium security goals . your report paints a mixed picture of the threat presented by islamist militants .
one the one hand , 4 of the 5 deadliest conflicts are islamist in nature ; on the other , support for al-qaeda in the muslim world is declining .
is progress being made in this area , and if so , in what sense ?
there are reasons for both real concern and cautious optimism here . four of the world 's deadliest conflicts - iraq , afghanistan , pakistan and somalia - are indeed associated with islamist political violence . but one of the reasons for the high death tolls is that they also involve , to a greater or lesser degree , major powers - primarily the us .
this is significant because , since the end of world war ii , the deadliest conflicts have almost always been associated with direct or indirect involvement by one of more of the major powers .
there is room for cautious optimism in that radical islamist groups like al-qaeda have been losing support among muslims throughout the islamic world for some five years .
this is n't surprising .
their extremist ideology is rejected by the overwhelming majority of muslims - including most of those who are strongly opposed to us policies in iraq , afghanistan and pakistan .
the harshly repressive policies that radical islamists have sought to impose wherever they have gained power have been deeply resented .
and the targets of islamist terror are mostly muslim civilians . the decline in public support means that the radicals have little chance of winning popular revolutions .
on the other hand no radical islamist group has sufficiently powerful conventional military forces to defeat the armed forces of the states that they oppose .
what sort of benefits do you expect from a study that quantifies conflict in the way yours does ?
governments are increasingly demanding that their foreign and security policies be " evidence-based . "
providing hard data each year on the number and deadliness of armed conflicts at the global regional and national levels helps governments - and international agencies like the un - determine whether their policies are having an impact or not .
for example , since the end of the cold war the international community has dramatically increased the resources it puts into preventing wars , trying to stop those that ca n't be prevented , and preventing wars that have ended from starting again .
as the level of what might be called " international activism " has gone up the number of wars has come down . indeed in 2008 there were 78 percent fewer high-intensity wars - those that kill 1,000 or more people year - than in 1988 .
please look into your crystal ball : will the world be a safer or more perilous place in 2020 ?
if current trends continue - they may not - there are reasonable grounds for believing that the world will be a safer place . first , other things being equal , we expect the past half-century trend of rising incomes in most developing countries to continue .
in 2010 every region in the developing world is growing strongly .
this is important because the most robust and important finding to emerge from recent quantitative research is that as national incomes rise , the risk of war declines .
its not income per se that matters , but rather that when national incomes rise governments have more resources to buy off grievances that could lead to war , to coopt political opponents and to win wars that ca n't be prevented . second , the end of the cold war has removed a major cause of armed conflicts from the international system , while the dramatic increase in economic interdependence and in the number of democracies in the world over the past four decades has reduced the risk of international wars dramatically . in the 1950s there were six wars a year on average ; in the new millennium there has been less than one .
in other words the factors that have been driving war numbers down are likely to continue - or strengthen .
and there are no obvious adverse counter-trends that threaten to increase the risk of war .
in the longer term the instabilities associated with climate change may cause major problems , but these are unlikely to become manifest in the next 10 years .

but with extreme snow across europe , father christmas might just not be able to get to customers in time this year . this year 's holiday shopping season was supposed to generate record online retail sales across europe - from food deliveries to presents .
british online retail association imrg estimates a rise in sales for december by 16 percent to 6.4 billion pounds -lrb- 7.5 billion euros -rrb- .
for 2010 , germany expects some 18.3 billion euros in online sales , up 18 percent .
no food deliveries to scotland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some british companies have stopped their trucks from travelling up to scotland however , with winter having hit europe early and heavily this year , some online retailers are now feeling the effects of snow-blocked roads .
especially hard hit are the british isles .
few tesco delivery trucks are able to make their rounds due to snowy streets .
on its mail-order website , the giant british food retailer is informing customers that it is currently unable to take any new orders in scotland , among other regions .
marks and spencer 's is also issuing regular weather updates on its homepage .
and like tesco , the food and clothing retailer has also temporarily suspended orders from scotland .
" i think customers will not want to risk things and will go to local shops instead of buying online , " natalie berg from the industry analyst planet retail told financial times deutschland .
snowed-in side streets in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plenty of presents are still en route across europe germany is also affected .
more than 80,000 mail carriers across germany have to walk across unplowed streets .
conditions differ considerably from community to community , " some communities are simply not clearing side streets this year , " anke baumann , a spokeswoman from german postal service deutsche post / dhl , told deutsche welle .
" that means our mail carriers have to walk back and forth through the snow carrying single parcels every time because they ca n't even push carts through the snow . "
deutsche post is promising customers in germany that parcels dropped off by noon on december 22 will be delivered by december 24 , christmas eve .
" that 's a promise we 're doing our best to fulfil , " said baumann who , in the same breath , warned : " it might just be impossible in individual cases to stick to it . "
deutsche post has expanded its operating hours to cope with the adverse weather conditions .
parcels ordered from online retailer amazon , for instance , will be delivered on the sunday before christmas - an exception in germany where business traditionally comes to a standstill on sundays .
nevertheless , amazon germany is advising customers to check their order status online because , as a company spokesperson told deutsche welle , " delays of one or two days are currently likely to occur . "
germany 's biggest mail-order clothing retailer otto declined to comment whether goods were being delivered on time .
twice as many parcels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more goods ordered online and christmas coming up : postmen hardly ever get a break this year the festive season traditionally sees a hike in the number of parcels delivered every year .
and this year is no exception , thanks largely to the growing popularity of purchasing merchandise online .
in the weeks leading up to christmas , the number of parcels delivered daily in germany this year has already increased from an average 2.5 million to about 5 million .
" and it 's going to be even more in the last week before christmas , " said baumann .
while germany has struggled with snowed-in side streets and temporarily closed airports to keep deliveries moving , britain does n't seem to be prepared for continuous frost and snow at all .
the country lacks snowploughs to clear roads .
in edinburgh , in fact , the army has been called in to help clear streets .
the country 's postal service , royal mail , is investing 20 billion pounds to be able to handle the christmas mail and parcels .
shop while you wait bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an exception for christmas : parcels are being delivered also on sundays in germany harsh weather conditions have generally been understood to spur online sales because customers can shop comfortably from home .
with the expected delays this year , however , experts say some customers might refrain from ordering online this shopping season .
current conditions demonstrate how sensitive online retail is to adverse weather conditions .
online shopping is still for now more popular in britain than it is in germany but it is becoming rapidly popular in europe 's largest economy .
some of the increase , interestingly , is attributed to smartphone users who like to use their downtime to shop online with their phones .
poinsettias still available online orders have also increased for fleurop .
germany 's largest flower mail-order service operates a network of 8,000 florists nationwide .
that dense network shortens distances between florists and customers , ensuring swift delivery .
but in extreme weather conditions , flights can be delayed or cancelled altogether .
occasionally , fleurop florists have to warn customers that a certain flower might not be deliverable on time .
but a spokesperson from fleurop told deutsche welle that , so far , it has not been forced to issue a warning for the popular christmas plant poinsettia – which is still readily available across germany .

the drastic downgrade hardly shows confidence in ongoing eu efforts to safeguard the euro at the brussels summit . ratings agency moody 's on friday dropped its rating on irish sovereign debt by five notches , suggesting it was less than enthused by thursday 's eu agreement on a permanent stability fund to protect debt-laden single currency users .
moody 's dropped ireland down five spots , from the third-highest available grade , aa2 , to baa1 , a risk level described as " lower medium grade . "
however , the agency added that this rating represented a " negative " outlook for a country , which would ordinarily have a very high credit rating .
moody 's said its decision was based " on the risk that the irish government 's financial strength could decline further if economic growth were to be weaker than currently projected or the costs of stabilizing the banking system turn out to be higher than currently forecast . "
european leaders gathered at a summit in brussels were seeking to shore up debt-laden eurozone countries , and the single european currency more generally ; but the measures agreed on thursday evidently did little to impress moody 's .
the establishment of a permanent rescue mechanism for eurozone members was designed , at least in part , to dispel concerns in the markets that europe may never repay its debts .
last , but not least bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen 's plan for recovery is unlikely to salvage his prime ministerial post " moody 's has this morning become the third of the three major ratings agencies to downgrade irish sovereign debt in the past four weeks , " the chief economist for dublin-based goodbody stockbroker 's , dermot o 'leary said .
" it has , however , outdone the other two with the scale of the downgrade . "
moody 's move follows similar , but smaller , reductions by fellow credit agencies , standard and poor 's and fitch .
the change means that investors will now demand a higher return in exchange for purchasing government bonds , effectively upping the price of existing and future loans for the irish government .
ireland recently became the second eurozone country , after greece , to seek emergency loans worth roughly 85 billion euros -lrb- $ 113 billion -rrb- from the european union and the international monetary fund .
the country 's rising national debt and enormous 2010 budget deficit - boosted by a government bailout of the country 's biggest moneylender , anglo irish bank - forced the government in dublin to call for help .
the financial turmoil has brought prime minister brian cowen 's coalition government to its knees , a snap election is expected early next year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 17.12.2010 electric cars hit us streets although future still uncertain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeffrey kaffee drives the first volt sold to the public out of the showroom the roll-out of electric cars by big automakers nissan and gm has sparked discussion about their prospects and acceptance by the larger public .
big hurdles remain but many are confident about electrics ' future . electric cars have had many false dawns over the years , but their proponents in the motor industry say now their time has come .
this december , two mass-market electric vehicles are hitting dealerships in selected markets around the world .
the general motors volt and nissan 's leaf are both aimed at delivering emissions-free driving at affordable prices .
motor trend magazine has called the chevy volt a " breakthrough " and a " game changer " and named it its 2011 car of the year .
a retiree in new jersey became the owner of the first volt , a gas-electric hybrid , to be sold to the public on december 15 , while nissan rolled out its leaf in a handful of us cities earlier this month .
both are scheduled for sale in europe in 2011 .
the developments have some experts saying that a major change is underway in the automobile industry .
general motors ' volt relies on a battery for the first 40 miles or 60 kilometers , after which a gas-powered engine kicks in to recharge the battery , which extends the range of the sedan by another 300 miles , or 480 kilometers .
in contrast , the leaf is all-electric with a range of around 100 miles , and just like early gas-powered vehicles , it might be difficult to find fuel nearby .
however , unlike the car 's predecessors , the leaf has a gps system .
press a small blue button and it will search for the nearest charging station .
still , many fear that ' range anxiety ' will put drivers off the all-electrics and that electric cars will remain a niche product .
but others say zero-emission vehicles will gain traction in the long term .
" we are the most bullish today by saying ten percent of the market 2020 will be zero emission , " nissan renault ceo carlos ghosn told a stanford university forum .
" frankly , i think the numbers will move up . ”
sticker shock bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the all-electric nissan leaf is more affordable it all sounds promising , although the price tag could limit its popularity .
even with a federal tax credit , the volt will set consumers back $ 33,500 -lrb- 25,155 euros -rrb- .
nissan 's leaf will not collide with bank accounts with quite the same ferocity .
tax incentives from washington and the state of california will bring the price of the four-door automobile down to just over $ 20,000 , about the same price as a gas-powered sedan .
still , that 's almost where the similarities with its gasoline-dependent brethren end .
starting up the leaf is a quiet process – there 's no traditional cranking sound of a starter .
there 's also no internal combustion engine .
instead , the car relies on lithium-ion batteries .
when it 's running , it emits a faint hum which has been added to alert pedestrians that a car is nearby .
nissan has spent $ 5 billion developing electric cars and ghosn insists this is a safe bet .
he says electric car sales will rise if oil prices go up and carbon dioxide restrictions get tougher .
event without new co2 rules , the international energy agency is promoting electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids as a way to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions , although the amount of the reduction depends on the electricity source .
while the cars themselves do n't emit greenhouse gases , the electricity plants where they get their energy from may .
" as a us average , a battery electric car we think would reduce greenhouse gas emission by about 40 percent compared to a conventional vehicle , " said timothy lipman of the university of california , berkeley .
" in california , because our grid is cleaner , it would probably be more like 60 percent reduction . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charging issues will have to be solved before electrics gain a wide following out of juice charging is a real issue when it comes to the acceptance or rejection of electrics with the wider population .
according to a recent report by the national research council , the current us electric grid could provide enough electricity to power 80 percent of today 's cars , if they were electric and provided that they were charged during off-peak hours , such as overnight .
however , some are looking at a different approach .
a company called " a better place " plans on offering electric car battery swapping pans , similar to mobile phone plans , in which monthly payments are based on the amounts of swapping and charging drivers do .
but some , such as berkeley 's lipman , doubt that such programs will be universally viable .
he said it might make sense to run a battery swapping operation in europe , where gas prices are relatively high , but in the us the system would probably not be able to compete with the relatively low price of gas . another battery-related worry has to do with a core component : lithium .
media reports say that bolivia , which has almost half the world supply of lithium , is considering tighter control of its lithium reserves .
other rare-earth resources , such as neodymium iron boron , could also pose problems .
china has the biggest deposits of this material has begun withholding it from the world market , pushing up its price .
future outlook government officials are already looking for substitutes for these materials .
one us government-funded research project is working on making electric cars easily affordable by radically redesigning their batteries , based on those used in hearing aids .
" we think that has the very distinct possibility of giving cars that now have a hundred mile range , a five hundred mile range at one third of the cost , " said us energy secretary david chu .
even if this technological breakthrough is far off on the horizon , lipman of berkeley 's transportation sustainability research center , says electric cars have a bright future .
he says they will eventually be embraced by more than just environmentalists .
" once people drive these cars , they see how they perform , how easy they are to operate , how quiet they are , the excellent acceleration and so forth , " he said .
" a lot of people are going to like these cars , not because they 're green , but because they 're better cars . "

the drastic downgrade hardly shows confidence in ongoing eu efforts to safeguard the euro at the brussels summit . ratings agency moody 's on friday dropped its rating on irish sovereign debt by five notches , suggesting it was less than enthused by thursday 's eu agreement on a permanent stability fund to protect debt-laden single currency users .
moody 's dropped ireland down five spots , from the third-highest available grade , aa2 , to baa1 , a risk level described as " lower medium grade . "
however , the agency added that this rating represented a " negative " outlook for a country , which would ordinarily have a very high credit rating .
moody 's said its decision was based " on the risk that the irish government 's financial strength could decline further if economic growth were to be weaker than currently projected or the costs of stabilizing the banking system turn out to be higher than currently forecast . "
european leaders gathered at a summit in brussels were seeking to shore up debt-laden eurozone countries , and the single european currency more generally ; but the measures agreed on thursday evidently did little to impress moody 's .
the establishment of a permanent rescue mechanism for eurozone members was designed , at least in part , to dispel concerns in the markets that europe may never repay its debts .
last , but not least bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen 's plan for recovery is unlikely to salvage his prime ministerial post " moody 's has this morning become the third of the three major ratings agencies to downgrade irish sovereign debt in the past four weeks , " the chief economist for dublin-based goodbody stockbroker 's , dermot o 'leary said .
" it has , however , outdone the other two with the scale of the downgrade . "
moody 's move follows similar , but smaller , reductions by fellow credit agencies , standard and poor 's and fitch .
the change means that investors will now demand a higher return in exchange for purchasing government bonds , effectively upping the price of existing and future loans for the irish government .
ireland recently became the second eurozone country , after greece , to seek emergency loans worth roughly 85 billion euros -lrb- $ 113 billion -rrb- from the european union and the international monetary fund .
the country 's rising national debt and enormous 2010 budget deficit - boosted by a government bailout of the country 's biggest moneylender , anglo irish bank - forced the government in dublin to call for help .
the financial turmoil has brought prime minister brian cowen 's coalition government to its knees , a snap election is expected early next year .

but at germany 's behest , aid will only be paid if it 's considered ' indispensable ' to the stability of the euro . european leaders have set up a permament emergency fund to help debt-laden countries , and have agreed to rewrite some of the bloc 's rules in a bid to shore up the value of the euro .
germany lobbied hard for changes to the lisbon treaty and a pledge to pay out aid only if it 's " indispensable , " as leaders meeting in brussels on thursday agreed on the need to make a temporary trillion dollar rescue fund into a permanent one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she was satisfied with the result " we stand ready to do whatever is required to ensure the stability of the eurozone , " said the president of the european council , herman van rompuy , after thursday 's meeting .
chancellor angela merkel expressed satisfaction with the results of the meeting , describing it as a " further step " towards greater coordination of economic policy within the eurozone .
" we will do whatever is required to secure the financial stability of the euro , " merkel told reporters at a friday press conference after the summit wrapped up .
french president nicolas sarkozy , a close ally of merkel 's on the issue of eurozone economic alignment , announced that he and merkel would be presenting new proposals on how to make the member countries work more closely .
" we have to tackle the competitiveness gaps within the 16 eurozone countries , " sarkozy said .
from the middle of 2013 , loans and guarantees similar to those offered to greece and ireland this year will only be offered if judged to be " indispensable " in saving the euro as a currency .
no spending cuts , no help that wording was added at the insistence of germany , likely to be the biggest individual contributor to future rescue funding .
berlin also stipulated that any bailout deal would require the recipient government to introduce a program of public spending cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank is to increase its capital base a two-sentence amendment was made to the eu 's lisbon treaty to permit the creation of the permanent rescue facility , the european stability mechanism .
article 125 of the 2007 lisbon treaty stated that the european union " shall not be liable for or assume the commitments of central governments , regional , local or other public authorities , other government bodies ... "
merkel pressed for changes to the article , because she said that a permanent mechanism might otherwise face a successful challenge in germany ’ s constitutional court .
leaders hope to have the necessary changes to the treaty ratified by the end of 2012 , with decisions on enacting rescue packages to be taken unanimously - effectively giving germany a veto .
it was also decided that there was no need to increase the existing rescue fund , which some analysts say would be insufficient in the case of future bailouts .
a number of countries led by germany put forward the argument that there was sufficient capacity in the present reserve . bonds kept off agenda discussion about the introduction of " e-bonds , " which would allow all european nations to borrow money at common rates , was kept off the agenda . merkel has said that the common bond plan " would not rid europe of its weaknesses , it would simply transmit them across the board . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal is next on the list of countries likely to need help underlining the need to reassure financial markets over fears that portugal and spain may be in need of bailouts soon , the european central bank also announced on thursday that it would double its capital to 10.76 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.3 billion -rrb- to cope with an increase in market volatility .
leaders were meeting in their seventh summit of a busy year , as markets have grown increasingly wary that eu states might default on loans secured through individual government bonds .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 17.12.2010 electric cars hit us streets although future still uncertain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeffrey kaffee drives the first volt sold to the public out of the showroom the roll-out of electric cars by big automakers nissan and gm has sparked discussion about their prospects and acceptance by the larger public .
big hurdles remain but many are confident about electrics ' future . electric cars have had many false dawns over the years , but their proponents in the motor industry say now their time has come .
this december , two mass-market electric vehicles are hitting dealerships in selected markets around the world .
the general motors volt and nissan 's leaf are both aimed at delivering emissions-free driving at affordable prices .
motor trend magazine has called the chevy volt a " breakthrough " and a " game changer " and named it its 2011 car of the year .
a retiree in new jersey became the owner of the first volt , a gas-electric hybrid , to be sold to the public on december 15 , while nissan rolled out its leaf in a handful of us cities earlier this month .
both are scheduled for sale in europe in 2011 .
the developments have some experts saying that a major change is underway in the automobile industry .
general motors ' volt relies on a battery for the first 40 miles or 60 kilometers , after which a gas-powered engine kicks in to recharge the battery , which extends the range of the sedan by another 300 miles , or 480 kilometers .
in contrast , the leaf is all-electric with a range of around 100 miles , and just like early gas-powered vehicles , it might be difficult to find fuel nearby .
however , unlike the car 's predecessors , the leaf has a gps system .
press a small blue button and it will search for the nearest charging station .
still , many fear that ' range anxiety ' will put drivers off the all-electrics and that electric cars will remain a niche product .
but others say zero-emission vehicles will gain traction in the long term .
" we are the most bullish today by saying ten percent of the market 2020 will be zero emission , " nissan renault ceo carlos ghosn told a stanford university forum .
" frankly , i think the numbers will move up . ”
sticker shock bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the all-electric nissan leaf is more affordable it all sounds promising , although the price tag could limit its popularity .
even with a federal tax credit , the volt will set consumers back $ 33,500 -lrb- 25,155 euros -rrb- .
nissan 's leaf will not collide with bank accounts with quite the same ferocity .
tax incentives from washington and the state of california will bring the price of the four-door automobile down to just over $ 20,000 , about the same price as a gas-powered sedan .
still , that 's almost where the similarities with its gasoline-dependent brethren end .
starting up the leaf is a quiet process – there 's no traditional cranking sound of a starter .
there 's also no internal combustion engine .
instead , the car relies on lithium-ion batteries .
when it 's running , it emits a faint hum which has been added to alert pedestrians that a car is nearby .
nissan has spent $ 5 billion developing electric cars and ghosn insists this is a safe bet .
he says electric car sales will rise if oil prices go up and carbon dioxide restrictions get tougher .
event without new co2 rules , the international energy agency is promoting electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids as a way to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions , although the amount of the reduction depends on the electricity source .
while the cars themselves do n't emit greenhouse gases , the electricity plants where they get their energy from may .
" as a us average , a battery electric car we think would reduce greenhouse gas emission by about 40 percent compared to a conventional vehicle , " said timothy lipman of the university of california , berkeley .
" in california , because our grid is cleaner , it would probably be more like 60 percent reduction . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charging issues will have to be solved before electrics gain a wide following out of juice charging is a real issue when it comes to the acceptance or rejection of electrics with the wider population .
according to a recent report by the national research council , the current us electric grid could provide enough electricity to power 80 percent of today 's cars , if they were electric and provided that they were charged during off-peak hours , such as overnight .
however , some are looking at a different approach .
a company called " a better place " plans on offering electric car battery swapping pans , similar to mobile phone plans , in which monthly payments are based on the amounts of swapping and charging drivers do .
but some , such as berkeley 's lipman , doubt that such programs will be universally viable .
he said it might make sense to run a battery swapping operation in europe , where gas prices are relatively high , but in the us the system would probably not be able to compete with the relatively low price of gas . another battery-related worry has to do with a core component : lithium .
media reports say that bolivia , which has almost half the world supply of lithium , is considering tighter control of its lithium reserves .
other rare-earth resources , such as neodymium iron boron , could also pose problems .
china has the biggest deposits of this material has begun withholding it from the world market , pushing up its price .
future outlook government officials are already looking for substitutes for these materials .
one us government-funded research project is working on making electric cars easily affordable by radically redesigning their batteries , based on those used in hearing aids .
" we think that has the very distinct possibility of giving cars that now have a hundred mile range , a five hundred mile range at one third of the cost , " said us energy secretary david chu .
even if this technological breakthrough is far off on the horizon , lipman of berkeley 's transportation sustainability research center , says electric cars have a bright future .
he says they will eventually be embraced by more than just environmentalists .
" once people drive these cars , they see how they perform , how easy they are to operate , how quiet they are , the excellent acceleration and so forth , " he said .
" a lot of people are going to like these cars , not because they 're green , but because they 're better cars . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 17.12.2010 agreement at eu summit fails to reassure markets großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and france oppose introducing euro bonds .
european leaders have agreed on a permanent rescue fund to cover countries in need of financial assistance .
german chancellor merkel hailed the summit as a success , but the measure has failed to reassure the markets . european leaders meeting in brussels have set up a permanent emergency fund to help debt-laden countries , and have agreed to rewrite some of the bloc 's rules in a bid to shore up the value of the euro .
" we will do everything to secure the financial stability of the euro as a whole , " german chancellor angela merkel said at a news conference after a european union summit .
she added that reform and stability will remain on the euro zone 's agenda next year as the bloc fights to secure the single currency and make its economies more competitive .
but the move was given an emphatic thumbs-down as the ratings agency moody 's downgraded ireland 's credit rating on friday by five notches , to baa1 , two notches above junk .
" while a downgrade had been anticipated , the severity of the downgrade is surprising , " dublin-based glas securities said .
spiraling debt eu leaders have spent most of 2010 trying to come up with successful measures to stop the region 's debt crisis spreading , but greece and ireland have already been forced to seek eu bailouts and portugal , spain , belgium and others are now in the spotlight .
on thursday leaders agreed on a change to the eu treaty to create the european stability mechanism -lrb- esm -rrb- – a permanent financial safety net of 750 billion euro from 2013 - that will help countries with liquidity problems and allow for debt restructuring of insolvent ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is determined to stabilize the euro eu leaders confirmed that private investors would be involved in the future euro zone rescue mechanism , a draft summit statement showed .
merkel said the fund would be sufficiently large .
" the more coherent economic policies are , the more we see by 2013 that states have made progress with a culture of stability , the lower the financial extent of the -lrb- rescue fund -rrb- will have to be , " she added .
germany lobbied hard for changes to the lisbon treaty and a pledge to pay out aid only if it 's " indispensable , " as leaders meeting in brussels on thursday agreed on the need to make a temporary trillion dollar rescue fund into a permanent one .
present dangers but market concerns are focused on whether the euro zone has sufficient immediate funds to come to the aid of the likes of portugal or spain , should they need a bailout next year .
" the new esm should safeguard the euro zone 's financial stability in the future .
however , it is to some extent window-dressing as it does not solve the current crisis , " said carsten brzeski , senior economist at ing bank .
the euro zone 's current fund - the european financial stability facility -lrb- efsf -rrb- - can borrow on the markets backed by euro zone government guarantees and has up to 440 billion euro to lend to governments cut off from market financing .
but many economists believe that even though only a small part of the efsf 's funds have been used to help ireland , it may turn out to be insufficient if more countries need help .
" european leaders failed to address the issue of debt sustainability and possible insolvency problems prior to 2013 .
debt restructuring , a common euro zone bond or an increase of the efsf ?
none of these issues have been addressed .
but they have to be , " brzeski said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markets reacted unvaforably to the eu summit " the preliminary outcome of the eu summit represents yet another missed opportunity by european policymakers to forcefully address investor concerns and calm markets in a more sustainable and pre-emptive manner , " said frank engels , economist at barclays capital .
underlining the need to reassure financial markets over fears that portugal and spain may be in need of bailouts soon , the european central bank also announced on thursday that it would double its capital to 10.76 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.3 billion -rrb- to cope with an increase in market volatility .
bonds kept off agenda discussion about the introduction of " e-bonds , " which would allow all european nations to borrow money at common rates , was kept off the agenda .
merkel has said that the common bond plan " would not rid europe of its weaknesses , it would simply transmit them across the board . "
germany is strongly opposed because e-bonds would effectively mean all 16 euro zone countries - or 17 when estonia joins the currency from jan .
1 , 2011 - financing a portion of their debt together and sharing a credit rating .
berlin , which is the benchmark issuer of debt in the euro zone and enjoys the lowest borrowing costs thanks to its economic strength and reliability , would have to surrender some of its credit to riskier euro states such as greece and ireland .
although germany is publicly opposed to the idea of euro-bonds , some in the euro zone back the idea .
" germany 's rejection of the expansion is another example of how euro zone governments do not agree on the best way forward to deal with this crisis , " said bnp paribas ' wattret .
" as a result , the measures taken have been piecemeal , unconvincing and reactive rather than pre-emptive .
this is going to have to change if confidence is to be restored in a lastingway , " he said .
leaders were meeting in their seventh summit of a busy year , as markets have grown increasingly wary that eu states might default on loans secured through individual government bonds .

dw-world.de opinion : heading in the right direction , but eurozone stability wo n't be easy as angela merkel tries to harmonize european economic policy , one should expect a lot more discord , according to christoph hasselbach , deutsche welle 's brussels correspondent .
a prime example is the euro bonds dispute .
-lrb- 17.12.2010 -rrb- irish debt dramatically downgraded despite eu rescue fund deal moody 's ratings agency has slashed its credit rating for ireland by five notches .
the drastic downgrade hardly shows confidence in ongoing eu efforts to safeguard the euro at the brussels summit .
-lrb- 17.12.2010 -rrb- european leaders seal deal on permanent crisis fund european leaders have agreed on a permanent rescue fund to cover countries in need of financial assistance .
but at germany 's behest , aid will only be paid if it 's considered ' indispensable ' to the stability of the euro .
-lrb- 17.12.2010 -rrb- merkel stands firm , but german parliament split over euro crisis in a speech to parliament , german chancellor angela merkel has fortified her stance against eurozone bonds and increasing the eu 's financial rescue fund a day ahead of an eu summit to consider new rules for the eurozone .

the document takes swiss precision to a whole new level . those swiss bankers , always showing up for work in faded t-shirts and stone-washed jeans .
well , no more .
the sartorially challenged , or simply clueless , finance professional now has a new dress code bible that gives definitive answers to all those pesky grooming and dressing issues .
swiss banking giant ubs this week release its new guidelines that leave little to chance , covering employees ' appearance pretty much from head to toe , from hair dyes -lrb- a no-no for men -rrb- to socks -lrb- leave the mickey mouse-themed ones at home -rrb- .
the rules are exhaustive , ranging from fairly obvious prohibitions against tattoos , piercings and ankle chains -lrb- who wears those anymore ? -rrb- , to more esoteric guidelines , such as the one stating that ties that do not match the " morphology of the face " should not be worn .
it 's all about " irreproachable behavior , " the dress code says , which " implies having an impeccable presentation . "
ubs has been trying to rebuild its reputation since enduring record losses during the financial crisis and getting a multi-billion euro bailout .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' fun ' socks are a fashion faux pas at swiss bank ubs if its employees are exquisitely groomed automatons , the thinking appears to be , the profit graph will once again start trending upward .
the bank said the suggestions are only meant for a small number of employees in five pilot branches in switzerland , but could be expanded .
a ubs spokesman said staff had reacted positively to the rules .
she 's got the look ?
" well , appearance is of course important for every professional sector , " andreas koehler , founder of the germany-based company the image consultants , told deutsche welle .
" it has been since the middle ages and before . "
he says he can understand a company wanting to keep up its image , since perception is often king .
and he points to the us civil war , where if you did n't have the right kind of beard , you could be suspected of being with the enemy , and shot .
" but of course , that a company makes such detailed suggestions for its dress code is a little embarrassing , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ubs can live with this look - just do n't let those roots show women need to take it easy on the perfume , and ideally apply it after a hot shower , and then only after applying body lotion while the skin 's pores are open . they should also avoid wearing " flashy " jewelry or skirts that are " too tight behind . "
underwear must not be " visible against clothing or spilling out of clothing . "
rather , they should be " skin-colored under white shirts . "
men need to trim their fingernails to 1.5 millimeters , and only wear a pair of lace-up shoes on alternate days , so as to allow the leather to breathe and recuperate .
and for god 's sake , " do not wash , nor ever iron your shirts yourself . "

he 's apologized for his recent comments that gay fans should n't fornicate at the qatar world cup . fifa president sepp blatter has apologized for saying that gay fans should " refrain from sexual activity " if they go to the 2022 world cup in qatar .
homosexuality is illegal in qatar and blatter 's original comments provoked anger among gay rights groups .
" i regret my comment , i did n't want to hurt anyone .
we are against discrimination .
i apologize for that comment , " blatter told a press conference ahead of saturday 's club world cup .
" it was not my intention and it will never be my intention to go into any discrimination because this is exactly what we -lrb- fifa -rrb- are against , so therefore if somebody feels they have been hurt , then i regret and i present apologies for that , " he added .
gay rights activists have reacted furiously after the comments and called for the head of the world soccer governing body to either apologize or resign after his comments this week .
former nba basketball star john amaechi - who revealed he was gay in 2007 - led the attack , accusing the fifa president of " epic , archaic , neanderthal , ignorance . "
a reputation for gaffes " with little more than an afterthought fifa has endorsed the marginalization of lgbt -lsb- lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender -rsb- people around the world , " he wrote on his blog .
" anything less than a full reversal of his position is unacceptable , " amaechi added .
blatter 's remarks are just the latest example of the 74-year-old football chief putting his foot in his mouth .
he told women footballers in 2004 that the best way to make their sport more popular would be to wear " tighter shorts . "
earlier this year , he suggested that john terry 's alleged affair , which led to him being stripped of the england captaincy , would have been applauded in latin countries .
qatar was awarded the world cup this month ahead of australia , the united states , japan and south korea .

a prime example is the euro bonds dispute . the two birth defects of the monetary union have come back to brutally haunt the eu : from the outset there was no common economic policy running parallel to the common currency .
hence huge imbalances were created in the eurozone .
and secondly , some of the member countries should never have been included in the euro in the first place .
greece is only the most flagrant , but not the only , example .
for a long time the eu has closed its eyes to these facts .
now they must deal with the consequences in a hurry .
in principle , the measures adopted are heading in the right direction .
governments are committing themselves to do everything necessary to protect the stability of the euro .
the starkness and vagueness of this statement is not a disadvantage .
obviously in theory there are limits to aid , but when numbers are mentioned , speculators are immediately encouraged to test the limits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph hasselbach , dw correspondent in brussels the permanent crisis mechanism is a sign of this mutual protection .
any doubts that the euro countries would abandon a country in an emergency , would cause a chain reaction .
this would break apart the monetary union , and if that happened , the germans especially would find it very expensive .
on the other hand , we can expect a lot of resentment if economic policy is adjusted belatedly in the euro countries .
some people might not perhaps realize what that means .
it is not just about fiscal consolidation , in itself difficult enough .
it 's also about sacred cows like national taxes , retirement policy and labor market legislation , to name only a few major areas .
this is about long national traditions , painstakingly developed social consensus .
while an alignment wo n't lead to a complete standardization , countries can not remain as they are now with differences as big as they are .
it is important that the benchmark for any harmonization is n't a so-called golden mean , but global competitiveness .
time is short .
the crisis is forcing the euro-zone countries to a level of integration that they would not have addressed voluntarily .
but that 's how it is in most cases .
if europe tries hard , it could actually emerge from the crisis stronger .

the rules are exhaustive , ranging from fairly obvious prohibitions against tattoos , piercings and ankle chains -lrb- who wears those anymore ? -rrb- , to more esoteric guidelines , such as the one stating that ties that do not match the " morphology of the face " should not be worn .
it 's all about " irreproachable behavior , " the dress code says , which " implies having an impeccable presentation . "
ubs has been trying to rebuild its reputation since enduring record losses during the financial crisis and getting a multi-billion euro bailout .

there are some , however , who think it enhances creativity . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
artists have n't abandoned search for psychedelic nirvana of inspiration do you think drugs can enhance artistic creativity ?
i know of no artwork made under drug influence that really is impressive and tells a good idea .
art is about ideas , drugs kill the ability to create them .
it 's funny how many great musicians failed more and more under the influence of drugs .
and if someone needs them to be creative or do art , he or she is maybe in the wrong profession .
the creativity should be naturally in you . - julius i do n't know , but i 've seen a number of movies and works of art where narcotics were clearly involved in their creation . - dairl yes , it is a medical fact that certain chemicals and enzymes make people more creative and active , no need to go far , look at caffeine as one .
people forget human beings are not only a soul but also a biological machine , a machine that is weak and sensitive to every element it interacts with , even if it is a substance or just a thought , weather conditions or social conditions , we react to everything around us and everything that is on the planet has impact on us in one way or another . - monie i have seen people paint under the influence of hashish and yes it definitely did enhance their creativity , the mind is free and hallucinating so it speaks for itself .
also look at movies , some were definitely written while under the influence . - johanna for some people , yes .
there is no given answer to the question .
people are different , and react differently when they ingest anything ... including food . - tracey to " open " a gate is not to reveal art .
if you can not find deep in your soul and mind the way to art , drugs are only a substitute not a tool that can enhance something . - adrian no , i have had artist friends try to get greater creativity from an altered state of mind , they get all excited and show their work , its just looks like art created by someone on drugs , not better quality . - jesse everyone is different , but it definitely does not work for me ...
i need clarity not cloudy .
as i say everyone is different , for some it may work .
i find when creating music high mostly i just jam endlessly or noodle if you will .
every day the same song is different , so one day it may sound great while the next disconnected and rambling .
for the listener it 's a 50/50 chance for a good show or recording . - randall depends on how creative the person is initially and how apt they are .
jimi hendrix was great guitar player because he practiced for many years and worked with other groups before he ever got famous . - erik i have no idea !
i do , however , know that substances , including alcohol , have taken the lives of many of our most talented creative minds ! - david compiled by stuart tiffen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with spaniards raul , jose manuel jurado and sergio escudero in the squad , along with christian metzelder and klaas jan huntelaar , who have experience playing in the spanish top flight , schalke can count on a good deal of insight into the playing style of the club from spain ’ s mediterranean coast .
“ it ’ s an attractive , and at the same time difficult draw , ” said schalke ’ s coach and general manager felix magath .
“ all the same , it ’ s our goal to get past valencia . ”
the two teams squared off in the group stage in the fall of 2007 , when valencia got the better of schalke , beating them in germany and drawing at home .
but as schalke defender benedikt hoewedes pointed out , just as schalke is a much different team to three years ago , so is valencia .
“ they ’ ve lost two very strong players in david silva and david villa , ” said hoewedes .
the round of 16 draw in full bildunterschrift : the other cup german sides bayer leverkusen and vfb stuttgart found out their opponents in the europa league round of 32 on friday .
group h winners stuttgart face a rather tough test in benfica , the portuguese champions who dropped out of schalke ’ s group in the champions league .
leverkusen , who won group b , will fancy their chances against the relatively inexperienced ukrainian club metallist kharkov , second place finishers in group i. the europa league round of 32 fixtures are two-legged matches set for february 17th and 24th , or 15th and 22nd .

bayer leverkusen drew against title holders atletico , with both german sides progressing . there was a dream start for new stuttgart head coach bruno labbadia , his players notching up five goals in their europa league soccer clash at home to danish club odense bk on thursday .
timo gebhart grabbed the first for stuttgart - who are already through to the next stage of the competition - on 20 minutes , scoring when his own header was chested back to his feet by odense defender anders moller christensen .
the second came in the form of a mistake from odense defender daniel hoegh , who accidentally stabbed a cross by gebhart into his own team 's net .
christian gentner was quickest to the ball after it hit defender thomas helveg , to make it 3-0 before pavel pogrebnyak made it 4-0 five minutes later .
that goal left spectators bewildered as the ball , which appeared to have been blocked by moller christensen , somehow found its way across the line through backspin .
although fortune smiled briefly on odense two minutes later , when john utaka maintained his composure in front of goal to net a neat consolation , there was more in stuttgart 's armory when ciprian marica fired in a goal in during extra time to make the final score 5-1 .
stuttgart go through as leaders of their group on 15 points , six points ahead of second place young boys from switzerland .
leverkusen draw , holders go out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atletico made every effort but were ultimately denied in other europa league football action , bayer leverkusen secured a 1-1 draw against europa league title holders atletico madrid on wednesday , sending the spanish side out of the competition .
atletico needed a win against leverkusen - who had already qualified - and needed other results to go in their favor to progress .
the spanish side did dominate the first half of the game with uruguayan striker diego forlan coming close with a half-volley just ahead of the break .
despite this , leverkusen soaked up the pressure and it was the germans who scored first - after a full 69 minutes - patrick helmes slotting the ball past atletico goalkeeper david de gea .
although atletico responded quickly , with a side-footed goal from fran merida just three minutes later , the spaniards were unable to take the lead .
in any case , a victory would not have helped atletico .
greek side aris salonika secured a win that ensured they finished in second place behind group leaders leverkusen .

there are some , however , who think it enhances creativity . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .

artists have n't abandoned search for psychedelic nirvana of inspiration do you think drugs can enhance artistic creativity ?
i know of no artwork made under drug influence that really is impressive and tells a good idea .
art is about ideas , drugs kill the ability to create them .
it 's funny how many great musicians failed more and more under the influence of drugs .
and if someone needs them to be creative or do art , he or she is maybe in the wrong profession .
the creativity should be naturally in you . - julius i do n't know , but i 've seen a number of movies and works of art where narcotics were clearly involved in their creation . - dairl yes , it is a medical fact that certain chemicals and enzymes make people more creative and active , no need to go far , look at caffeine as one .
people forget human beings are not only a soul but also a biological machine , a machine that is weak and sensitive to every element it interacts with , even if it is a substance or just a thought , weather conditions or social conditions , we react to everything around us and everything that is on the planet has impact on us in one way or another . - monie i have seen people paint under the influence of hashish and yes it definitely did enhance their creativity , the mind is free and hallucinating so it speaks for itself .
also look at movies , some were definitely written while under the influence . - johanna for some people , yes .
there is no given answer to the question .
people are different , and react differently when they ingest anything ... including food . - tracey to " open " a gate is not to reveal art .
if you can not find deep in your soul and mind the way to art , drugs are only a substitute not a tool that can enhance something . - adrian no , i have had artist friends try to get greater creativity from an altered state of mind , they get all excited and show their work , its just looks like art created by someone on drugs , not better quality . - jesse everyone is different , but it definitely does not work for me ...
i need clarity not cloudy .
as i say everyone is different , for some it may work .
i find when creating music high mostly i just jam endlessly or noodle if you will .
every day the same song is different , so one day it may sound great while the next disconnected and rambling .
for the listener it 's a 50/50 chance for a good show or recording . - randall depends on how creative the person is initially and how apt they are .
jimi hendrix was great guitar player because he practiced for many years and worked with other groups before he ever got famous . - erik i have no idea !
i do , however , know that substances , including alcohol , have taken the lives of many of our most talented creative minds ! - david compiled by stuart tiffen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but at germany 's behest , aid will only be paid if it 's considered ' indispensable ' to the stability of the euro . european leaders have set up a permament emergency fund to help debt-laden countries , and have agreed to rewrite some of the bloc 's rules in a bid to shore up the value of the euro .
germany lobbied hard for changes to the lisbon treaty and a pledge to pay out aid only if it 's " indispensable , " as leaders meeting in brussels on thursday agreed on the need to make a temporary trillion dollar rescue fund into a permanent one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she was satisfied with the result " we stand ready to do whatever is required to ensure the stability of the eurozone , " said the president of the european council , herman van rompuy , after thursday 's meeting .
chancellor angela merkel expressed satisfaction with the results of the meeting , describing it as a " further step " towards greater coordination of economic policy within the eurozone .
" we will do whatever is required to secure the financial stability of the euro , " merkel told reporters at a friday press conference after the summit wrapped up .
french president nicolas sarkozy , a close ally of merkel 's on the issue of eurozone economic alignment , announced that he and merkel would be presenting new proposals on how to make the member countries work more closely .
" we have to tackle the competitiveness gaps within the 16 eurozone countries , " sarkozy said .
from the middle of 2013 , loans and guarantees similar to those offered to greece and ireland this year will only be offered if judged to be " indispensable " in saving the euro as a currency .
no spending cuts , no help that wording was added at the insistence of germany , likely to be the biggest individual contributor to future rescue funding .
berlin also stipulated that any bailout deal would require the recipient government to introduce a program of public spending cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank is to increase its capital base a two-sentence amendment was made to the eu 's lisbon treaty to permit the creation of the permanent rescue facility , the european stability mechanism .
article 125 of the 2007 lisbon treaty stated that the european union " shall not be liable for or assume the commitments of central governments , regional , local or other public authorities , other government bodies ... "
merkel pressed for changes to the article , because she said that a permanent mechanism might otherwise face a successful challenge in germany ’ s constitutional court .
leaders hope to have the necessary changes to the treaty ratified by the end of 2012 , with decisions on enacting rescue packages to be taken unanimously - effectively giving germany a veto .
it was also decided that there was no need to increase the existing rescue fund , which some analysts say would be insufficient in the case of future bailouts .
a number of countries led by germany put forward the argument that there was sufficient capacity in the present reserve . bonds kept off agenda discussion about the introduction of " e-bonds , " which would allow all european nations to borrow money at common rates , was kept off the agenda . merkel has said that the common bond plan " would not rid europe of its weaknesses , it would simply transmit them across the board . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal is next on the list of countries likely to need help underlining the need to reassure financial markets over fears that portugal and spain may be in need of bailouts soon , the european central bank also announced on thursday that it would double its capital to 10.76 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.3 billion -rrb- to cope with an increase in market volatility .
leaders were meeting in their seventh summit of a busy year , as markets have grown increasingly wary that eu states might default on loans secured through individual government bonds .
the eu and international monetary fund set up a eurozone safety net fund , worth an estimated 750 billion euros , in may .

but was it worth leaving bed ? the snow does n't seem to have stopped falling for days , who knows how many degrees below zero it is outside , and all i can think of is staying under the covers and hibernating the next six months away . even with the heat blasting out of my radiators , i feel like i 've already turned into an icicle .
when the phone rings and the invitation comes for a trip to the christmas market i know i 'd have to be seriously deranged to voluntarily stand around in the freezing cold , my hands wrapped around a cup of hot alcoholic red liquid , dressed up with a few spices and a piece of moldy orange .
and i know my hangover the next day is guaranteed to be worse than if i 'd knocked back 15 tequila slammers . my friend valiantly proposes the traditional snacks of backfisch and kartoffelpuffer .
like a lump of fried cod wedged into a tiny roll or fried potato pancakes with apple sauce will convince me to expose myself to the worst mother nature has to offer germany 's capital .
" bah humbug ! "
i hear him mumble . scrooge ! ?
who me ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mulled wine is an essential part of the christmas market visit no , i 've got nothing against christmas , just against the cold !
give me a carol concert any day , a cup of nice mulled wine in front of an open fire , a jar of cookies perhaps and i 'll be whistling " we wish you a merry christmas " all the way into february - as long as i do n't have to step out the door . yet somehow the words , " ok , if i really must , " escape my lips in a whisper . this is germany after all and that means everyone must " do " at least one christmas market a year , if not two or three .
the idea is to wrap yourself in about a thousand layers and drag your reluctant body to the town square . frozen travels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : snow arrived early in berlin this year but that 's easier said than done in berlin .
from my place in neukoelln is no town square in sight , let alone a father christmas , string of tinsel or a loudspeaker blaring " jingle bells . "
i 'm going to have to brave the cold and leave my neighborhood before finding a warming mug of gluehwein . stumbling because of my partially frozen legs , i get off the tram only to be nearly knocked down by the siberian wind .
trudging through the snow , i focus on the ferris wheel at the christmas market on alexanderplatz to keep myself from turning around .
its flashing lights are all i can see as even the television tower has disappeared into the fog . when i find him , my friend is already propping up a kiosk ; sipping on his mulled wine and watching excited kids skate round and round on the ice rink .
tourists sing " away in a manger " in japanese or " the little drummer boy " in french .
my friend 's enthusiasm increases as i order the first of many gluehweins and join in for the next round of carols . measuring markets - and mulled wine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all gifts are worth giving these markets are not only about song and wine .
you 're supposed to wander the rows of stalls and buy socks your granddad does n't need , a wooly hat your mum will never wear , an amusing game for your boyfriend that he 'll never play .
but it 's all so expensive and little of it is even " made in germany . " but holy shit shopping is just around the corner .
it 's a designer christmas market that aims to open the wallets of 30-somethings who already buy anything they really want and can afford the far-from-cheap prices .
but the t-shirts with quirky designs , the cookies and candles with berlin motifs , the hand-knitted caps , and whacky trousers made out of pullovers have all been created by local artists , who plug their wares with wit .
i order another gluehwein and buy a hat . it keeps me snug at my next stop : the self-proclaimed " most beautiful christmas market in berlin " near the historic thoroughfare unter den linden .
tucked between the opera house and the friedrichswerder church , the market is indeed lovely .
the lights are tastefully arranged , the stands recall medieval times and the gluehwein tastes surprisingly good . yet not as good as the tiny christmas market in friedrichshain , where it is positively delicious and the atmosphere is delightful .
all around the samariter church are charming wooden shacks , where merry people sell mouth-watering home-baked cookies , colorful soft toys , teapots and other gifts friends and relatives are likely to appreciate . laden with colorful paper bags , i lumber home and immediately crawl back under the covers . the next day , the gluehwein 's warming effect has been replaced with a searing headache and burning throat .
i sneeze and think i should have followed my instincts .
instead i drank liters of cheap red wine and sang carols in all languages at the top of my voice .
next year , i will know better ! but in the meantime , merry christmas ! author : anne thomas editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 17.12.2010 electric cars hit us streets although future still uncertain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeffrey kaffee drives the first volt sold to the public out of the showroom the roll-out of electric cars by big automakers nissan and gm has sparked discussion about their prospects and acceptance by the larger public .
big hurdles remain but many are confident about electrics ' future . electric cars have had many false dawns over the years , but their proponents in the motor industry say now their time has come .
this december , two mass-market electric vehicles are hitting dealerships in selected markets around the world .
the general motors volt and nissan 's leaf are both aimed at delivering emissions-free driving at affordable prices .
motor trend magazine has called the chevy volt a " breakthrough " and a " game changer " and named it its 2011 car of the year .
a retiree in new jersey became the owner of the first volt , a gas-electric hybrid , to be sold to the public on december 15 , while nissan rolled out its leaf in a handful of us cities earlier this month .
both are scheduled for sale in europe in 2011 .
the developments have some experts saying that a major change is underway in the automobile industry .
general motors ' volt relies on a battery for the first 40 miles or 60 kilometers , after which a gas-powered engine kicks in to recharge the battery , which extends the range of the sedan by another 300 miles , or 480 kilometers .
in contrast , the leaf is all-electric with a range of around 100 miles , and just like early gas-powered vehicles , it might be difficult to find fuel nearby .
however , unlike the car 's predecessors , the leaf has a gps system .
press a small blue button and it will search for the nearest charging station .
still , many fear that ' range anxiety ' will put drivers off the all-electrics and that electric cars will remain a niche product .
but others say zero-emission vehicles will gain traction in the long term .
" we are the most bullish today by saying ten percent of the market 2020 will be zero emission , " nissan renault ceo carlos ghosn told a stanford university forum .
" frankly , i think the numbers will move up . ”
sticker shock bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the all-electric nissan leaf is more affordable it all sounds promising , although the price tag could limit its popularity .

while the cars themselves do n't emit greenhouse gases , the electricity plants where they get their energy from may .
" as a us average , a battery electric car we think would reduce greenhouse gas emission by about 40 percent compared to a conventional vehicle , " said timothy lipman of the university of california , berkeley .
" in california , because our grid is cleaner , it would probably be more like 60 percent reduction . ”

according to a recent report by the national research council , the current us electric grid could provide enough electricity to power 80 percent of today 's cars , if they were electric and provided that they were charged during off-peak hours , such as overnight .
however , some are looking at a different approach .
a company called " a better place " plans on offering electric car battery swapping pans , similar to mobile phone plans , in which monthly payments are based on the amounts of swapping and charging drivers do .
but some , such as berkeley 's lipman , doubt that such programs will be universally viable .
he said it might make sense to run a battery swapping operation in europe , where gas prices are relatively high , but in the us the system would probably not be able to compete with the relatively low price of gas . another battery-related worry has to do with a core component : lithium .
media reports say that bolivia , which has almost half the world supply of lithium , is considering tighter control of its lithium reserves .

even if this technological breakthrough is far off on the horizon , lipman of berkeley 's transportation sustainability research center , says electric cars have a bright future .
he says they will eventually be embraced by more than just environmentalists .
" once people drive these cars , they see how they perform , how easy they are to operate , how quiet they are , the excellent acceleration and so forth , " he said .

big hurdles remain but many are confident about electrics ' future . electric cars have had many false dawns over the years , but their proponents in the motor industry say now their time has come .
this december , two mass-market electric vehicles are hitting dealerships in selected markets around the world .
the general motors volt and nissan 's leaf are both aimed at delivering emissions-free driving at affordable prices .
motor trend magazine has called the chevy volt a " breakthrough " and a " game changer " and named it its 2011 car of the year .
a retiree in new jersey became the owner of the first volt , a gas-electric hybrid , to be sold to the public on december 15 , while nissan rolled out its leaf in a handful of us cities earlier this month .
both are scheduled for sale in europe in 2011 .
the developments have some experts saying that a major change is underway in the automobile industry .
general motors ' volt relies on a battery for the first 40 miles or 60 kilometers , after which a gas-powered engine kicks in to recharge the battery , which extends the range of the sedan by another 300 miles , or 480 kilometers .
in contrast , the leaf is all-electric with a range of around 100 miles , and just like early gas-powered vehicles , it might be difficult to find fuel nearby .
however , unlike the car 's predecessors , the leaf has a gps system .
press a small blue button and it will search for the nearest charging station .
still , many fear that ' range anxiety ' will put drivers off the all-electrics and that electric cars will remain a niche product .
but others say zero-emission vehicles will gain traction in the long term .
" we are the most bullish today by saying ten percent of the market 2020 will be zero emission , " nissan renault ceo carlos ghosn told a stanford university forum .
" frankly , i think the numbers will move up . ”
sticker shock bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the all-electric nissan leaf is more affordable it all sounds promising , although the price tag could limit its popularity .
even with a federal tax credit , the volt will set consumers back $ 33,500 -lrb- 25,155 euros -rrb- .
nissan 's leaf will not collide with bank accounts with quite the same ferocity .

schalke 04 , who have endured some tough times domestically this season , also topped their group ahead of more fancied teams such as benfica and lyon .
" bayern munich and schalke have played a lot better in the champions league this season than they have in the bundesliga , " freelance soccer writer and sometime sportschau.de correspondent marcus bark told deutsche welle .
" schalke coach felix magath has even gone as far as to say that his team takes the champions league more seriously , although it 's hard to believe that this is true . "
out of the three german teams who qualified for this season 's champions league , only werder bremen failed to make it out of the group stage .
" for the past few seasons , two out of the three german teams have gone relatively far in the champions league , " bark said .
" even wolfsburg who dropped out of the champions league at the group stage last year , went on to reach the quarter-finals of the europa league . "
in this season 's europa league , bayer leverkusen and vfb stuttgart have mirrored the success of bayern and schalke by qualifying as the winners of their groups , with only borussia dortmund - somewhat surprisingly considering their domestic form - failing to reach the last 32 .
close followers of the bundesliga may not be that surprised to see such a strong german showing .
this season is hardly a one-off .

the 2009 europa league finalists werder bremen , wolfsburg and hamburg all made it to the quarter-finals of the europa league last season with hamburg progressing to the semi-finals - as they did the year before - before defeat to fulham ended their dream of competing for the title in their own stadium .
german teams have been putting in consistently strong performances in european competition for over a decade now , with at least one of the bundesliga 's six allotted representatives progressing to the quarter-finals or further in both the champions and europa leagues over the past five years .
exposure to foreign opposition honing german skills marcus bark believes that the german national team ’ s long history of success helps to breed players ready for the styles and challenges of foreign opponents , and that this season 's champions league is a case in point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young but experienced : kroos , mueller and badstuber " i think german teams have done so well in europe this season because a lot of the young german stars in these teams performed very well at the world cup , " he said .
" if you look at bayern 's team with lahm , schweinsteiger , kroos , mueller and badstuber , they all have international experience and confidence at that level . "
joerg jakob , deputy editor-in-chief at kicker magazine , agrees that foreign experience helps when attempting to win european trophies but believes that the bundesliga 's recent success is based more on the rise of its young stars . " of course you learn from playing at the world cup or by facing european competition but this is not new for german players and teams , " jakob told deutsche welle .
one of the reasons german teams are doing so well in europe , says jakob , is because of the youth development .
“ bundesliga clubs have to have education and training facilities for young people under dfb rules they introduced in 2000 , so now we have better and more talented youngsters who play a more modern style .
we also have young , modern coaches to guide them . " cash flow essential to maintaining bundesliga 's success according to marcus bark , the bundesliga 's comparatively stable financial situation - in relation to other debt-ridden leagues - is also aiding german teams . " in other leagues , the best players are sold off , making only a few clubs capable of fielding good teams in europe , " he said .
" in germany , the clubs pay well and on time .
they 're very well run and the money is used to develop talent and to hold onto players - again , look at lahm and schweinstieger at bayern ; they ’ ve been approached by europe 's biggest clubs but have chosen to stay . " if money helps bundesliga teams produce european stars of the future and keep at least some of them from the clutches of the leading clubs in the continent ’ s other leagues , then the bundesliga will need a steady stream of revenue if germany 's record in europe is to continue to improve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's loss could be germany 's champions league gain marcus bark and joerg jakob do n't see this as being a problem , even less so in the coming years as the bundesliga looks ready to usurp the underperforming italian league to snatch a fourth champions league place under uefa 's coefficient system which takes into account the results of a particular nation 's clubs in european competitions over the preceding five years . " the bundesliga attracts money , it generates money , and it keeps money , " bark said .
" buying in stars like robben , ribery , raul and huntelaar , the league has become more attractive which brings in bigger crowds .
the reasonable ticket prices also help ; a ticket on average for a bundesliga game is around 20 euros -lrb- $ 26 -rrb- where as in england you can pay up to 120 euros at some clubs .
most clubs have little or no debt so they 're making profits for reinvestment . " " if you ’ re a player on the transfer market , you want to be playing for a champions league team , " said jakob .

schalke 04 , who have endured some tough times domestically this season , also topped their group ahead of more fancied teams such as benfica and lyon .
" bayern munich and schalke have played a lot better in the champions league this season than they have in the bundesliga , " freelance soccer writer and sometime sportschau.de correspondent marcus bark told deutsche welle .
" schalke coach felix magath has even gone as far as to say that his team takes the champions league more seriously , although it 's hard to believe that this is true . "
out of the three german teams who qualified for this season 's champions league , only werder bremen failed to make it out of the group stage .
" for the past few seasons , two out of the three german teams have gone relatively far in the champions league , " bark said .
" even wolfsburg who dropped out of the champions league at the group stage last year , went on to reach the quarter-finals of the europa league . "
in this season 's europa league , bayer leverkusen and vfb stuttgart have mirrored the success of bayern and schalke by qualifying as the winners of their groups , with only borussia dortmund - somewhat surprisingly considering their domestic form - failing to reach the last 32 .
close followers of the bundesliga may not be that surprised to see such a strong german showing .
this season is hardly a one-off .
consistency breeds consistency for germans in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern romped to last year 's final before losing to inter both bayern and stuttgart made it into the knock-out rounds of the champions league last season - with the bavarian giants , who also made it to the quarter-finals the year before , romping all the way to the final .
the 2009 europa league finalists werder bremen , wolfsburg and hamburg all made it to the quarter-finals of the europa league last season with hamburg progressing to the semi-finals - as they did the year before - before defeat to fulham ended their dream of competing for the title in their own stadium .
german teams have been putting in consistently strong performances in european competition for over a decade now , with at least one of the bundesliga 's six allotted representatives progressing to the quarter-finals or further in both the champions and europa leagues over the past five years .
exposure to foreign opposition honing german skills marcus bark believes that the german national team ’ s long history of success helps to breed players ready for the styles and challenges of foreign opponents , and that this season 's champions league is a case in point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young but experienced : kroos , mueller and badstuber " i think german teams have done so well in europe this season because a lot of the young german stars in these teams performed very well at the world cup , " he said .
" if you look at bayern 's team with lahm , schweinsteiger , kroos , mueller and badstuber , they all have international experience and confidence at that level . "
joerg jakob , deputy editor-in-chief at kicker magazine , agrees that foreign experience helps when attempting to win european trophies but believes that the bundesliga 's recent success is based more on the rise of its young stars . " of course you learn from playing at the world cup or by facing european competition but this is not new for german players and teams , " jakob told deutsche welle .
one of the reasons german teams are doing so well in europe , says jakob , is because of the youth development .
“ bundesliga clubs have to have education and training facilities for young people under dfb rules they introduced in 2000 , so now we have better and more talented youngsters who play a more modern style .
we also have young , modern coaches to guide them . " cash flow essential to maintaining bundesliga 's success according to marcus bark , the bundesliga 's comparatively stable financial situation - in relation to other debt-ridden leagues - is also aiding german teams . " in other leagues , the best players are sold off , making only a few clubs capable of fielding good teams in europe , " he said .
" in germany , the clubs pay well and on time .
they 're very well run and the money is used to develop talent and to hold onto players - again , look at lahm and schweinstieger at bayern ; they ’ ve been approached by europe 's biggest clubs but have chosen to stay . " if money helps bundesliga teams produce european stars of the future and keep at least some of them from the clutches of the leading clubs in the continent ’ s other leagues , then the bundesliga will need a steady stream of revenue if germany 's record in europe is to continue to improve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's loss could be germany 's champions league gain marcus bark and joerg jakob do n't see this as being a problem , even less so in the coming years as the bundesliga looks ready to usurp the underperforming italian league to snatch a fourth champions league place under uefa 's coefficient system which takes into account the results of a particular nation 's clubs in european competitions over the preceding five years . " the bundesliga attracts money , it generates money , and it keeps money , " bark said .
" buying in stars like robben , ribery , raul and huntelaar , the league has become more attractive which brings in bigger crowds .
the reasonable ticket prices also help ; a ticket on average for a bundesliga game is around 20 euros -lrb- $ 26 -rrb- where as in england you can pay up to 120 euros at some clubs .
most clubs have little or no debt so they 're making profits for reinvestment . " " if you ’ re a player on the transfer market , you want to be playing for a champions league team , " said jakob .
" if germany has an extra team in the competition then this means someone else will be able to attract players , agents and sponsors .
of course money ’ s involved , but it ’ s the glamour and prestige of the champions league which will help you keep your youngsters and your stars , meaning you 'll remain competitive .

deutsche welle talked with him about the reasons for this surprising conclusion . andrew mack is the director of the human security report project -lrb- hsrp -rrb- at canada 's simon fraser university and a faculty member of the university 's new school for international studies .
from 1998 to 2001 he was director of the strategic planning office in the executive office of un secretary-general kofi annan .
he has taught at several universities , including the london school of economics , and has published in numerous international newspapers and magazines .
deutsche welle : a lot of people 's perception is that the world is getting more dangerous and violent .
your report says otherwise .
are we being hoodwinked by the media ?
andrew mack : there are two reasons why people believe that the world is becoming more dangerous even though there has been a big decline in the number and deadliness of wars since the end of the cold war 20 years ago . first , media reporting tends to be driven by what might be called the , " if it bleeds , it leads " imperative . this means in practice that wars that start almost always get reported , while those that quietly peter out tend to be ignored .
second , no international organization collects data on the number or deadliness of wars .
so while we have millennium development goals that track national , global and regional trends in progress in health , education , economic and environmental issues , there are no millennium security goals . your report paints a mixed picture of the threat presented by islamist militants .
one the one hand , 4 of the 5 deadliest conflicts are islamist in nature ; on the other , support for al-qaeda in the muslim world is declining .
is progress being made in this area , and if so , in what sense ?
there are reasons for both real concern and cautious optimism here . four of the world 's deadliest conflicts - iraq , afghanistan , pakistan and somalia - are indeed associated with islamist political violence . but one of the reasons for the high death tolls is that they also involve , to a greater or lesser degree , major powers - primarily the us .
this is significant because , since the end of world war ii , the deadliest conflicts have almost always been associated with direct or indirect involvement by one of more of the major powers .
there is room for cautious optimism in that radical islamist groups like al-qaeda have been losing support among muslims throughout the islamic world for some five years .
this is n't surprising .
their extremist ideology is rejected by the overwhelming majority of muslims - including most of those who are strongly opposed to us policies in iraq , afghanistan and pakistan .
the harshly repressive policies that radical islamists have sought to impose wherever they have gained power have been deeply resented .
and the targets of islamist terror are mostly muslim civilians . the decline in public support means that the radicals have little chance of winning popular revolutions .
on the other hand no radical islamist group has sufficiently powerful conventional military forces to defeat the armed forces of the states that they oppose .
what sort of benefits do you expect from a study that quantifies conflict in the way yours does ?
governments are increasingly demanding that their foreign and security policies be " evidence-based . "
providing hard data each year on the number and deadliness of armed conflicts at the global regional and national levels helps governments - and international agencies like the un - determine whether their policies are having an impact or not .
for example , since the end of the cold war the international community has dramatically increased the resources it puts into preventing wars , trying to stop those that ca n't be prevented , and preventing wars that have ended from starting again .
as the level of what might be called " international activism " has gone up the number of wars has come down . indeed in 2008 there were 78 percent fewer high-intensity wars - those that kill 1,000 or more people year - than in 1988 .
please look into your crystal ball : will the world be a safer or more perilous place in 2020 ?
if current trends continue - they may not - there are reasonable grounds for believing that the world will be a safer place . first , other things being equal , we expect the past half-century trend of rising incomes in most developing countries to continue .
in 2010 every region in the developing world is growing strongly .
this is important because the most robust and important finding to emerge from recent quantitative research is that as national incomes rise , the risk of war declines .
its not income per se that matters , but rather that when national incomes rise governments have more resources to buy off grievances that could lead to war , to coopt political opponents and to win wars that ca n't be prevented . second , the end of the cold war has removed a major cause of armed conflicts from the international system , while the dramatic increase in economic interdependence and in the number of democracies in the world over the past four decades has reduced the risk of international wars dramatically . in the 1950s there were six wars a year on average ; in the new millennium there has been less than one .
in other words the factors that have been driving war numbers down are likely to continue - or strengthen .
and there are no obvious adverse counter-trends that threaten to increase the risk of war .
in the longer term the instabilities associated with climate change may cause major problems , but these are unlikely to become manifest in the next 10 years .

bayer leverkusen drew against title holders atletico , with both german sides progressing . there was a dream start for new stuttgart head coach bruno labbadia , his players notching up five goals in their europa league soccer clash at home to danish club odense bk on thursday .
timo gebhart grabbed the first for stuttgart - who are already through to the next stage of the competition - on 20 minutes , scoring when his own header was chested back to his feet by odense defender anders moller christensen .
the second came in the form of a mistake from odense defender daniel hoegh , who accidentally stabbed a cross by gebhart into his own team 's net .

timo gebhart grabbed the first for stuttgart - who are already through to the next stage of the competition - on 20 minutes , scoring when his own header was chested back to his feet by odense defender anders moller christensen .
the second came in the form of a mistake from odense defender daniel hoegh , who accidentally stabbed a cross by gebhart into his own team 's net .

deutsche welle talked with him about the reasons for this surprising conclusion . andrew mack is the director of the human security report project -lrb- hsrp -rrb- at canada 's simon fraser university and a faculty member of the university 's new school for international studies .
from 1998 to 2001 he was director of the strategic planning office in the executive office of un secretary-general kofi annan .
he has taught at several universities , including the london school of economics , and has published in numerous international newspapers and magazines .
deutsche welle : a lot of people 's perception is that the world is getting more dangerous and violent .
your report says otherwise .
are we being hoodwinked by the media ?
andrew mack : there are two reasons why people believe that the world is becoming more dangerous even though there has been a big decline in the number and deadliness of wars since the end of the cold war 20 years ago . first , media reporting tends to be driven by what might be called the , " if it bleeds , it leads " imperative . this means in practice that wars that start almost always get reported , while those that quietly peter out tend to be ignored .
second , no international organization collects data on the number or deadliness of wars .
so while we have millennium development goals that track national , global and regional trends in progress in health , education , economic and environmental issues , there are no millennium security goals . your report paints a mixed picture of the threat presented by islamist militants .
one the one hand , 4 of the 5 deadliest conflicts are islamist in nature ; on the other , support for al-qaeda in the muslim world is declining .
is progress being made in this area , and if so , in what sense ?
there are reasons for both real concern and cautious optimism here . four of the world 's deadliest conflicts - iraq , afghanistan , pakistan and somalia - are indeed associated with islamist political violence . but one of the reasons for the high death tolls is that they also involve , to a greater or lesser degree , major powers - primarily the us .
this is significant because , since the end of world war ii , the deadliest conflicts have almost always been associated with direct or indirect involvement by one of more of the major powers .
there is room for cautious optimism in that radical islamist groups like al-qaeda have been losing support among muslims throughout the islamic world for some five years .
this is n't surprising .
their extremist ideology is rejected by the overwhelming majority of muslims - including most of those who are strongly opposed to us policies in iraq , afghanistan and pakistan .
the harshly repressive policies that radical islamists have sought to impose wherever they have gained power have been deeply resented .
and the targets of islamist terror are mostly muslim civilians . the decline in public support means that the radicals have little chance of winning popular revolutions .
on the other hand no radical islamist group has sufficiently powerful conventional military forces to defeat the armed forces of the states that they oppose .
what sort of benefits do you expect from a study that quantifies conflict in the way yours does ?
governments are increasingly demanding that their foreign and security policies be " evidence-based . "
providing hard data each year on the number and deadliness of armed conflicts at the global regional and national levels helps governments - and international agencies like the un - determine whether their policies are having an impact or not .
for example , since the end of the cold war the international community has dramatically increased the resources it puts into preventing wars , trying to stop those that ca n't be prevented , and preventing wars that have ended from starting again .
as the level of what might be called " international activism " has gone up the number of wars has come down . indeed in 2008 there were 78 percent fewer high-intensity wars - those that kill 1,000 or more people year - than in 1988 .
please look into your crystal ball : will the world be a safer or more perilous place in 2020 ?
if current trends continue - they may not - there are reasonable grounds for believing that the world will be a safer place . first , other things being equal , we expect the past half-century trend of rising incomes in most developing countries to continue .
in 2010 every region in the developing world is growing strongly .
this is important because the most robust and important finding to emerge from recent quantitative research is that as national incomes rise , the risk of war declines .
its not income per se that matters , but rather that when national incomes rise governments have more resources to buy off grievances that could lead to war , to coopt political opponents and to win wars that ca n't be prevented . second , the end of the cold war has removed a major cause of armed conflicts from the international system , while the dramatic increase in economic interdependence and in the number of democracies in the world over the past four decades has reduced the risk of international wars dramatically . in the 1950s there were six wars a year on average ; in the new millennium there has been less than one .
in other words the factors that have been driving war numbers down are likely to continue - or strengthen .
and there are no obvious adverse counter-trends that threaten to increase the risk of war .
in the longer term the instabilities associated with climate change may cause major problems , but these are unlikely to become manifest in the next 10 years .

schalke , stuttgart and leverkusen , meanwhile , were handed less formidable foes in europe . bayern fans will be wary of their team ’ s next test in the champions league as the club were handed a difficult tie with cup holders inter milan .
they will also be looking for revenge in the two-legged match , having lost to inter in last year ’ s final .
bayern sporting director christian nerlinger was quick to confirm the club was relishing a chance to reverse last year ’ s defeat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern fans hope this season 's encounter does n't end in tears " we still dwell a little on the lost final in madrid and now we have the opportunity with these two new matches against inter to put things right , " said nerlinger .
" it 's going to be difficult , but it could n't be more interesting for us . "
having won their qualifying group e , the bavarians avoided many of the tournament ’ s strongest sides - but didn ’ t miss inter , who finished a somewhat surprising second to tottenham hotspur in group a. bayern president karl-heinz rummenigge spoke for most when he called inter " without a doubt the most difficult we could have drawn . "
schalke luckier the growing spanish faction at gelsenkirchen side schalke will be looking forward to the club ’ s match against valencia .
with spaniards raul , jose manuel jurado and sergio escudero in the squad , along with christian metzelder and klaas jan huntelaar , who have experience playing in the spanish top flight , schalke can count on a good deal of insight into the playing style of the club from spain ’ s mediterranean coast .
“ it ’ s an attractive , and at the same time difficult draw , ” said schalke ’ s coach and general manager felix magath .
“ all the same , it ’ s our goal to get past valencia . ”
the two teams squared off in the group stage in the fall of 2007 , when valencia got the better of schalke , beating them in germany and drawing at home .
but as schalke defender benedikt hoewedes pointed out , just as schalke is a much different team to three years ago , so is valencia .
“ they ’ ve lost two very strong players in david silva and david villa , ” said hoewedes .
the round of 16 draw in full bildunterschrift : the other cup german sides bayer leverkusen and vfb stuttgart found out their opponents in the europa league round of 32 on friday .
group h winners stuttgart face a rather tough test in benfica , the portuguese champions who dropped out of schalke ’ s group in the champions league .
leverkusen , who won group b , will fancy their chances against the relatively inexperienced ukrainian club metallist kharkov , second place finishers in group i. the europa league round of 32 fixtures are two-legged matches set for february 17th and 24th , or 15th and 22nd .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 17.12.2010 tuberculosis makes a comeback in london großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuberculosis was once thought defeated in the uk , but london is now the tb capital of western europe tuberculosis , which was thought to have been conquered by the early 1980s , has made a resurgence in the uk , especially in london , where victorian living conditions are common among some groups . the rates of tuberculosis are rising in britain , according to an article published friday in the british medical journal the lancet , while the disease 's occurrences in other western european countries are dropping .
the problem is becoming particularly acute in london , where 40 percent of all of the uk 's tb cases have been reported .
four in ten cases are reported in the capital , with the number of cases rising by nearly 50 percent since 1999 .
" it 's prevailing today in certain sections of the community that replicate conditions in victorian london , " tb expert alimuddin zumla of university college london told deutsche welle .
" most of the tb occurs in areas where there 's deprivation and poverty , and that 's where all the homeless are .
so we 've set up an endemic cycle of transmission . "
in all european countries , tuberculosis is largely concentrated in high-risk groups , such as migrants , refugees , homeless people , drug users , prisoners and hiv-infected people .
it is caused by a bacterial infection , usually of the lungs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some tb strains in south africa are resistant to all known tb drugs the increase in the number of tb cases in the uk has largely been among immigrant groups , although most were not new migrants .
among the cases of those born overseas , 85 percent had lived in the uk for two or more years and about half had lived in the country for five or more years .
the death toll from tb , which used to referred to as the " white plague " due to the pallor of those who had it , began to fall in london at the beginning of the 20th century thanks to improved living standards .
in the early 1960s , anti-tb drugs , better health services and bcg vaccinations continued to cut the number of cases .
the disease was thought to have been conquered by the early 1980s , but had something of a resurgence with the coming of hiv , which weakens the body 's immune system .
in london , as recently as 2000 , everyone thought the disease had been conquered , according to zumla .
but now among high-risk populations , tb rates are equivalent to those in africa .
drug resistant strains another alarming fact is that drug-resistant forms of the disease are beginning to be seen .
complying with the six-month regime of antibiotic treatment has meant that strains of tb have become resistant to drug treatments .
" people start feeling better after two months and stop taking their tablets and drug resistance occurs , " zumla said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in india , new treatment methods have helped cut the number of cases the situation is very serious in south africa , where strains have developed which are resistant to all known tb drugs .
in london , tb is showing up that is still treatable , but resistant to the most commonly used drugs .
zumla said the situation in london is reminiscent of multi-drug resistant tb outbreaks in prisons in the us in the 1990s .
they required a large financial investment to be brought under control .
he has called for a reconsideration of the delivery of tb services by britain 's national health service , standardized treatment and care methods and improvements in access to tb services .
he said because many with tb do not have permanent residences , it is difficult to get them to special clinics for treatment and ensure that they comply with drug regimens .
in new york , he said , a community-based model where health care workers take services to those affected has proven effective and should be adopted in the uk .
britain , one of the world 's major foreign-aid providers , is active in funding anti-tb programs overseas , but zumla says the country needs to look in its own backyard .
" we seem to neglect our own people here , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 17.12.2010 agreement at eu summit fails to reassure markets großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and france oppose introducing euro bonds .
european leaders have agreed on a permanent rescue fund to cover countries in need of financial assistance .
german chancellor merkel hailed the summit as a success , but the measure has failed to reassure the markets . european leaders meeting in brussels have set up a permanent emergency fund to help debt-laden countries , and have agreed to rewrite some of the bloc 's rules in a bid to shore up the value of the euro .
" we will do everything to secure the financial stability of the euro as a whole , " german chancellor angela merkel said at a news conference after a european union summit .
she added that reform and stability will remain on the euro zone 's agenda next year as the bloc fights to secure the single currency and make its economies more competitive .
but the move was given an emphatic thumbs-down as the ratings agency moody 's downgraded ireland 's credit rating on friday by five notches , to baa1 , two notches above junk .
" while a downgrade had been anticipated , the severity of the downgrade is surprising , " dublin-based glas securities said .
spiraling debt eu leaders have spent most of 2010 trying to come up with successful measures to stop the region 's debt crisis spreading , but greece and ireland have already been forced to seek eu bailouts and portugal , spain , belgium and others are now in the spotlight .
on thursday leaders agreed on a change to the eu treaty to create the european stability mechanism -lrb- esm -rrb- – a permanent financial safety net of 750 billion euro from 2013 - that will help countries with liquidity problems and allow for debt restructuring of insolvent ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is determined to stabilize the euro eu leaders confirmed that private investors would be involved in the future euro zone rescue mechanism , a draft summit statement showed .
merkel said the fund would be sufficiently large .
" the more coherent economic policies are , the more we see by 2013 that states have made progress with a culture of stability , the lower the financial extent of the -lrb- rescue fund -rrb- will have to be , " she added .
germany lobbied hard for changes to the lisbon treaty and a pledge to pay out aid only if it 's " indispensable , " as leaders meeting in brussels on thursday agreed on the need to make a temporary trillion dollar rescue fund into a permanent one .
present dangers but market concerns are focused on whether the euro zone has sufficient immediate funds to come to the aid of the likes of portugal or spain , should they need a bailout next year .
" the new esm should safeguard the euro zone 's financial stability in the future .
however , it is to some extent window-dressing as it does not solve the current crisis , " said carsten brzeski , senior economist at ing bank .
the euro zone 's current fund - the european financial stability facility -lrb- efsf -rrb- - can borrow on the markets backed by euro zone government guarantees and has up to 440 billion euro to lend to governments cut off from market financing .
but many economists believe that even though only a small part of the efsf 's funds have been used to help ireland , it may turn out to be insufficient if more countries need help .
" european leaders failed to address the issue of debt sustainability and possible insolvency problems prior to 2013 .
debt restructuring , a common euro zone bond or an increase of the efsf ?
none of these issues have been addressed .
but they have to be , " brzeski said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markets reacted unvaforably to the eu summit " the preliminary outcome of the eu summit represents yet another missed opportunity by european policymakers to forcefully address investor concerns and calm markets in a more sustainable and pre-emptive manner , " said frank engels , economist at barclays capital .
underlining the need to reassure financial markets over fears that portugal and spain may be in need of bailouts soon , the european central bank also announced on thursday that it would double its capital to 10.76 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.3 billion -rrb- to cope with an increase in market volatility .
bonds kept off agenda discussion about the introduction of " e-bonds , " which would allow all european nations to borrow money at common rates , was kept off the agenda .
merkel has said that the common bond plan " would not rid europe of its weaknesses , it would simply transmit them across the board . "
germany is strongly opposed because e-bonds would effectively mean all 16 euro zone countries - or 17 when estonia joins the currency from jan .
1 , 2011 - financing a portion of their debt together and sharing a credit rating .
berlin , which is the benchmark issuer of debt in the euro zone and enjoys the lowest borrowing costs thanks to its economic strength and reliability , would have to surrender some of its credit to riskier euro states such as greece and ireland .
although germany is publicly opposed to the idea of euro-bonds , some in the euro zone back the idea .
" germany 's rejection of the expansion is another example of how euro zone governments do not agree on the best way forward to deal with this crisis , " said bnp paribas ' wattret .
" as a result , the measures taken have been piecemeal , unconvincing and reactive rather than pre-emptive .
this is going to have to change if confidence is to be restored in a lastingway , " he said .
leaders were meeting in their seventh summit of a busy year , as markets have grown increasingly wary that eu states might default on loans secured through individual government bonds .

dw-world.de opinion : heading in the right direction , but eurozone stability wo n't be easy as angela merkel tries to harmonize european economic policy , one should expect a lot more discord , according to christoph hasselbach , deutsche welle 's brussels correspondent .

hundreds of road traffic accidents and grounded airplanes have made life difficult for people and police alike . heavy snowfall across much of germany has caused widespread traffic jams and hundreds of accidents on the roads , as well as severely interrupting air and rail travel .
the blizzard " petra " has largely abated but the german weather service , the dwd , is still issuing mild weather warnings nationwide , describing the overall situation on its website as " extremely wintery across the board . "
meanwhile , authorities are scrambling to clear thursday 's heavy snowfall from the country 's highways , runways and railways .
airport backlogs germany 's largest airport , in frankfurt , was operating " entirely without disruptions " early on friday , according to a spokesman for the hub .
nevertheless , roughly 100 flights have been cancelled , partly because of problems at other european airports , and also as a knock-on effect from the airport 's brief closure on thursday night .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the going has been unusually slow on the fast-moving autobahns stuttgart airport , where snow was still falling heavily on friday morning , reported delays caused by the intermittent closure of runways in order to clear away fresh snow .
several other airports were still battling to minimize delays on friday , and the german red cross has been taking camp beds , sleeping bags and blankets to german terminals , anticipating more stranded passengers .
almost 200 kilometers of traffic jams the greatest disruptions hit germany 's road network , especially the highways .
thousands of road traffic accidents were recorded by german police on thursday , mostly caused by the adverse weather ; three people lost their lives in the crashes .
the motorway network came close to gridlock during the worst of the snowfall , with authorities in the western state of north rhine-westphalia alone recording a total of 185 kilometers -lrb- 115 miles -rrb- of traffic jams at one point late on thursday evening .
one single queue , on the a3 highway near leverkusen , stretched back 40 kilometers .
parts of the country even banned heavy goods vehicles from taking to the highways overnight , after several got bogged down in the snow ; but that ban has since been lifted .
although the situation is now clearing , police have asked all road users to plan plenty of extra time for their journeys , and to adapt their driving style to suit the conditions .
meanwhile , the german rail service , deutsche bahn - also facing numerous weather-related delays and cancellations - has opened up a free customer service phone hotline for timetable inquiries .

but for consumers , the move will require getting used to longer personal account and bank identifier numbers . the european commission has said enough is enough .
the executive arm of the european union on thursday decided to set a deadline to accelerate its unified payment system , known as the single euro payment area -lrb- sepa -rrb- after voluntary efforts to introduce the scheme fell short of expectations . under a draft law expected to be approved by eu member states and the european parliament , national credit transfers and direct debit are to be phased out and replaced by sepa in 12 and 24 months respectively . off to a slow start sepa was introduced in 2008 to reduce the costs of payments , increase competition and make cross-border payments as easy as domestic ones .
a study for the commission estimated that sepa would save the eu economy 123 billion euros -lrb- $ 163 billion -rrb- over six years . but by october of this year , only 9.6 percent of eurozone credit transfers were made using the new system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks , including those in germany , have been slow to embrace sepa eu internal market commissioner michel barnier said the proposed law would fix " end-dates to make this pan-european system a reality , hopefully as early as 2012 . " the common payment area comprises more than 500 million citizens , including some 20 million businesses and european public authorities in the 27-member eu .
all of them with euro bank accounts can make and receive payments in euro under the same basic conditions , rights and obligations , regardless of their location . under the system , for instance , a resident of the netherlands working in belgium would receive his salary from his dutch bank as quickly as his belgian colleagues .
or a german family could pay all the utility bills for a holiday home in spain by simple direct debit from a german account . new account number twice as long but to enjoy such comfort in making payments , consumers in most countries will have to get used to writing or typing long bank account number and bank identifier codes . in germany , bank account holders will need to type in a 22-character international bank account number -lrb- iban -rrb- , consisting of numbers and letters .

a prime example is the euro bonds dispute . the two birth defects of the monetary union have come back to brutally haunt the eu : from the outset there was no common economic policy running parallel to the common currency .
hence huge imbalances were created in the eurozone .
and secondly , some of the member countries should never have been included in the euro in the first place .
greece is only the most flagrant , but not the only , example .
for a long time the eu has closed its eyes to these facts .
now they must deal with the consequences in a hurry .
in principle , the measures adopted are heading in the right direction .
governments are committing themselves to do everything necessary to protect the stability of the euro .
the starkness and vagueness of this statement is not a disadvantage .
obviously in theory there are limits to aid , but when numbers are mentioned , speculators are immediately encouraged to test the limits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph hasselbach , dw correspondent in brussels the permanent crisis mechanism is a sign of this mutual protection .
any doubts that the euro countries would abandon a country in an emergency , would cause a chain reaction .
this would break apart the monetary union , and if that happened , the germans especially would find it very expensive .
on the other hand , we can expect a lot of resentment if economic policy is adjusted belatedly in the euro countries .
some people might not perhaps realize what that means .
it is not just about fiscal consolidation , in itself difficult enough .
it 's also about sacred cows like national taxes , retirement policy and labor market legislation , to name only a few major areas .
this is about long national traditions , painstakingly developed social consensus .
while an alignment wo n't lead to a complete standardization , countries can not remain as they are now with differences as big as they are .
it is important that the benchmark for any harmonization is n't a so-called golden mean , but global competitiveness .
time is short .
the crisis is forcing the euro-zone countries to a level of integration that they would not have addressed voluntarily .
but that 's how it is in most cases .
if europe tries hard , it could actually emerge from the crisis stronger .

the problem is becoming particularly acute in london , where 40 percent of all of the uk 's tb cases have been reported .
four in ten cases are reported in the capital , with the number of cases rising by nearly 50 percent since 1999 .
" it 's prevailing today in certain sections of the community that replicate conditions in victorian london , " tb expert alimuddin zumla of university college london told deutsche welle .
" most of the tb occurs in areas where there 's deprivation and poverty , and that 's where all the homeless are .
so we 've set up an endemic cycle of transmission . "
in all european countries , tuberculosis is largely concentrated in high-risk groups , such as migrants , refugees , homeless people , drug users , prisoners and hiv-infected people .
it is caused by a bacterial infection , usually of the lungs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some tb strains in south africa are resistant to all known tb drugs the increase in the number of tb cases in the uk has largely been among immigrant groups , although most were not new migrants .
among the cases of those born overseas , 85 percent had lived in the uk for two or more years and about half had lived in the country for five or more years .
the death toll from tb , which used to referred to as the " white plague " due to the pallor of those who had it , began to fall in london at the beginning of the 20th century thanks to improved living standards .
in the early 1960s , anti-tb drugs , better health services and bcg vaccinations continued to cut the number of cases .
the disease was thought to have been conquered by the early 1980s , but had something of a resurgence with the coming of hiv , which weakens the body 's immune system .
in london , as recently as 2000 , everyone thought the disease had been conquered , according to zumla .
but now among high-risk populations , tb rates are equivalent to those in africa .
drug resistant strains another alarming fact is that drug-resistant forms of the disease are beginning to be seen .
complying with the six-month regime of antibiotic treatment has meant that strains of tb have become resistant to drug treatments .
" people start feeling better after two months and stop taking their tablets and drug resistance occurs , " zumla said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in india , new treatment methods have helped cut the number of cases the situation is very serious in south africa , where strains have developed which are resistant to all known tb drugs .
in london , tb is showing up that is still treatable , but resistant to the most commonly used drugs .
zumla said the situation in london is reminiscent of multi-drug resistant tb outbreaks in prisons in the us in the 1990s .
they required a large financial investment to be brought under control .
he has called for a reconsideration of the delivery of tb services by britain 's national health service , standardized treatment and care methods and improvements in access to tb services .
he said because many with tb do not have permanent residences , it is difficult to get them to special clinics for treatment and ensure that they comply with drug regimens .
in new york , he said , a community-based model where health care workers take services to those affected has proven effective and should be adopted in the uk .
britain , one of the world 's major foreign-aid providers , is active in funding anti-tb programs overseas , but zumla says the country needs to look in its own backyard .
" we seem to neglect our own people here , " he said .

european leaders have agreed on a permanent rescue fund to cover countries in need of financial assistance .
german chancellor merkel hailed the summit as a success , but the measure has failed to reassure the markets . european leaders meeting in brussels have set up a permanent emergency fund to help debt-laden countries , and have agreed to rewrite some of the bloc 's rules in a bid to shore up the value of the euro .
" we will do everything to secure the financial stability of the euro as a whole , " german chancellor angela merkel said at a news conference after a european union summit .
she added that reform and stability will remain on the euro zone 's agenda next year as the bloc fights to secure the single currency and make its economies more competitive .
but the move was given an emphatic thumbs-down as the ratings agency moody 's downgraded ireland 's credit rating on friday by five notches , to baa1 , two notches above junk .
" while a downgrade had been anticipated , the severity of the downgrade is surprising , " dublin-based glas securities said .
spiraling debt eu leaders have spent most of 2010 trying to come up with successful measures to stop the region 's debt crisis spreading , but greece and ireland have already been forced to seek eu bailouts and portugal , spain , belgium and others are now in the spotlight .
on thursday leaders agreed on a change to the eu treaty to create the european stability mechanism -lrb- esm -rrb- – a permanent financial safety net of 750 billion euro from 2013 - that will help countries with liquidity problems and allow for debt restructuring of insolvent ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is determined to stabilize the euro eu leaders confirmed that private investors would be involved in the future euro zone rescue mechanism , a draft summit statement showed .
merkel said the fund would be sufficiently large .
" the more coherent economic policies are , the more we see by 2013 that states have made progress with a culture of stability , the lower the financial extent of the -lrb- rescue fund -rrb- will have to be , " she added .
germany lobbied hard for changes to the lisbon treaty and a pledge to pay out aid only if it 's " indispensable , " as leaders meeting in brussels on thursday agreed on the need to make a temporary trillion dollar rescue fund into a permanent one .
present dangers but market concerns are focused on whether the euro zone has sufficient immediate funds to come to the aid of the likes of portugal or spain , should they need a bailout next year .
" the new esm should safeguard the euro zone 's financial stability in the future .
however , it is to some extent window-dressing as it does not solve the current crisis , " said carsten brzeski , senior economist at ing bank .
the euro zone 's current fund - the european financial stability facility -lrb- efsf -rrb- - can borrow on the markets backed by euro zone government guarantees and has up to 440 billion euro to lend to governments cut off from market financing .
but many economists believe that even though only a small part of the efsf 's funds have been used to help ireland , it may turn out to be insufficient if more countries need help .
" european leaders failed to address the issue of debt sustainability and possible insolvency problems prior to 2013 .
debt restructuring , a common euro zone bond or an increase of the efsf ?
none of these issues have been addressed .
but they have to be , " brzeski said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markets reacted unvaforably to the eu summit " the preliminary outcome of the eu summit represents yet another missed opportunity by european policymakers to forcefully address investor concerns and calm markets in a more sustainable and pre-emptive manner , " said frank engels , economist at barclays capital .
underlining the need to reassure financial markets over fears that portugal and spain may be in need of bailouts soon , the european central bank also announced on thursday that it would double its capital to 10.76 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.3 billion -rrb- to cope with an increase in market volatility .
bonds kept off agenda discussion about the introduction of " e-bonds , " which would allow all european nations to borrow money at common rates , was kept off the agenda .
merkel has said that the common bond plan " would not rid europe of its weaknesses , it would simply transmit them across the board . "
germany is strongly opposed because e-bonds would effectively mean all 16 euro zone countries - or 17 when estonia joins the currency from jan .
1 , 2011 - financing a portion of their debt together and sharing a credit rating .
berlin , which is the benchmark issuer of debt in the euro zone and enjoys the lowest borrowing costs thanks to its economic strength and reliability , would have to surrender some of its credit to riskier euro states such as greece and ireland .
although germany is publicly opposed to the idea of euro-bonds , some in the euro zone back the idea .
" germany 's rejection of the expansion is another example of how euro zone governments do not agree on the best way forward to deal with this crisis , " said bnp paribas ' wattret .
" as a result , the measures taken have been piecemeal , unconvincing and reactive rather than pre-emptive .
this is going to have to change if confidence is to be restored in a lastingway , " he said .
leaders were meeting in their seventh summit of a busy year , as markets have grown increasingly wary that eu states might default on loans secured through individual government bonds .

dw-world.de opinion : heading in the right direction , but eurozone stability wo n't be easy as angela merkel tries to harmonize european economic policy , one should expect a lot more discord , according to christoph hasselbach , deutsche welle 's brussels correspondent .
a prime example is the euro bonds dispute .
-lrb- 17.12.2010 -rrb- irish debt dramatically downgraded despite eu rescue fund deal moody 's ratings agency has slashed its credit rating for ireland by five notches .

germany lobbied hard for changes to the lisbon treaty and a pledge to pay out aid only if it 's " indispensable , " as leaders meeting in brussels on thursday agreed on the need to make a temporary trillion dollar rescue fund into a permanent one .
present dangers but market concerns are focused on whether the euro zone has sufficient immediate funds to come to the aid of the likes of portugal or spain , should they need a bailout next year .
" the new esm should safeguard the euro zone 's financial stability in the future .
however , it is to some extent window-dressing as it does not solve the current crisis , " said carsten brzeski , senior economist at ing bank .
the euro zone 's current fund - the european financial stability facility -lrb- efsf -rrb- - can borrow on the markets backed by euro zone government guarantees and has up to 440 billion euro to lend to governments cut off from market financing .
but many economists believe that even though only a small part of the efsf 's funds have been used to help ireland , it may turn out to be insufficient if more countries need help .
" european leaders failed to address the issue of debt sustainability and possible insolvency problems prior to 2013 .
debt restructuring , a common euro zone bond or an increase of the efsf ?
none of these issues have been addressed .
but they have to be , " brzeski said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markets reacted unvaforably to the eu summit " the preliminary outcome of the eu summit represents yet another missed opportunity by european policymakers to forcefully address investor concerns and calm markets in a more sustainable and pre-emptive manner , " said frank engels , economist at barclays capital .
underlining the need to reassure financial markets over fears that portugal and spain may be in need of bailouts soon , the european central bank also announced on thursday that it would double its capital to 10.76 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.3 billion -rrb- to cope with an increase in market volatility .
bonds kept off agenda discussion about the introduction of " e-bonds , " which would allow all european nations to borrow money at common rates , was kept off the agenda .
merkel has said that the common bond plan " would not rid europe of its weaknesses , it would simply transmit them across the board . "
germany is strongly opposed because e-bonds would effectively mean all 16 euro zone countries - or 17 when estonia joins the currency from jan .
1 , 2011 - financing a portion of their debt together and sharing a credit rating .
berlin , which is the benchmark issuer of debt in the euro zone and enjoys the lowest borrowing costs thanks to its economic strength and reliability , would have to surrender some of its credit to riskier euro states such as greece and ireland .
although germany is publicly opposed to the idea of euro-bonds , some in the euro zone back the idea .
" germany 's rejection of the expansion is another example of how euro zone governments do not agree on the best way forward to deal with this crisis , " said bnp paribas ' wattret .
" as a result , the measures taken have been piecemeal , unconvincing and reactive rather than pre-emptive .
this is going to have to change if confidence is to be restored in a lastingway , " he said .
leaders were meeting in their seventh summit of a busy year , as markets have grown increasingly wary that eu states might default on loans secured through individual government bonds .

dw-world.de opinion : heading in the right direction , but eurozone stability wo n't be easy as angela merkel tries to harmonize european economic policy , one should expect a lot more discord , according to christoph hasselbach , deutsche welle 's brussels correspondent .
a prime example is the euro bonds dispute .
-lrb- 17.12.2010 -rrb- irish debt dramatically downgraded despite eu rescue fund deal moody 's ratings agency has slashed its credit rating for ireland by five notches .
the drastic downgrade hardly shows confidence in ongoing eu efforts to safeguard the euro at the brussels summit .
-lrb- 17.12.2010 -rrb- european leaders seal deal on permanent crisis fund european leaders have agreed on a permanent rescue fund to cover countries in need of financial assistance .
but at germany 's behest , aid will only be paid if it 's considered ' indispensable ' to the stability of the euro .
-lrb- 17.12.2010 -rrb- merkel stands firm , but german parliament split over euro crisis in a speech to parliament , german chancellor angela merkel has fortified her stance against eurozone bonds and increasing the eu 's financial rescue fund a day ahead of an eu summit to consider new rules for the eurozone .

schalke , stuttgart and leverkusen , meanwhile , were handed less formidable foes in europe . bayern fans will be wary of their team ’ s next test in the champions league as the club were handed a difficult tie with cup holders inter milan .
they will also be looking for revenge in the two-legged match , having lost to inter in last year ’ s final .

having won their qualifying group e , the bavarians avoided many of the tournament ’ s strongest sides - but didn ’ t miss inter , who finished a somewhat surprising second to tottenham hotspur in group a. bayern president karl-heinz rummenigge spoke for most when he called inter " without a doubt the most difficult we could have drawn . "
schalke luckier the growing spanish faction at gelsenkirchen side schalke will be looking forward to the club ’ s match against valencia .
with spaniards raul , jose manuel jurado and sergio escudero in the squad , along with christian metzelder and klaas jan huntelaar , who have experience playing in the spanish top flight , schalke can count on a good deal of insight into the playing style of the club from spain ’ s mediterranean coast .
“ it ’ s an attractive , and at the same time difficult draw , ” said schalke ’ s coach and general manager felix magath .
“ all the same , it ’ s our goal to get past valencia . ”
the two teams squared off in the group stage in the fall of 2007 , when valencia got the better of schalke , beating them in germany and drawing at home .
but as schalke defender benedikt hoewedes pointed out , just as schalke is a much different team to three years ago , so is valencia .

with the expected delays this year , however , experts say some customers might refrain from ordering online this shopping season .
current conditions demonstrate how sensitive online retail is to adverse weather conditions .
online shopping is still for now more popular in britain than it is in germany but it is becoming rapidly popular in europe 's largest economy .
some of the increase , interestingly , is attributed to smartphone users who like to use their downtime to shop online with their phones .
poinsettias still available online orders have also increased for fleurop .
germany 's largest flower mail-order service operates a network of 8,000 florists nationwide .
that dense network shortens distances between florists and customers , ensuring swift delivery .
but in extreme weather conditions , flights can be delayed or cancelled altogether .
occasionally , fleurop florists have to warn customers that a certain flower might not be deliverable on time .
but a spokesperson from fleurop told deutsche welle that , so far , it has not been forced to issue a warning for the popular christmas plant poinsettia – which is still readily available across germany .

shop while you wait bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an exception for christmas : parcels are being delivered also on sundays in germany harsh weather conditions have generally been understood to spur online sales because customers can shop comfortably from home .
with the expected delays this year , however , experts say some customers might refrain from ordering online this shopping season .
current conditions demonstrate how sensitive online retail is to adverse weather conditions .
online shopping is still for now more popular in britain than it is in germany but it is becoming rapidly popular in europe 's largest economy .
some of the increase , interestingly , is attributed to smartphone users who like to use their downtime to shop online with their phones .
poinsettias still available online orders have also increased for fleurop .
germany 's largest flower mail-order service operates a network of 8,000 florists nationwide .
that dense network shortens distances between florists and customers , ensuring swift delivery .
but in extreme weather conditions , flights can be delayed or cancelled altogether .
occasionally , fleurop florists have to warn customers that a certain flower might not be deliverable on time .
but a spokesperson from fleurop told deutsche welle that , so far , it has not been forced to issue a warning for the popular christmas plant poinsettia – which is still readily available across germany .

the drastic downgrade hardly shows confidence in ongoing eu efforts to safeguard the euro at the brussels summit . ratings agency moody 's on friday dropped its rating on irish sovereign debt by five notches , suggesting it was less than enthused by thursday 's eu agreement on a permanent stability fund to protect debt-laden single currency users .
moody 's dropped ireland down five spots , from the third-highest available grade , aa2 , to baa1 , a risk level described as " lower medium grade . "
however , the agency added that this rating represented a " negative " outlook for a country , which would ordinarily have a very high credit rating .
moody 's said its decision was based " on the risk that the irish government 's financial strength could decline further if economic growth were to be weaker than currently projected or the costs of stabilizing the banking system turn out to be higher than currently forecast . "
european leaders gathered at a summit in brussels were seeking to shore up debt-laden eurozone countries , and the single european currency more generally ; but the measures agreed on thursday evidently did little to impress moody 's .
the establishment of a permanent rescue mechanism for eurozone members was designed , at least in part , to dispel concerns in the markets that europe may never repay its debts .
last , but not least bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen 's plan for recovery is unlikely to salvage his prime ministerial post " moody 's has this morning become the third of the three major ratings agencies to downgrade irish sovereign debt in the past four weeks , " the chief economist for dublin-based goodbody stockbroker 's , dermot o 'leary said .
" it has , however , outdone the other two with the scale of the downgrade . "
moody 's move follows similar , but smaller , reductions by fellow credit agencies , standard and poor 's and fitch .
the change means that investors will now demand a higher return in exchange for purchasing government bonds , effectively upping the price of existing and future loans for the irish government .
ireland recently became the second eurozone country , after greece , to seek emergency loans worth roughly 85 billion euros -lrb- $ 113 billion -rrb- from the european union and the international monetary fund .
the country 's rising national debt and enormous 2010 budget deficit - boosted by a government bailout of the country 's biggest moneylender , anglo irish bank - forced the government in dublin to call for help .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 17.12.2010 dw pundits emerge from mothership to pick match day 17 results großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pundits believe their time in the stars gave them new wisdom .
last week , an alien abduction prevented us from bringing you our predictions for match day 16 .
this week , probed , rested and ready , we 're hoping for a big week to make up for the dropped points . friday , dec .
17 moenchengladbach - hamburg friday night 's encounter features two of the bundesliga 's most out-of-form teams , each collecting just three points from their last five league matches .
hamburg coach armin veh appears out of answers to improve his team 's poor play , all but admitting as much after last week 's hammering at home to leverkusen .
gladbach 's michael frontzeck , meanwhile , might well need a win to stay in his job .
in that we 've said that before about the stern , bald man this season and he 's gotten the job done -lrb- witness the 4-0 win at cologne on match day 12 -rrb- , we like his chances .
prediction : 2-1 moenchengladbach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a dire start , schalke are finding their groove saturday , dec .
18 schalke - cologne the billy goats took all three points off of high-flying eintracht last week , but did so in the ugliest - and most fortunate - of circumstances .
they could have easily gone 3-0 down within the first 20 minutes , but did n't and got a goal from 19-year-old debutant christian clemens early in the second half .
then they held of for dear life .
schalke , for their part , have been bossing around the likes of bayern , benfica and mainz in recent weeks .
expect to find a broken cologne somewhere under an avalanche come saturday evening .
prediction : 4-1 schalke bremen - kaiserslautern the fight bremen put up against dortmund last week was as credible as any team 's has been over the last couple of months , and on another day they might well have eked out a draw rather than a 2-0 loss .
that good showing , coupled with kaiserslautern 's pitiful away form this season -lrb- two wins , six losses -rrb- , means werder should head into the break three points richer .
prediction : 2-0 bremen wolfsburg - hoffenheim the great steve mcclaren experiment in wolfsburg is beginning to look like a failure .
after spending big to get his englishman for the touchline -lrb- not to mention his brazilian , diego , for the number 10 shirt -rrb- , dieter hoeness might just have to head back to the drawing board come january .
word is edin dzeko will get his big-money move to manchester city , mark van bommel will be on his way in from bayern , and - providing hoffenheim lower the boom on saturday - mcclaren will be heading down to the jobcentre .
and so it will come to pass … prediction : 2-1 hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eintracht will have to show a lot of fight to take down dortmund frankfurt - dortmund dortmund 's effort in spain on wednesday night was valiant , but was n't good enough to get the win over sevilla they needed to stay in the europa league .
it could also prove one exertion too many ahead of a tough match at eintracht on the weekend .
coach michael skibbe 's men have hit a rough patch recently , losing three of four , but have had some tough luck along the way . we see that luck changing on saturday , helping produce a surprise result .
prediction : 1-0 frankfurt nuremberg - hanover just when you 're ready to write off nuremberg as rubbish , and hanover as merely fortunate , they go and prove otherwise .
it was nuremberg who were lucky last week , drawing at hoffenheim on the back of stingy defending and late , opportunistic behavior in front of goal .
and hanover ?
they 're just good .
the reds ' 2-1 win over stuttgart was a master class in counter-attacking football , led by didier ya konan .
it 's a shame that the ivorian will miss this week 's match , but his running partner from earlier this season , mohammed abdelloue , is back from his break in training to replace him , and that should be enough to tide the team over .
prediction : 1-0 hanover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz fans ought to have a good time in hamburg this weekend st. pauli - mainz the st. pauli pirate brigade 's roger is not looking so jolly these days - they 've lost six of their last eight , and most of those losses were n't even close -lrb- see : 3-0 defeats to schalke , bremen and bayern -rrb- .
fortunately for pauli , mainz is in a funk of its own , losing five of their last seven .
but all but one of those losses was close - unlucky even , some might say .
thomas tuchel and co. should have enough juice to satisfy their fans at the millerntor … before the happy out-of-towners head to the nearby red light district for round two .
prediction : 3-1 mainz sunday , dec .
5 leverkusen - freiburg by now leverkusen must be aware that it is one of the few sides in the bundesliga with even an outside chance to overhaul dortmund for the title .
11 points is a tall order , but do-able - so long as a couple of big ifs fall into place .
dortmund must start losing games -lrb- something they 've done just once so far -rrb- , and the pharmaceuticals must find the mental toughness to turn the games they 've been drawing up to now -lrb- a whopping five on the season -rrb- in to wins .
this project has to start now , against freiburg , and we reckon it will .
prediction : 3-2 leverkusen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labbadia is already off to a good start at suttgart stuttgart - bayern many a commentator has remarked in the days since bruno labbadia 's appointment as stuttgart 's new coach that he has come at an opportune time .
the journeyman coach had three matches to win over the squad and the club 's fans .
first , a gimme against a danish tomato can called odense -lrb- duly won , 5-1 -rrb- , then two dates with bayern munich - in the league on sunday , then in the cup on wednesday .
take two out of three , or even a fighting draw with bayern in the league , and he can go into the winter break on a high . we think he 'll manage it .
prediction : 2-1 stuttgart last week 's results : n / a total for the season : 66 three points for a correct score prediction two points for a correct margin prediction one point for a correct winner prediction author : matt hermann editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

artists have n't abandoned search for psychedelic nirvana of inspiration do you think drugs can enhance artistic creativity ?
i know of no artwork made under drug influence that really is impressive and tells a good idea .
art is about ideas , drugs kill the ability to create them .
it 's funny how many great musicians failed more and more under the influence of drugs .
and if someone needs them to be creative or do art , he or she is maybe in the wrong profession .
the creativity should be naturally in you . - julius i do n't know , but i 've seen a number of movies and works of art where narcotics were clearly involved in their creation . - dairl yes , it is a medical fact that certain chemicals and enzymes make people more creative and active , no need to go far , look at caffeine as one .
people forget human beings are not only a soul but also a biological machine , a machine that is weak and sensitive to every element it interacts with , even if it is a substance or just a thought , weather conditions or social conditions , we react to everything around us and everything that is on the planet has impact on us in one way or another . - monie i have seen people paint under the influence of hashish and yes it definitely did enhance their creativity , the mind is free and hallucinating so it speaks for itself .
also look at movies , some were definitely written while under the influence . - johanna for some people , yes .
there is no given answer to the question .
people are different , and react differently when they ingest anything ... including food . - tracey to " open " a gate is not to reveal art .
if you can not find deep in your soul and mind the way to art , drugs are only a substitute not a tool that can enhance something . - adrian no , i have had artist friends try to get greater creativity from an altered state of mind , they get all excited and show their work , its just looks like art created by someone on drugs , not better quality . - jesse everyone is different , but it definitely does not work for me ...
i need clarity not cloudy .
as i say everyone is different , for some it may work .
i find when creating music high mostly i just jam endlessly or noodle if you will .
every day the same song is different , so one day it may sound great while the next disconnected and rambling .
for the listener it 's a 50/50 chance for a good show or recording . - randall depends on how creative the person is initially and how apt they are .
jimi hendrix was great guitar player because he practiced for many years and worked with other groups before he ever got famous . - erik i have no idea !
i do , however , know that substances , including alcohol , have taken the lives of many of our most talented creative minds ! - david compiled by stuart tiffen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and if someone needs them to be creative or do art , he or she is maybe in the wrong profession .
the creativity should be naturally in you . - julius i do n't know , but i 've seen a number of movies and works of art where narcotics were clearly involved in their creation . - dairl yes , it is a medical fact that certain chemicals and enzymes make people more creative and active , no need to go far , look at caffeine as one .
people forget human beings are not only a soul but also a biological machine , a machine that is weak and sensitive to every element it interacts with , even if it is a substance or just a thought , weather conditions or social conditions , we react to everything around us and everything that is on the planet has impact on us in one way or another . - monie i have seen people paint under the influence of hashish and yes it definitely did enhance their creativity , the mind is free and hallucinating so it speaks for itself .
also look at movies , some were definitely written while under the influence . - johanna for some people , yes .
there is no given answer to the question .
people are different , and react differently when they ingest anything ... including food . - tracey to " open " a gate is not to reveal art .
if you can not find deep in your soul and mind the way to art , drugs are only a substitute not a tool that can enhance something . - adrian no , i have had artist friends try to get greater creativity from an altered state of mind , they get all excited and show their work , its just looks like art created by someone on drugs , not better quality . - jesse everyone is different , but it definitely does not work for me ...
i need clarity not cloudy .
as i say everyone is different , for some it may work .
i find when creating music high mostly i just jam endlessly or noodle if you will .
every day the same song is different , so one day it may sound great while the next disconnected and rambling .
for the listener it 's a 50/50 chance for a good show or recording . - randall depends on how creative the person is initially and how apt they are .
jimi hendrix was great guitar player because he practiced for many years and worked with other groups before he ever got famous . - erik i have no idea !
i do , however , know that substances , including alcohol , have taken the lives of many of our most talented creative minds ! - david compiled by stuart tiffen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 17.12.2010 electric cars hit us streets although future still uncertain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeffrey kaffee drives the first volt sold to the public out of the showroom the roll-out of electric cars by big automakers nissan and gm has sparked discussion about their prospects and acceptance by the larger public .
big hurdles remain but many are confident about electrics ' future . electric cars have had many false dawns over the years , but their proponents in the motor industry say now their time has come .
this december , two mass-market electric vehicles are hitting dealerships in selected markets around the world .
the general motors volt and nissan 's leaf are both aimed at delivering emissions-free driving at affordable prices .
motor trend magazine has called the chevy volt a " breakthrough " and a " game changer " and named it its 2011 car of the year .
a retiree in new jersey became the owner of the first volt , a gas-electric hybrid , to be sold to the public on december 15 , while nissan rolled out its leaf in a handful of us cities earlier this month .
both are scheduled for sale in europe in 2011 .
the developments have some experts saying that a major change is underway in the automobile industry .
general motors ' volt relies on a battery for the first 40 miles or 60 kilometers , after which a gas-powered engine kicks in to recharge the battery , which extends the range of the sedan by another 300 miles , or 480 kilometers .
in contrast , the leaf is all-electric with a range of around 100 miles , and just like early gas-powered vehicles , it might be difficult to find fuel nearby .
however , unlike the car 's predecessors , the leaf has a gps system .
press a small blue button and it will search for the nearest charging station .
still , many fear that ' range anxiety ' will put drivers off the all-electrics and that electric cars will remain a niche product .
but others say zero-emission vehicles will gain traction in the long term .
" we are the most bullish today by saying ten percent of the market 2020 will be zero emission , " nissan renault ceo carlos ghosn told a stanford university forum .
" frankly , i think the numbers will move up . ”
sticker shock bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the all-electric nissan leaf is more affordable it all sounds promising , although the price tag could limit its popularity .
even with a federal tax credit , the volt will set consumers back $ 33,500 -lrb- 25,155 euros -rrb- .
nissan 's leaf will not collide with bank accounts with quite the same ferocity .
tax incentives from washington and the state of california will bring the price of the four-door automobile down to just over $ 20,000 , about the same price as a gas-powered sedan .
still , that 's almost where the similarities with its gasoline-dependent brethren end .
starting up the leaf is a quiet process – there 's no traditional cranking sound of a starter .
there 's also no internal combustion engine .
instead , the car relies on lithium-ion batteries .
when it 's running , it emits a faint hum which has been added to alert pedestrians that a car is nearby .
nissan has spent $ 5 billion developing electric cars and ghosn insists this is a safe bet .
he says electric car sales will rise if oil prices go up and carbon dioxide restrictions get tougher .
event without new co2 rules , the international energy agency is promoting electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids as a way to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions , although the amount of the reduction depends on the electricity source .
while the cars themselves do n't emit greenhouse gases , the electricity plants where they get their energy from may .
" as a us average , a battery electric car we think would reduce greenhouse gas emission by about 40 percent compared to a conventional vehicle , " said timothy lipman of the university of california , berkeley .
" in california , because our grid is cleaner , it would probably be more like 60 percent reduction . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charging issues will have to be solved before electrics gain a wide following out of juice charging is a real issue when it comes to the acceptance or rejection of electrics with the wider population .
according to a recent report by the national research council , the current us electric grid could provide enough electricity to power 80 percent of today 's cars , if they were electric and provided that they were charged during off-peak hours , such as overnight .
however , some are looking at a different approach .
a company called " a better place " plans on offering electric car battery swapping pans , similar to mobile phone plans , in which monthly payments are based on the amounts of swapping and charging drivers do .
but some , such as berkeley 's lipman , doubt that such programs will be universally viable .
he said it might make sense to run a battery swapping operation in europe , where gas prices are relatively high , but in the us the system would probably not be able to compete with the relatively low price of gas . another battery-related worry has to do with a core component : lithium .
media reports say that bolivia , which has almost half the world supply of lithium , is considering tighter control of its lithium reserves .
other rare-earth resources , such as neodymium iron boron , could also pose problems .
china has the biggest deposits of this material has begun withholding it from the world market , pushing up its price .
future outlook government officials are already looking for substitutes for these materials .
one us government-funded research project is working on making electric cars easily affordable by radically redesigning their batteries , based on those used in hearing aids .
" we think that has the very distinct possibility of giving cars that now have a hundred mile range , a five hundred mile range at one third of the cost , " said us energy secretary david chu .
even if this technological breakthrough is far off on the horizon , lipman of berkeley 's transportation sustainability research center , says electric cars have a bright future .
he says they will eventually be embraced by more than just environmentalists .
" once people drive these cars , they see how they perform , how easy they are to operate , how quiet they are , the excellent acceleration and so forth , " he said .
" a lot of people are going to like these cars , not because they 're green , but because they 're better cars . "

deutsche welle talked with him about the reasons for this surprising conclusion . andrew mack is the director of the human security report project -lrb- hsrp -rrb- at canada 's simon fraser university and a faculty member of the university 's new school for international studies .
from 1998 to 2001 he was director of the strategic planning office in the executive office of un secretary-general kofi annan .
he has taught at several universities , including the london school of economics , and has published in numerous international newspapers and magazines .
deutsche welle : a lot of people 's perception is that the world is getting more dangerous and violent .
your report says otherwise .
are we being hoodwinked by the media ?
andrew mack : there are two reasons why people believe that the world is becoming more dangerous even though there has been a big decline in the number and deadliness of wars since the end of the cold war 20 years ago . first , media reporting tends to be driven by what might be called the , " if it bleeds , it leads " imperative . this means in practice that wars that start almost always get reported , while those that quietly peter out tend to be ignored .
second , no international organization collects data on the number or deadliness of wars .
so while we have millennium development goals that track national , global and regional trends in progress in health , education , economic and environmental issues , there are no millennium security goals . your report paints a mixed picture of the threat presented by islamist militants .
one the one hand , 4 of the 5 deadliest conflicts are islamist in nature ; on the other , support for al-qaeda in the muslim world is declining .
is progress being made in this area , and if so , in what sense ?
there are reasons for both real concern and cautious optimism here . four of the world 's deadliest conflicts - iraq , afghanistan , pakistan and somalia - are indeed associated with islamist political violence . but one of the reasons for the high death tolls is that they also involve , to a greater or lesser degree , major powers - primarily the us .
this is significant because , since the end of world war ii , the deadliest conflicts have almost always been associated with direct or indirect involvement by one of more of the major powers .
there is room for cautious optimism in that radical islamist groups like al-qaeda have been losing support among muslims throughout the islamic world for some five years .
this is n't surprising .
their extremist ideology is rejected by the overwhelming majority of muslims - including most of those who are strongly opposed to us policies in iraq , afghanistan and pakistan .
the harshly repressive policies that radical islamists have sought to impose wherever they have gained power have been deeply resented .
and the targets of islamist terror are mostly muslim civilians . the decline in public support means that the radicals have little chance of winning popular revolutions .
on the other hand no radical islamist group has sufficiently powerful conventional military forces to defeat the armed forces of the states that they oppose .
what sort of benefits do you expect from a study that quantifies conflict in the way yours does ?
governments are increasingly demanding that their foreign and security policies be " evidence-based . "
providing hard data each year on the number and deadliness of armed conflicts at the global regional and national levels helps governments - and international agencies like the un - determine whether their policies are having an impact or not .
for example , since the end of the cold war the international community has dramatically increased the resources it puts into preventing wars , trying to stop those that ca n't be prevented , and preventing wars that have ended from starting again .
as the level of what might be called " international activism " has gone up the number of wars has come down . indeed in 2008 there were 78 percent fewer high-intensity wars - those that kill 1,000 or more people year - than in 1988 .
please look into your crystal ball : will the world be a safer or more perilous place in 2020 ?
if current trends continue - they may not - there are reasonable grounds for believing that the world will be a safer place . first , other things being equal , we expect the past half-century trend of rising incomes in most developing countries to continue .
in 2010 every region in the developing world is growing strongly .
this is important because the most robust and important finding to emerge from recent quantitative research is that as national incomes rise , the risk of war declines .
its not income per se that matters , but rather that when national incomes rise governments have more resources to buy off grievances that could lead to war , to coopt political opponents and to win wars that ca n't be prevented . second , the end of the cold war has removed a major cause of armed conflicts from the international system , while the dramatic increase in economic interdependence and in the number of democracies in the world over the past four decades has reduced the risk of international wars dramatically . in the 1950s there were six wars a year on average ; in the new millennium there has been less than one .
in other words the factors that have been driving war numbers down are likely to continue - or strengthen .
and there are no obvious adverse counter-trends that threaten to increase the risk of war .
in the longer term the instabilities associated with climate change may cause major problems , but these are unlikely to become manifest in the next 10 years .

even with a federal tax credit , the volt will set consumers back $ 33,500 -lrb- 25,155 euros -rrb- .
nissan 's leaf will not collide with bank accounts with quite the same ferocity .
tax incentives from washington and the state of california will bring the price of the four-door automobile down to just over $ 20,000 , about the same price as a gas-powered sedan .
still , that 's almost where the similarities with its gasoline-dependent brethren end .
starting up the leaf is a quiet process – there 's no traditional cranking sound of a starter .
there 's also no internal combustion engine .
instead , the car relies on lithium-ion batteries .
when it 's running , it emits a faint hum which has been added to alert pedestrians that a car is nearby .
nissan has spent $ 5 billion developing electric cars and ghosn insists this is a safe bet .
he says electric car sales will rise if oil prices go up and carbon dioxide restrictions get tougher .
event without new co2 rules , the international energy agency is promoting electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids as a way to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions , although the amount of the reduction depends on the electricity source .
while the cars themselves do n't emit greenhouse gases , the electricity plants where they get their energy from may .
" as a us average , a battery electric car we think would reduce greenhouse gas emission by about 40 percent compared to a conventional vehicle , " said timothy lipman of the university of california , berkeley .
" in california , because our grid is cleaner , it would probably be more like 60 percent reduction . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charging issues will have to be solved before electrics gain a wide following out of juice charging is a real issue when it comes to the acceptance or rejection of electrics with the wider population .
according to a recent report by the national research council , the current us electric grid could provide enough electricity to power 80 percent of today 's cars , if they were electric and provided that they were charged during off-peak hours , such as overnight .
however , some are looking at a different approach .
a company called " a better place " plans on offering electric car battery swapping pans , similar to mobile phone plans , in which monthly payments are based on the amounts of swapping and charging drivers do .
but some , such as berkeley 's lipman , doubt that such programs will be universally viable .
he said it might make sense to run a battery swapping operation in europe , where gas prices are relatively high , but in the us the system would probably not be able to compete with the relatively low price of gas . another battery-related worry has to do with a core component : lithium .
media reports say that bolivia , which has almost half the world supply of lithium , is considering tighter control of its lithium reserves .
other rare-earth resources , such as neodymium iron boron , could also pose problems .
china has the biggest deposits of this material has begun withholding it from the world market , pushing up its price .
future outlook government officials are already looking for substitutes for these materials .
one us government-funded research project is working on making electric cars easily affordable by radically redesigning their batteries , based on those used in hearing aids .
" we think that has the very distinct possibility of giving cars that now have a hundred mile range , a five hundred mile range at one third of the cost , " said us energy secretary david chu .
even if this technological breakthrough is far off on the horizon , lipman of berkeley 's transportation sustainability research center , says electric cars have a bright future .
he says they will eventually be embraced by more than just environmentalists .
" once people drive these cars , they see how they perform , how easy they are to operate , how quiet they are , the excellent acceleration and so forth , " he said .
" a lot of people are going to like these cars , not because they 're green , but because they 're better cars . "

hundreds of road traffic accidents and grounded airplanes have made life difficult for people and police alike . heavy snowfall across much of germany has caused widespread traffic jams and hundreds of accidents on the roads , as well as severely interrupting air and rail travel .
the blizzard " petra " has largely abated but the german weather service , the dwd , is still issuing mild weather warnings nationwide , describing the overall situation on its website as " extremely wintery across the board . "
meanwhile , authorities are scrambling to clear thursday 's heavy snowfall from the country 's highways , runways and railways .
airport backlogs germany 's largest airport , in frankfurt , was operating " entirely without disruptions " early on friday , according to a spokesman for the hub .
nevertheless , roughly 100 flights have been cancelled , partly because of problems at other european airports , and also as a knock-on effect from the airport 's brief closure on thursday night .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the going has been unusually slow on the fast-moving autobahns stuttgart airport , where snow was still falling heavily on friday morning , reported delays caused by the intermittent closure of runways in order to clear away fresh snow .
several other airports were still battling to minimize delays on friday , and the german red cross has been taking camp beds , sleeping bags and blankets to german terminals , anticipating more stranded passengers .
almost 200 kilometers of traffic jams the greatest disruptions hit germany 's road network , especially the highways .
thousands of road traffic accidents were recorded by german police on thursday , mostly caused by the adverse weather ; three people lost their lives in the crashes .
the motorway network came close to gridlock during the worst of the snowfall , with authorities in the western state of north rhine-westphalia alone recording a total of 185 kilometers -lrb- 115 miles -rrb- of traffic jams at one point late on thursday evening .
one single queue , on the a3 highway near leverkusen , stretched back 40 kilometers .
parts of the country even banned heavy goods vehicles from taking to the highways overnight , after several got bogged down in the snow ; but that ban has since been lifted .
although the situation is now clearing , police have asked all road users to plan plenty of extra time for their journeys , and to adapt their driving style to suit the conditions .
meanwhile , the german rail service , deutsche bahn - also facing numerous weather-related delays and cancellations - has opened up a free customer service phone hotline for timetable inquiries .

nevertheless , roughly 100 flights have been cancelled , partly because of problems at other european airports , and also as a knock-on effect from the airport 's brief closure on thursday night .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the going has been unusually slow on the fast-moving autobahns stuttgart airport , where snow was still falling heavily on friday morning , reported delays caused by the intermittent closure of runways in order to clear away fresh snow .
several other airports were still battling to minimize delays on friday , and the german red cross has been taking camp beds , sleeping bags and blankets to german terminals , anticipating more stranded passengers .
almost 200 kilometers of traffic jams the greatest disruptions hit germany 's road network , especially the highways .
thousands of road traffic accidents were recorded by german police on thursday , mostly caused by the adverse weather ; three people lost their lives in the crashes .
the motorway network came close to gridlock during the worst of the snowfall , with authorities in the western state of north rhine-westphalia alone recording a total of 185 kilometers -lrb- 115 miles -rrb- of traffic jams at one point late on thursday evening .
one single queue , on the a3 highway near leverkusen , stretched back 40 kilometers .
parts of the country even banned heavy goods vehicles from taking to the highways overnight , after several got bogged down in the snow ; but that ban has since been lifted .
although the situation is now clearing , police have asked all road users to plan plenty of extra time for their journeys , and to adapt their driving style to suit the conditions .
meanwhile , the german rail service , deutsche bahn - also facing numerous weather-related delays and cancellations - has opened up a free customer service phone hotline for timetable inquiries .

he 's apologized for his recent comments that gay fans should n't fornicate at the qatar world cup . fifa president sepp blatter has apologized for saying that gay fans should " refrain from sexual activity " if they go to the 2022 world cup in qatar .
homosexuality is illegal in qatar and blatter 's original comments provoked anger among gay rights groups .
" i regret my comment , i did n't want to hurt anyone .
we are against discrimination .
i apologize for that comment , " blatter told a press conference ahead of saturday 's club world cup .
" it was not my intention and it will never be my intention to go into any discrimination because this is exactly what we -lrb- fifa -rrb- are against , so therefore if somebody feels they have been hurt , then i regret and i present apologies for that , " he added .
gay rights activists have reacted furiously after the comments and called for the head of the world soccer governing body to either apologize or resign after his comments this week .
former nba basketball star john amaechi - who revealed he was gay in 2007 - led the attack , accusing the fifa president of " epic , archaic , neanderthal , ignorance . "
a reputation for gaffes " with little more than an afterthought fifa has endorsed the marginalization of lgbt -lsb- lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender -rsb- people around the world , " he wrote on his blog .
" anything less than a full reversal of his position is unacceptable , " amaechi added .
blatter 's remarks are just the latest example of the 74-year-old football chief putting his foot in his mouth .
he told women footballers in 2004 that the best way to make their sport more popular would be to wear " tighter shorts . "
earlier this year , he suggested that john terry 's alleged affair , which led to him being stripped of the england captaincy , would have been applauded in latin countries .
qatar was awarded the world cup this month ahead of australia , the united states , japan and south korea .

a prime example is the euro bonds dispute . the two birth defects of the monetary union have come back to brutally haunt the eu : from the outset there was no common economic policy running parallel to the common currency .
hence huge imbalances were created in the eurozone .
and secondly , some of the member countries should never have been included in the euro in the first place .
greece is only the most flagrant , but not the only , example .
for a long time the eu has closed its eyes to these facts .
now they must deal with the consequences in a hurry .
in principle , the measures adopted are heading in the right direction .
governments are committing themselves to do everything necessary to protect the stability of the euro .
the starkness and vagueness of this statement is not a disadvantage .
obviously in theory there are limits to aid , but when numbers are mentioned , speculators are immediately encouraged to test the limits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph hasselbach , dw correspondent in brussels the permanent crisis mechanism is a sign of this mutual protection .
any doubts that the euro countries would abandon a country in an emergency , would cause a chain reaction .
this would break apart the monetary union , and if that happened , the germans especially would find it very expensive .
on the other hand , we can expect a lot of resentment if economic policy is adjusted belatedly in the euro countries .
some people might not perhaps realize what that means .
it is not just about fiscal consolidation , in itself difficult enough .
it 's also about sacred cows like national taxes , retirement policy and labor market legislation , to name only a few major areas .
this is about long national traditions , painstakingly developed social consensus .
while an alignment wo n't lead to a complete standardization , countries can not remain as they are now with differences as big as they are .
it is important that the benchmark for any harmonization is n't a so-called golden mean , but global competitiveness .
time is short .
the crisis is forcing the euro-zone countries to a level of integration that they would not have addressed voluntarily .
but that 's how it is in most cases .
if europe tries hard , it could actually emerge from the crisis stronger .

bayer leverkusen drew against title holders atletico , with both german sides progressing . there was a dream start for new stuttgart head coach bruno labbadia , his players notching up five goals in their europa league soccer clash at home to danish club odense bk on thursday .
timo gebhart grabbed the first for stuttgart - who are already through to the next stage of the competition - on 20 minutes , scoring when his own header was chested back to his feet by odense defender anders moller christensen .
the second came in the form of a mistake from odense defender daniel hoegh , who accidentally stabbed a cross by gebhart into his own team 's net .
christian gentner was quickest to the ball after it hit defender thomas helveg , to make it 3-0 before pavel pogrebnyak made it 4-0 five minutes later .
that goal left spectators bewildered as the ball , which appeared to have been blocked by moller christensen , somehow found its way across the line through backspin .

the spanish side did dominate the first half of the game with uruguayan striker diego forlan coming close with a half-volley just ahead of the break .
despite this , leverkusen soaked up the pressure and it was the germans who scored first - after a full 69 minutes - patrick helmes slotting the ball past atletico goalkeeper david de gea .

but at germany 's behest , aid will only be paid if it 's considered ' indispensable ' to the stability of the euro . european leaders have set up a permament emergency fund to help debt-laden countries , and have agreed to rewrite some of the bloc 's rules in a bid to shore up the value of the euro .
germany lobbied hard for changes to the lisbon treaty and a pledge to pay out aid only if it 's " indispensable , " as leaders meeting in brussels on thursday agreed on the need to make a temporary trillion dollar rescue fund into a permanent one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she was satisfied with the result " we stand ready to do whatever is required to ensure the stability of the eurozone , " said the president of the european council , herman van rompuy , after thursday 's meeting .
chancellor angela merkel expressed satisfaction with the results of the meeting , describing it as a " further step " towards greater coordination of economic policy within the eurozone .
" we will do whatever is required to secure the financial stability of the euro , " merkel told reporters at a friday press conference after the summit wrapped up .
french president nicolas sarkozy , a close ally of merkel 's on the issue of eurozone economic alignment , announced that he and merkel would be presenting new proposals on how to make the member countries work more closely .
" we have to tackle the competitiveness gaps within the 16 eurozone countries , " sarkozy said .
from the middle of 2013 , loans and guarantees similar to those offered to greece and ireland this year will only be offered if judged to be " indispensable " in saving the euro as a currency .
no spending cuts , no help that wording was added at the insistence of germany , likely to be the biggest individual contributor to future rescue funding .
berlin also stipulated that any bailout deal would require the recipient government to introduce a program of public spending cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank is to increase its capital base a two-sentence amendment was made to the eu 's lisbon treaty to permit the creation of the permanent rescue facility , the european stability mechanism .
article 125 of the 2007 lisbon treaty stated that the european union " shall not be liable for or assume the commitments of central governments , regional , local or other public authorities , other government bodies ... "
merkel pressed for changes to the article , because she said that a permanent mechanism might otherwise face a successful challenge in germany ’ s constitutional court .
leaders hope to have the necessary changes to the treaty ratified by the end of 2012 , with decisions on enacting rescue packages to be taken unanimously - effectively giving germany a veto .
it was also decided that there was no need to increase the existing rescue fund , which some analysts say would be insufficient in the case of future bailouts .
a number of countries led by germany put forward the argument that there was sufficient capacity in the present reserve . bonds kept off agenda discussion about the introduction of " e-bonds , " which would allow all european nations to borrow money at common rates , was kept off the agenda . merkel has said that the common bond plan " would not rid europe of its weaknesses , it would simply transmit them across the board . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal is next on the list of countries likely to need help underlining the need to reassure financial markets over fears that portugal and spain may be in need of bailouts soon , the european central bank also announced on thursday that it would double its capital to 10.76 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.3 billion -rrb- to cope with an increase in market volatility .

but at germany 's behest , aid will only be paid if it 's considered ' indispensable ' to the stability of the euro . european leaders have set up a permament emergency fund to help debt-laden countries , and have agreed to rewrite some of the bloc 's rules in a bid to shore up the value of the euro .
germany lobbied hard for changes to the lisbon treaty and a pledge to pay out aid only if it 's " indispensable , " as leaders meeting in brussels on thursday agreed on the need to make a temporary trillion dollar rescue fund into a permanent one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she was satisfied with the result " we stand ready to do whatever is required to ensure the stability of the eurozone , " said the president of the european council , herman van rompuy , after thursday 's meeting .
chancellor angela merkel expressed satisfaction with the results of the meeting , describing it as a " further step " towards greater coordination of economic policy within the eurozone .
" we will do whatever is required to secure the financial stability of the euro , " merkel told reporters at a friday press conference after the summit wrapped up .
french president nicolas sarkozy , a close ally of merkel 's on the issue of eurozone economic alignment , announced that he and merkel would be presenting new proposals on how to make the member countries work more closely .
" we have to tackle the competitiveness gaps within the 16 eurozone countries , " sarkozy said .
from the middle of 2013 , loans and guarantees similar to those offered to greece and ireland this year will only be offered if judged to be " indispensable " in saving the euro as a currency .
no spending cuts , no help that wording was added at the insistence of germany , likely to be the biggest individual contributor to future rescue funding .
berlin also stipulated that any bailout deal would require the recipient government to introduce a program of public spending cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank is to increase its capital base a two-sentence amendment was made to the eu 's lisbon treaty to permit the creation of the permanent rescue facility , the european stability mechanism .
article 125 of the 2007 lisbon treaty stated that the european union " shall not be liable for or assume the commitments of central governments , regional , local or other public authorities , other government bodies ... "
merkel pressed for changes to the article , because she said that a permanent mechanism might otherwise face a successful challenge in germany ’ s constitutional court .
leaders hope to have the necessary changes to the treaty ratified by the end of 2012 , with decisions on enacting rescue packages to be taken unanimously - effectively giving germany a veto .
it was also decided that there was no need to increase the existing rescue fund , which some analysts say would be insufficient in the case of future bailouts .
a number of countries led by germany put forward the argument that there was sufficient capacity in the present reserve . bonds kept off agenda discussion about the introduction of " e-bonds , " which would allow all european nations to borrow money at common rates , was kept off the agenda . merkel has said that the common bond plan " would not rid europe of its weaknesses , it would simply transmit them across the board . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal is next on the list of countries likely to need help underlining the need to reassure financial markets over fears that portugal and spain may be in need of bailouts soon , the european central bank also announced on thursday that it would double its capital to 10.76 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.3 billion -rrb- to cope with an increase in market volatility .

a prime example is the euro bonds dispute . the two birth defects of the monetary union have come back to brutally haunt the eu : from the outset there was no common economic policy running parallel to the common currency .
hence huge imbalances were created in the eurozone .
and secondly , some of the member countries should never have been included in the euro in the first place .
greece is only the most flagrant , but not the only , example .
for a long time the eu has closed its eyes to these facts .
now they must deal with the consequences in a hurry .
in principle , the measures adopted are heading in the right direction .
governments are committing themselves to do everything necessary to protect the stability of the euro .
the starkness and vagueness of this statement is not a disadvantage .
obviously in theory there are limits to aid , but when numbers are mentioned , speculators are immediately encouraged to test the limits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph hasselbach , dw correspondent in brussels the permanent crisis mechanism is a sign of this mutual protection .
any doubts that the euro countries would abandon a country in an emergency , would cause a chain reaction .
this would break apart the monetary union , and if that happened , the germans especially would find it very expensive .
on the other hand , we can expect a lot of resentment if economic policy is adjusted belatedly in the euro countries .
some people might not perhaps realize what that means .
it is not just about fiscal consolidation , in itself difficult enough .
it 's also about sacred cows like national taxes , retirement policy and labor market legislation , to name only a few major areas .
this is about long national traditions , painstakingly developed social consensus .
while an alignment wo n't lead to a complete standardization , countries can not remain as they are now with differences as big as they are .
it is important that the benchmark for any harmonization is n't a so-called golden mean , but global competitiveness .
time is short .
the crisis is forcing the euro-zone countries to a level of integration that they would not have addressed voluntarily .
but that 's how it is in most cases .
if europe tries hard , it could actually emerge from the crisis stronger .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 17.12.2010 german parliament at odds over papal address großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone thinks it 's such a good idea for the pope to speak in parliament pope benedict xvi is scheduled to speak in parliament when he visits germany in september 2011 .
this has caused a great stir among politicians . pope benedict xvi is not scheduled to talk in the bundestag , the lower house of the german parliament , until september 2011 , but his visit has already stirred up a hot debate between the opposition greens and chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the greens oppose the papal speech in parliament and hans-christian stroebele , a green party grandee , said he would not listen to the pope 's speech .
stroebele has protested against speeches in the past , when he left parliament to ignore speeches by george w. bush and vladimir putin .
other greens said they will attend the speech , but echoed the criticism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stroebele said he would leave the bundestag during the papal speech " the german bundestag is supposed to be neutral when it comes to state visitors , " volker beck , head of the greens ' parliamentary group said .
as the pope is first and foremost the leader of a religious group , it would raise the question which representatives from other religious groups could be invited next , he added .
the greens lay great importance on the equal treatment of different religions and fear this to be compromised by the pope ’ s visit .
the cdu dismissed the concerns and went on the offensive .
greens are against everything " the greens are simply against everything and everyone , " cdu secretary general hermann groehe said .
" you can only hope that this ' party against everything ' reflects a bit over christmas .
it would be an honor to have the pope speak in parliament . "
cem oezdemir , leader of the greens , rebuffed the sharp attacks .
" the pope should speak in parliament if he wishes to do so , " he said .
oezdemir added he believed in an open dialogue .
the greens ' concerns were backed by social democrat rolf schwanitz who is also a member of a group within his party that campaigns for laicism .
he said he had reservations about the papal speech .
wolfgang thierse , the social democrat vice president of the german parliament , called the greens narrow-minded .
the head of the protestant church , nikolaus schneider , said the pope 's invitation to speak in the bundestag was " understandable , because the pope is also a head of state . "
christian stroebele added another twist to the debate in an interview with the saturday editions of the waz group newspapers in germany .
he said he might consider staying in parliament and listening to the pope 's speech if he were allowed to ask a question .
yet stroebele , who describes himself as a catholic , maintained the pope had failed to modernize the church .
" the holy father still promotes exorcism .
for me that shows a medieval institution , " he said . author : sarah steffen -lrb- epd , dpa , afp , kna -rrb- editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 17.12.2010 strong youth and sound finances drive bundesliga 's success in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 04 is not alone in excelling in europe this season the consistently strong performances of bundesliga clubs in europe is likely to pay off with germany getting another champions league place - thanks to the league 's finances , youth program and ability to keep its stars . a glance at the pairings in the knock-out rounds of the champions league and europa league make for some satisfied reading for fans of the bundesliga . bayern munich dominated group e in the champions league , losing just once in six games to qualify with a game to spare .
schalke 04 , who have endured some tough times domestically this season , also topped their group ahead of more fancied teams such as benfica and lyon .
" bayern munich and schalke have played a lot better in the champions league this season than they have in the bundesliga , " freelance soccer writer and sometime sportschau.de correspondent marcus bark told deutsche welle .
" schalke coach felix magath has even gone as far as to say that his team takes the champions league more seriously , although it 's hard to believe that this is true . "
out of the three german teams who qualified for this season 's champions league , only werder bremen failed to make it out of the group stage .
" for the past few seasons , two out of the three german teams have gone relatively far in the champions league , " bark said .
" even wolfsburg who dropped out of the champions league at the group stage last year , went on to reach the quarter-finals of the europa league . "
in this season 's europa league , bayer leverkusen and vfb stuttgart have mirrored the success of bayern and schalke by qualifying as the winners of their groups , with only borussia dortmund - somewhat surprisingly considering their domestic form - failing to reach the last 32 .
close followers of the bundesliga may not be that surprised to see such a strong german showing .
this season is hardly a one-off .
consistency breeds consistency for germans in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern romped to last year 's final before losing to inter both bayern and stuttgart made it into the knock-out rounds of the champions league last season - with the bavarian giants , who also made it to the quarter-finals the year before , romping all the way to the final .
the 2009 europa league finalists werder bremen , wolfsburg and hamburg all made it to the quarter-finals of the europa league last season with hamburg progressing to the semi-finals - as they did the year before - before defeat to fulham ended their dream of competing for the title in their own stadium .
german teams have been putting in consistently strong performances in european competition for over a decade now , with at least one of the bundesliga 's six allotted representatives progressing to the quarter-finals or further in both the champions and europa leagues over the past five years .
exposure to foreign opposition honing german skills marcus bark believes that the german national team ’ s long history of success helps to breed players ready for the styles and challenges of foreign opponents , and that this season 's champions league is a case in point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young but experienced : kroos , mueller and badstuber " i think german teams have done so well in europe this season because a lot of the young german stars in these teams performed very well at the world cup , " he said .
" if you look at bayern 's team with lahm , schweinsteiger , kroos , mueller and badstuber , they all have international experience and confidence at that level . "
joerg jakob , deputy editor-in-chief at kicker magazine , agrees that foreign experience helps when attempting to win european trophies but believes that the bundesliga 's recent success is based more on the rise of its young stars . " of course you learn from playing at the world cup or by facing european competition but this is not new for german players and teams , " jakob told deutsche welle .
one of the reasons german teams are doing so well in europe , says jakob , is because of the youth development .
“ bundesliga clubs have to have education and training facilities for young people under dfb rules they introduced in 2000 , so now we have better and more talented youngsters who play a more modern style .
we also have young , modern coaches to guide them . " cash flow essential to maintaining bundesliga 's success according to marcus bark , the bundesliga 's comparatively stable financial situation - in relation to other debt-ridden leagues - is also aiding german teams . " in other leagues , the best players are sold off , making only a few clubs capable of fielding good teams in europe , " he said .
" in germany , the clubs pay well and on time .
they 're very well run and the money is used to develop talent and to hold onto players - again , look at lahm and schweinstieger at bayern ; they ’ ve been approached by europe 's biggest clubs but have chosen to stay . " if money helps bundesliga teams produce european stars of the future and keep at least some of them from the clutches of the leading clubs in the continent ’ s other leagues , then the bundesliga will need a steady stream of revenue if germany 's record in europe is to continue to improve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's loss could be germany 's champions league gain marcus bark and joerg jakob do n't see this as being a problem , even less so in the coming years as the bundesliga looks ready to usurp the underperforming italian league to snatch a fourth champions league place under uefa 's coefficient system which takes into account the results of a particular nation 's clubs in european competitions over the preceding five years . " the bundesliga attracts money , it generates money , and it keeps money , " bark said .
" buying in stars like robben , ribery , raul and huntelaar , the league has become more attractive which brings in bigger crowds .
the reasonable ticket prices also help ; a ticket on average for a bundesliga game is around 20 euros -lrb- $ 26 -rrb- where as in england you can pay up to 120 euros at some clubs .
most clubs have little or no debt so they 're making profits for reinvestment . " " if you ’ re a player on the transfer market , you want to be playing for a champions league team , " said jakob .
" if germany has an extra team in the competition then this means someone else will be able to attract players , agents and sponsors .
of course money ’ s involved , but it ’ s the glamour and prestige of the champions league which will help you keep your youngsters and your stars , meaning you 'll remain competitive .

schalke 04 , who have endured some tough times domestically this season , also topped their group ahead of more fancied teams such as benfica and lyon .
" bayern munich and schalke have played a lot better in the champions league this season than they have in the bundesliga , " freelance soccer writer and sometime sportschau.de correspondent marcus bark told deutsche welle .
" schalke coach felix magath has even gone as far as to say that his team takes the champions league more seriously , although it 's hard to believe that this is true . "
out of the three german teams who qualified for this season 's champions league , only werder bremen failed to make it out of the group stage .
" for the past few seasons , two out of the three german teams have gone relatively far in the champions league , " bark said .
" even wolfsburg who dropped out of the champions league at the group stage last year , went on to reach the quarter-finals of the europa league . "
in this season 's europa league , bayer leverkusen and vfb stuttgart have mirrored the success of bayern and schalke by qualifying as the winners of their groups , with only borussia dortmund - somewhat surprisingly considering their domestic form - failing to reach the last 32 .
close followers of the bundesliga may not be that surprised to see such a strong german showing .
this season is hardly a one-off .
consistency breeds consistency for germans in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern romped to last year 's final before losing to inter both bayern and stuttgart made it into the knock-out rounds of the champions league last season - with the bavarian giants , who also made it to the quarter-finals the year before , romping all the way to the final .
the 2009 europa league finalists werder bremen , wolfsburg and hamburg all made it to the quarter-finals of the europa league last season with hamburg progressing to the semi-finals - as they did the year before - before defeat to fulham ended their dream of competing for the title in their own stadium .
german teams have been putting in consistently strong performances in european competition for over a decade now , with at least one of the bundesliga 's six allotted representatives progressing to the quarter-finals or further in both the champions and europa leagues over the past five years .
exposure to foreign opposition honing german skills marcus bark believes that the german national team ’ s long history of success helps to breed players ready for the styles and challenges of foreign opponents , and that this season 's champions league is a case in point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young but experienced : kroos , mueller and badstuber " i think german teams have done so well in europe this season because a lot of the young german stars in these teams performed very well at the world cup , " he said .
" if you look at bayern 's team with lahm , schweinsteiger , kroos , mueller and badstuber , they all have international experience and confidence at that level . "
joerg jakob , deputy editor-in-chief at kicker magazine , agrees that foreign experience helps when attempting to win european trophies but believes that the bundesliga 's recent success is based more on the rise of its young stars . " of course you learn from playing at the world cup or by facing european competition but this is not new for german players and teams , " jakob told deutsche welle .
one of the reasons german teams are doing so well in europe , says jakob , is because of the youth development .
“ bundesliga clubs have to have education and training facilities for young people under dfb rules they introduced in 2000 , so now we have better and more talented youngsters who play a more modern style .
we also have young , modern coaches to guide them . " cash flow essential to maintaining bundesliga 's success according to marcus bark , the bundesliga 's comparatively stable financial situation - in relation to other debt-ridden leagues - is also aiding german teams . " in other leagues , the best players are sold off , making only a few clubs capable of fielding good teams in europe , " he said .
" in germany , the clubs pay well and on time .
they 're very well run and the money is used to develop talent and to hold onto players - again , look at lahm and schweinstieger at bayern ; they ’ ve been approached by europe 's biggest clubs but have chosen to stay . " if money helps bundesliga teams produce european stars of the future and keep at least some of them from the clutches of the leading clubs in the continent ’ s other leagues , then the bundesliga will need a steady stream of revenue if germany 's record in europe is to continue to improve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's loss could be germany 's champions league gain marcus bark and joerg jakob do n't see this as being a problem , even less so in the coming years as the bundesliga looks ready to usurp the underperforming italian league to snatch a fourth champions league place under uefa 's coefficient system which takes into account the results of a particular nation 's clubs in european competitions over the preceding five years . " the bundesliga attracts money , it generates money , and it keeps money , " bark said .
" buying in stars like robben , ribery , raul and huntelaar , the league has become more attractive which brings in bigger crowds .
the reasonable ticket prices also help ; a ticket on average for a bundesliga game is around 20 euros -lrb- $ 26 -rrb- where as in england you can pay up to 120 euros at some clubs .
most clubs have little or no debt so they 're making profits for reinvestment . " " if you ’ re a player on the transfer market , you want to be playing for a champions league team , " said jakob .
" if germany has an extra team in the competition then this means someone else will be able to attract players , agents and sponsors .
of course money ’ s involved , but it ’ s the glamour and prestige of the champions league which will help you keep your youngsters and your stars , meaning you 'll remain competitive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 17.12.2010 asylum seekers in bavaria go on hunger strike to highlight their plight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum seekers often live below the poverty line in germany most asylum seekers in germany live below the poverty line , with around half of them housed in overcrowded hostels .
in bavaria , asylum seekers are on hunger strike to highlight the conditions they have to live in . twice a week asylum seekers in a hostel in the southern german city of augsburg get groceries delivered to their door , based on a list they have to hand in beforehand .
but most of the residents do n't speak enough german , so they do n't really know what they are ordering .
and often the food is past the sell-by-date .
" it 's now december and this expired in november , " 31-year-old justus says and places a tub of yogurt on the table .
the nigerian 's room is on the ground floor , the beds are very close together , saucepans are strewn across the floor , food is scattered on the window sill and on the table , because there are no cabinets to put them in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the facilities are often substandard in refugee hostels he shares the room with four fellow nigerians .
the lack of privacy is a huge problem .
" the door is always open , a key would cost 10 euros -lrb- $ 13 -rrb- and we do n't have that money , " justus said .
as asylum seekers are not allowed to work in their first year and do not have the right to attend a german language course as opposed to recognized refugees , the future looks pretty bleak .
based on a quota system they end up somewhere in germany , and if they want to leave their accommodation for a short visit to relatives who were placed in a different town or even federal state , they have to get a permit first or they will be fined . hunger strike justus and the other asylum seekers get 40 euros a month each .
" but the ticket to the welfare office is 2.40 euros each way , sometimes we have to travel back and forth to get translators and have nothing left at the end of the month , " he said .
a few weeks ago justus and 200 fellow asylum seekers went on a hunger strike , but gave up after two weeks .
some , like samuel , continued the protest by refusing to collect their groceries .
the 21-year-old nigerian has lived in the augsburg hostel for two years .
he hoped to highlight the conditions asylum seekers live in .
" most people are not aware of the problems we have here , i do n't think .
people think we have a better life here , " he says pointing at the grubby toilets and rusty doors .
" but this is not a better life at all . "
not forced to stay bavarian social welfare minister christine harderthauer has no sympathy with people like samuel and justus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harderthauer insists the asylum seekers are not forced to stay " no one is forcing them to stay , " she told deutsche welle , explaining that most of the more than 8,000 hostel residents in the state of bavaria are asylum seekers fighting extradition .
" they can go back to their home country anytime they like , " she said .
in reality , they often can not be sent back because they do not have the necessary paperwork , so they are forced to stay in these temporary hostels .
and conditions are particularly bad in bavaria .
" it 's a nationwide problem , but conditions for refugees are definitely bad in bavaria , " hans-georg ebberl from the refugee organization caravan munich told deutsche welle .
legislation needs updating the legal basis for the benefits asylum seekers get has not been updated since being introduced in 1993 , and is also applied differently in each of the german states .
but , for the most part , asylum seekers get less than residents on benefits .
" the payments have not been increased in the last 19 years , " ulla jelpke , an mp for the left party said .
" they only get two-thirds of what legal residents get in benefits , so it pushes them below the poverty line . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : samuel tries to improve his german to pass the time meanwhile , the government has confirmed that the payment rates for asylum seekers are unconstitutional and has placed them under review .
but even if people like samuel and justus get more money , it does n't change the fact that they are not wanted in germany , no matter how much they try to integrate .
but samuel is not deterred .
he has just trained as a geriatric nurse and he also spends a lot of time at the local library to improve his german .
" i want to do something useful .
i ca n't sit around all day doing nothing , it would drive me round the bend , " he says and sets out on his daily trip through a snow-clad augbsurg .

the problem is becoming particularly acute in london , where 40 percent of all of the uk 's tb cases have been reported .
four in ten cases are reported in the capital , with the number of cases rising by nearly 50 percent since 1999 .
" it 's prevailing today in certain sections of the community that replicate conditions in victorian london , " tb expert alimuddin zumla of university college london told deutsche welle .
" most of the tb occurs in areas where there 's deprivation and poverty , and that 's where all the homeless are .
so we 've set up an endemic cycle of transmission . "
in all european countries , tuberculosis is largely concentrated in high-risk groups , such as migrants , refugees , homeless people , drug users , prisoners and hiv-infected people .
it is caused by a bacterial infection , usually of the lungs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some tb strains in south africa are resistant to all known tb drugs the increase in the number of tb cases in the uk has largely been among immigrant groups , although most were not new migrants .
among the cases of those born overseas , 85 percent had lived in the uk for two or more years and about half had lived in the country for five or more years .
the death toll from tb , which used to referred to as the " white plague " due to the pallor of those who had it , began to fall in london at the beginning of the 20th century thanks to improved living standards .
in the early 1960s , anti-tb drugs , better health services and bcg vaccinations continued to cut the number of cases .
the disease was thought to have been conquered by the early 1980s , but had something of a resurgence with the coming of hiv , which weakens the body 's immune system .
in london , as recently as 2000 , everyone thought the disease had been conquered , according to zumla .
but now among high-risk populations , tb rates are equivalent to those in africa .
drug resistant strains another alarming fact is that drug-resistant forms of the disease are beginning to be seen .
complying with the six-month regime of antibiotic treatment has meant that strains of tb have become resistant to drug treatments .
" people start feeling better after two months and stop taking their tablets and drug resistance occurs , " zumla said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in india , new treatment methods have helped cut the number of cases the situation is very serious in south africa , where strains have developed which are resistant to all known tb drugs .
in london , tb is showing up that is still treatable , but resistant to the most commonly used drugs .
zumla said the situation in london is reminiscent of multi-drug resistant tb outbreaks in prisons in the us in the 1990s .
they required a large financial investment to be brought under control .
he has called for a reconsideration of the delivery of tb services by britain 's national health service , standardized treatment and care methods and improvements in access to tb services .
he said because many with tb do not have permanent residences , it is difficult to get them to special clinics for treatment and ensure that they comply with drug regimens .
in new york , he said , a community-based model where health care workers take services to those affected has proven effective and should be adopted in the uk .
britain , one of the world 's major foreign-aid providers , is active in funding anti-tb programs overseas , but zumla says the country needs to look in its own backyard .
" we seem to neglect our own people here , " he said .

the problem is becoming particularly acute in london , where 40 percent of all of the uk 's tb cases have been reported .
four in ten cases are reported in the capital , with the number of cases rising by nearly 50 percent since 1999 .
" it 's prevailing today in certain sections of the community that replicate conditions in victorian london , " tb expert alimuddin zumla of university college london told deutsche welle .
" most of the tb occurs in areas where there 's deprivation and poverty , and that 's where all the homeless are .
so we 've set up an endemic cycle of transmission . "
in all european countries , tuberculosis is largely concentrated in high-risk groups , such as migrants , refugees , homeless people , drug users , prisoners and hiv-infected people .
it is caused by a bacterial infection , usually of the lungs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some tb strains in south africa are resistant to all known tb drugs the increase in the number of tb cases in the uk has largely been among immigrant groups , although most were not new migrants .
among the cases of those born overseas , 85 percent had lived in the uk for two or more years and about half had lived in the country for five or more years .
the death toll from tb , which used to referred to as the " white plague " due to the pallor of those who had it , began to fall in london at the beginning of the 20th century thanks to improved living standards .
in the early 1960s , anti-tb drugs , better health services and bcg vaccinations continued to cut the number of cases .
the disease was thought to have been conquered by the early 1980s , but had something of a resurgence with the coming of hiv , which weakens the body 's immune system .
in london , as recently as 2000 , everyone thought the disease had been conquered , according to zumla .
but now among high-risk populations , tb rates are equivalent to those in africa .
drug resistant strains another alarming fact is that drug-resistant forms of the disease are beginning to be seen .
complying with the six-month regime of antibiotic treatment has meant that strains of tb have become resistant to drug treatments .
" people start feeling better after two months and stop taking their tablets and drug resistance occurs , " zumla said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in india , new treatment methods have helped cut the number of cases the situation is very serious in south africa , where strains have developed which are resistant to all known tb drugs .
in london , tb is showing up that is still treatable , but resistant to the most commonly used drugs .
zumla said the situation in london is reminiscent of multi-drug resistant tb outbreaks in prisons in the us in the 1990s .
they required a large financial investment to be brought under control .
he has called for a reconsideration of the delivery of tb services by britain 's national health service , standardized treatment and care methods and improvements in access to tb services .
he said because many with tb do not have permanent residences , it is difficult to get them to special clinics for treatment and ensure that they comply with drug regimens .
in new york , he said , a community-based model where health care workers take services to those affected has proven effective and should be adopted in the uk .
britain , one of the world 's major foreign-aid providers , is active in funding anti-tb programs overseas , but zumla says the country needs to look in its own backyard .
" we seem to neglect our own people here , " he said .

european leaders have agreed on a permanent rescue fund to cover countries in need of financial assistance .
german chancellor merkel hailed the summit as a success , but the measure has failed to reassure the markets . european leaders meeting in brussels have set up a permanent emergency fund to help debt-laden countries , and have agreed to rewrite some of the bloc 's rules in a bid to shore up the value of the euro .
" we will do everything to secure the financial stability of the euro as a whole , " german chancellor angela merkel said at a news conference after a european union summit .
she added that reform and stability will remain on the euro zone 's agenda next year as the bloc fights to secure the single currency and make its economies more competitive .
but the move was given an emphatic thumbs-down as the ratings agency moody 's downgraded ireland 's credit rating on friday by five notches , to baa1 , two notches above junk .
" while a downgrade had been anticipated , the severity of the downgrade is surprising , " dublin-based glas securities said .
spiraling debt eu leaders have spent most of 2010 trying to come up with successful measures to stop the region 's debt crisis spreading , but greece and ireland have already been forced to seek eu bailouts and portugal , spain , belgium and others are now in the spotlight .
on thursday leaders agreed on a change to the eu treaty to create the european stability mechanism -lrb- esm -rrb- – a permanent financial safety net of 750 billion euro from 2013 - that will help countries with liquidity problems and allow for debt restructuring of insolvent ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is determined to stabilize the euro eu leaders confirmed that private investors would be involved in the future euro zone rescue mechanism , a draft summit statement showed .
merkel said the fund would be sufficiently large .
" the more coherent economic policies are , the more we see by 2013 that states have made progress with a culture of stability , the lower the financial extent of the -lrb- rescue fund -rrb- will have to be , " she added .
germany lobbied hard for changes to the lisbon treaty and a pledge to pay out aid only if it 's " indispensable , " as leaders meeting in brussels on thursday agreed on the need to make a temporary trillion dollar rescue fund into a permanent one .
present dangers but market concerns are focused on whether the euro zone has sufficient immediate funds to come to the aid of the likes of portugal or spain , should they need a bailout next year .
" the new esm should safeguard the euro zone 's financial stability in the future .
however , it is to some extent window-dressing as it does not solve the current crisis , " said carsten brzeski , senior economist at ing bank .
the euro zone 's current fund - the european financial stability facility -lrb- efsf -rrb- - can borrow on the markets backed by euro zone government guarantees and has up to 440 billion euro to lend to governments cut off from market financing .
but many economists believe that even though only a small part of the efsf 's funds have been used to help ireland , it may turn out to be insufficient if more countries need help .
" european leaders failed to address the issue of debt sustainability and possible insolvency problems prior to 2013 .
debt restructuring , a common euro zone bond or an increase of the efsf ?
none of these issues have been addressed .
but they have to be , " brzeski said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markets reacted unvaforably to the eu summit " the preliminary outcome of the eu summit represents yet another missed opportunity by european policymakers to forcefully address investor concerns and calm markets in a more sustainable and pre-emptive manner , " said frank engels , economist at barclays capital .
underlining the need to reassure financial markets over fears that portugal and spain may be in need of bailouts soon , the european central bank also announced on thursday that it would double its capital to 10.76 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.3 billion -rrb- to cope with an increase in market volatility .
bonds kept off agenda discussion about the introduction of " e-bonds , " which would allow all european nations to borrow money at common rates , was kept off the agenda .
merkel has said that the common bond plan " would not rid europe of its weaknesses , it would simply transmit them across the board . "
germany is strongly opposed because e-bonds would effectively mean all 16 euro zone countries - or 17 when estonia joins the currency from jan .
1 , 2011 - financing a portion of their debt together and sharing a credit rating .
berlin , which is the benchmark issuer of debt in the euro zone and enjoys the lowest borrowing costs thanks to its economic strength and reliability , would have to surrender some of its credit to riskier euro states such as greece and ireland .
although germany is publicly opposed to the idea of euro-bonds , some in the euro zone back the idea .
" germany 's rejection of the expansion is another example of how euro zone governments do not agree on the best way forward to deal with this crisis , " said bnp paribas ' wattret .
" as a result , the measures taken have been piecemeal , unconvincing and reactive rather than pre-emptive .
this is going to have to change if confidence is to be restored in a lastingway , " he said .
leaders were meeting in their seventh summit of a busy year , as markets have grown increasingly wary that eu states might default on loans secured through individual government bonds .

european leaders have agreed on a permanent rescue fund to cover countries in need of financial assistance .
german chancellor merkel hailed the summit as a success , but the measure has failed to reassure the markets . european leaders meeting in brussels have set up a permanent emergency fund to help debt-laden countries , and have agreed to rewrite some of the bloc 's rules in a bid to shore up the value of the euro .
" we will do everything to secure the financial stability of the euro as a whole , " german chancellor angela merkel said at a news conference after a european union summit .
she added that reform and stability will remain on the euro zone 's agenda next year as the bloc fights to secure the single currency and make its economies more competitive .
but the move was given an emphatic thumbs-down as the ratings agency moody 's downgraded ireland 's credit rating on friday by five notches , to baa1 , two notches above junk .
" while a downgrade had been anticipated , the severity of the downgrade is surprising , " dublin-based glas securities said .
spiraling debt eu leaders have spent most of 2010 trying to come up with successful measures to stop the region 's debt crisis spreading , but greece and ireland have already been forced to seek eu bailouts and portugal , spain , belgium and others are now in the spotlight .
on thursday leaders agreed on a change to the eu treaty to create the european stability mechanism -lrb- esm -rrb- – a permanent financial safety net of 750 billion euro from 2013 - that will help countries with liquidity problems and allow for debt restructuring of insolvent ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is determined to stabilize the euro eu leaders confirmed that private investors would be involved in the future euro zone rescue mechanism , a draft summit statement showed .
merkel said the fund would be sufficiently large .
" the more coherent economic policies are , the more we see by 2013 that states have made progress with a culture of stability , the lower the financial extent of the -lrb- rescue fund -rrb- will have to be , " she added .
germany lobbied hard for changes to the lisbon treaty and a pledge to pay out aid only if it 's " indispensable , " as leaders meeting in brussels on thursday agreed on the need to make a temporary trillion dollar rescue fund into a permanent one .
present dangers but market concerns are focused on whether the euro zone has sufficient immediate funds to come to the aid of the likes of portugal or spain , should they need a bailout next year .
" the new esm should safeguard the euro zone 's financial stability in the future .
however , it is to some extent window-dressing as it does not solve the current crisis , " said carsten brzeski , senior economist at ing bank .
the euro zone 's current fund - the european financial stability facility -lrb- efsf -rrb- - can borrow on the markets backed by euro zone government guarantees and has up to 440 billion euro to lend to governments cut off from market financing .
but many economists believe that even though only a small part of the efsf 's funds have been used to help ireland , it may turn out to be insufficient if more countries need help .
" european leaders failed to address the issue of debt sustainability and possible insolvency problems prior to 2013 .
debt restructuring , a common euro zone bond or an increase of the efsf ?
none of these issues have been addressed .
but they have to be , " brzeski said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markets reacted unvaforably to the eu summit " the preliminary outcome of the eu summit represents yet another missed opportunity by european policymakers to forcefully address investor concerns and calm markets in a more sustainable and pre-emptive manner , " said frank engels , economist at barclays capital .
underlining the need to reassure financial markets over fears that portugal and spain may be in need of bailouts soon , the european central bank also announced on thursday that it would double its capital to 10.76 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.3 billion -rrb- to cope with an increase in market volatility .
bonds kept off agenda discussion about the introduction of " e-bonds , " which would allow all european nations to borrow money at common rates , was kept off the agenda .
merkel has said that the common bond plan " would not rid europe of its weaknesses , it would simply transmit them across the board . "
germany is strongly opposed because e-bonds would effectively mean all 16 euro zone countries - or 17 when estonia joins the currency from jan .
1 , 2011 - financing a portion of their debt together and sharing a credit rating .
berlin , which is the benchmark issuer of debt in the euro zone and enjoys the lowest borrowing costs thanks to its economic strength and reliability , would have to surrender some of its credit to riskier euro states such as greece and ireland .
although germany is publicly opposed to the idea of euro-bonds , some in the euro zone back the idea .
" germany 's rejection of the expansion is another example of how euro zone governments do not agree on the best way forward to deal with this crisis , " said bnp paribas ' wattret .
" as a result , the measures taken have been piecemeal , unconvincing and reactive rather than pre-emptive .
this is going to have to change if confidence is to be restored in a lastingway , " he said .
leaders were meeting in their seventh summit of a busy year , as markets have grown increasingly wary that eu states might default on loans secured through individual government bonds .

schalke , stuttgart and leverkusen , meanwhile , were handed less formidable foes in europe . bayern fans will be wary of their team ’ s next test in the champions league as the club were handed a difficult tie with cup holders inter milan .
they will also be looking for revenge in the two-legged match , having lost to inter in last year ’ s final .

“ all the same , it ’ s our goal to get past valencia . ”
the two teams squared off in the group stage in the fall of 2007 , when valencia got the better of schalke , beating them in germany and drawing at home .
but as schalke defender benedikt hoewedes pointed out , just as schalke is a much different team to three years ago , so is valencia .
“ they ’ ve lost two very strong players in david silva and david villa , ” said hoewedes .

he 's apologized for his recent comments that gay fans should n't fornicate at the qatar world cup . fifa president sepp blatter has apologized for saying that gay fans should " refrain from sexual activity " if they go to the 2022 world cup in qatar .
homosexuality is illegal in qatar and blatter 's original comments provoked anger among gay rights groups .
" i regret my comment , i did n't want to hurt anyone .
we are against discrimination .
i apologize for that comment , " blatter told a press conference ahead of saturday 's club world cup .
" it was not my intention and it will never be my intention to go into any discrimination because this is exactly what we -lrb- fifa -rrb- are against , so therefore if somebody feels they have been hurt , then i regret and i present apologies for that , " he added .
gay rights activists have reacted furiously after the comments and called for the head of the world soccer governing body to either apologize or resign after his comments this week .
former nba basketball star john amaechi - who revealed he was gay in 2007 - led the attack , accusing the fifa president of " epic , archaic , neanderthal , ignorance . "
a reputation for gaffes " with little more than an afterthought fifa has endorsed the marginalization of lgbt -lsb- lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender -rsb- people around the world , " he wrote on his blog .
" anything less than a full reversal of his position is unacceptable , " amaechi added .
blatter 's remarks are just the latest example of the 74-year-old football chief putting his foot in his mouth .
he told women footballers in 2004 that the best way to make their sport more popular would be to wear " tighter shorts . "
earlier this year , he suggested that john terry 's alleged affair , which led to him being stripped of the england captaincy , would have been applauded in latin countries .
qatar was awarded the world cup this month ahead of australia , the united states , japan and south korea .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 17.12.2010 online retailers slip on deliveries großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some communities in germany are only clearing main roads this year christmas is the time of big money for online retail - this year record turnover was expected .
but with extreme snow across europe , father christmas might just not be able to get to customers in time this year . this year 's holiday shopping season was supposed to generate record online retail sales across europe - from food deliveries to presents .
british online retail association imrg estimates a rise in sales for december by 16 percent to 6.4 billion pounds -lrb- 7.5 billion euros -rrb- .
for 2010 , germany expects some 18.3 billion euros in online sales , up 18 percent .
no food deliveries to scotland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some british companies have stopped their trucks from travelling up to scotland however , with winter having hit europe early and heavily this year , some online retailers are now feeling the effects of snow-blocked roads .
especially hard hit are the british isles .
few tesco delivery trucks are able to make their rounds due to snowy streets .
on its mail-order website , the giant british food retailer is informing customers that it is currently unable to take any new orders in scotland , among other regions .
marks and spencer 's is also issuing regular weather updates on its homepage .
and like tesco , the food and clothing retailer has also temporarily suspended orders from scotland .
" i think customers will not want to risk things and will go to local shops instead of buying online , " natalie berg from the industry analyst planet retail told financial times deutschland .
snowed-in side streets in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plenty of presents are still en route across europe germany is also affected .
more than 80,000 mail carriers across germany have to walk across unplowed streets .
conditions differ considerably from community to community , " some communities are simply not clearing side streets this year , " anke baumann , a spokeswoman from german postal service deutsche post / dhl , told deutsche welle .
" that means our mail carriers have to walk back and forth through the snow carrying single parcels every time because they ca n't even push carts through the snow . "
deutsche post is promising customers in germany that parcels dropped off by noon on december 22 will be delivered by december 24 , christmas eve .
" that 's a promise we 're doing our best to fulfil , " said baumann who , in the same breath , warned : " it might just be impossible in individual cases to stick to it . "
deutsche post has expanded its operating hours to cope with the adverse weather conditions .
parcels ordered from online retailer amazon , for instance , will be delivered on the sunday before christmas - an exception in germany where business traditionally comes to a standstill on sundays .
nevertheless , amazon germany is advising customers to check their order status online because , as a company spokesperson told deutsche welle , " delays of one or two days are currently likely to occur . "
germany 's biggest mail-order clothing retailer otto declined to comment whether goods were being delivered on time .
twice as many parcels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more goods ordered online and christmas coming up : postmen hardly ever get a break this year the festive season traditionally sees a hike in the number of parcels delivered every year .
and this year is no exception , thanks largely to the growing popularity of purchasing merchandise online .
in the weeks leading up to christmas , the number of parcels delivered daily in germany this year has already increased from an average 2.5 million to about 5 million .
" and it 's going to be even more in the last week before christmas , " said baumann .
while germany has struggled with snowed-in side streets and temporarily closed airports to keep deliveries moving , britain does n't seem to be prepared for continuous frost and snow at all .
the country lacks snowploughs to clear roads .
in edinburgh , in fact , the army has been called in to help clear streets .
the country 's postal service , royal mail , is investing 20 billion pounds to be able to handle the christmas mail and parcels .
shop while you wait bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an exception for christmas : parcels are being delivered also on sundays in germany harsh weather conditions have generally been understood to spur online sales because customers can shop comfortably from home .
with the expected delays this year , however , experts say some customers might refrain from ordering online this shopping season .
current conditions demonstrate how sensitive online retail is to adverse weather conditions .
online shopping is still for now more popular in britain than it is in germany but it is becoming rapidly popular in europe 's largest economy .
some of the increase , interestingly , is attributed to smartphone users who like to use their downtime to shop online with their phones .
poinsettias still available online orders have also increased for fleurop .
germany 's largest flower mail-order service operates a network of 8,000 florists nationwide .
that dense network shortens distances between florists and customers , ensuring swift delivery .
but in extreme weather conditions , flights can be delayed or cancelled altogether .
occasionally , fleurop florists have to warn customers that a certain flower might not be deliverable on time .
but a spokesperson from fleurop told deutsche welle that , so far , it has not been forced to issue a warning for the popular christmas plant poinsettia – which is still readily available across germany .

but with extreme snow across europe , father christmas might just not be able to get to customers in time this year . this year 's holiday shopping season was supposed to generate record online retail sales across europe - from food deliveries to presents .
british online retail association imrg estimates a rise in sales for december by 16 percent to 6.4 billion pounds -lrb- 7.5 billion euros -rrb- .
for 2010 , germany expects some 18.3 billion euros in online sales , up 18 percent .
no food deliveries to scotland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some british companies have stopped their trucks from travelling up to scotland however , with winter having hit europe early and heavily this year , some online retailers are now feeling the effects of snow-blocked roads .
especially hard hit are the british isles .
few tesco delivery trucks are able to make their rounds due to snowy streets .
on its mail-order website , the giant british food retailer is informing customers that it is currently unable to take any new orders in scotland , among other regions .
marks and spencer 's is also issuing regular weather updates on its homepage .
and like tesco , the food and clothing retailer has also temporarily suspended orders from scotland .
" i think customers will not want to risk things and will go to local shops instead of buying online , " natalie berg from the industry analyst planet retail told financial times deutschland .
snowed-in side streets in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plenty of presents are still en route across europe germany is also affected .
more than 80,000 mail carriers across germany have to walk across unplowed streets .
conditions differ considerably from community to community , " some communities are simply not clearing side streets this year , " anke baumann , a spokeswoman from german postal service deutsche post / dhl , told deutsche welle .
" that means our mail carriers have to walk back and forth through the snow carrying single parcels every time because they ca n't even push carts through the snow . "
deutsche post is promising customers in germany that parcels dropped off by noon on december 22 will be delivered by december 24 , christmas eve .
" that 's a promise we 're doing our best to fulfil , " said baumann who , in the same breath , warned : " it might just be impossible in individual cases to stick to it . "
deutsche post has expanded its operating hours to cope with the adverse weather conditions .
parcels ordered from online retailer amazon , for instance , will be delivered on the sunday before christmas - an exception in germany where business traditionally comes to a standstill on sundays .
nevertheless , amazon germany is advising customers to check their order status online because , as a company spokesperson told deutsche welle , " delays of one or two days are currently likely to occur . "
germany 's biggest mail-order clothing retailer otto declined to comment whether goods were being delivered on time .
twice as many parcels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more goods ordered online and christmas coming up : postmen hardly ever get a break this year the festive season traditionally sees a hike in the number of parcels delivered every year .
and this year is no exception , thanks largely to the growing popularity of purchasing merchandise online .
in the weeks leading up to christmas , the number of parcels delivered daily in germany this year has already increased from an average 2.5 million to about 5 million .
" and it 's going to be even more in the last week before christmas , " said baumann .
while germany has struggled with snowed-in side streets and temporarily closed airports to keep deliveries moving , britain does n't seem to be prepared for continuous frost and snow at all .
the country lacks snowploughs to clear roads .
in edinburgh , in fact , the army has been called in to help clear streets .
the country 's postal service , royal mail , is investing 20 billion pounds to be able to handle the christmas mail and parcels .
shop while you wait bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an exception for christmas : parcels are being delivered also on sundays in germany harsh weather conditions have generally been understood to spur online sales because customers can shop comfortably from home .
with the expected delays this year , however , experts say some customers might refrain from ordering online this shopping season .
current conditions demonstrate how sensitive online retail is to adverse weather conditions .
online shopping is still for now more popular in britain than it is in germany but it is becoming rapidly popular in europe 's largest economy .
some of the increase , interestingly , is attributed to smartphone users who like to use their downtime to shop online with their phones .
poinsettias still available online orders have also increased for fleurop .
germany 's largest flower mail-order service operates a network of 8,000 florists nationwide .
that dense network shortens distances between florists and customers , ensuring swift delivery .
but in extreme weather conditions , flights can be delayed or cancelled altogether .
occasionally , fleurop florists have to warn customers that a certain flower might not be deliverable on time .
but a spokesperson from fleurop told deutsche welle that , so far , it has not been forced to issue a warning for the popular christmas plant poinsettia – which is still readily available across germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 17.12.2010 german parliament at odds over papal address großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone thinks it 's such a good idea for the pope to speak in parliament pope benedict xvi is scheduled to speak in parliament when he visits germany in september 2011 .
this has caused a great stir among politicians . pope benedict xvi is not scheduled to talk in the bundestag , the lower house of the german parliament , until september 2011 , but his visit has already stirred up a hot debate between the opposition greens and chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the greens oppose the papal speech in parliament and hans-christian stroebele , a green party grandee , said he would not listen to the pope 's speech .
stroebele has protested against speeches in the past , when he left parliament to ignore speeches by george w. bush and vladimir putin .
other greens said they will attend the speech , but echoed the criticism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stroebele said he would leave the bundestag during the papal speech " the german bundestag is supposed to be neutral when it comes to state visitors , " volker beck , head of the greens ' parliamentary group said .
as the pope is first and foremost the leader of a religious group , it would raise the question which representatives from other religious groups could be invited next , he added .
the greens lay great importance on the equal treatment of different religions and fear this to be compromised by the pope ’ s visit .
the cdu dismissed the concerns and went on the offensive .
greens are against everything " the greens are simply against everything and everyone , " cdu secretary general hermann groehe said .
" you can only hope that this ' party against everything ' reflects a bit over christmas .
it would be an honor to have the pope speak in parliament . "
cem oezdemir , leader of the greens , rebuffed the sharp attacks .
" the pope should speak in parliament if he wishes to do so , " he said .
oezdemir added he believed in an open dialogue .
the greens ' concerns were backed by social democrat rolf schwanitz who is also a member of a group within his party that campaigns for laicism .
he said he had reservations about the papal speech .
wolfgang thierse , the social democrat vice president of the german parliament , called the greens narrow-minded .
the head of the protestant church , nikolaus schneider , said the pope 's invitation to speak in the bundestag was " understandable , because the pope is also a head of state . "
christian stroebele added another twist to the debate in an interview with the saturday editions of the waz group newspapers in germany .
he said he might consider staying in parliament and listening to the pope 's speech if he were allowed to ask a question .
yet stroebele , who describes himself as a catholic , maintained the pope had failed to modernize the church .
" the holy father still promotes exorcism .
for me that shows a medieval institution , " he said . author : sarah steffen -lrb- epd , dpa , afp , kna -rrb- editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the drastic downgrade hardly shows confidence in ongoing eu efforts to safeguard the euro at the brussels summit . ratings agency moody 's on friday dropped its rating on irish sovereign debt by five notches , suggesting it was less than enthused by thursday 's eu agreement on a permanent stability fund to protect debt-laden single currency users .
moody 's dropped ireland down five spots , from the third-highest available grade , aa2 , to baa1 , a risk level described as " lower medium grade . "
however , the agency added that this rating represented a " negative " outlook for a country , which would ordinarily have a very high credit rating .
moody 's said its decision was based " on the risk that the irish government 's financial strength could decline further if economic growth were to be weaker than currently projected or the costs of stabilizing the banking system turn out to be higher than currently forecast . "
european leaders gathered at a summit in brussels were seeking to shore up debt-laden eurozone countries , and the single european currency more generally ; but the measures agreed on thursday evidently did little to impress moody 's .
the establishment of a permanent rescue mechanism for eurozone members was designed , at least in part , to dispel concerns in the markets that europe may never repay its debts .
last , but not least bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen 's plan for recovery is unlikely to salvage his prime ministerial post " moody 's has this morning become the third of the three major ratings agencies to downgrade irish sovereign debt in the past four weeks , " the chief economist for dublin-based goodbody stockbroker 's , dermot o 'leary said .
" it has , however , outdone the other two with the scale of the downgrade . "
moody 's move follows similar , but smaller , reductions by fellow credit agencies , standard and poor 's and fitch .
the change means that investors will now demand a higher return in exchange for purchasing government bonds , effectively upping the price of existing and future loans for the irish government .
ireland recently became the second eurozone country , after greece , to seek emergency loans worth roughly 85 billion euros -lrb- $ 113 billion -rrb- from the european union and the international monetary fund .
the country 's rising national debt and enormous 2010 budget deficit - boosted by a government bailout of the country 's biggest moneylender , anglo irish bank - forced the government in dublin to call for help .
the financial turmoil has brought prime minister brian cowen 's coalition government to its knees , a snap election is expected early next year .

last week , an alien abduction prevented us from bringing you our predictions for match day 16 .
this week , probed , rested and ready , we 're hoping for a big week to make up for the dropped points . friday , dec .
17 moenchengladbach - hamburg friday night 's encounter features two of the bundesliga 's most out-of-form teams , each collecting just three points from their last five league matches .
hamburg coach armin veh appears out of answers to improve his team 's poor play , all but admitting as much after last week 's hammering at home to leverkusen .
gladbach 's michael frontzeck , meanwhile , might well need a win to stay in his job .
in that we 've said that before about the stern , bald man this season and he 's gotten the job done -lrb- witness the 4-0 win at cologne on match day 12 -rrb- , we like his chances .
prediction : 2-1 moenchengladbach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a dire start , schalke are finding their groove saturday , dec .
18 schalke - cologne the billy goats took all three points off of high-flying eintracht last week , but did so in the ugliest - and most fortunate - of circumstances .
they could have easily gone 3-0 down within the first 20 minutes , but did n't and got a goal from 19-year-old debutant christian clemens early in the second half .
then they held of for dear life .
schalke , for their part , have been bossing around the likes of bayern , benfica and mainz in recent weeks .
expect to find a broken cologne somewhere under an avalanche come saturday evening .
prediction : 4-1 schalke bremen - kaiserslautern the fight bremen put up against dortmund last week was as credible as any team 's has been over the last couple of months , and on another day they might well have eked out a draw rather than a 2-0 loss .
that good showing , coupled with kaiserslautern 's pitiful away form this season -lrb- two wins , six losses -rrb- , means werder should head into the break three points richer .
prediction : 2-0 bremen wolfsburg - hoffenheim the great steve mcclaren experiment in wolfsburg is beginning to look like a failure .
after spending big to get his englishman for the touchline -lrb- not to mention his brazilian , diego , for the number 10 shirt -rrb- , dieter hoeness might just have to head back to the drawing board come january .
word is edin dzeko will get his big-money move to manchester city , mark van bommel will be on his way in from bayern , and - providing hoffenheim lower the boom on saturday - mcclaren will be heading down to the jobcentre .
and so it will come to pass … prediction : 2-1 hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eintracht will have to show a lot of fight to take down dortmund frankfurt - dortmund dortmund 's effort in spain on wednesday night was valiant , but was n't good enough to get the win over sevilla they needed to stay in the europa league .
it could also prove one exertion too many ahead of a tough match at eintracht on the weekend .
coach michael skibbe 's men have hit a rough patch recently , losing three of four , but have had some tough luck along the way . we see that luck changing on saturday , helping produce a surprise result .
prediction : 1-0 frankfurt nuremberg - hanover just when you 're ready to write off nuremberg as rubbish , and hanover as merely fortunate , they go and prove otherwise .
it was nuremberg who were lucky last week , drawing at hoffenheim on the back of stingy defending and late , opportunistic behavior in front of goal .
and hanover ?
they 're just good .
the reds ' 2-1 win over stuttgart was a master class in counter-attacking football , led by didier ya konan .
it 's a shame that the ivorian will miss this week 's match , but his running partner from earlier this season , mohammed abdelloue , is back from his break in training to replace him , and that should be enough to tide the team over .
prediction : 1-0 hanover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz fans ought to have a good time in hamburg this weekend st. pauli - mainz the st. pauli pirate brigade 's roger is not looking so jolly these days - they 've lost six of their last eight , and most of those losses were n't even close -lrb- see : 3-0 defeats to schalke , bremen and bayern -rrb- .
fortunately for pauli , mainz is in a funk of its own , losing five of their last seven .
but all but one of those losses was close - unlucky even , some might say .
thomas tuchel and co. should have enough juice to satisfy their fans at the millerntor … before the happy out-of-towners head to the nearby red light district for round two .
prediction : 3-1 mainz sunday , dec .
5 leverkusen - freiburg by now leverkusen must be aware that it is one of the few sides in the bundesliga with even an outside chance to overhaul dortmund for the title .
11 points is a tall order , but do-able - so long as a couple of big ifs fall into place .
dortmund must start losing games -lrb- something they 've done just once so far -rrb- , and the pharmaceuticals must find the mental toughness to turn the games they 've been drawing up to now -lrb- a whopping five on the season -rrb- in to wins .
this project has to start now , against freiburg , and we reckon it will .
prediction : 3-2 leverkusen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labbadia is already off to a good start at suttgart stuttgart - bayern many a commentator has remarked in the days since bruno labbadia 's appointment as stuttgart 's new coach that he has come at an opportune time .
the journeyman coach had three matches to win over the squad and the club 's fans .
first , a gimme against a danish tomato can called odense -lrb- duly won , 5-1 -rrb- , then two dates with bayern munich - in the league on sunday , then in the cup on wednesday .
take two out of three , or even a fighting draw with bayern in the league , and he can go into the winter break on a high . we think he 'll manage it .
prediction : 2-1 stuttgart last week 's results : n / a total for the season : 66 three points for a correct score prediction two points for a correct margin prediction one point for a correct winner prediction author : matt hermann editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

prediction : 3-2 leverkusen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labbadia is already off to a good start at suttgart stuttgart - bayern many a commentator has remarked in the days since bruno labbadia 's appointment as stuttgart 's new coach that he has come at an opportune time .
the journeyman coach had three matches to win over the squad and the club 's fans .
first , a gimme against a danish tomato can called odense -lrb- duly won , 5-1 -rrb- , then two dates with bayern munich - in the league on sunday , then in the cup on wednesday .
take two out of three , or even a fighting draw with bayern in the league , and he can go into the winter break on a high . we think he 'll manage it .
prediction : 2-1 stuttgart last week 's results : n / a total for the season : 66 three points for a correct score prediction two points for a correct margin prediction one point for a correct winner prediction author : matt hermann editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

artists have n't abandoned search for psychedelic nirvana of inspiration do you think drugs can enhance artistic creativity ?
i know of no artwork made under drug influence that really is impressive and tells a good idea .
art is about ideas , drugs kill the ability to create them .
it 's funny how many great musicians failed more and more under the influence of drugs .

big hurdles remain but many are confident about electrics ' future . electric cars have had many false dawns over the years , but their proponents in the motor industry say now their time has come .
this december , two mass-market electric vehicles are hitting dealerships in selected markets around the world .
the general motors volt and nissan 's leaf are both aimed at delivering emissions-free driving at affordable prices .
motor trend magazine has called the chevy volt a " breakthrough " and a " game changer " and named it its 2011 car of the year .
a retiree in new jersey became the owner of the first volt , a gas-electric hybrid , to be sold to the public on december 15 , while nissan rolled out its leaf in a handful of us cities earlier this month .
both are scheduled for sale in europe in 2011 .
the developments have some experts saying that a major change is underway in the automobile industry .
general motors ' volt relies on a battery for the first 40 miles or 60 kilometers , after which a gas-powered engine kicks in to recharge the battery , which extends the range of the sedan by another 300 miles , or 480 kilometers .
in contrast , the leaf is all-electric with a range of around 100 miles , and just like early gas-powered vehicles , it might be difficult to find fuel nearby .
however , unlike the car 's predecessors , the leaf has a gps system .
press a small blue button and it will search for the nearest charging station .
still , many fear that ' range anxiety ' will put drivers off the all-electrics and that electric cars will remain a niche product .
but others say zero-emission vehicles will gain traction in the long term .
" we are the most bullish today by saying ten percent of the market 2020 will be zero emission , " nissan renault ceo carlos ghosn told a stanford university forum .
" frankly , i think the numbers will move up . ”
sticker shock bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the all-electric nissan leaf is more affordable it all sounds promising , although the price tag could limit its popularity .
even with a federal tax credit , the volt will set consumers back $ 33,500 -lrb- 25,155 euros -rrb- .
nissan 's leaf will not collide with bank accounts with quite the same ferocity .
tax incentives from washington and the state of california will bring the price of the four-door automobile down to just over $ 20,000 , about the same price as a gas-powered sedan .
still , that 's almost where the similarities with its gasoline-dependent brethren end .
starting up the leaf is a quiet process – there 's no traditional cranking sound of a starter .
there 's also no internal combustion engine .
instead , the car relies on lithium-ion batteries .
when it 's running , it emits a faint hum which has been added to alert pedestrians that a car is nearby .
nissan has spent $ 5 billion developing electric cars and ghosn insists this is a safe bet .
he says electric car sales will rise if oil prices go up and carbon dioxide restrictions get tougher .
event without new co2 rules , the international energy agency is promoting electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids as a way to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions , although the amount of the reduction depends on the electricity source .
while the cars themselves do n't emit greenhouse gases , the electricity plants where they get their energy from may .
" as a us average , a battery electric car we think would reduce greenhouse gas emission by about 40 percent compared to a conventional vehicle , " said timothy lipman of the university of california , berkeley .
" in california , because our grid is cleaner , it would probably be more like 60 percent reduction . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charging issues will have to be solved before electrics gain a wide following out of juice charging is a real issue when it comes to the acceptance or rejection of electrics with the wider population .
according to a recent report by the national research council , the current us electric grid could provide enough electricity to power 80 percent of today 's cars , if they were electric and provided that they were charged during off-peak hours , such as overnight .
however , some are looking at a different approach .
a company called " a better place " plans on offering electric car battery swapping pans , similar to mobile phone plans , in which monthly payments are based on the amounts of swapping and charging drivers do .
but some , such as berkeley 's lipman , doubt that such programs will be universally viable .
he said it might make sense to run a battery swapping operation in europe , where gas prices are relatively high , but in the us the system would probably not be able to compete with the relatively low price of gas . another battery-related worry has to do with a core component : lithium .
media reports say that bolivia , which has almost half the world supply of lithium , is considering tighter control of its lithium reserves .
other rare-earth resources , such as neodymium iron boron , could also pose problems .
china has the biggest deposits of this material has begun withholding it from the world market , pushing up its price .
future outlook government officials are already looking for substitutes for these materials .
one us government-funded research project is working on making electric cars easily affordable by radically redesigning their batteries , based on those used in hearing aids .
" we think that has the very distinct possibility of giving cars that now have a hundred mile range , a five hundred mile range at one third of the cost , " said us energy secretary david chu .
even if this technological breakthrough is far off on the horizon , lipman of berkeley 's transportation sustainability research center , says electric cars have a bright future .
he says they will eventually be embraced by more than just environmentalists .
" once people drive these cars , they see how they perform , how easy they are to operate , how quiet they are , the excellent acceleration and so forth , " he said .
" a lot of people are going to like these cars , not because they 're green , but because they 're better cars . "

big hurdles remain but many are confident about electrics ' future . electric cars have had many false dawns over the years , but their proponents in the motor industry say now their time has come .
this december , two mass-market electric vehicles are hitting dealerships in selected markets around the world .
the general motors volt and nissan 's leaf are both aimed at delivering emissions-free driving at affordable prices .
motor trend magazine has called the chevy volt a " breakthrough " and a " game changer " and named it its 2011 car of the year .
a retiree in new jersey became the owner of the first volt , a gas-electric hybrid , to be sold to the public on december 15 , while nissan rolled out its leaf in a handful of us cities earlier this month .
both are scheduled for sale in europe in 2011 .
the developments have some experts saying that a major change is underway in the automobile industry .
general motors ' volt relies on a battery for the first 40 miles or 60 kilometers , after which a gas-powered engine kicks in to recharge the battery , which extends the range of the sedan by another 300 miles , or 480 kilometers .
in contrast , the leaf is all-electric with a range of around 100 miles , and just like early gas-powered vehicles , it might be difficult to find fuel nearby .
however , unlike the car 's predecessors , the leaf has a gps system .
press a small blue button and it will search for the nearest charging station .
still , many fear that ' range anxiety ' will put drivers off the all-electrics and that electric cars will remain a niche product .
but others say zero-emission vehicles will gain traction in the long term .
" we are the most bullish today by saying ten percent of the market 2020 will be zero emission , " nissan renault ceo carlos ghosn told a stanford university forum .
" frankly , i think the numbers will move up . ”
sticker shock bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the all-electric nissan leaf is more affordable it all sounds promising , although the price tag could limit its popularity .
even with a federal tax credit , the volt will set consumers back $ 33,500 -lrb- 25,155 euros -rrb- .
nissan 's leaf will not collide with bank accounts with quite the same ferocity .
tax incentives from washington and the state of california will bring the price of the four-door automobile down to just over $ 20,000 , about the same price as a gas-powered sedan .
still , that 's almost where the similarities with its gasoline-dependent brethren end .
starting up the leaf is a quiet process – there 's no traditional cranking sound of a starter .
there 's also no internal combustion engine .
instead , the car relies on lithium-ion batteries .
when it 's running , it emits a faint hum which has been added to alert pedestrians that a car is nearby .
nissan has spent $ 5 billion developing electric cars and ghosn insists this is a safe bet .
he says electric car sales will rise if oil prices go up and carbon dioxide restrictions get tougher .
event without new co2 rules , the international energy agency is promoting electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids as a way to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions , although the amount of the reduction depends on the electricity source .
while the cars themselves do n't emit greenhouse gases , the electricity plants where they get their energy from may .
" as a us average , a battery electric car we think would reduce greenhouse gas emission by about 40 percent compared to a conventional vehicle , " said timothy lipman of the university of california , berkeley .
" in california , because our grid is cleaner , it would probably be more like 60 percent reduction . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charging issues will have to be solved before electrics gain a wide following out of juice charging is a real issue when it comes to the acceptance or rejection of electrics with the wider population .
according to a recent report by the national research council , the current us electric grid could provide enough electricity to power 80 percent of today 's cars , if they were electric and provided that they were charged during off-peak hours , such as overnight .
however , some are looking at a different approach .
a company called " a better place " plans on offering electric car battery swapping pans , similar to mobile phone plans , in which monthly payments are based on the amounts of swapping and charging drivers do .
but some , such as berkeley 's lipman , doubt that such programs will be universally viable .
he said it might make sense to run a battery swapping operation in europe , where gas prices are relatively high , but in the us the system would probably not be able to compete with the relatively low price of gas . another battery-related worry has to do with a core component : lithium .
media reports say that bolivia , which has almost half the world supply of lithium , is considering tighter control of its lithium reserves .
other rare-earth resources , such as neodymium iron boron , could also pose problems .
china has the biggest deposits of this material has begun withholding it from the world market , pushing up its price .

bayer leverkusen drew against title holders atletico , with both german sides progressing . there was a dream start for new stuttgart head coach bruno labbadia , his players notching up five goals in their europa league soccer clash at home to danish club odense bk on thursday .
timo gebhart grabbed the first for stuttgart - who are already through to the next stage of the competition - on 20 minutes , scoring when his own header was chested back to his feet by odense defender anders moller christensen .
the second came in the form of a mistake from odense defender daniel hoegh , who accidentally stabbed a cross by gebhart into his own team 's net .
christian gentner was quickest to the ball after it hit defender thomas helveg , to make it 3-0 before pavel pogrebnyak made it 4-0 five minutes later .

the spanish side did dominate the first half of the game with uruguayan striker diego forlan coming close with a half-volley just ahead of the break .
despite this , leverkusen soaked up the pressure and it was the germans who scored first - after a full 69 minutes - patrick helmes slotting the ball past atletico goalkeeper david de gea .
although atletico responded quickly , with a side-footed goal from fran merida just three minutes later , the spaniards were unable to take the lead .
in any case , a victory would not have helped atletico .
greek side aris salonika secured a win that ensured they finished in second place behind group leaders leverkusen .

leverkusen draw , holders go out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atletico made every effort but were ultimately denied in other europa league football action , bayer leverkusen secured a 1-1 draw against europa league title holders atletico madrid on wednesday , sending the spanish side out of the competition .
atletico needed a win against leverkusen - who had already qualified - and needed other results to go in their favor to progress .
the spanish side did dominate the first half of the game with uruguayan striker diego forlan coming close with a half-volley just ahead of the break .
despite this , leverkusen soaked up the pressure and it was the germans who scored first - after a full 69 minutes - patrick helmes slotting the ball past atletico goalkeeper david de gea .
although atletico responded quickly , with a side-footed goal from fran merida just three minutes later , the spaniards were unable to take the lead .
in any case , a victory would not have helped atletico .
greek side aris salonika secured a win that ensured they finished in second place behind group leaders leverkusen .

schalke 04 , who have endured some tough times domestically this season , also topped their group ahead of more fancied teams such as benfica and lyon .
" bayern munich and schalke have played a lot better in the champions league this season than they have in the bundesliga , " freelance soccer writer and sometime sportschau.de correspondent marcus bark told deutsche welle .
" schalke coach felix magath has even gone as far as to say that his team takes the champions league more seriously , although it 's hard to believe that this is true . "
out of the three german teams who qualified for this season 's champions league , only werder bremen failed to make it out of the group stage .
" for the past few seasons , two out of the three german teams have gone relatively far in the champions league , " bark said .
" even wolfsburg who dropped out of the champions league at the group stage last year , went on to reach the quarter-finals of the europa league . "
in this season 's europa league , bayer leverkusen and vfb stuttgart have mirrored the success of bayern and schalke by qualifying as the winners of their groups , with only borussia dortmund - somewhat surprisingly considering their domestic form - failing to reach the last 32 .
close followers of the bundesliga may not be that surprised to see such a strong german showing .
this season is hardly a one-off .
consistency breeds consistency for germans in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern romped to last year 's final before losing to inter both bayern and stuttgart made it into the knock-out rounds of the champions league last season - with the bavarian giants , who also made it to the quarter-finals the year before , romping all the way to the final .
the 2009 europa league finalists werder bremen , wolfsburg and hamburg all made it to the quarter-finals of the europa league last season with hamburg progressing to the semi-finals - as they did the year before - before defeat to fulham ended their dream of competing for the title in their own stadium .
german teams have been putting in consistently strong performances in european competition for over a decade now , with at least one of the bundesliga 's six allotted representatives progressing to the quarter-finals or further in both the champions and europa leagues over the past five years .
exposure to foreign opposition honing german skills marcus bark believes that the german national team ’ s long history of success helps to breed players ready for the styles and challenges of foreign opponents , and that this season 's champions league is a case in point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young but experienced : kroos , mueller and badstuber " i think german teams have done so well in europe this season because a lot of the young german stars in these teams performed very well at the world cup , " he said .
" if you look at bayern 's team with lahm , schweinsteiger , kroos , mueller and badstuber , they all have international experience and confidence at that level . "
joerg jakob , deputy editor-in-chief at kicker magazine , agrees that foreign experience helps when attempting to win european trophies but believes that the bundesliga 's recent success is based more on the rise of its young stars . " of course you learn from playing at the world cup or by facing european competition but this is not new for german players and teams , " jakob told deutsche welle .
one of the reasons german teams are doing so well in europe , says jakob , is because of the youth development .
“ bundesliga clubs have to have education and training facilities for young people under dfb rules they introduced in 2000 , so now we have better and more talented youngsters who play a more modern style .
we also have young , modern coaches to guide them . " cash flow essential to maintaining bundesliga 's success according to marcus bark , the bundesliga 's comparatively stable financial situation - in relation to other debt-ridden leagues - is also aiding german teams . " in other leagues , the best players are sold off , making only a few clubs capable of fielding good teams in europe , " he said .
" in germany , the clubs pay well and on time .
they 're very well run and the money is used to develop talent and to hold onto players - again , look at lahm and schweinstieger at bayern ; they ’ ve been approached by europe 's biggest clubs but have chosen to stay . " if money helps bundesliga teams produce european stars of the future and keep at least some of them from the clutches of the leading clubs in the continent ’ s other leagues , then the bundesliga will need a steady stream of revenue if germany 's record in europe is to continue to improve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's loss could be germany 's champions league gain marcus bark and joerg jakob do n't see this as being a problem , even less so in the coming years as the bundesliga looks ready to usurp the underperforming italian league to snatch a fourth champions league place under uefa 's coefficient system which takes into account the results of a particular nation 's clubs in european competitions over the preceding five years . " the bundesliga attracts money , it generates money , and it keeps money , " bark said .
" buying in stars like robben , ribery , raul and huntelaar , the league has become more attractive which brings in bigger crowds .
the reasonable ticket prices also help ; a ticket on average for a bundesliga game is around 20 euros -lrb- $ 26 -rrb- where as in england you can pay up to 120 euros at some clubs .
most clubs have little or no debt so they 're making profits for reinvestment . " " if you ’ re a player on the transfer market , you want to be playing for a champions league team , " said jakob .
" if germany has an extra team in the competition then this means someone else will be able to attract players , agents and sponsors .
of course money ’ s involved , but it ’ s the glamour and prestige of the champions league which will help you keep your youngsters and your stars , meaning you 'll remain competitive .

schalke 04 , who have endured some tough times domestically this season , also topped their group ahead of more fancied teams such as benfica and lyon .
" bayern munich and schalke have played a lot better in the champions league this season than they have in the bundesliga , " freelance soccer writer and sometime sportschau.de correspondent marcus bark told deutsche welle .
" schalke coach felix magath has even gone as far as to say that his team takes the champions league more seriously , although it 's hard to believe that this is true . "
out of the three german teams who qualified for this season 's champions league , only werder bremen failed to make it out of the group stage .
" for the past few seasons , two out of the three german teams have gone relatively far in the champions league , " bark said .
" even wolfsburg who dropped out of the champions league at the group stage last year , went on to reach the quarter-finals of the europa league . "
in this season 's europa league , bayer leverkusen and vfb stuttgart have mirrored the success of bayern and schalke by qualifying as the winners of their groups , with only borussia dortmund - somewhat surprisingly considering their domestic form - failing to reach the last 32 .
close followers of the bundesliga may not be that surprised to see such a strong german showing .
this season is hardly a one-off .
consistency breeds consistency for germans in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern romped to last year 's final before losing to inter both bayern and stuttgart made it into the knock-out rounds of the champions league last season - with the bavarian giants , who also made it to the quarter-finals the year before , romping all the way to the final .
the 2009 europa league finalists werder bremen , wolfsburg and hamburg all made it to the quarter-finals of the europa league last season with hamburg progressing to the semi-finals - as they did the year before - before defeat to fulham ended their dream of competing for the title in their own stadium .
german teams have been putting in consistently strong performances in european competition for over a decade now , with at least one of the bundesliga 's six allotted representatives progressing to the quarter-finals or further in both the champions and europa leagues over the past five years .
exposure to foreign opposition honing german skills marcus bark believes that the german national team ’ s long history of success helps to breed players ready for the styles and challenges of foreign opponents , and that this season 's champions league is a case in point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young but experienced : kroos , mueller and badstuber " i think german teams have done so well in europe this season because a lot of the young german stars in these teams performed very well at the world cup , " he said .
" if you look at bayern 's team with lahm , schweinsteiger , kroos , mueller and badstuber , they all have international experience and confidence at that level . "
joerg jakob , deputy editor-in-chief at kicker magazine , agrees that foreign experience helps when attempting to win european trophies but believes that the bundesliga 's recent success is based more on the rise of its young stars . " of course you learn from playing at the world cup or by facing european competition but this is not new for german players and teams , " jakob told deutsche welle .
one of the reasons german teams are doing so well in europe , says jakob , is because of the youth development .
“ bundesliga clubs have to have education and training facilities for young people under dfb rules they introduced in 2000 , so now we have better and more talented youngsters who play a more modern style .
we also have young , modern coaches to guide them . " cash flow essential to maintaining bundesliga 's success according to marcus bark , the bundesliga 's comparatively stable financial situation - in relation to other debt-ridden leagues - is also aiding german teams . " in other leagues , the best players are sold off , making only a few clubs capable of fielding good teams in europe , " he said .
" in germany , the clubs pay well and on time .
they 're very well run and the money is used to develop talent and to hold onto players - again , look at lahm and schweinstieger at bayern ; they ’ ve been approached by europe 's biggest clubs but have chosen to stay . " if money helps bundesliga teams produce european stars of the future and keep at least some of them from the clutches of the leading clubs in the continent ’ s other leagues , then the bundesliga will need a steady stream of revenue if germany 's record in europe is to continue to improve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's loss could be germany 's champions league gain marcus bark and joerg jakob do n't see this as being a problem , even less so in the coming years as the bundesliga looks ready to usurp the underperforming italian league to snatch a fourth champions league place under uefa 's coefficient system which takes into account the results of a particular nation 's clubs in european competitions over the preceding five years . " the bundesliga attracts money , it generates money , and it keeps money , " bark said .
" buying in stars like robben , ribery , raul and huntelaar , the league has become more attractive which brings in bigger crowds .
the reasonable ticket prices also help ; a ticket on average for a bundesliga game is around 20 euros -lrb- $ 26 -rrb- where as in england you can pay up to 120 euros at some clubs .
most clubs have little or no debt so they 're making profits for reinvestment . " " if you ’ re a player on the transfer market , you want to be playing for a champions league team , " said jakob .
" if germany has an extra team in the competition then this means someone else will be able to attract players , agents and sponsors .
of course money ’ s involved , but it ’ s the glamour and prestige of the champions league which will help you keep your youngsters and your stars , meaning you 'll remain competitive .

but was it worth leaving bed ? the snow does n't seem to have stopped falling for days , who knows how many degrees below zero it is outside , and all i can think of is staying under the covers and hibernating the next six months away . even with the heat blasting out of my radiators , i feel like i 've already turned into an icicle .
when the phone rings and the invitation comes for a trip to the christmas market i know i 'd have to be seriously deranged to voluntarily stand around in the freezing cold , my hands wrapped around a cup of hot alcoholic red liquid , dressed up with a few spices and a piece of moldy orange .
and i know my hangover the next day is guaranteed to be worse than if i 'd knocked back 15 tequila slammers . my friend valiantly proposes the traditional snacks of backfisch and kartoffelpuffer .
like a lump of fried cod wedged into a tiny roll or fried potato pancakes with apple sauce will convince me to expose myself to the worst mother nature has to offer germany 's capital .
" bah humbug ! "
i hear him mumble . scrooge ! ?
who me ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mulled wine is an essential part of the christmas market visit no , i 've got nothing against christmas , just against the cold !
give me a carol concert any day , a cup of nice mulled wine in front of an open fire , a jar of cookies perhaps and i 'll be whistling " we wish you a merry christmas " all the way into february - as long as i do n't have to step out the door . yet somehow the words , " ok , if i really must , " escape my lips in a whisper . this is germany after all and that means everyone must " do " at least one christmas market a year , if not two or three .
the idea is to wrap yourself in about a thousand layers and drag your reluctant body to the town square . frozen travels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : snow arrived early in berlin this year but that 's easier said than done in berlin .
from my place in neukoelln is no town square in sight , let alone a father christmas , string of tinsel or a loudspeaker blaring " jingle bells . "
i 'm going to have to brave the cold and leave my neighborhood before finding a warming mug of gluehwein . stumbling because of my partially frozen legs , i get off the tram only to be nearly knocked down by the siberian wind .
trudging through the snow , i focus on the ferris wheel at the christmas market on alexanderplatz to keep myself from turning around .
its flashing lights are all i can see as even the television tower has disappeared into the fog . when i find him , my friend is already propping up a kiosk ; sipping on his mulled wine and watching excited kids skate round and round on the ice rink .
tourists sing " away in a manger " in japanese or " the little drummer boy " in french .
my friend 's enthusiasm increases as i order the first of many gluehweins and join in for the next round of carols . measuring markets - and mulled wine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all gifts are worth giving these markets are not only about song and wine .
you 're supposed to wander the rows of stalls and buy socks your granddad does n't need , a wooly hat your mum will never wear , an amusing game for your boyfriend that he 'll never play .
but it 's all so expensive and little of it is even " made in germany . " but holy shit shopping is just around the corner .
it 's a designer christmas market that aims to open the wallets of 30-somethings who already buy anything they really want and can afford the far-from-cheap prices .
but the t-shirts with quirky designs , the cookies and candles with berlin motifs , the hand-knitted caps , and whacky trousers made out of pullovers have all been created by local artists , who plug their wares with wit .
i order another gluehwein and buy a hat . it keeps me snug at my next stop : the self-proclaimed " most beautiful christmas market in berlin " near the historic thoroughfare unter den linden .
tucked between the opera house and the friedrichswerder church , the market is indeed lovely .
the lights are tastefully arranged , the stands recall medieval times and the gluehwein tastes surprisingly good . yet not as good as the tiny christmas market in friedrichshain , where it is positively delicious and the atmosphere is delightful .
all around the samariter church are charming wooden shacks , where merry people sell mouth-watering home-baked cookies , colorful soft toys , teapots and other gifts friends and relatives are likely to appreciate . laden with colorful paper bags , i lumber home and immediately crawl back under the covers . the next day , the gluehwein 's warming effect has been replaced with a searing headache and burning throat .
i sneeze and think i should have followed my instincts .
instead i drank liters of cheap red wine and sang carols in all languages at the top of my voice .
next year , i will know better ! but in the meantime , merry christmas ! author : anne thomas editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 17.12.2010 ivory coast violence escalates over power impasse großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the disputed election threatens to split ivory coast in two again the situation in ivory coast is deteriorating following an election leaving the country with two presidents and two governments .
as the nation slips toward chaos , the international community fears a return to war . ivory coast is bracing for more violent unrest following clashes on thursday in which at least 20 people were killed after security forces loyal to incumbent president laurent gbagbo fired on pro-alassane quattara supporters in abidjan .
the united states has in the meantime pulled all its non-emergency embassy staff out of the country .
the eu has given gbagbo until the end of the week to give up his claim to the presidency or face sanctions and possible un prosecution .
french president nicolas sarkozy said in brussels that eu leaders were unanimous in their call for gbagbo to leave office . earlier this week , eu foreign ministers approved a first round of sanctions , including an asset freeze and travel ban , on several other leading officials .
observers say that the key to power is control over the state television headquarters still held by gbagbo .
" state tv is crucial to gain and preserve power , " koné lanciné , general secretary of a broadcasting trade union , told deutsche welle .
" the fact that gbagbo still has some control in ivory coast is largely due to the fact that he controls the state-run media . "
on friday a number of independent newspapers were shut down to prevent them from reporting on the deadly clashes .
" rti -lrb- state broadcaster - ed . -rrb- has turned into a propaganda medium .
they 're disseminating hate in all its forms , ethnic hatred and racial hatred , " said lanciné .
the opposition challenger ouattara and incumbent gbagbo both claimed victory in the nov .
28 election and have both sworn themselves in as president .
ouattara was declared the winner by the country 's electoral commission after the run-off , with provisional results giving him a 10 percent lead over gbagbo .
the result in favor of ouattara has since been ratified by the united nations and recognized by the international community .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gbagbo and ouattara both claimed victory in the election despite ouattara 's support in the international community , gbagbo has defied international calls to cede power and has rejected the un 's ratification of the result .
the current situation raises fears of a return to the violent divisions which split the nation in two between the rebel-controlled north and government-controlled south during the civil war of 2002-2003 .
international concern heightens as crisis deepens the situation is already sending nervous ripples through the international community , especially in organizations responsible for funding development programs in the poverty-stricken nation .
the world bank and the african development bank have both questioned the " usefulness and effectiveness " of their aid programs to ivory coast given the breakdown in governance and have admitted to concerns that the turmoil in the country could drive many more ivorians further into poverty while causing instability and affecting economic prosperity in the wider west african sub-region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international organizations fear the unrest could spread " although the situation is troubling , the international community has reacted very quickly , " richard gowan , an africa expert with the european council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" the african union , ecowas and un have made it clear that the world is watching what happens next in cote d 'ivoire .
big firms with cocoa and mining interests in the country have done the same .
with luck , this level of scrutiny will deter both sides from escalating tensions into all-out violence . "
compromise seems impossible , even with un intervention dr. dirk khonert , the deputy director of the institute of african affairs at the german institute of global and area studies -lrb- giga -rrb- and a member of the eu election observation team in ivory coast , said that the main stumbling block to a solution was whether both rival candidates would be prepared to accept defeat .
" ouattara has a very strong international backing against gbagbo , " he told deutsche welle .
" thus , he derives his legitimacy not only internally but also externally by the backing of the international community .
it is difficult to imagine under these conditions that he and his followers would be inclined to accept a compromise on the question of the presidency . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un efforts to keep the peace may not prevent conflict it is unlikely that a compromise will satisfy either man as any deal may have to be brokered by the united nations which has given its support to ouattara , therefore alienating gbagbo 's team .
gbagbo has a long record of ignoring international pressure and appears to be ready to take the country to the brink of war to retain power .
he is also unlikely to consider the best option available to african union mediators which would be a government of national reconciliation , with ouattara as president and a significant input of gbagbo activists in the cabinet .
although the un security council has officially backed quattara as president , khonert said that security council intervention would not guarantee success .
" that would require a robust mandate , backed by considerable additional military engagement , which would be more than the 8,500 un troops currently present in ivory coast , and additional finance .
it is doubtful under the present conditions , whether the major parties involved would agree to this . " rival factions ready for a return to war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : concerns are high that a new civil war could divide the nation should the violent protests continue , ivory coast may find itself slipping closer to a new civil war .
ouatarra commands the support of the rebel-controlled north while gbagbo has the sworn allegiance of the army .
rebel leaders have already said that they will not wait long to take action should gbagbo refuse to stand down .
" in view of the history of violent conflicts in the ivory coast in the past decade , there is a high risk of a return to civil war , " khonert said .
" the most dangerous element is the unpredictable attitude of the militias of the presidential contenders ; the ' jeune patriots ' in abidjan or duekoué in the western region of the country . "
for richard gowan the worst-case scenario is a return to full-scale conflict .
" in that case , the un peacekeepers do n't have the forces to stop war and france , which has troops in the country , will want to avoid getting dragged into fighting .
diplomacy is the last best hope . " author : nick amies , ute schaeffer , ibrahim tounkara , dirk koepp -lrb- rm -rrb- editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

last week , an alien abduction prevented us from bringing you our predictions for match day 16 .
this week , probed , rested and ready , we 're hoping for a big week to make up for the dropped points . friday , dec .
17 moenchengladbach - hamburg friday night 's encounter features two of the bundesliga 's most out-of-form teams , each collecting just three points from their last five league matches .
hamburg coach armin veh appears out of answers to improve his team 's poor play , all but admitting as much after last week 's hammering at home to leverkusen .
gladbach 's michael frontzeck , meanwhile , might well need a win to stay in his job .
in that we 've said that before about the stern , bald man this season and he 's gotten the job done -lrb- witness the 4-0 win at cologne on match day 12 -rrb- , we like his chances .
prediction : 2-1 moenchengladbach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a dire start , schalke are finding their groove saturday , dec .
18 schalke - cologne the billy goats took all three points off of high-flying eintracht last week , but did so in the ugliest - and most fortunate - of circumstances .
they could have easily gone 3-0 down within the first 20 minutes , but did n't and got a goal from 19-year-old debutant christian clemens early in the second half .
then they held of for dear life .
schalke , for their part , have been bossing around the likes of bayern , benfica and mainz in recent weeks .
expect to find a broken cologne somewhere under an avalanche come saturday evening .
prediction : 4-1 schalke bremen - kaiserslautern the fight bremen put up against dortmund last week was as credible as any team 's has been over the last couple of months , and on another day they might well have eked out a draw rather than a 2-0 loss .
that good showing , coupled with kaiserslautern 's pitiful away form this season -lrb- two wins , six losses -rrb- , means werder should head into the break three points richer .
prediction : 2-0 bremen wolfsburg - hoffenheim the great steve mcclaren experiment in wolfsburg is beginning to look like a failure .
after spending big to get his englishman for the touchline -lrb- not to mention his brazilian , diego , for the number 10 shirt -rrb- , dieter hoeness might just have to head back to the drawing board come january .
word is edin dzeko will get his big-money move to manchester city , mark van bommel will be on his way in from bayern , and - providing hoffenheim lower the boom on saturday - mcclaren will be heading down to the jobcentre .
and so it will come to pass … prediction : 2-1 hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eintracht will have to show a lot of fight to take down dortmund frankfurt - dortmund dortmund 's effort in spain on wednesday night was valiant , but was n't good enough to get the win over sevilla they needed to stay in the europa league .
it could also prove one exertion too many ahead of a tough match at eintracht on the weekend .
coach michael skibbe 's men have hit a rough patch recently , losing three of four , but have had some tough luck along the way . we see that luck changing on saturday , helping produce a surprise result .
prediction : 1-0 frankfurt nuremberg - hanover just when you 're ready to write off nuremberg as rubbish , and hanover as merely fortunate , they go and prove otherwise .
it was nuremberg who were lucky last week , drawing at hoffenheim on the back of stingy defending and late , opportunistic behavior in front of goal .
and hanover ?
they 're just good .
the reds ' 2-1 win over stuttgart was a master class in counter-attacking football , led by didier ya konan .
it 's a shame that the ivorian will miss this week 's match , but his running partner from earlier this season , mohammed abdelloue , is back from his break in training to replace him , and that should be enough to tide the team over .
prediction : 1-0 hanover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz fans ought to have a good time in hamburg this weekend st. pauli - mainz the st. pauli pirate brigade 's roger is not looking so jolly these days - they 've lost six of their last eight , and most of those losses were n't even close -lrb- see : 3-0 defeats to schalke , bremen and bayern -rrb- .
fortunately for pauli , mainz is in a funk of its own , losing five of their last seven .
but all but one of those losses was close - unlucky even , some might say .
thomas tuchel and co. should have enough juice to satisfy their fans at the millerntor … before the happy out-of-towners head to the nearby red light district for round two .
prediction : 3-1 mainz sunday , dec .
5 leverkusen - freiburg by now leverkusen must be aware that it is one of the few sides in the bundesliga with even an outside chance to overhaul dortmund for the title .
11 points is a tall order , but do-able - so long as a couple of big ifs fall into place .
dortmund must start losing games -lrb- something they 've done just once so far -rrb- , and the pharmaceuticals must find the mental toughness to turn the games they 've been drawing up to now -lrb- a whopping five on the season -rrb- in to wins .
this project has to start now , against freiburg , and we reckon it will .
prediction : 3-2 leverkusen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labbadia is already off to a good start at suttgart stuttgart - bayern many a commentator has remarked in the days since bruno labbadia 's appointment as stuttgart 's new coach that he has come at an opportune time .
the journeyman coach had three matches to win over the squad and the club 's fans .
first , a gimme against a danish tomato can called odense -lrb- duly won , 5-1 -rrb- , then two dates with bayern munich - in the league on sunday , then in the cup on wednesday .
take two out of three , or even a fighting draw with bayern in the league , and he can go into the winter break on a high . we think he 'll manage it .
prediction : 2-1 stuttgart last week 's results : n / a total for the season : 66 three points for a correct score prediction two points for a correct margin prediction one point for a correct winner prediction author : matt hermann editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there are some , however , who think it enhances creativity . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
artists have n't abandoned search for psychedelic nirvana of inspiration do you think drugs can enhance artistic creativity ?
i know of no artwork made under drug influence that really is impressive and tells a good idea .
art is about ideas , drugs kill the ability to create them .
it 's funny how many great musicians failed more and more under the influence of drugs .
and if someone needs them to be creative or do art , he or she is maybe in the wrong profession .
the creativity should be naturally in you . - julius i do n't know , but i 've seen a number of movies and works of art where narcotics were clearly involved in their creation . - dairl yes , it is a medical fact that certain chemicals and enzymes make people more creative and active , no need to go far , look at caffeine as one .
people forget human beings are not only a soul but also a biological machine , a machine that is weak and sensitive to every element it interacts with , even if it is a substance or just a thought , weather conditions or social conditions , we react to everything around us and everything that is on the planet has impact on us in one way or another . - monie i have seen people paint under the influence of hashish and yes it definitely did enhance their creativity , the mind is free and hallucinating so it speaks for itself .
also look at movies , some were definitely written while under the influence . - johanna for some people , yes .
there is no given answer to the question .
people are different , and react differently when they ingest anything ... including food . - tracey to " open " a gate is not to reveal art .
if you can not find deep in your soul and mind the way to art , drugs are only a substitute not a tool that can enhance something . - adrian no , i have had artist friends try to get greater creativity from an altered state of mind , they get all excited and show their work , its just looks like art created by someone on drugs , not better quality . - jesse everyone is different , but it definitely does not work for me ...
i need clarity not cloudy .
as i say everyone is different , for some it may work .
i find when creating music high mostly i just jam endlessly or noodle if you will .
every day the same song is different , so one day it may sound great while the next disconnected and rambling .
for the listener it 's a 50/50 chance for a good show or recording . - randall depends on how creative the person is initially and how apt they are .
jimi hendrix was great guitar player because he practiced for many years and worked with other groups before he ever got famous . - erik i have no idea !
i do , however , know that substances , including alcohol , have taken the lives of many of our most talented creative minds ! - david compiled by stuart tiffen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but was it worth leaving bed ? the snow does n't seem to have stopped falling for days , who knows how many degrees below zero it is outside , and all i can think of is staying under the covers and hibernating the next six months away . even with the heat blasting out of my radiators , i feel like i 've already turned into an icicle .
when the phone rings and the invitation comes for a trip to the christmas market i know i 'd have to be seriously deranged to voluntarily stand around in the freezing cold , my hands wrapped around a cup of hot alcoholic red liquid , dressed up with a few spices and a piece of moldy orange .
and i know my hangover the next day is guaranteed to be worse than if i 'd knocked back 15 tequila slammers . my friend valiantly proposes the traditional snacks of backfisch and kartoffelpuffer .
like a lump of fried cod wedged into a tiny roll or fried potato pancakes with apple sauce will convince me to expose myself to the worst mother nature has to offer germany 's capital .
" bah humbug ! "
i hear him mumble . scrooge ! ?
who me ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mulled wine is an essential part of the christmas market visit no , i 've got nothing against christmas , just against the cold !
give me a carol concert any day , a cup of nice mulled wine in front of an open fire , a jar of cookies perhaps and i 'll be whistling " we wish you a merry christmas " all the way into february - as long as i do n't have to step out the door . yet somehow the words , " ok , if i really must , " escape my lips in a whisper . this is germany after all and that means everyone must " do " at least one christmas market a year , if not two or three .
the idea is to wrap yourself in about a thousand layers and drag your reluctant body to the town square . frozen travels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : snow arrived early in berlin this year but that 's easier said than done in berlin .
from my place in neukoelln is no town square in sight , let alone a father christmas , string of tinsel or a loudspeaker blaring " jingle bells . "
i 'm going to have to brave the cold and leave my neighborhood before finding a warming mug of gluehwein . stumbling because of my partially frozen legs , i get off the tram only to be nearly knocked down by the siberian wind .
trudging through the snow , i focus on the ferris wheel at the christmas market on alexanderplatz to keep myself from turning around .
its flashing lights are all i can see as even the television tower has disappeared into the fog . when i find him , my friend is already propping up a kiosk ; sipping on his mulled wine and watching excited kids skate round and round on the ice rink .
tourists sing " away in a manger " in japanese or " the little drummer boy " in french .
my friend 's enthusiasm increases as i order the first of many gluehweins and join in for the next round of carols . measuring markets - and mulled wine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all gifts are worth giving these markets are not only about song and wine .
you 're supposed to wander the rows of stalls and buy socks your granddad does n't need , a wooly hat your mum will never wear , an amusing game for your boyfriend that he 'll never play .
but it 's all so expensive and little of it is even " made in germany . " but holy shit shopping is just around the corner .
it 's a designer christmas market that aims to open the wallets of 30-somethings who already buy anything they really want and can afford the far-from-cheap prices .
but the t-shirts with quirky designs , the cookies and candles with berlin motifs , the hand-knitted caps , and whacky trousers made out of pullovers have all been created by local artists , who plug their wares with wit .
i order another gluehwein and buy a hat . it keeps me snug at my next stop : the self-proclaimed " most beautiful christmas market in berlin " near the historic thoroughfare unter den linden .
tucked between the opera house and the friedrichswerder church , the market is indeed lovely .
the lights are tastefully arranged , the stands recall medieval times and the gluehwein tastes surprisingly good . yet not as good as the tiny christmas market in friedrichshain , where it is positively delicious and the atmosphere is delightful .
all around the samariter church are charming wooden shacks , where merry people sell mouth-watering home-baked cookies , colorful soft toys , teapots and other gifts friends and relatives are likely to appreciate . laden with colorful paper bags , i lumber home and immediately crawl back under the covers . the next day , the gluehwein 's warming effect has been replaced with a searing headache and burning throat .
i sneeze and think i should have followed my instincts .
instead i drank liters of cheap red wine and sang carols in all languages at the top of my voice .
next year , i will know better ! but in the meantime , merry christmas ! author : anne thomas editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but with extreme snow across europe , father christmas might just not be able to get to customers in time this year . this year 's holiday shopping season was supposed to generate record online retail sales across europe - from food deliveries to presents .
british online retail association imrg estimates a rise in sales for december by 16 percent to 6.4 billion pounds -lrb- 7.5 billion euros -rrb- .
for 2010 , germany expects some 18.3 billion euros in online sales , up 18 percent .
no food deliveries to scotland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some british companies have stopped their trucks from travelling up to scotland however , with winter having hit europe early and heavily this year , some online retailers are now feeling the effects of snow-blocked roads .
especially hard hit are the british isles .
few tesco delivery trucks are able to make their rounds due to snowy streets .
on its mail-order website , the giant british food retailer is informing customers that it is currently unable to take any new orders in scotland , among other regions .
marks and spencer 's is also issuing regular weather updates on its homepage .
and like tesco , the food and clothing retailer has also temporarily suspended orders from scotland .
" i think customers will not want to risk things and will go to local shops instead of buying online , " natalie berg from the industry analyst planet retail told financial times deutschland .
snowed-in side streets in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plenty of presents are still en route across europe germany is also affected .
more than 80,000 mail carriers across germany have to walk across unplowed streets .
conditions differ considerably from community to community , " some communities are simply not clearing side streets this year , " anke baumann , a spokeswoman from german postal service deutsche post / dhl , told deutsche welle .
" that means our mail carriers have to walk back and forth through the snow carrying single parcels every time because they ca n't even push carts through the snow . "
deutsche post is promising customers in germany that parcels dropped off by noon on december 22 will be delivered by december 24 , christmas eve .
" that 's a promise we 're doing our best to fulfil , " said baumann who , in the same breath , warned : " it might just be impossible in individual cases to stick to it . "
deutsche post has expanded its operating hours to cope with the adverse weather conditions .
parcels ordered from online retailer amazon , for instance , will be delivered on the sunday before christmas - an exception in germany where business traditionally comes to a standstill on sundays .
nevertheless , amazon germany is advising customers to check their order status online because , as a company spokesperson told deutsche welle , " delays of one or two days are currently likely to occur . "
germany 's biggest mail-order clothing retailer otto declined to comment whether goods were being delivered on time .
twice as many parcels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more goods ordered online and christmas coming up : postmen hardly ever get a break this year the festive season traditionally sees a hike in the number of parcels delivered every year .
and this year is no exception , thanks largely to the growing popularity of purchasing merchandise online .
in the weeks leading up to christmas , the number of parcels delivered daily in germany this year has already increased from an average 2.5 million to about 5 million .
" and it 's going to be even more in the last week before christmas , " said baumann .
while germany has struggled with snowed-in side streets and temporarily closed airports to keep deliveries moving , britain does n't seem to be prepared for continuous frost and snow at all .
the country lacks snowploughs to clear roads .
in edinburgh , in fact , the army has been called in to help clear streets .
the country 's postal service , royal mail , is investing 20 billion pounds to be able to handle the christmas mail and parcels .
shop while you wait bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an exception for christmas : parcels are being delivered also on sundays in germany harsh weather conditions have generally been understood to spur online sales because customers can shop comfortably from home .
with the expected delays this year , however , experts say some customers might refrain from ordering online this shopping season .
current conditions demonstrate how sensitive online retail is to adverse weather conditions .
online shopping is still for now more popular in britain than it is in germany but it is becoming rapidly popular in europe 's largest economy .
some of the increase , interestingly , is attributed to smartphone users who like to use their downtime to shop online with their phones .
poinsettias still available online orders have also increased for fleurop .
germany 's largest flower mail-order service operates a network of 8,000 florists nationwide .
that dense network shortens distances between florists and customers , ensuring swift delivery .
but in extreme weather conditions , flights can be delayed or cancelled altogether .
occasionally , fleurop florists have to warn customers that a certain flower might not be deliverable on time .
but a spokesperson from fleurop told deutsche welle that , so far , it has not been forced to issue a warning for the popular christmas plant poinsettia – which is still readily available across germany .

but for consumers , the move will require getting used to longer personal account and bank identifier numbers . the european commission has said enough is enough .
the executive arm of the european union on thursday decided to set a deadline to accelerate its unified payment system , known as the single euro payment area -lrb- sepa -rrb- after voluntary efforts to introduce the scheme fell short of expectations . under a draft law expected to be approved by eu member states and the european parliament , national credit transfers and direct debit are to be phased out and replaced by sepa in 12 and 24 months respectively . off to a slow start sepa was introduced in 2008 to reduce the costs of payments , increase competition and make cross-border payments as easy as domestic ones .
a study for the commission estimated that sepa would save the eu economy 123 billion euros -lrb- $ 163 billion -rrb- over six years . but by october of this year , only 9.6 percent of eurozone credit transfers were made using the new system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks , including those in germany , have been slow to embrace sepa eu internal market commissioner michel barnier said the proposed law would fix " end-dates to make this pan-european system a reality , hopefully as early as 2012 . " the common payment area comprises more than 500 million citizens , including some 20 million businesses and european public authorities in the 27-member eu .
all of them with euro bank accounts can make and receive payments in euro under the same basic conditions , rights and obligations , regardless of their location . under the system , for instance , a resident of the netherlands working in belgium would receive his salary from his dutch bank as quickly as his belgian colleagues .
or a german family could pay all the utility bills for a holiday home in spain by simple direct debit from a german account . new account number twice as long but to enjoy such comfort in making payments , consumers in most countries will have to get used to writing or typing long bank account number and bank identifier codes . in germany , bank account holders will need to type in a 22-character international bank account number -lrb- iban -rrb- , consisting of numbers and letters .
in many cases , that is twice as long as the number many of them know by heart . the bank identifier code , known as bic , is 11 digits long , or three more than german codes .
the new bank identifier contains information that identifies the bank , the country and city in which it is located as well as the particular branch office . author : john blau editor : stuart tiffen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hundreds of road traffic accidents and grounded airplanes have made life difficult for people and police alike . heavy snowfall across much of germany has caused widespread traffic jams and hundreds of accidents on the roads , as well as severely interrupting air and rail travel .
the blizzard " petra " has largely abated but the german weather service , the dwd , is still issuing mild weather warnings nationwide , describing the overall situation on its website as " extremely wintery across the board . "
meanwhile , authorities are scrambling to clear thursday 's heavy snowfall from the country 's highways , runways and railways .
airport backlogs germany 's largest airport , in frankfurt , was operating " entirely without disruptions " early on friday , according to a spokesman for the hub .
nevertheless , roughly 100 flights have been cancelled , partly because of problems at other european airports , and also as a knock-on effect from the airport 's brief closure on thursday night .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the going has been unusually slow on the fast-moving autobahns stuttgart airport , where snow was still falling heavily on friday morning , reported delays caused by the intermittent closure of runways in order to clear away fresh snow .
several other airports were still battling to minimize delays on friday , and the german red cross has been taking camp beds , sleeping bags and blankets to german terminals , anticipating more stranded passengers .
almost 200 kilometers of traffic jams the greatest disruptions hit germany 's road network , especially the highways .
thousands of road traffic accidents were recorded by german police on thursday , mostly caused by the adverse weather ; three people lost their lives in the crashes .
the motorway network came close to gridlock during the worst of the snowfall , with authorities in the western state of north rhine-westphalia alone recording a total of 185 kilometers -lrb- 115 miles -rrb- of traffic jams at one point late on thursday evening .
one single queue , on the a3 highway near leverkusen , stretched back 40 kilometers .
parts of the country even banned heavy goods vehicles from taking to the highways overnight , after several got bogged down in the snow ; but that ban has since been lifted .
although the situation is now clearing , police have asked all road users to plan plenty of extra time for their journeys , and to adapt their driving style to suit the conditions .
meanwhile , the german rail service , deutsche bahn - also facing numerous weather-related delays and cancellations - has opened up a free customer service phone hotline for timetable inquiries .

schalke , stuttgart and leverkusen , meanwhile , were handed less formidable foes in europe . bayern fans will be wary of their team ’ s next test in the champions league as the club were handed a difficult tie with cup holders inter milan .
they will also be looking for revenge in the two-legged match , having lost to inter in last year ’ s final .
bayern sporting director christian nerlinger was quick to confirm the club was relishing a chance to reverse last year ’ s defeat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern fans hope this season 's encounter does n't end in tears " we still dwell a little on the lost final in madrid and now we have the opportunity with these two new matches against inter to put things right , " said nerlinger .
" it 's going to be difficult , but it could n't be more interesting for us . "
having won their qualifying group e , the bavarians avoided many of the tournament ’ s strongest sides - but didn ’ t miss inter , who finished a somewhat surprising second to tottenham hotspur in group a. bayern president karl-heinz rummenigge spoke for most when he called inter " without a doubt the most difficult we could have drawn . "
schalke luckier the growing spanish faction at gelsenkirchen side schalke will be looking forward to the club ’ s match against valencia .
with spaniards raul , jose manuel jurado and sergio escudero in the squad , along with christian metzelder and klaas jan huntelaar , who have experience playing in the spanish top flight , schalke can count on a good deal of insight into the playing style of the club from spain ’ s mediterranean coast .
“ it ’ s an attractive , and at the same time difficult draw , ” said schalke ’ s coach and general manager felix magath .
“ all the same , it ’ s our goal to get past valencia . ”
the two teams squared off in the group stage in the fall of 2007 , when valencia got the better of schalke , beating them in germany and drawing at home .
but as schalke defender benedikt hoewedes pointed out , just as schalke is a much different team to three years ago , so is valencia .
“ they ’ ve lost two very strong players in david silva and david villa , ” said hoewedes .

group h winners stuttgart face a rather tough test in benfica , the portuguese champions who dropped out of schalke ’ s group in the champions league .
leverkusen , who won group b , will fancy their chances against the relatively inexperienced ukrainian club metallist kharkov , second place finishers in group i. the europa league round of 32 fixtures are two-legged matches set for february 17th and 24th , or 15th and 22nd .

european leaders have agreed on a permanent rescue fund to cover countries in need of financial assistance .
german chancellor merkel hailed the summit as a success , but the measure has failed to reassure the markets . european leaders meeting in brussels have set up a permanent emergency fund to help debt-laden countries , and have agreed to rewrite some of the bloc 's rules in a bid to shore up the value of the euro .
" we will do everything to secure the financial stability of the euro as a whole , " german chancellor angela merkel said at a news conference after a european union summit .
she added that reform and stability will remain on the euro zone 's agenda next year as the bloc fights to secure the single currency and make its economies more competitive .
but the move was given an emphatic thumbs-down as the ratings agency moody 's downgraded ireland 's credit rating on friday by five notches , to baa1 , two notches above junk .
" while a downgrade had been anticipated , the severity of the downgrade is surprising , " dublin-based glas securities said .
spiraling debt eu leaders have spent most of 2010 trying to come up with successful measures to stop the region 's debt crisis spreading , but greece and ireland have already been forced to seek eu bailouts and portugal , spain , belgium and others are now in the spotlight .
on thursday leaders agreed on a change to the eu treaty to create the european stability mechanism -lrb- esm -rrb- – a permanent financial safety net of 750 billion euro from 2013 - that will help countries with liquidity problems and allow for debt restructuring of insolvent ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is determined to stabilize the euro eu leaders confirmed that private investors would be involved in the future euro zone rescue mechanism , a draft summit statement showed .
merkel said the fund would be sufficiently large .
" the more coherent economic policies are , the more we see by 2013 that states have made progress with a culture of stability , the lower the financial extent of the -lrb- rescue fund -rrb- will have to be , " she added .
germany lobbied hard for changes to the lisbon treaty and a pledge to pay out aid only if it 's " indispensable , " as leaders meeting in brussels on thursday agreed on the need to make a temporary trillion dollar rescue fund into a permanent one .
present dangers but market concerns are focused on whether the euro zone has sufficient immediate funds to come to the aid of the likes of portugal or spain , should they need a bailout next year .
" the new esm should safeguard the euro zone 's financial stability in the future .
however , it is to some extent window-dressing as it does not solve the current crisis , " said carsten brzeski , senior economist at ing bank .
the euro zone 's current fund - the european financial stability facility -lrb- efsf -rrb- - can borrow on the markets backed by euro zone government guarantees and has up to 440 billion euro to lend to governments cut off from market financing .
but many economists believe that even though only a small part of the efsf 's funds have been used to help ireland , it may turn out to be insufficient if more countries need help .
" european leaders failed to address the issue of debt sustainability and possible insolvency problems prior to 2013 .
debt restructuring , a common euro zone bond or an increase of the efsf ?
none of these issues have been addressed .
but they have to be , " brzeski said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markets reacted unvaforably to the eu summit " the preliminary outcome of the eu summit represents yet another missed opportunity by european policymakers to forcefully address investor concerns and calm markets in a more sustainable and pre-emptive manner , " said frank engels , economist at barclays capital .
underlining the need to reassure financial markets over fears that portugal and spain may be in need of bailouts soon , the european central bank also announced on thursday that it would double its capital to 10.76 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.3 billion -rrb- to cope with an increase in market volatility .
bonds kept off agenda discussion about the introduction of " e-bonds , " which would allow all european nations to borrow money at common rates , was kept off the agenda .
merkel has said that the common bond plan " would not rid europe of its weaknesses , it would simply transmit them across the board . "
germany is strongly opposed because e-bonds would effectively mean all 16 euro zone countries - or 17 when estonia joins the currency from jan .
1 , 2011 - financing a portion of their debt together and sharing a credit rating .
berlin , which is the benchmark issuer of debt in the euro zone and enjoys the lowest borrowing costs thanks to its economic strength and reliability , would have to surrender some of its credit to riskier euro states such as greece and ireland .
although germany is publicly opposed to the idea of euro-bonds , some in the euro zone back the idea .
" germany 's rejection of the expansion is another example of how euro zone governments do not agree on the best way forward to deal with this crisis , " said bnp paribas ' wattret .
" as a result , the measures taken have been piecemeal , unconvincing and reactive rather than pre-emptive .
this is going to have to change if confidence is to be restored in a lastingway , " he said .
leaders were meeting in their seventh summit of a busy year , as markets have grown increasingly wary that eu states might default on loans secured through individual government bonds .

the problem is becoming particularly acute in london , where 40 percent of all of the uk 's tb cases have been reported .
four in ten cases are reported in the capital , with the number of cases rising by nearly 50 percent since 1999 .
" it 's prevailing today in certain sections of the community that replicate conditions in victorian london , " tb expert alimuddin zumla of university college london told deutsche welle .
" most of the tb occurs in areas where there 's deprivation and poverty , and that 's where all the homeless are .
so we 've set up an endemic cycle of transmission . "
in all european countries , tuberculosis is largely concentrated in high-risk groups , such as migrants , refugees , homeless people , drug users , prisoners and hiv-infected people .
it is caused by a bacterial infection , usually of the lungs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some tb strains in south africa are resistant to all known tb drugs the increase in the number of tb cases in the uk has largely been among immigrant groups , although most were not new migrants .
among the cases of those born overseas , 85 percent had lived in the uk for two or more years and about half had lived in the country for five or more years .
the death toll from tb , which used to referred to as the " white plague " due to the pallor of those who had it , began to fall in london at the beginning of the 20th century thanks to improved living standards .
in the early 1960s , anti-tb drugs , better health services and bcg vaccinations continued to cut the number of cases .
the disease was thought to have been conquered by the early 1980s , but had something of a resurgence with the coming of hiv , which weakens the body 's immune system .
in london , as recently as 2000 , everyone thought the disease had been conquered , according to zumla .
but now among high-risk populations , tb rates are equivalent to those in africa .
drug resistant strains another alarming fact is that drug-resistant forms of the disease are beginning to be seen .
complying with the six-month regime of antibiotic treatment has meant that strains of tb have become resistant to drug treatments .
" people start feeling better after two months and stop taking their tablets and drug resistance occurs , " zumla said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in india , new treatment methods have helped cut the number of cases the situation is very serious in south africa , where strains have developed which are resistant to all known tb drugs .
in london , tb is showing up that is still treatable , but resistant to the most commonly used drugs .
zumla said the situation in london is reminiscent of multi-drug resistant tb outbreaks in prisons in the us in the 1990s .
they required a large financial investment to be brought under control .
he has called for a reconsideration of the delivery of tb services by britain 's national health service , standardized treatment and care methods and improvements in access to tb services .
he said because many with tb do not have permanent residences , it is difficult to get them to special clinics for treatment and ensure that they comply with drug regimens .
in new york , he said , a community-based model where health care workers take services to those affected has proven effective and should be adopted in the uk .
britain , one of the world 's major foreign-aid providers , is active in funding anti-tb programs overseas , but zumla says the country needs to look in its own backyard .
" we seem to neglect our own people here , " he said .

he 's apologized for his recent comments that gay fans should n't fornicate at the qatar world cup . fifa president sepp blatter has apologized for saying that gay fans should " refrain from sexual activity " if they go to the 2022 world cup in qatar .
homosexuality is illegal in qatar and blatter 's original comments provoked anger among gay rights groups .
" i regret my comment , i did n't want to hurt anyone .
we are against discrimination .
i apologize for that comment , " blatter told a press conference ahead of saturday 's club world cup .
" it was not my intention and it will never be my intention to go into any discrimination because this is exactly what we -lrb- fifa -rrb- are against , so therefore if somebody feels they have been hurt , then i regret and i present apologies for that , " he added .
gay rights activists have reacted furiously after the comments and called for the head of the world soccer governing body to either apologize or resign after his comments this week .
former nba basketball star john amaechi - who revealed he was gay in 2007 - led the attack , accusing the fifa president of " epic , archaic , neanderthal , ignorance . "
a reputation for gaffes " with little more than an afterthought fifa has endorsed the marginalization of lgbt -lsb- lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender -rsb- people around the world , " he wrote on his blog .
" anything less than a full reversal of his position is unacceptable , " amaechi added .
blatter 's remarks are just the latest example of the 74-year-old football chief putting his foot in his mouth .
he told women footballers in 2004 that the best way to make their sport more popular would be to wear " tighter shorts . "
earlier this year , he suggested that john terry 's alleged affair , which led to him being stripped of the england captaincy , would have been applauded in latin countries .
qatar was awarded the world cup this month ahead of australia , the united states , japan and south korea .

now there could be even more interest with a new , and yet old , attraction that provides insight into early baptisms . the hagia sophia in istanbul served as a church for a millennium and as a mosque for another 500 years .
today it is a museum that attracts three million visitors annually , with the number of tourists rising significantly in recent years .
the number is expected to rise still further after an addition to its attractions was unveiled this week .
as a grand finale to its year as european capital of culture , istanbul has unearthed the original baptismal font of the ancient church .
the huge marble basin sits in the courtyard of the baptistry , where it had been buried underground for centuries .
the font had not been seen since the ottoman conquest of constantinople in 1453 , the director of the hagia sophia museum haluk dursun told deutsche welle .
" we are the first to see this baptismal font since the days of sultan mehmet the conqueror , " dursun said .
" the ottomans initially used the baptistry to store oil for the lamps in the hagia sophia , which they had converted to a mosque . "
" the font was forgotten in some corner of the warehouse .
later , they converted the baptistry into a tomb for minor sultans and moved the basin out into the courtyard , which was then filled in with the surplus soil from the burials . "
because the font - thought by dursun to be older than the hagia sophia building - was buried under the earth , it remains in remarkably good condition .
its white marble has been rendered smooth and bright after a thorough cleaning .
older than church itself bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the religious site is one of the wonders of the medieval world the hagia sophia was inaugurated in the year 532 and the font may have belonged to one of the earlier churches on the site , built in the fourth and fifth centuries and destroyed by fire .
the font , the size of a small car , is believed to be the largest of its kind and is hewn from a single block of marble that is 3.3 meters -lrb- 11 feet -rrb- in length , 2.5 meters wide and 1.5 meters high .
visible steps on the inside walls of the basin reveal that it was probably used for mass baptisms dursun said .
" on its front side , the font was originally decorated with gem-encrusted crosses , " said dursun .
" those were unfortunately carried off by the knights of the fourth crusade when they pillaged the church in the 13th century .
at least we can still see their outlines here . "
not going anywhere despite the renewed interest , the font of the hagia sophia will not be moving to take pride of place at the hagia sophia museum .
it will instead be displayed to visitors in its present resting place in the courtyard , rather than in its original place under the dome of the baptistery .
among other reasons , there are fears that it would be impossible to move the font without it being destroyed .
" when the baptistery was converted into a tomb in 1639 , the baptismal font was lifted out of this window and set down in this place without it toppling over or breaking , " said dursun .
" this was an amazing feat in my opinion .
we would have trouble lifting it today . "
it is hoped that the font will be open to public viewing by easter .

bayer leverkusen drew against title holders atletico , with both german sides progressing . there was a dream start for new stuttgart head coach bruno labbadia , his players notching up five goals in their europa league soccer clash at home to danish club odense bk on thursday .
timo gebhart grabbed the first for stuttgart - who are already through to the next stage of the competition - on 20 minutes , scoring when his own header was chested back to his feet by odense defender anders moller christensen .
the second came in the form of a mistake from odense defender daniel hoegh , who accidentally stabbed a cross by gebhart into his own team 's net .
christian gentner was quickest to the ball after it hit defender thomas helveg , to make it 3-0 before pavel pogrebnyak made it 4-0 five minutes later .
that goal left spectators bewildered as the ball , which appeared to have been blocked by moller christensen , somehow found its way across the line through backspin .
although fortune smiled briefly on odense two minutes later , when john utaka maintained his composure in front of goal to net a neat consolation , there was more in stuttgart 's armory when ciprian marica fired in a goal in during extra time to make the final score 5-1 .
stuttgart go through as leaders of their group on 15 points , six points ahead of second place young boys from switzerland .
leverkusen draw , holders go out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atletico made every effort but were ultimately denied in other europa league football action , bayer leverkusen secured a 1-1 draw against europa league title holders atletico madrid on wednesday , sending the spanish side out of the competition .
atletico needed a win against leverkusen - who had already qualified - and needed other results to go in their favor to progress .
the spanish side did dominate the first half of the game with uruguayan striker diego forlan coming close with a half-volley just ahead of the break .
despite this , leverkusen soaked up the pressure and it was the germans who scored first - after a full 69 minutes - patrick helmes slotting the ball past atletico goalkeeper david de gea .
although atletico responded quickly , with a side-footed goal from fran merida just three minutes later , the spaniards were unable to take the lead .
in any case , a victory would not have helped atletico .
greek side aris salonika secured a win that ensured they finished in second place behind group leaders leverkusen .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 17.12.2010 european leaders seal deal on permanent crisis fund großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders were meeting for the seventh time this year european leaders have agreed on a permanent rescue fund to cover countries in need of financial assistance .
but at germany 's behest , aid will only be paid if it 's considered ' indispensable ' to the stability of the euro . european leaders have set up a permament emergency fund to help debt-laden countries , and have agreed to rewrite some of the bloc 's rules in a bid to shore up the value of the euro .
germany lobbied hard for changes to the lisbon treaty and a pledge to pay out aid only if it 's " indispensable , " as leaders meeting in brussels on thursday agreed on the need to make a temporary trillion dollar rescue fund into a permanent one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she was satisfied with the result " we stand ready to do whatever is required to ensure the stability of the eurozone , " said the president of the european council , herman van rompuy , after thursday 's meeting .
chancellor angela merkel expressed satisfaction with the results of the meeting , describing it as a " further step " towards greater coordination of economic policy within the eurozone .
" we will do whatever is required to secure the financial stability of the euro , " merkel told reporters at a friday press conference after the summit wrapped up .
french president nicolas sarkozy , a close ally of merkel 's on the issue of eurozone economic alignment , announced that he and merkel would be presenting new proposals on how to make the member countries work more closely .
" we have to tackle the competitiveness gaps within the 16 eurozone countries , " sarkozy said .
from the middle of 2013 , loans and guarantees similar to those offered to greece and ireland this year will only be offered if judged to be " indispensable " in saving the euro as a currency .
no spending cuts , no help that wording was added at the insistence of germany , likely to be the biggest individual contributor to future rescue funding .
berlin also stipulated that any bailout deal would require the recipient government to introduce a program of public spending cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank is to increase its capital base a two-sentence amendment was made to the eu 's lisbon treaty to permit the creation of the permanent rescue facility , the european stability mechanism .
article 125 of the 2007 lisbon treaty stated that the european union " shall not be liable for or assume the commitments of central governments , regional , local or other public authorities , other government bodies ... "
merkel pressed for changes to the article , because she said that a permanent mechanism might otherwise face a successful challenge in germany ’ s constitutional court .
leaders hope to have the necessary changes to the treaty ratified by the end of 2012 , with decisions on enacting rescue packages to be taken unanimously - effectively giving germany a veto .
it was also decided that there was no need to increase the existing rescue fund , which some analysts say would be insufficient in the case of future bailouts .
a number of countries led by germany put forward the argument that there was sufficient capacity in the present reserve . bonds kept off agenda discussion about the introduction of " e-bonds , " which would allow all european nations to borrow money at common rates , was kept off the agenda . merkel has said that the common bond plan " would not rid europe of its weaknesses , it would simply transmit them across the board . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal is next on the list of countries likely to need help underlining the need to reassure financial markets over fears that portugal and spain may be in need of bailouts soon , the european central bank also announced on thursday that it would double its capital to 10.76 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.3 billion -rrb- to cope with an increase in market volatility .
leaders were meeting in their seventh summit of a busy year , as markets have grown increasingly wary that eu states might default on loans secured through individual government bonds .
the eu and international monetary fund set up a eurozone safety net fund , worth an estimated 750 billion euros , in may .

a prime example is the euro bonds dispute . the two birth defects of the monetary union have come back to brutally haunt the eu : from the outset there was no common economic policy running parallel to the common currency .
hence huge imbalances were created in the eurozone .
and secondly , some of the member countries should never have been included in the euro in the first place .
greece is only the most flagrant , but not the only , example .
for a long time the eu has closed its eyes to these facts .
now they must deal with the consequences in a hurry .
in principle , the measures adopted are heading in the right direction .
governments are committing themselves to do everything necessary to protect the stability of the euro .
the starkness and vagueness of this statement is not a disadvantage .
obviously in theory there are limits to aid , but when numbers are mentioned , speculators are immediately encouraged to test the limits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph hasselbach , dw correspondent in brussels the permanent crisis mechanism is a sign of this mutual protection .
any doubts that the euro countries would abandon a country in an emergency , would cause a chain reaction .
this would break apart the monetary union , and if that happened , the germans especially would find it very expensive .
on the other hand , we can expect a lot of resentment if economic policy is adjusted belatedly in the euro countries .
some people might not perhaps realize what that means .
it is not just about fiscal consolidation , in itself difficult enough .
it 's also about sacred cows like national taxes , retirement policy and labor market legislation , to name only a few major areas .
this is about long national traditions , painstakingly developed social consensus .
while an alignment wo n't lead to a complete standardization , countries can not remain as they are now with differences as big as they are .
it is important that the benchmark for any harmonization is n't a so-called golden mean , but global competitiveness .
time is short .
the crisis is forcing the euro-zone countries to a level of integration that they would not have addressed voluntarily .
but that 's how it is in most cases .
if europe tries hard , it could actually emerge from the crisis stronger .

the document takes swiss precision to a whole new level . those swiss bankers , always showing up for work in faded t-shirts and stone-washed jeans .
well , no more .
the sartorially challenged , or simply clueless , finance professional now has a new dress code bible that gives definitive answers to all those pesky grooming and dressing issues .
swiss banking giant ubs this week release its new guidelines that leave little to chance , covering employees ' appearance pretty much from head to toe , from hair dyes -lrb- a no-no for men -rrb- to socks -lrb- leave the mickey mouse-themed ones at home -rrb- .
the rules are exhaustive , ranging from fairly obvious prohibitions against tattoos , piercings and ankle chains -lrb- who wears those anymore ? -rrb- , to more esoteric guidelines , such as the one stating that ties that do not match the " morphology of the face " should not be worn .
it 's all about " irreproachable behavior , " the dress code says , which " implies having an impeccable presentation . "
ubs has been trying to rebuild its reputation since enduring record losses during the financial crisis and getting a multi-billion euro bailout .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' fun ' socks are a fashion faux pas at swiss bank ubs if its employees are exquisitely groomed automatons , the thinking appears to be , the profit graph will once again start trending upward .
the bank said the suggestions are only meant for a small number of employees in five pilot branches in switzerland , but could be expanded .
a ubs spokesman said staff had reacted positively to the rules .
she 's got the look ?
" well , appearance is of course important for every professional sector , " andreas koehler , founder of the germany-based company the image consultants , told deutsche welle .
" it has been since the middle ages and before . "
he says he can understand a company wanting to keep up its image , since perception is often king .
and he points to the us civil war , where if you did n't have the right kind of beard , you could be suspected of being with the enemy , and shot .
" but of course , that a company makes such detailed suggestions for its dress code is a little embarrassing , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ubs can live with this look - just do n't let those roots show women need to take it easy on the perfume , and ideally apply it after a hot shower , and then only after applying body lotion while the skin 's pores are open . they should also avoid wearing " flashy " jewelry or skirts that are " too tight behind . "
underwear must not be " visible against clothing or spilling out of clothing . "
rather , they should be " skin-colored under white shirts . "
men need to trim their fingernails to 1.5 millimeters , and only wear a pair of lace-up shoes on alternate days , so as to allow the leather to breathe and recuperate .
and for god 's sake , " do not wash , nor ever iron your shirts yourself . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 17.12.2010 strong youth and sound finances drive bundesliga 's success in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 04 is not alone in excelling in europe this season the consistently strong performances of bundesliga clubs in europe is likely to pay off with germany getting another champions league place - thanks to the league 's finances , youth program and ability to keep its stars . a glance at the pairings in the knock-out rounds of the champions league and europa league make for some satisfied reading for fans of the bundesliga . bayern munich dominated group e in the champions league , losing just once in six games to qualify with a game to spare .
schalke 04 , who have endured some tough times domestically this season , also topped their group ahead of more fancied teams such as benfica and lyon .
" bayern munich and schalke have played a lot better in the champions league this season than they have in the bundesliga , " freelance soccer writer and sometime sportschau.de correspondent marcus bark told deutsche welle .
" schalke coach felix magath has even gone as far as to say that his team takes the champions league more seriously , although it 's hard to believe that this is true . "
out of the three german teams who qualified for this season 's champions league , only werder bremen failed to make it out of the group stage .
" for the past few seasons , two out of the three german teams have gone relatively far in the champions league , " bark said .
" even wolfsburg who dropped out of the champions league at the group stage last year , went on to reach the quarter-finals of the europa league . "
in this season 's europa league , bayer leverkusen and vfb stuttgart have mirrored the success of bayern and schalke by qualifying as the winners of their groups , with only borussia dortmund - somewhat surprisingly considering their domestic form - failing to reach the last 32 .
close followers of the bundesliga may not be that surprised to see such a strong german showing .
this season is hardly a one-off .
consistency breeds consistency for germans in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern romped to last year 's final before losing to inter both bayern and stuttgart made it into the knock-out rounds of the champions league last season - with the bavarian giants , who also made it to the quarter-finals the year before , romping all the way to the final .
the 2009 europa league finalists werder bremen , wolfsburg and hamburg all made it to the quarter-finals of the europa league last season with hamburg progressing to the semi-finals - as they did the year before - before defeat to fulham ended their dream of competing for the title in their own stadium .
german teams have been putting in consistently strong performances in european competition for over a decade now , with at least one of the bundesliga 's six allotted representatives progressing to the quarter-finals or further in both the champions and europa leagues over the past five years .
exposure to foreign opposition honing german skills marcus bark believes that the german national team ’ s long history of success helps to breed players ready for the styles and challenges of foreign opponents , and that this season 's champions league is a case in point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young but experienced : kroos , mueller and badstuber " i think german teams have done so well in europe this season because a lot of the young german stars in these teams performed very well at the world cup , " he said .
" if you look at bayern 's team with lahm , schweinsteiger , kroos , mueller and badstuber , they all have international experience and confidence at that level . "
joerg jakob , deputy editor-in-chief at kicker magazine , agrees that foreign experience helps when attempting to win european trophies but believes that the bundesliga 's recent success is based more on the rise of its young stars . " of course you learn from playing at the world cup or by facing european competition but this is not new for german players and teams , " jakob told deutsche welle .
one of the reasons german teams are doing so well in europe , says jakob , is because of the youth development .
“ bundesliga clubs have to have education and training facilities for young people under dfb rules they introduced in 2000 , so now we have better and more talented youngsters who play a more modern style .
we also have young , modern coaches to guide them . " cash flow essential to maintaining bundesliga 's success according to marcus bark , the bundesliga 's comparatively stable financial situation - in relation to other debt-ridden leagues - is also aiding german teams . " in other leagues , the best players are sold off , making only a few clubs capable of fielding good teams in europe , " he said .
" in germany , the clubs pay well and on time .
they 're very well run and the money is used to develop talent and to hold onto players - again , look at lahm and schweinstieger at bayern ; they ’ ve been approached by europe 's biggest clubs but have chosen to stay . " if money helps bundesliga teams produce european stars of the future and keep at least some of them from the clutches of the leading clubs in the continent ’ s other leagues , then the bundesliga will need a steady stream of revenue if germany 's record in europe is to continue to improve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's loss could be germany 's champions league gain marcus bark and joerg jakob do n't see this as being a problem , even less so in the coming years as the bundesliga looks ready to usurp the underperforming italian league to snatch a fourth champions league place under uefa 's coefficient system which takes into account the results of a particular nation 's clubs in european competitions over the preceding five years . " the bundesliga attracts money , it generates money , and it keeps money , " bark said .
" buying in stars like robben , ribery , raul and huntelaar , the league has become more attractive which brings in bigger crowds .
the reasonable ticket prices also help ; a ticket on average for a bundesliga game is around 20 euros -lrb- $ 26 -rrb- where as in england you can pay up to 120 euros at some clubs .
most clubs have little or no debt so they 're making profits for reinvestment . " " if you ’ re a player on the transfer market , you want to be playing for a champions league team , " said jakob .
" if germany has an extra team in the competition then this means someone else will be able to attract players , agents and sponsors .
of course money ’ s involved , but it ’ s the glamour and prestige of the champions league which will help you keep your youngsters and your stars , meaning you 'll remain competitive .

deutsche welle talked with him about the reasons for this surprising conclusion . andrew mack is the director of the human security report project -lrb- hsrp -rrb- at canada 's simon fraser university and a faculty member of the university 's new school for international studies .
from 1998 to 2001 he was director of the strategic planning office in the executive office of un secretary-general kofi annan .
he has taught at several universities , including the london school of economics , and has published in numerous international newspapers and magazines .
deutsche welle : a lot of people 's perception is that the world is getting more dangerous and violent .
your report says otherwise .
are we being hoodwinked by the media ?
andrew mack : there are two reasons why people believe that the world is becoming more dangerous even though there has been a big decline in the number and deadliness of wars since the end of the cold war 20 years ago . first , media reporting tends to be driven by what might be called the , " if it bleeds , it leads " imperative . this means in practice that wars that start almost always get reported , while those that quietly peter out tend to be ignored .
second , no international organization collects data on the number or deadliness of wars .
so while we have millennium development goals that track national , global and regional trends in progress in health , education , economic and environmental issues , there are no millennium security goals . your report paints a mixed picture of the threat presented by islamist militants .
one the one hand , 4 of the 5 deadliest conflicts are islamist in nature ; on the other , support for al-qaeda in the muslim world is declining .
is progress being made in this area , and if so , in what sense ?
there are reasons for both real concern and cautious optimism here . four of the world 's deadliest conflicts - iraq , afghanistan , pakistan and somalia - are indeed associated with islamist political violence . but one of the reasons for the high death tolls is that they also involve , to a greater or lesser degree , major powers - primarily the us .
this is significant because , since the end of world war ii , the deadliest conflicts have almost always been associated with direct or indirect involvement by one of more of the major powers .
there is room for cautious optimism in that radical islamist groups like al-qaeda have been losing support among muslims throughout the islamic world for some five years .
this is n't surprising .
their extremist ideology is rejected by the overwhelming majority of muslims - including most of those who are strongly opposed to us policies in iraq , afghanistan and pakistan .
the harshly repressive policies that radical islamists have sought to impose wherever they have gained power have been deeply resented .
and the targets of islamist terror are mostly muslim civilians . the decline in public support means that the radicals have little chance of winning popular revolutions .
on the other hand no radical islamist group has sufficiently powerful conventional military forces to defeat the armed forces of the states that they oppose .
what sort of benefits do you expect from a study that quantifies conflict in the way yours does ?
governments are increasingly demanding that their foreign and security policies be " evidence-based . "
providing hard data each year on the number and deadliness of armed conflicts at the global regional and national levels helps governments - and international agencies like the un - determine whether their policies are having an impact or not .
for example , since the end of the cold war the international community has dramatically increased the resources it puts into preventing wars , trying to stop those that ca n't be prevented , and preventing wars that have ended from starting again .
as the level of what might be called " international activism " has gone up the number of wars has come down . indeed in 2008 there were 78 percent fewer high-intensity wars - those that kill 1,000 or more people year - than in 1988 .
please look into your crystal ball : will the world be a safer or more perilous place in 2020 ?
if current trends continue - they may not - there are reasonable grounds for believing that the world will be a safer place . first , other things being equal , we expect the past half-century trend of rising incomes in most developing countries to continue .
in 2010 every region in the developing world is growing strongly .
this is important because the most robust and important finding to emerge from recent quantitative research is that as national incomes rise , the risk of war declines .
its not income per se that matters , but rather that when national incomes rise governments have more resources to buy off grievances that could lead to war , to coopt political opponents and to win wars that ca n't be prevented . second , the end of the cold war has removed a major cause of armed conflicts from the international system , while the dramatic increase in economic interdependence and in the number of democracies in the world over the past four decades has reduced the risk of international wars dramatically . in the 1950s there were six wars a year on average ; in the new millennium there has been less than one .
in other words the factors that have been driving war numbers down are likely to continue - or strengthen .
and there are no obvious adverse counter-trends that threaten to increase the risk of war .
in the longer term the instabilities associated with climate change may cause major problems , but these are unlikely to become manifest in the next 10 years .

big hurdles remain but many are confident about electrics ' future . electric cars have had many false dawns over the years , but their proponents in the motor industry say now their time has come .
this december , two mass-market electric vehicles are hitting dealerships in selected markets around the world .
the general motors volt and nissan 's leaf are both aimed at delivering emissions-free driving at affordable prices .
motor trend magazine has called the chevy volt a " breakthrough " and a " game changer " and named it its 2011 car of the year .
a retiree in new jersey became the owner of the first volt , a gas-electric hybrid , to be sold to the public on december 15 , while nissan rolled out its leaf in a handful of us cities earlier this month .
both are scheduled for sale in europe in 2011 .
the developments have some experts saying that a major change is underway in the automobile industry .
general motors ' volt relies on a battery for the first 40 miles or 60 kilometers , after which a gas-powered engine kicks in to recharge the battery , which extends the range of the sedan by another 300 miles , or 480 kilometers .
in contrast , the leaf is all-electric with a range of around 100 miles , and just like early gas-powered vehicles , it might be difficult to find fuel nearby .
however , unlike the car 's predecessors , the leaf has a gps system .
press a small blue button and it will search for the nearest charging station .

but others say zero-emission vehicles will gain traction in the long term .

even with a federal tax credit , the volt will set consumers back $ 33,500 -lrb- 25,155 euros -rrb- .
nissan 's leaf will not collide with bank accounts with quite the same ferocity .
tax incentives from washington and the state of california will bring the price of the four-door automobile down to just over $ 20,000 , about the same price as a gas-powered sedan .
still , that 's almost where the similarities with its gasoline-dependent brethren end .
starting up the leaf is a quiet process – there 's no traditional cranking sound of a starter .
there 's also no internal combustion engine .
instead , the car relies on lithium-ion batteries .
when it 's running , it emits a faint hum which has been added to alert pedestrians that a car is nearby .
nissan has spent $ 5 billion developing electric cars and ghosn insists this is a safe bet .
he says electric car sales will rise if oil prices go up and carbon dioxide restrictions get tougher .
event without new co2 rules , the international energy agency is promoting electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids as a way to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions , although the amount of the reduction depends on the electricity source .
while the cars themselves do n't emit greenhouse gases , the electricity plants where they get their energy from may .
" as a us average , a battery electric car we think would reduce greenhouse gas emission by about 40 percent compared to a conventional vehicle , " said timothy lipman of the university of california , berkeley .
" in california , because our grid is cleaner , it would probably be more like 60 percent reduction . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charging issues will have to be solved before electrics gain a wide following out of juice charging is a real issue when it comes to the acceptance or rejection of electrics with the wider population .
according to a recent report by the national research council , the current us electric grid could provide enough electricity to power 80 percent of today 's cars , if they were electric and provided that they were charged during off-peak hours , such as overnight .
however , some are looking at a different approach .
a company called " a better place " plans on offering electric car battery swapping pans , similar to mobile phone plans , in which monthly payments are based on the amounts of swapping and charging drivers do .
but some , such as berkeley 's lipman , doubt that such programs will be universally viable .
he said it might make sense to run a battery swapping operation in europe , where gas prices are relatively high , but in the us the system would probably not be able to compete with the relatively low price of gas . another battery-related worry has to do with a core component : lithium .
media reports say that bolivia , which has almost half the world supply of lithium , is considering tighter control of its lithium reserves .
other rare-earth resources , such as neodymium iron boron , could also pose problems .
china has the biggest deposits of this material has begun withholding it from the world market , pushing up its price .
future outlook government officials are already looking for substitutes for these materials .
one us government-funded research project is working on making electric cars easily affordable by radically redesigning their batteries , based on those used in hearing aids .
" we think that has the very distinct possibility of giving cars that now have a hundred mile range , a five hundred mile range at one third of the cost , " said us energy secretary david chu .
even if this technological breakthrough is far off on the horizon , lipman of berkeley 's transportation sustainability research center , says electric cars have a bright future .
he says they will eventually be embraced by more than just environmentalists .
" once people drive these cars , they see how they perform , how easy they are to operate , how quiet they are , the excellent acceleration and so forth , " he said .
" a lot of people are going to like these cars , not because they 're green , but because they 're better cars . "

the drastic downgrade hardly shows confidence in ongoing eu efforts to safeguard the euro at the brussels summit . ratings agency moody 's on friday dropped its rating on irish sovereign debt by five notches , suggesting it was less than enthused by thursday 's eu agreement on a permanent stability fund to protect debt-laden single currency users .
moody 's dropped ireland down five spots , from the third-highest available grade , aa2 , to baa1 , a risk level described as " lower medium grade . "
however , the agency added that this rating represented a " negative " outlook for a country , which would ordinarily have a very high credit rating .
moody 's said its decision was based " on the risk that the irish government 's financial strength could decline further if economic growth were to be weaker than currently projected or the costs of stabilizing the banking system turn out to be higher than currently forecast . "
european leaders gathered at a summit in brussels were seeking to shore up debt-laden eurozone countries , and the single european currency more generally ; but the measures agreed on thursday evidently did little to impress moody 's .
the establishment of a permanent rescue mechanism for eurozone members was designed , at least in part , to dispel concerns in the markets that europe may never repay its debts .
last , but not least bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen 's plan for recovery is unlikely to salvage his prime ministerial post " moody 's has this morning become the third of the three major ratings agencies to downgrade irish sovereign debt in the past four weeks , " the chief economist for dublin-based goodbody stockbroker 's , dermot o 'leary said .
" it has , however , outdone the other two with the scale of the downgrade . "
moody 's move follows similar , but smaller , reductions by fellow credit agencies , standard and poor 's and fitch .
the change means that investors will now demand a higher return in exchange for purchasing government bonds , effectively upping the price of existing and future loans for the irish government .
ireland recently became the second eurozone country , after greece , to seek emergency loans worth roughly 85 billion euros -lrb- $ 113 billion -rrb- from the european union and the international monetary fund .
the country 's rising national debt and enormous 2010 budget deficit - boosted by a government bailout of the country 's biggest moneylender , anglo irish bank - forced the government in dublin to call for help .
the financial turmoil has brought prime minister brian cowen 's coalition government to its knees , a snap election is expected early next year .

there are some , however , who think it enhances creativity . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
artists have n't abandoned search for psychedelic nirvana of inspiration do you think drugs can enhance artistic creativity ?
i know of no artwork made under drug influence that really is impressive and tells a good idea .
art is about ideas , drugs kill the ability to create them .
it 's funny how many great musicians failed more and more under the influence of drugs .
and if someone needs them to be creative or do art , he or she is maybe in the wrong profession .
the creativity should be naturally in you . - julius i do n't know , but i 've seen a number of movies and works of art where narcotics were clearly involved in their creation . - dairl yes , it is a medical fact that certain chemicals and enzymes make people more creative and active , no need to go far , look at caffeine as one .
people forget human beings are not only a soul but also a biological machine , a machine that is weak and sensitive to every element it interacts with , even if it is a substance or just a thought , weather conditions or social conditions , we react to everything around us and everything that is on the planet has impact on us in one way or another . - monie i have seen people paint under the influence of hashish and yes it definitely did enhance their creativity , the mind is free and hallucinating so it speaks for itself .
also look at movies , some were definitely written while under the influence . - johanna for some people , yes .
there is no given answer to the question .
people are different , and react differently when they ingest anything ... including food . - tracey to " open " a gate is not to reveal art .
if you can not find deep in your soul and mind the way to art , drugs are only a substitute not a tool that can enhance something . - adrian no , i have had artist friends try to get greater creativity from an altered state of mind , they get all excited and show their work , its just looks like art created by someone on drugs , not better quality . - jesse everyone is different , but it definitely does not work for me ...
i need clarity not cloudy .
as i say everyone is different , for some it may work .
i find when creating music high mostly i just jam endlessly or noodle if you will .
every day the same song is different , so one day it may sound great while the next disconnected and rambling .
for the listener it 's a 50/50 chance for a good show or recording . - randall depends on how creative the person is initially and how apt they are .
jimi hendrix was great guitar player because he practiced for many years and worked with other groups before he ever got famous . - erik i have no idea !
i do , however , know that substances , including alcohol , have taken the lives of many of our most talented creative minds ! - david compiled by stuart tiffen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

big hurdles remain but many are confident about electrics ' future . electric cars have had many false dawns over the years , but their proponents in the motor industry say now their time has come .
this december , two mass-market electric vehicles are hitting dealerships in selected markets around the world .
the general motors volt and nissan 's leaf are both aimed at delivering emissions-free driving at affordable prices .
motor trend magazine has called the chevy volt a " breakthrough " and a " game changer " and named it its 2011 car of the year .
a retiree in new jersey became the owner of the first volt , a gas-electric hybrid , to be sold to the public on december 15 , while nissan rolled out its leaf in a handful of us cities earlier this month .
both are scheduled for sale in europe in 2011 .
the developments have some experts saying that a major change is underway in the automobile industry .
general motors ' volt relies on a battery for the first 40 miles or 60 kilometers , after which a gas-powered engine kicks in to recharge the battery , which extends the range of the sedan by another 300 miles , or 480 kilometers .
in contrast , the leaf is all-electric with a range of around 100 miles , and just like early gas-powered vehicles , it might be difficult to find fuel nearby .
however , unlike the car 's predecessors , the leaf has a gps system .
press a small blue button and it will search for the nearest charging station .
still , many fear that ' range anxiety ' will put drivers off the all-electrics and that electric cars will remain a niche product .
but others say zero-emission vehicles will gain traction in the long term .

hundreds of road traffic accidents and grounded airplanes have made life difficult for people and police alike . heavy snowfall across much of germany has caused widespread traffic jams and hundreds of accidents on the roads , as well as severely interrupting air and rail travel .
the blizzard " petra " has largely abated but the german weather service , the dwd , is still issuing mild weather warnings nationwide , describing the overall situation on its website as " extremely wintery across the board . "
meanwhile , authorities are scrambling to clear thursday 's heavy snowfall from the country 's highways , runways and railways .
airport backlogs germany 's largest airport , in frankfurt , was operating " entirely without disruptions " early on friday , according to a spokesman for the hub .
nevertheless , roughly 100 flights have been cancelled , partly because of problems at other european airports , and also as a knock-on effect from the airport 's brief closure on thursday night .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the going has been unusually slow on the fast-moving autobahns stuttgart airport , where snow was still falling heavily on friday morning , reported delays caused by the intermittent closure of runways in order to clear away fresh snow .
several other airports were still battling to minimize delays on friday , and the german red cross has been taking camp beds , sleeping bags and blankets to german terminals , anticipating more stranded passengers .
almost 200 kilometers of traffic jams the greatest disruptions hit germany 's road network , especially the highways .
thousands of road traffic accidents were recorded by german police on thursday , mostly caused by the adverse weather ; three people lost their lives in the crashes .
the motorway network came close to gridlock during the worst of the snowfall , with authorities in the western state of north rhine-westphalia alone recording a total of 185 kilometers -lrb- 115 miles -rrb- of traffic jams at one point late on thursday evening .
one single queue , on the a3 highway near leverkusen , stretched back 40 kilometers .
parts of the country even banned heavy goods vehicles from taking to the highways overnight , after several got bogged down in the snow ; but that ban has since been lifted .
although the situation is now clearing , police have asked all road users to plan plenty of extra time for their journeys , and to adapt their driving style to suit the conditions .
meanwhile , the german rail service , deutsche bahn - also facing numerous weather-related delays and cancellations - has opened up a free customer service phone hotline for timetable inquiries .

but was it worth leaving bed ? the snow does n't seem to have stopped falling for days , who knows how many degrees below zero it is outside , and all i can think of is staying under the covers and hibernating the next six months away . even with the heat blasting out of my radiators , i feel like i 've already turned into an icicle .
when the phone rings and the invitation comes for a trip to the christmas market i know i 'd have to be seriously deranged to voluntarily stand around in the freezing cold , my hands wrapped around a cup of hot alcoholic red liquid , dressed up with a few spices and a piece of moldy orange .
and i know my hangover the next day is guaranteed to be worse than if i 'd knocked back 15 tequila slammers . my friend valiantly proposes the traditional snacks of backfisch and kartoffelpuffer .
like a lump of fried cod wedged into a tiny roll or fried potato pancakes with apple sauce will convince me to expose myself to the worst mother nature has to offer germany 's capital .
" bah humbug ! "
i hear him mumble . scrooge ! ?
who me ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mulled wine is an essential part of the christmas market visit no , i 've got nothing against christmas , just against the cold !
give me a carol concert any day , a cup of nice mulled wine in front of an open fire , a jar of cookies perhaps and i 'll be whistling " we wish you a merry christmas " all the way into february - as long as i do n't have to step out the door . yet somehow the words , " ok , if i really must , " escape my lips in a whisper . this is germany after all and that means everyone must " do " at least one christmas market a year , if not two or three .
the idea is to wrap yourself in about a thousand layers and drag your reluctant body to the town square . frozen travels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : snow arrived early in berlin this year but that 's easier said than done in berlin .
from my place in neukoelln is no town square in sight , let alone a father christmas , string of tinsel or a loudspeaker blaring " jingle bells . "
i 'm going to have to brave the cold and leave my neighborhood before finding a warming mug of gluehwein . stumbling because of my partially frozen legs , i get off the tram only to be nearly knocked down by the siberian wind .
trudging through the snow , i focus on the ferris wheel at the christmas market on alexanderplatz to keep myself from turning around .
its flashing lights are all i can see as even the television tower has disappeared into the fog . when i find him , my friend is already propping up a kiosk ; sipping on his mulled wine and watching excited kids skate round and round on the ice rink .
tourists sing " away in a manger " in japanese or " the little drummer boy " in french .
my friend 's enthusiasm increases as i order the first of many gluehweins and join in for the next round of carols . measuring markets - and mulled wine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all gifts are worth giving these markets are not only about song and wine .
you 're supposed to wander the rows of stalls and buy socks your granddad does n't need , a wooly hat your mum will never wear , an amusing game for your boyfriend that he 'll never play .
but it 's all so expensive and little of it is even " made in germany . " but holy shit shopping is just around the corner .
it 's a designer christmas market that aims to open the wallets of 30-somethings who already buy anything they really want and can afford the far-from-cheap prices .
but the t-shirts with quirky designs , the cookies and candles with berlin motifs , the hand-knitted caps , and whacky trousers made out of pullovers have all been created by local artists , who plug their wares with wit .
i order another gluehwein and buy a hat . it keeps me snug at my next stop : the self-proclaimed " most beautiful christmas market in berlin " near the historic thoroughfare unter den linden .
tucked between the opera house and the friedrichswerder church , the market is indeed lovely .
the lights are tastefully arranged , the stands recall medieval times and the gluehwein tastes surprisingly good . yet not as good as the tiny christmas market in friedrichshain , where it is positively delicious and the atmosphere is delightful .
all around the samariter church are charming wooden shacks , where merry people sell mouth-watering home-baked cookies , colorful soft toys , teapots and other gifts friends and relatives are likely to appreciate . laden with colorful paper bags , i lumber home and immediately crawl back under the covers . the next day , the gluehwein 's warming effect has been replaced with a searing headache and burning throat .
i sneeze and think i should have followed my instincts .
instead i drank liters of cheap red wine and sang carols in all languages at the top of my voice .
next year , i will know better ! but in the meantime , merry christmas ! author : anne thomas editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 17.12.2010 ivory coast violence escalates over power impasse großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the disputed election threatens to split ivory coast in two again the situation in ivory coast is deteriorating following an election leaving the country with two presidents and two governments .
as the nation slips toward chaos , the international community fears a return to war . ivory coast is bracing for more violent unrest following clashes on thursday in which at least 20 people were killed after security forces loyal to incumbent president laurent gbagbo fired on pro-alassane quattara supporters in abidjan .
the united states has in the meantime pulled all its non-emergency embassy staff out of the country .
the eu has given gbagbo until the end of the week to give up his claim to the presidency or face sanctions and possible un prosecution .
french president nicolas sarkozy said in brussels that eu leaders were unanimous in their call for gbagbo to leave office . earlier this week , eu foreign ministers approved a first round of sanctions , including an asset freeze and travel ban , on several other leading officials .
observers say that the key to power is control over the state television headquarters still held by gbagbo .
" state tv is crucial to gain and preserve power , " koné lanciné , general secretary of a broadcasting trade union , told deutsche welle .
" the fact that gbagbo still has some control in ivory coast is largely due to the fact that he controls the state-run media . "
on friday a number of independent newspapers were shut down to prevent them from reporting on the deadly clashes .
" rti -lrb- state broadcaster - ed . -rrb- has turned into a propaganda medium .
they 're disseminating hate in all its forms , ethnic hatred and racial hatred , " said lanciné .
the opposition challenger ouattara and incumbent gbagbo both claimed victory in the nov .
28 election and have both sworn themselves in as president .
ouattara was declared the winner by the country 's electoral commission after the run-off , with provisional results giving him a 10 percent lead over gbagbo .
the result in favor of ouattara has since been ratified by the united nations and recognized by the international community .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gbagbo and ouattara both claimed victory in the election despite ouattara 's support in the international community , gbagbo has defied international calls to cede power and has rejected the un 's ratification of the result .
the current situation raises fears of a return to the violent divisions which split the nation in two between the rebel-controlled north and government-controlled south during the civil war of 2002-2003 .
international concern heightens as crisis deepens the situation is already sending nervous ripples through the international community , especially in organizations responsible for funding development programs in the poverty-stricken nation .
the world bank and the african development bank have both questioned the " usefulness and effectiveness " of their aid programs to ivory coast given the breakdown in governance and have admitted to concerns that the turmoil in the country could drive many more ivorians further into poverty while causing instability and affecting economic prosperity in the wider west african sub-region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international organizations fear the unrest could spread " although the situation is troubling , the international community has reacted very quickly , " richard gowan , an africa expert with the european council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" the african union , ecowas and un have made it clear that the world is watching what happens next in cote d 'ivoire .
big firms with cocoa and mining interests in the country have done the same .
with luck , this level of scrutiny will deter both sides from escalating tensions into all-out violence . "
compromise seems impossible , even with un intervention dr. dirk khonert , the deputy director of the institute of african affairs at the german institute of global and area studies -lrb- giga -rrb- and a member of the eu election observation team in ivory coast , said that the main stumbling block to a solution was whether both rival candidates would be prepared to accept defeat .
" ouattara has a very strong international backing against gbagbo , " he told deutsche welle .
" thus , he derives his legitimacy not only internally but also externally by the backing of the international community .
it is difficult to imagine under these conditions that he and his followers would be inclined to accept a compromise on the question of the presidency . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un efforts to keep the peace may not prevent conflict it is unlikely that a compromise will satisfy either man as any deal may have to be brokered by the united nations which has given its support to ouattara , therefore alienating gbagbo 's team .
gbagbo has a long record of ignoring international pressure and appears to be ready to take the country to the brink of war to retain power .
he is also unlikely to consider the best option available to african union mediators which would be a government of national reconciliation , with ouattara as president and a significant input of gbagbo activists in the cabinet .
although the un security council has officially backed quattara as president , khonert said that security council intervention would not guarantee success .
" that would require a robust mandate , backed by considerable additional military engagement , which would be more than the 8,500 un troops currently present in ivory coast , and additional finance .
it is doubtful under the present conditions , whether the major parties involved would agree to this . " rival factions ready for a return to war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : concerns are high that a new civil war could divide the nation should the violent protests continue , ivory coast may find itself slipping closer to a new civil war .
ouatarra commands the support of the rebel-controlled north while gbagbo has the sworn allegiance of the army .
rebel leaders have already said that they will not wait long to take action should gbagbo refuse to stand down .
" in view of the history of violent conflicts in the ivory coast in the past decade , there is a high risk of a return to civil war , " khonert said .
" the most dangerous element is the unpredictable attitude of the militias of the presidential contenders ; the ' jeune patriots ' in abidjan or duekoué in the western region of the country . "
for richard gowan the worst-case scenario is a return to full-scale conflict .
" in that case , the un peacekeepers do n't have the forces to stop war and france , which has troops in the country , will want to avoid getting dragged into fighting .
diplomacy is the last best hope . " author : nick amies , ute schaeffer , ibrahim tounkara , dirk koepp -lrb- rm -rrb- editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a prime example is the euro bonds dispute . the two birth defects of the monetary union have come back to brutally haunt the eu : from the outset there was no common economic policy running parallel to the common currency .
hence huge imbalances were created in the eurozone .
and secondly , some of the member countries should never have been included in the euro in the first place .
greece is only the most flagrant , but not the only , example .
for a long time the eu has closed its eyes to these facts .
now they must deal with the consequences in a hurry .
in principle , the measures adopted are heading in the right direction .
governments are committing themselves to do everything necessary to protect the stability of the euro .
the starkness and vagueness of this statement is not a disadvantage .
obviously in theory there are limits to aid , but when numbers are mentioned , speculators are immediately encouraged to test the limits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph hasselbach , dw correspondent in brussels the permanent crisis mechanism is a sign of this mutual protection .
any doubts that the euro countries would abandon a country in an emergency , would cause a chain reaction .
this would break apart the monetary union , and if that happened , the germans especially would find it very expensive .
on the other hand , we can expect a lot of resentment if economic policy is adjusted belatedly in the euro countries .
some people might not perhaps realize what that means .
it is not just about fiscal consolidation , in itself difficult enough .
it 's also about sacred cows like national taxes , retirement policy and labor market legislation , to name only a few major areas .
this is about long national traditions , painstakingly developed social consensus .
while an alignment wo n't lead to a complete standardization , countries can not remain as they are now with differences as big as they are .
it is important that the benchmark for any harmonization is n't a so-called golden mean , but global competitiveness .
time is short .
the crisis is forcing the euro-zone countries to a level of integration that they would not have addressed voluntarily .
but that 's how it is in most cases .
if europe tries hard , it could actually emerge from the crisis stronger .

a prime example is the euro bonds dispute . the two birth defects of the monetary union have come back to brutally haunt the eu : from the outset there was no common economic policy running parallel to the common currency .
hence huge imbalances were created in the eurozone .
and secondly , some of the member countries should never have been included in the euro in the first place .
greece is only the most flagrant , but not the only , example .
for a long time the eu has closed its eyes to these facts .
now they must deal with the consequences in a hurry .
in principle , the measures adopted are heading in the right direction .
governments are committing themselves to do everything necessary to protect the stability of the euro .
the starkness and vagueness of this statement is not a disadvantage .
obviously in theory there are limits to aid , but when numbers are mentioned , speculators are immediately encouraged to test the limits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph hasselbach , dw correspondent in brussels the permanent crisis mechanism is a sign of this mutual protection .
any doubts that the euro countries would abandon a country in an emergency , would cause a chain reaction .
this would break apart the monetary union , and if that happened , the germans especially would find it very expensive .
on the other hand , we can expect a lot of resentment if economic policy is adjusted belatedly in the euro countries .
some people might not perhaps realize what that means .
it is not just about fiscal consolidation , in itself difficult enough .
it 's also about sacred cows like national taxes , retirement policy and labor market legislation , to name only a few major areas .
this is about long national traditions , painstakingly developed social consensus .
while an alignment wo n't lead to a complete standardization , countries can not remain as they are now with differences as big as they are .
it is important that the benchmark for any harmonization is n't a so-called golden mean , but global competitiveness .
time is short .
the crisis is forcing the euro-zone countries to a level of integration that they would not have addressed voluntarily .
but that 's how it is in most cases .
if europe tries hard , it could actually emerge from the crisis stronger .

he 's apologized for his recent comments that gay fans should n't fornicate at the qatar world cup . fifa president sepp blatter has apologized for saying that gay fans should " refrain from sexual activity " if they go to the 2022 world cup in qatar .
homosexuality is illegal in qatar and blatter 's original comments provoked anger among gay rights groups .
" i regret my comment , i did n't want to hurt anyone .
we are against discrimination .
i apologize for that comment , " blatter told a press conference ahead of saturday 's club world cup .
" it was not my intention and it will never be my intention to go into any discrimination because this is exactly what we -lrb- fifa -rrb- are against , so therefore if somebody feels they have been hurt , then i regret and i present apologies for that , " he added .
gay rights activists have reacted furiously after the comments and called for the head of the world soccer governing body to either apologize or resign after his comments this week .
former nba basketball star john amaechi - who revealed he was gay in 2007 - led the attack , accusing the fifa president of " epic , archaic , neanderthal , ignorance . "
a reputation for gaffes " with little more than an afterthought fifa has endorsed the marginalization of lgbt -lsb- lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender -rsb- people around the world , " he wrote on his blog .
" anything less than a full reversal of his position is unacceptable , " amaechi added .
blatter 's remarks are just the latest example of the 74-year-old football chief putting his foot in his mouth .
he told women footballers in 2004 that the best way to make their sport more popular would be to wear " tighter shorts . "
earlier this year , he suggested that john terry 's alleged affair , which led to him being stripped of the england captaincy , would have been applauded in latin countries .
qatar was awarded the world cup this month ahead of australia , the united states , japan and south korea .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 17.12.2010 tuberculosis makes a comeback in london großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuberculosis was once thought defeated in the uk , but london is now the tb capital of western europe tuberculosis , which was thought to have been conquered by the early 1980s , has made a resurgence in the uk , especially in london , where victorian living conditions are common among some groups . the rates of tuberculosis are rising in britain , according to an article published friday in the british medical journal the lancet , while the disease 's occurrences in other western european countries are dropping .
the problem is becoming particularly acute in london , where 40 percent of all of the uk 's tb cases have been reported .
four in ten cases are reported in the capital , with the number of cases rising by nearly 50 percent since 1999 .
" it 's prevailing today in certain sections of the community that replicate conditions in victorian london , " tb expert alimuddin zumla of university college london told deutsche welle .
" most of the tb occurs in areas where there 's deprivation and poverty , and that 's where all the homeless are .
so we 've set up an endemic cycle of transmission . "
in all european countries , tuberculosis is largely concentrated in high-risk groups , such as migrants , refugees , homeless people , drug users , prisoners and hiv-infected people .
it is caused by a bacterial infection , usually of the lungs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some tb strains in south africa are resistant to all known tb drugs the increase in the number of tb cases in the uk has largely been among immigrant groups , although most were not new migrants .
among the cases of those born overseas , 85 percent had lived in the uk for two or more years and about half had lived in the country for five or more years .
the death toll from tb , which used to referred to as the " white plague " due to the pallor of those who had it , began to fall in london at the beginning of the 20th century thanks to improved living standards .
in the early 1960s , anti-tb drugs , better health services and bcg vaccinations continued to cut the number of cases .
the disease was thought to have been conquered by the early 1980s , but had something of a resurgence with the coming of hiv , which weakens the body 's immune system .
in london , as recently as 2000 , everyone thought the disease had been conquered , according to zumla .
but now among high-risk populations , tb rates are equivalent to those in africa .
drug resistant strains another alarming fact is that drug-resistant forms of the disease are beginning to be seen .
complying with the six-month regime of antibiotic treatment has meant that strains of tb have become resistant to drug treatments .
" people start feeling better after two months and stop taking their tablets and drug resistance occurs , " zumla said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in india , new treatment methods have helped cut the number of cases the situation is very serious in south africa , where strains have developed which are resistant to all known tb drugs .
in london , tb is showing up that is still treatable , but resistant to the most commonly used drugs .
zumla said the situation in london is reminiscent of multi-drug resistant tb outbreaks in prisons in the us in the 1990s .
they required a large financial investment to be brought under control .
he has called for a reconsideration of the delivery of tb services by britain 's national health service , standardized treatment and care methods and improvements in access to tb services .
he said because many with tb do not have permanent residences , it is difficult to get them to special clinics for treatment and ensure that they comply with drug regimens .
in new york , he said , a community-based model where health care workers take services to those affected has proven effective and should be adopted in the uk .
britain , one of the world 's major foreign-aid providers , is active in funding anti-tb programs overseas , but zumla says the country needs to look in its own backyard .
" we seem to neglect our own people here , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 17.12.2010 strong youth and sound finances drive bundesliga 's success in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 04 is not alone in excelling in europe this season the consistently strong performances of bundesliga clubs in europe is likely to pay off with germany getting another champions league place - thanks to the league 's finances , youth program and ability to keep its stars . a glance at the pairings in the knock-out rounds of the champions league and europa league make for some satisfied reading for fans of the bundesliga . bayern munich dominated group e in the champions league , losing just once in six games to qualify with a game to spare .
schalke 04 , who have endured some tough times domestically this season , also topped their group ahead of more fancied teams such as benfica and lyon .
" bayern munich and schalke have played a lot better in the champions league this season than they have in the bundesliga , " freelance soccer writer and sometime sportschau.de correspondent marcus bark told deutsche welle .
" schalke coach felix magath has even gone as far as to say that his team takes the champions league more seriously , although it 's hard to believe that this is true . "
out of the three german teams who qualified for this season 's champions league , only werder bremen failed to make it out of the group stage .
" for the past few seasons , two out of the three german teams have gone relatively far in the champions league , " bark said .
" even wolfsburg who dropped out of the champions league at the group stage last year , went on to reach the quarter-finals of the europa league . "
in this season 's europa league , bayer leverkusen and vfb stuttgart have mirrored the success of bayern and schalke by qualifying as the winners of their groups , with only borussia dortmund - somewhat surprisingly considering their domestic form - failing to reach the last 32 .
close followers of the bundesliga may not be that surprised to see such a strong german showing .
this season is hardly a one-off .
consistency breeds consistency for germans in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern romped to last year 's final before losing to inter both bayern and stuttgart made it into the knock-out rounds of the champions league last season - with the bavarian giants , who also made it to the quarter-finals the year before , romping all the way to the final .
the 2009 europa league finalists werder bremen , wolfsburg and hamburg all made it to the quarter-finals of the europa league last season with hamburg progressing to the semi-finals - as they did the year before - before defeat to fulham ended their dream of competing for the title in their own stadium .
german teams have been putting in consistently strong performances in european competition for over a decade now , with at least one of the bundesliga 's six allotted representatives progressing to the quarter-finals or further in both the champions and europa leagues over the past five years .
exposure to foreign opposition honing german skills marcus bark believes that the german national team ’ s long history of success helps to breed players ready for the styles and challenges of foreign opponents , and that this season 's champions league is a case in point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young but experienced : kroos , mueller and badstuber " i think german teams have done so well in europe this season because a lot of the young german stars in these teams performed very well at the world cup , " he said .
" if you look at bayern 's team with lahm , schweinsteiger , kroos , mueller and badstuber , they all have international experience and confidence at that level . "
joerg jakob , deputy editor-in-chief at kicker magazine , agrees that foreign experience helps when attempting to win european trophies but believes that the bundesliga 's recent success is based more on the rise of its young stars . " of course you learn from playing at the world cup or by facing european competition but this is not new for german players and teams , " jakob told deutsche welle .
one of the reasons german teams are doing so well in europe , says jakob , is because of the youth development .
“ bundesliga clubs have to have education and training facilities for young people under dfb rules they introduced in 2000 , so now we have better and more talented youngsters who play a more modern style .
we also have young , modern coaches to guide them . " cash flow essential to maintaining bundesliga 's success according to marcus bark , the bundesliga 's comparatively stable financial situation - in relation to other debt-ridden leagues - is also aiding german teams . " in other leagues , the best players are sold off , making only a few clubs capable of fielding good teams in europe , " he said .
" in germany , the clubs pay well and on time .
they 're very well run and the money is used to develop talent and to hold onto players - again , look at lahm and schweinstieger at bayern ; they ’ ve been approached by europe 's biggest clubs but have chosen to stay . " if money helps bundesliga teams produce european stars of the future and keep at least some of them from the clutches of the leading clubs in the continent ’ s other leagues , then the bundesliga will need a steady stream of revenue if germany 's record in europe is to continue to improve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's loss could be germany 's champions league gain marcus bark and joerg jakob do n't see this as being a problem , even less so in the coming years as the bundesliga looks ready to usurp the underperforming italian league to snatch a fourth champions league place under uefa 's coefficient system which takes into account the results of a particular nation 's clubs in european competitions over the preceding five years . " the bundesliga attracts money , it generates money , and it keeps money , " bark said .
" buying in stars like robben , ribery , raul and huntelaar , the league has become more attractive which brings in bigger crowds .
the reasonable ticket prices also help ; a ticket on average for a bundesliga game is around 20 euros -lrb- $ 26 -rrb- where as in england you can pay up to 120 euros at some clubs .
most clubs have little or no debt so they 're making profits for reinvestment . " " if you ’ re a player on the transfer market , you want to be playing for a champions league team , " said jakob .
" if germany has an extra team in the competition then this means someone else will be able to attract players , agents and sponsors .
of course money ’ s involved , but it ’ s the glamour and prestige of the champions league which will help you keep your youngsters and your stars , meaning you 'll remain competitive .

german chancellor merkel hailed the summit as a success , but the measure has failed to reassure the markets . european leaders meeting in brussels have set up a permanent emergency fund to help debt-laden countries , and have agreed to rewrite some of the bloc 's rules in a bid to shore up the value of the euro .
" we will do everything to secure the financial stability of the euro as a whole , " german chancellor angela merkel said at a news conference after a european union summit .
she added that reform and stability will remain on the euro zone 's agenda next year as the bloc fights to secure the single currency and make its economies more competitive .
but the move was given an emphatic thumbs-down as the ratings agency moody 's downgraded ireland 's credit rating on friday by five notches , to baa1 , two notches above junk .
" while a downgrade had been anticipated , the severity of the downgrade is surprising , " dublin-based glas securities said .
spiraling debt eu leaders have spent most of 2010 trying to come up with successful measures to stop the region 's debt crisis spreading , but greece and ireland have already been forced to seek eu bailouts and portugal , spain , belgium and others are now in the spotlight .
on thursday leaders agreed on a change to the eu treaty to create the european stability mechanism -lrb- esm -rrb- – a permanent financial safety net of 750 billion euro from 2013 - that will help countries with liquidity problems and allow for debt restructuring of insolvent ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is determined to stabilize the euro eu leaders confirmed that private investors would be involved in the future euro zone rescue mechanism , a draft summit statement showed .
merkel said the fund would be sufficiently large .
" the more coherent economic policies are , the more we see by 2013 that states have made progress with a culture of stability , the lower the financial extent of the -lrb- rescue fund -rrb- will have to be , " she added .
germany lobbied hard for changes to the lisbon treaty and a pledge to pay out aid only if it 's " indispensable , " as leaders meeting in brussels on thursday agreed on the need to make a temporary trillion dollar rescue fund into a permanent one .
present dangers but market concerns are focused on whether the euro zone has sufficient immediate funds to come to the aid of the likes of portugal or spain , should they need a bailout next year .
" the new esm should safeguard the euro zone 's financial stability in the future .
however , it is to some extent window-dressing as it does not solve the current crisis , " said carsten brzeski , senior economist at ing bank .
the euro zone 's current fund - the european financial stability facility -lrb- efsf -rrb- - can borrow on the markets backed by euro zone government guarantees and has up to 440 billion euro to lend to governments cut off from market financing .
but many economists believe that even though only a small part of the efsf 's funds have been used to help ireland , it may turn out to be insufficient if more countries need help .
" european leaders failed to address the issue of debt sustainability and possible insolvency problems prior to 2013 .
debt restructuring , a common euro zone bond or an increase of the efsf ?
none of these issues have been addressed .
but they have to be , " brzeski said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markets reacted unvaforably to the eu summit " the preliminary outcome of the eu summit represents yet another missed opportunity by european policymakers to forcefully address investor concerns and calm markets in a more sustainable and pre-emptive manner , " said frank engels , economist at barclays capital .
underlining the need to reassure financial markets over fears that portugal and spain may be in need of bailouts soon , the european central bank also announced on thursday that it would double its capital to 10.76 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.3 billion -rrb- to cope with an increase in market volatility .
bonds kept off agenda discussion about the introduction of " e-bonds , " which would allow all european nations to borrow money at common rates , was kept off the agenda .
merkel has said that the common bond plan " would not rid europe of its weaknesses , it would simply transmit them across the board . "
germany is strongly opposed because e-bonds would effectively mean all 16 euro zone countries - or 17 when estonia joins the currency from jan .
1 , 2011 - financing a portion of their debt together and sharing a credit rating .
berlin , which is the benchmark issuer of debt in the euro zone and enjoys the lowest borrowing costs thanks to its economic strength and reliability , would have to surrender some of its credit to riskier euro states such as greece and ireland .
although germany is publicly opposed to the idea of euro-bonds , some in the euro zone back the idea .
" germany 's rejection of the expansion is another example of how euro zone governments do not agree on the best way forward to deal with this crisis , " said bnp paribas ' wattret .
" as a result , the measures taken have been piecemeal , unconvincing and reactive rather than pre-emptive .
this is going to have to change if confidence is to be restored in a lastingway , " he said .
leaders were meeting in their seventh summit of a busy year , as markets have grown increasingly wary that eu states might default on loans secured through individual government bonds .

germany lobbied hard for changes to the lisbon treaty and a pledge to pay out aid only if it 's " indispensable , " as leaders meeting in brussels on thursday agreed on the need to make a temporary trillion dollar rescue fund into a permanent one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she was satisfied with the result " we stand ready to do whatever is required to ensure the stability of the eurozone , " said the president of the european council , herman van rompuy , after thursday 's meeting .
chancellor angela merkel expressed satisfaction with the results of the meeting , describing it as a " further step " towards greater coordination of economic policy within the eurozone .
" we will do whatever is required to secure the financial stability of the euro , " merkel told reporters at a friday press conference after the summit wrapped up .
french president nicolas sarkozy , a close ally of merkel 's on the issue of eurozone economic alignment , announced that he and merkel would be presenting new proposals on how to make the member countries work more closely .
" we have to tackle the competitiveness gaps within the 16 eurozone countries , " sarkozy said .
from the middle of 2013 , loans and guarantees similar to those offered to greece and ireland this year will only be offered if judged to be " indispensable " in saving the euro as a currency .
no spending cuts , no help that wording was added at the insistence of germany , likely to be the biggest individual contributor to future rescue funding .
berlin also stipulated that any bailout deal would require the recipient government to introduce a program of public spending cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank is to increase its capital base a two-sentence amendment was made to the eu 's lisbon treaty to permit the creation of the permanent rescue facility , the european stability mechanism .
article 125 of the 2007 lisbon treaty stated that the european union " shall not be liable for or assume the commitments of central governments , regional , local or other public authorities , other government bodies ... "
merkel pressed for changes to the article , because she said that a permanent mechanism might otherwise face a successful challenge in germany ’ s constitutional court .
leaders hope to have the necessary changes to the treaty ratified by the end of 2012 , with decisions on enacting rescue packages to be taken unanimously - effectively giving germany a veto .
it was also decided that there was no need to increase the existing rescue fund , which some analysts say would be insufficient in the case of future bailouts .
a number of countries led by germany put forward the argument that there was sufficient capacity in the present reserve . bonds kept off agenda discussion about the introduction of " e-bonds , " which would allow all european nations to borrow money at common rates , was kept off the agenda . merkel has said that the common bond plan " would not rid europe of its weaknesses , it would simply transmit them across the board .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 17.12.2010 bayern face inter rematch , other german sides get easier draws in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern will want to get the better of inter milan this time out bayern need to succeed where they failed in last year ’ s champions league final after drawing inter milan in the round of 16 .
schalke , stuttgart and leverkusen , meanwhile , were handed less formidable foes in europe . bayern fans will be wary of their team ’ s next test in the champions league as the club were handed a difficult tie with cup holders inter milan .
they will also be looking for revenge in the two-legged match , having lost to inter in last year ’ s final .
bayern sporting director christian nerlinger was quick to confirm the club was relishing a chance to reverse last year ’ s defeat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern fans hope this season 's encounter does n't end in tears " we still dwell a little on the lost final in madrid and now we have the opportunity with these two new matches against inter to put things right , " said nerlinger .
" it 's going to be difficult , but it could n't be more interesting for us . "
having won their qualifying group e , the bavarians avoided many of the tournament ’ s strongest sides - but didn ’ t miss inter , who finished a somewhat surprising second to tottenham hotspur in group a. bayern president karl-heinz rummenigge spoke for most when he called inter " without a doubt the most difficult we could have drawn . "
schalke luckier the growing spanish faction at gelsenkirchen side schalke will be looking forward to the club ’ s match against valencia .
with spaniards raul , jose manuel jurado and sergio escudero in the squad , along with christian metzelder and klaas jan huntelaar , who have experience playing in the spanish top flight , schalke can count on a good deal of insight into the playing style of the club from spain ’ s mediterranean coast .
“ it ’ s an attractive , and at the same time difficult draw , ” said schalke ’ s coach and general manager felix magath .
“ all the same , it ’ s our goal to get past valencia . ”
the two teams squared off in the group stage in the fall of 2007 , when valencia got the better of schalke , beating them in germany and drawing at home .
but as schalke defender benedikt hoewedes pointed out , just as schalke is a much different team to three years ago , so is valencia .
“ they ’ ve lost two very strong players in david silva and david villa , ” said hoewedes .
the round of 16 draw in full bildunterschrift : the other cup german sides bayer leverkusen and vfb stuttgart found out their opponents in the europa league round of 32 on friday .
group h winners stuttgart face a rather tough test in benfica , the portuguese champions who dropped out of schalke ’ s group in the champions league .
leverkusen , who won group b , will fancy their chances against the relatively inexperienced ukrainian club metallist kharkov , second place finishers in group i. the europa league round of 32 fixtures are two-legged matches set for february 17th and 24th , or 15th and 22nd .

but with extreme snow across europe , father christmas might just not be able to get to customers in time this year . this year 's holiday shopping season was supposed to generate record online retail sales across europe - from food deliveries to presents .
british online retail association imrg estimates a rise in sales for december by 16 percent to 6.4 billion pounds -lrb- 7.5 billion euros -rrb- .
for 2010 , germany expects some 18.3 billion euros in online sales , up 18 percent .
no food deliveries to scotland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some british companies have stopped their trucks from travelling up to scotland however , with winter having hit europe early and heavily this year , some online retailers are now feeling the effects of snow-blocked roads .
especially hard hit are the british isles .
few tesco delivery trucks are able to make their rounds due to snowy streets .
on its mail-order website , the giant british food retailer is informing customers that it is currently unable to take any new orders in scotland , among other regions .
marks and spencer 's is also issuing regular weather updates on its homepage .
and like tesco , the food and clothing retailer has also temporarily suspended orders from scotland .
" i think customers will not want to risk things and will go to local shops instead of buying online , " natalie berg from the industry analyst planet retail told financial times deutschland .
snowed-in side streets in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plenty of presents are still en route across europe germany is also affected .
more than 80,000 mail carriers across germany have to walk across unplowed streets .
conditions differ considerably from community to community , " some communities are simply not clearing side streets this year , " anke baumann , a spokeswoman from german postal service deutsche post / dhl , told deutsche welle .
" that means our mail carriers have to walk back and forth through the snow carrying single parcels every time because they ca n't even push carts through the snow . "
deutsche post is promising customers in germany that parcels dropped off by noon on december 22 will be delivered by december 24 , christmas eve .
" that 's a promise we 're doing our best to fulfil , " said baumann who , in the same breath , warned : " it might just be impossible in individual cases to stick to it . "
deutsche post has expanded its operating hours to cope with the adverse weather conditions .
parcels ordered from online retailer amazon , for instance , will be delivered on the sunday before christmas - an exception in germany where business traditionally comes to a standstill on sundays .
nevertheless , amazon germany is advising customers to check their order status online because , as a company spokesperson told deutsche welle , " delays of one or two days are currently likely to occur . "
germany 's biggest mail-order clothing retailer otto declined to comment whether goods were being delivered on time .
twice as many parcels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more goods ordered online and christmas coming up : postmen hardly ever get a break this year the festive season traditionally sees a hike in the number of parcels delivered every year .
and this year is no exception , thanks largely to the growing popularity of purchasing merchandise online .
in the weeks leading up to christmas , the number of parcels delivered daily in germany this year has already increased from an average 2.5 million to about 5 million .
" and it 's going to be even more in the last week before christmas , " said baumann .
while germany has struggled with snowed-in side streets and temporarily closed airports to keep deliveries moving , britain does n't seem to be prepared for continuous frost and snow at all .
the country lacks snowploughs to clear roads .
in edinburgh , in fact , the army has been called in to help clear streets .
the country 's postal service , royal mail , is investing 20 billion pounds to be able to handle the christmas mail and parcels .
shop while you wait bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an exception for christmas : parcels are being delivered also on sundays in germany harsh weather conditions have generally been understood to spur online sales because customers can shop comfortably from home .
with the expected delays this year , however , experts say some customers might refrain from ordering online this shopping season .
current conditions demonstrate how sensitive online retail is to adverse weather conditions .
online shopping is still for now more popular in britain than it is in germany but it is becoming rapidly popular in europe 's largest economy .
some of the increase , interestingly , is attributed to smartphone users who like to use their downtime to shop online with their phones .
poinsettias still available online orders have also increased for fleurop .
germany 's largest flower mail-order service operates a network of 8,000 florists nationwide .
that dense network shortens distances between florists and customers , ensuring swift delivery .
but in extreme weather conditions , flights can be delayed or cancelled altogether .
occasionally , fleurop florists have to warn customers that a certain flower might not be deliverable on time .
but a spokesperson from fleurop told deutsche welle that , so far , it has not been forced to issue a warning for the popular christmas plant poinsettia – which is still readily available across germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 17.12.2010 irish debt dramatically downgraded despite eu rescue fund deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland 's international obligations just got a little larger moody 's ratings agency has slashed its credit rating for ireland by five notches .
the drastic downgrade hardly shows confidence in ongoing eu efforts to safeguard the euro at the brussels summit . ratings agency moody 's on friday dropped its rating on irish sovereign debt by five notches , suggesting it was less than enthused by thursday 's eu agreement on a permanent stability fund to protect debt-laden single currency users .
moody 's dropped ireland down five spots , from the third-highest available grade , aa2 , to baa1 , a risk level described as " lower medium grade . "
however , the agency added that this rating represented a " negative " outlook for a country , which would ordinarily have a very high credit rating .
moody 's said its decision was based " on the risk that the irish government 's financial strength could decline further if economic growth were to be weaker than currently projected or the costs of stabilizing the banking system turn out to be higher than currently forecast . "
european leaders gathered at a summit in brussels were seeking to shore up debt-laden eurozone countries , and the single european currency more generally ; but the measures agreed on thursday evidently did little to impress moody 's .
the establishment of a permanent rescue mechanism for eurozone members was designed , at least in part , to dispel concerns in the markets that europe may never repay its debts .
last , but not least bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen 's plan for recovery is unlikely to salvage his prime ministerial post " moody 's has this morning become the third of the three major ratings agencies to downgrade irish sovereign debt in the past four weeks , " the chief economist for dublin-based goodbody stockbroker 's , dermot o 'leary said .
" it has , however , outdone the other two with the scale of the downgrade . "
moody 's move follows similar , but smaller , reductions by fellow credit agencies , standard and poor 's and fitch .
the change means that investors will now demand a higher return in exchange for purchasing government bonds , effectively upping the price of existing and future loans for the irish government .
ireland recently became the second eurozone country , after greece , to seek emergency loans worth roughly 85 billion euros -lrb- $ 113 billion -rrb- from the european union and the international monetary fund .
the country 's rising national debt and enormous 2010 budget deficit - boosted by a government bailout of the country 's biggest moneylender , anglo irish bank - forced the government in dublin to call for help .
the financial turmoil has brought prime minister brian cowen 's coalition government to its knees , a snap election is expected early next year .

bayer leverkusen drew against title holders atletico , with both german sides progressing . there was a dream start for new stuttgart head coach bruno labbadia , his players notching up five goals in their europa league soccer clash at home to danish club odense bk on thursday .
timo gebhart grabbed the first for stuttgart - who are already through to the next stage of the competition - on 20 minutes , scoring when his own header was chested back to his feet by odense defender anders moller christensen .
the second came in the form of a mistake from odense defender daniel hoegh , who accidentally stabbed a cross by gebhart into his own team 's net .
christian gentner was quickest to the ball after it hit defender thomas helveg , to make it 3-0 before pavel pogrebnyak made it 4-0 five minutes later .
that goal left spectators bewildered as the ball , which appeared to have been blocked by moller christensen , somehow found its way across the line through backspin .
although fortune smiled briefly on odense two minutes later , when john utaka maintained his composure in front of goal to net a neat consolation , there was more in stuttgart 's armory when ciprian marica fired in a goal in during extra time to make the final score 5-1 .
stuttgart go through as leaders of their group on 15 points , six points ahead of second place young boys from switzerland .
leverkusen draw , holders go out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atletico made every effort but were ultimately denied in other europa league football action , bayer leverkusen secured a 1-1 draw against europa league title holders atletico madrid on wednesday , sending the spanish side out of the competition .
atletico needed a win against leverkusen - who had already qualified - and needed other results to go in their favor to progress .
the spanish side did dominate the first half of the game with uruguayan striker diego forlan coming close with a half-volley just ahead of the break .
despite this , leverkusen soaked up the pressure and it was the germans who scored first - after a full 69 minutes - patrick helmes slotting the ball past atletico goalkeeper david de gea .
although atletico responded quickly , with a side-footed goal from fran merida just three minutes later , the spaniards were unable to take the lead .
in any case , a victory would not have helped atletico .
greek side aris salonika secured a win that ensured they finished in second place behind group leaders leverkusen .

schalke 04 , who have endured some tough times domestically this season , also topped their group ahead of more fancied teams such as benfica and lyon .
" bayern munich and schalke have played a lot better in the champions league this season than they have in the bundesliga , " freelance soccer writer and sometime sportschau.de correspondent marcus bark told deutsche welle .
" schalke coach felix magath has even gone as far as to say that his team takes the champions league more seriously , although it 's hard to believe that this is true . "
out of the three german teams who qualified for this season 's champions league , only werder bremen failed to make it out of the group stage .
" for the past few seasons , two out of the three german teams have gone relatively far in the champions league , " bark said .
" even wolfsburg who dropped out of the champions league at the group stage last year , went on to reach the quarter-finals of the europa league . "
in this season 's europa league , bayer leverkusen and vfb stuttgart have mirrored the success of bayern and schalke by qualifying as the winners of their groups , with only borussia dortmund - somewhat surprisingly considering their domestic form - failing to reach the last 32 .
close followers of the bundesliga may not be that surprised to see such a strong german showing .
this season is hardly a one-off .
consistency breeds consistency for germans in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern romped to last year 's final before losing to inter both bayern and stuttgart made it into the knock-out rounds of the champions league last season - with the bavarian giants , who also made it to the quarter-finals the year before , romping all the way to the final .
the 2009 europa league finalists werder bremen , wolfsburg and hamburg all made it to the quarter-finals of the europa league last season with hamburg progressing to the semi-finals - as they did the year before - before defeat to fulham ended their dream of competing for the title in their own stadium .
german teams have been putting in consistently strong performances in european competition for over a decade now , with at least one of the bundesliga 's six allotted representatives progressing to the quarter-finals or further in both the champions and europa leagues over the past five years .
exposure to foreign opposition honing german skills marcus bark believes that the german national team ’ s long history of success helps to breed players ready for the styles and challenges of foreign opponents , and that this season 's champions league is a case in point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young but experienced : kroos , mueller and badstuber " i think german teams have done so well in europe this season because a lot of the young german stars in these teams performed very well at the world cup , " he said .
" if you look at bayern 's team with lahm , schweinsteiger , kroos , mueller and badstuber , they all have international experience and confidence at that level . "
joerg jakob , deputy editor-in-chief at kicker magazine , agrees that foreign experience helps when attempting to win european trophies but believes that the bundesliga 's recent success is based more on the rise of its young stars . " of course you learn from playing at the world cup or by facing european competition but this is not new for german players and teams , " jakob told deutsche welle .
one of the reasons german teams are doing so well in europe , says jakob , is because of the youth development .
“ bundesliga clubs have to have education and training facilities for young people under dfb rules they introduced in 2000 , so now we have better and more talented youngsters who play a more modern style .
we also have young , modern coaches to guide them . " cash flow essential to maintaining bundesliga 's success according to marcus bark , the bundesliga 's comparatively stable financial situation - in relation to other debt-ridden leagues - is also aiding german teams . " in other leagues , the best players are sold off , making only a few clubs capable of fielding good teams in europe , " he said .
" in germany , the clubs pay well and on time .
they 're very well run and the money is used to develop talent and to hold onto players - again , look at lahm and schweinstieger at bayern ; they ’ ve been approached by europe 's biggest clubs but have chosen to stay . " if money helps bundesliga teams produce european stars of the future and keep at least some of them from the clutches of the leading clubs in the continent ’ s other leagues , then the bundesliga will need a steady stream of revenue if germany 's record in europe is to continue to improve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's loss could be germany 's champions league gain marcus bark and joerg jakob do n't see this as being a problem , even less so in the coming years as the bundesliga looks ready to usurp the underperforming italian league to snatch a fourth champions league place under uefa 's coefficient system which takes into account the results of a particular nation 's clubs in european competitions over the preceding five years . " the bundesliga attracts money , it generates money , and it keeps money , " bark said .
" buying in stars like robben , ribery , raul and huntelaar , the league has become more attractive which brings in bigger crowds .
the reasonable ticket prices also help ; a ticket on average for a bundesliga game is around 20 euros -lrb- $ 26 -rrb- where as in england you can pay up to 120 euros at some clubs .
most clubs have little or no debt so they 're making profits for reinvestment . " " if you ’ re a player on the transfer market , you want to be playing for a champions league team , " said jakob .
" if germany has an extra team in the competition then this means someone else will be able to attract players , agents and sponsors .
of course money ’ s involved , but it ’ s the glamour and prestige of the champions league which will help you keep your youngsters and your stars , meaning you 'll remain competitive .

out of the three german teams who qualified for this season 's champions league , only werder bremen failed to make it out of the group stage .
" for the past few seasons , two out of the three german teams have gone relatively far in the champions league , " bark said .
" even wolfsburg who dropped out of the champions league at the group stage last year , went on to reach the quarter-finals of the europa league . "
in this season 's europa league , bayer leverkusen and vfb stuttgart have mirrored the success of bayern and schalke by qualifying as the winners of their groups , with only borussia dortmund - somewhat surprisingly considering their domestic form - failing to reach the last 32 .
close followers of the bundesliga may not be that surprised to see such a strong german showing .
this season is hardly a one-off .
consistency breeds consistency for germans in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern romped to last year 's final before losing to inter both bayern and stuttgart made it into the knock-out rounds of the champions league last season - with the bavarian giants , who also made it to the quarter-finals the year before , romping all the way to the final .
the 2009 europa league finalists werder bremen , wolfsburg and hamburg all made it to the quarter-finals of the europa league last season with hamburg progressing to the semi-finals - as they did the year before - before defeat to fulham ended their dream of competing for the title in their own stadium .
german teams have been putting in consistently strong performances in european competition for over a decade now , with at least one of the bundesliga 's six allotted representatives progressing to the quarter-finals or further in both the champions and europa leagues over the past five years .
exposure to foreign opposition honing german skills marcus bark believes that the german national team ’ s long history of success helps to breed players ready for the styles and challenges of foreign opponents , and that this season 's champions league is a case in point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young but experienced : kroos , mueller and badstuber " i think german teams have done so well in europe this season because a lot of the young german stars in these teams performed very well at the world cup , " he said .
" if you look at bayern 's team with lahm , schweinsteiger , kroos , mueller and badstuber , they all have international experience and confidence at that level . "
joerg jakob , deputy editor-in-chief at kicker magazine , agrees that foreign experience helps when attempting to win european trophies but believes that the bundesliga 's recent success is based more on the rise of its young stars . " of course you learn from playing at the world cup or by facing european competition but this is not new for german players and teams , " jakob told deutsche welle .
one of the reasons german teams are doing so well in europe , says jakob , is because of the youth development .
“ bundesliga clubs have to have education and training facilities for young people under dfb rules they introduced in 2000 , so now we have better and more talented youngsters who play a more modern style .
we also have young , modern coaches to guide them . " cash flow essential to maintaining bundesliga 's success according to marcus bark , the bundesliga 's comparatively stable financial situation - in relation to other debt-ridden leagues - is also aiding german teams . " in other leagues , the best players are sold off , making only a few clubs capable of fielding good teams in europe , " he said .
" in germany , the clubs pay well and on time .
they 're very well run and the money is used to develop talent and to hold onto players - again , look at lahm and schweinstieger at bayern ; they ’ ve been approached by europe 's biggest clubs but have chosen to stay . " if money helps bundesliga teams produce european stars of the future and keep at least some of them from the clutches of the leading clubs in the continent ’ s other leagues , then the bundesliga will need a steady stream of revenue if germany 's record in europe is to continue to improve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's loss could be germany 's champions league gain marcus bark and joerg jakob do n't see this as being a problem , even less so in the coming years as the bundesliga looks ready to usurp the underperforming italian league to snatch a fourth champions league place under uefa 's coefficient system which takes into account the results of a particular nation 's clubs in european competitions over the preceding five years . " the bundesliga attracts money , it generates money , and it keeps money , " bark said .
" buying in stars like robben , ribery , raul and huntelaar , the league has become more attractive which brings in bigger crowds .
the reasonable ticket prices also help ; a ticket on average for a bundesliga game is around 20 euros -lrb- $ 26 -rrb- where as in england you can pay up to 120 euros at some clubs .
most clubs have little or no debt so they 're making profits for reinvestment . " " if you ’ re a player on the transfer market , you want to be playing for a champions league team , " said jakob .
" if germany has an extra team in the competition then this means someone else will be able to attract players , agents and sponsors .
of course money ’ s involved , but it ’ s the glamour and prestige of the champions league which will help you keep your youngsters and your stars , meaning you 'll remain competitive .

deutsche welle talked with him about the reasons for this surprising conclusion . andrew mack is the director of the human security report project -lrb- hsrp -rrb- at canada 's simon fraser university and a faculty member of the university 's new school for international studies .
from 1998 to 2001 he was director of the strategic planning office in the executive office of un secretary-general kofi annan .
he has taught at several universities , including the london school of economics , and has published in numerous international newspapers and magazines .
deutsche welle : a lot of people 's perception is that the world is getting more dangerous and violent .
your report says otherwise .
are we being hoodwinked by the media ?
andrew mack : there are two reasons why people believe that the world is becoming more dangerous even though there has been a big decline in the number and deadliness of wars since the end of the cold war 20 years ago . first , media reporting tends to be driven by what might be called the , " if it bleeds , it leads " imperative . this means in practice that wars that start almost always get reported , while those that quietly peter out tend to be ignored .
second , no international organization collects data on the number or deadliness of wars .
so while we have millennium development goals that track national , global and regional trends in progress in health , education , economic and environmental issues , there are no millennium security goals . your report paints a mixed picture of the threat presented by islamist militants .
one the one hand , 4 of the 5 deadliest conflicts are islamist in nature ; on the other , support for al-qaeda in the muslim world is declining .
is progress being made in this area , and if so , in what sense ?
there are reasons for both real concern and cautious optimism here . four of the world 's deadliest conflicts - iraq , afghanistan , pakistan and somalia - are indeed associated with islamist political violence . but one of the reasons for the high death tolls is that they also involve , to a greater or lesser degree , major powers - primarily the us .
this is significant because , since the end of world war ii , the deadliest conflicts have almost always been associated with direct or indirect involvement by one of more of the major powers .
there is room for cautious optimism in that radical islamist groups like al-qaeda have been losing support among muslims throughout the islamic world for some five years .
this is n't surprising .
their extremist ideology is rejected by the overwhelming majority of muslims - including most of those who are strongly opposed to us policies in iraq , afghanistan and pakistan .
the harshly repressive policies that radical islamists have sought to impose wherever they have gained power have been deeply resented .
and the targets of islamist terror are mostly muslim civilians . the decline in public support means that the radicals have little chance of winning popular revolutions .
on the other hand no radical islamist group has sufficiently powerful conventional military forces to defeat the armed forces of the states that they oppose .
what sort of benefits do you expect from a study that quantifies conflict in the way yours does ?
governments are increasingly demanding that their foreign and security policies be " evidence-based . "
providing hard data each year on the number and deadliness of armed conflicts at the global regional and national levels helps governments - and international agencies like the un - determine whether their policies are having an impact or not .
for example , since the end of the cold war the international community has dramatically increased the resources it puts into preventing wars , trying to stop those that ca n't be prevented , and preventing wars that have ended from starting again .
as the level of what might be called " international activism " has gone up the number of wars has come down . indeed in 2008 there were 78 percent fewer high-intensity wars - those that kill 1,000 or more people year - than in 1988 .
please look into your crystal ball : will the world be a safer or more perilous place in 2020 ?
if current trends continue - they may not - there are reasonable grounds for believing that the world will be a safer place . first , other things being equal , we expect the past half-century trend of rising incomes in most developing countries to continue .
in 2010 every region in the developing world is growing strongly .
this is important because the most robust and important finding to emerge from recent quantitative research is that as national incomes rise , the risk of war declines .
its not income per se that matters , but rather that when national incomes rise governments have more resources to buy off grievances that could lead to war , to coopt political opponents and to win wars that ca n't be prevented . second , the end of the cold war has removed a major cause of armed conflicts from the international system , while the dramatic increase in economic interdependence and in the number of democracies in the world over the past four decades has reduced the risk of international wars dramatically . in the 1950s there were six wars a year on average ; in the new millennium there has been less than one .
in other words the factors that have been driving war numbers down are likely to continue - or strengthen .
and there are no obvious adverse counter-trends that threaten to increase the risk of war .
in the longer term the instabilities associated with climate change may cause major problems , but these are unlikely to become manifest in the next 10 years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 17.12.2010 ivory coast violence escalates over power impasse großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the disputed election threatens to split ivory coast in two again the situation in ivory coast is deteriorating following an election leaving the country with two presidents and two governments .
as the nation slips toward chaos , the international community fears a return to war . ivory coast is bracing for more violent unrest following clashes on thursday in which at least 20 people were killed after security forces loyal to incumbent president laurent gbagbo fired on pro-alassane quattara supporters in abidjan .
the united states has in the meantime pulled all its non-emergency embassy staff out of the country .
the eu has given gbagbo until the end of the week to give up his claim to the presidency or face sanctions and possible un prosecution .
french president nicolas sarkozy said in brussels that eu leaders were unanimous in their call for gbagbo to leave office . earlier this week , eu foreign ministers approved a first round of sanctions , including an asset freeze and travel ban , on several other leading officials .
observers say that the key to power is control over the state television headquarters still held by gbagbo .
" state tv is crucial to gain and preserve power , " koné lanciné , general secretary of a broadcasting trade union , told deutsche welle .
" the fact that gbagbo still has some control in ivory coast is largely due to the fact that he controls the state-run media . "
on friday a number of independent newspapers were shut down to prevent them from reporting on the deadly clashes .
" rti -lrb- state broadcaster - ed . -rrb- has turned into a propaganda medium .
they 're disseminating hate in all its forms , ethnic hatred and racial hatred , " said lanciné .
the opposition challenger ouattara and incumbent gbagbo both claimed victory in the nov .
28 election and have both sworn themselves in as president .
ouattara was declared the winner by the country 's electoral commission after the run-off , with provisional results giving him a 10 percent lead over gbagbo .
the result in favor of ouattara has since been ratified by the united nations and recognized by the international community .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gbagbo and ouattara both claimed victory in the election despite ouattara 's support in the international community , gbagbo has defied international calls to cede power and has rejected the un 's ratification of the result .
the current situation raises fears of a return to the violent divisions which split the nation in two between the rebel-controlled north and government-controlled south during the civil war of 2002-2003 .
international concern heightens as crisis deepens the situation is already sending nervous ripples through the international community , especially in organizations responsible for funding development programs in the poverty-stricken nation .
the world bank and the african development bank have both questioned the " usefulness and effectiveness " of their aid programs to ivory coast given the breakdown in governance and have admitted to concerns that the turmoil in the country could drive many more ivorians further into poverty while causing instability and affecting economic prosperity in the wider west african sub-region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international organizations fear the unrest could spread " although the situation is troubling , the international community has reacted very quickly , " richard gowan , an africa expert with the european council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" the african union , ecowas and un have made it clear that the world is watching what happens next in cote d 'ivoire .
big firms with cocoa and mining interests in the country have done the same .
with luck , this level of scrutiny will deter both sides from escalating tensions into all-out violence . "
compromise seems impossible , even with un intervention dr. dirk khonert , the deputy director of the institute of african affairs at the german institute of global and area studies -lrb- giga -rrb- and a member of the eu election observation team in ivory coast , said that the main stumbling block to a solution was whether both rival candidates would be prepared to accept defeat .
" ouattara has a very strong international backing against gbagbo , " he told deutsche welle .
" thus , he derives his legitimacy not only internally but also externally by the backing of the international community .
it is difficult to imagine under these conditions that he and his followers would be inclined to accept a compromise on the question of the presidency . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un efforts to keep the peace may not prevent conflict it is unlikely that a compromise will satisfy either man as any deal may have to be brokered by the united nations which has given its support to ouattara , therefore alienating gbagbo 's team .
gbagbo has a long record of ignoring international pressure and appears to be ready to take the country to the brink of war to retain power .
he is also unlikely to consider the best option available to african union mediators which would be a government of national reconciliation , with ouattara as president and a significant input of gbagbo activists in the cabinet .
although the un security council has officially backed quattara as president , khonert said that security council intervention would not guarantee success .
" that would require a robust mandate , backed by considerable additional military engagement , which would be more than the 8,500 un troops currently present in ivory coast , and additional finance .
it is doubtful under the present conditions , whether the major parties involved would agree to this . " rival factions ready for a return to war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : concerns are high that a new civil war could divide the nation should the violent protests continue , ivory coast may find itself slipping closer to a new civil war .
ouatarra commands the support of the rebel-controlled north while gbagbo has the sworn allegiance of the army .
rebel leaders have already said that they will not wait long to take action should gbagbo refuse to stand down .
" in view of the history of violent conflicts in the ivory coast in the past decade , there is a high risk of a return to civil war , " khonert said .
" the most dangerous element is the unpredictable attitude of the militias of the presidential contenders ; the ' jeune patriots ' in abidjan or duekoué in the western region of the country . "
for richard gowan the worst-case scenario is a return to full-scale conflict .
" in that case , the un peacekeepers do n't have the forces to stop war and france , which has troops in the country , will want to avoid getting dragged into fighting .
diplomacy is the last best hope . " author : nick amies , ute schaeffer , ibrahim tounkara , dirk koepp -lrb- rm -rrb- editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ignace murwanashyaka , leader of the democratic forces for the liberation of rwanda -lrb- fdlr -rrb- , and his deputy straton musoni were arrested in southern germany in november 2009 .
prior to that , murwanashyaka had studied in bonn and had successfully applied for asylum , moving to mannheim .
musoni had been living in the south-western town of neuffen .
murwanashyaka was among 15 people whose assets were frozen by the un security council in 2005 on suspicion of involvement in war crimes .
the fdlr was created by perpetrators of the 1994 rwandan genocide , who fled to neighboring democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- after being routed and driven out by forces led by current president paul kagame .
murwanashyaka , aged 47 and the 49-year-old musoni are suspected of issuing orders to a mostly ethnic-hutu militia involved in crimes against congolese civilians .
german federal prosecutors said the two coordinated between january 2008 and july 2009 fdlr attacks in eastern drc that saw hundreds of civilians killed , large numbers of women raped and villages looted .
investigators went to rwanda at the time of their arrest , the rebel group said that the two were " in no way involved in the atrocities committed against civilians in eastern drc , " calling their detention " unfair and unjustified . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murwanashyaka was the suspected leader of a hutu militia the group is considered a key source of insecurity in africa 's great lakes region .
after their arrest , german prosecutors traveled to congo to gather evidence from witnesses and survivors .
kagame has criticized western countries in the past for not doing enough to bring fdlr leaders living there to justice .
on november 3 , a french court agreed to send callixte mbarushimana , another fdlr leader , to the international criminal court in the hague to face charges that he masterminded war crimes from his hideaway in france .
a french judge has also placed rwanda 's defense minister and five other aides of kagame under investigation in a probe into an attack seen as sparking the genocide , legal sources said thursday .
it was unclear if and when a trial of murwanashyaka and musoni would take place .
an estimated 800,000 people , mostly ethnic tutsis , were killed in the rwandan genocide .
on january 18 , 2011 onesphore r. , a former mayor , is due to go on trial in frankfurt an der oder charged with ordering and organising during the genocide the murder of at least 3,730 tutsis who had sought refuge in church buildings .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 17.12.2010 asylum seekers in bavaria go on hunger strike to highlight their plight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum seekers often live below the poverty line in germany most asylum seekers in germany live below the poverty line , with around half of them housed in overcrowded hostels .
in bavaria , asylum seekers are on hunger strike to highlight the conditions they have to live in . twice a week asylum seekers in a hostel in the southern german city of augsburg get groceries delivered to their door , based on a list they have to hand in beforehand .
but most of the residents do n't speak enough german , so they do n't really know what they are ordering .
and often the food is past the sell-by-date .
" it 's now december and this expired in november , " 31-year-old justus says and places a tub of yogurt on the table .
the nigerian 's room is on the ground floor , the beds are very close together , saucepans are strewn across the floor , food is scattered on the window sill and on the table , because there are no cabinets to put them in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the facilities are often substandard in refugee hostels he shares the room with four fellow nigerians .
the lack of privacy is a huge problem .
" the door is always open , a key would cost 10 euros -lrb- $ 13 -rrb- and we do n't have that money , " justus said .
as asylum seekers are not allowed to work in their first year and do not have the right to attend a german language course as opposed to recognized refugees , the future looks pretty bleak .
based on a quota system they end up somewhere in germany , and if they want to leave their accommodation for a short visit to relatives who were placed in a different town or even federal state , they have to get a permit first or they will be fined . hunger strike justus and the other asylum seekers get 40 euros a month each .
" but the ticket to the welfare office is 2.40 euros each way , sometimes we have to travel back and forth to get translators and have nothing left at the end of the month , " he said .
a few weeks ago justus and 200 fellow asylum seekers went on a hunger strike , but gave up after two weeks .
some , like samuel , continued the protest by refusing to collect their groceries .
the 21-year-old nigerian has lived in the augsburg hostel for two years .
he hoped to highlight the conditions asylum seekers live in .
" most people are not aware of the problems we have here , i do n't think .
people think we have a better life here , " he says pointing at the grubby toilets and rusty doors .
" but this is not a better life at all . "
not forced to stay bavarian social welfare minister christine harderthauer has no sympathy with people like samuel and justus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harderthauer insists the asylum seekers are not forced to stay " no one is forcing them to stay , " she told deutsche welle , explaining that most of the more than 8,000 hostel residents in the state of bavaria are asylum seekers fighting extradition .
" they can go back to their home country anytime they like , " she said .
in reality , they often can not be sent back because they do not have the necessary paperwork , so they are forced to stay in these temporary hostels .
and conditions are particularly bad in bavaria .
" it 's a nationwide problem , but conditions for refugees are definitely bad in bavaria , " hans-georg ebberl from the refugee organization caravan munich told deutsche welle .
legislation needs updating the legal basis for the benefits asylum seekers get has not been updated since being introduced in 1993 , and is also applied differently in each of the german states .
but , for the most part , asylum seekers get less than residents on benefits .
" the payments have not been increased in the last 19 years , " ulla jelpke , an mp for the left party said .
" they only get two-thirds of what legal residents get in benefits , so it pushes them below the poverty line . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : samuel tries to improve his german to pass the time meanwhile , the government has confirmed that the payment rates for asylum seekers are unconstitutional and has placed them under review .
but even if people like samuel and justus get more money , it does n't change the fact that they are not wanted in germany , no matter how much they try to integrate .
but samuel is not deterred .
he has just trained as a geriatric nurse and he also spends a lot of time at the local library to improve his german .
" i want to do something useful .
i ca n't sit around all day doing nothing , it would drive me round the bend , " he says and sets out on his daily trip through a snow-clad augbsurg .

schalke 04 , who have endured some tough times domestically this season , also topped their group ahead of more fancied teams such as benfica and lyon .
" bayern munich and schalke have played a lot better in the champions league this season than they have in the bundesliga , " freelance soccer writer and sometime sportschau.de correspondent marcus bark told deutsche welle .
" schalke coach felix magath has even gone as far as to say that his team takes the champions league more seriously , although it 's hard to believe that this is true . "
out of the three german teams who qualified for this season 's champions league , only werder bremen failed to make it out of the group stage .
" for the past few seasons , two out of the three german teams have gone relatively far in the champions league , " bark said .
" even wolfsburg who dropped out of the champions league at the group stage last year , went on to reach the quarter-finals of the europa league . "
in this season 's europa league , bayer leverkusen and vfb stuttgart have mirrored the success of bayern and schalke by qualifying as the winners of their groups , with only borussia dortmund - somewhat surprisingly considering their domestic form - failing to reach the last 32 .
close followers of the bundesliga may not be that surprised to see such a strong german showing .
this season is hardly a one-off .
consistency breeds consistency for germans in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern romped to last year 's final before losing to inter both bayern and stuttgart made it into the knock-out rounds of the champions league last season - with the bavarian giants , who also made it to the quarter-finals the year before , romping all the way to the final .
the 2009 europa league finalists werder bremen , wolfsburg and hamburg all made it to the quarter-finals of the europa league last season with hamburg progressing to the semi-finals - as they did the year before - before defeat to fulham ended their dream of competing for the title in their own stadium .
german teams have been putting in consistently strong performances in european competition for over a decade now , with at least one of the bundesliga 's six allotted representatives progressing to the quarter-finals or further in both the champions and europa leagues over the past five years .
exposure to foreign opposition honing german skills marcus bark believes that the german national team ’ s long history of success helps to breed players ready for the styles and challenges of foreign opponents , and that this season 's champions league is a case in point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young but experienced : kroos , mueller and badstuber " i think german teams have done so well in europe this season because a lot of the young german stars in these teams performed very well at the world cup , " he said .
" if you look at bayern 's team with lahm , schweinsteiger , kroos , mueller and badstuber , they all have international experience and confidence at that level . "
joerg jakob , deputy editor-in-chief at kicker magazine , agrees that foreign experience helps when attempting to win european trophies but believes that the bundesliga 's recent success is based more on the rise of its young stars . " of course you learn from playing at the world cup or by facing european competition but this is not new for german players and teams , " jakob told deutsche welle .
one of the reasons german teams are doing so well in europe , says jakob , is because of the youth development .
“ bundesliga clubs have to have education and training facilities for young people under dfb rules they introduced in 2000 , so now we have better and more talented youngsters who play a more modern style .
we also have young , modern coaches to guide them . " cash flow essential to maintaining bundesliga 's success according to marcus bark , the bundesliga 's comparatively stable financial situation - in relation to other debt-ridden leagues - is also aiding german teams . " in other leagues , the best players are sold off , making only a few clubs capable of fielding good teams in europe , " he said .
" in germany , the clubs pay well and on time .
they 're very well run and the money is used to develop talent and to hold onto players - again , look at lahm and schweinstieger at bayern ; they ’ ve been approached by europe 's biggest clubs but have chosen to stay . " if money helps bundesliga teams produce european stars of the future and keep at least some of them from the clutches of the leading clubs in the continent ’ s other leagues , then the bundesliga will need a steady stream of revenue if germany 's record in europe is to continue to improve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's loss could be germany 's champions league gain marcus bark and joerg jakob do n't see this as being a problem , even less so in the coming years as the bundesliga looks ready to usurp the underperforming italian league to snatch a fourth champions league place under uefa 's coefficient system which takes into account the results of a particular nation 's clubs in european competitions over the preceding five years . " the bundesliga attracts money , it generates money , and it keeps money , " bark said .
" buying in stars like robben , ribery , raul and huntelaar , the league has become more attractive which brings in bigger crowds .
the reasonable ticket prices also help ; a ticket on average for a bundesliga game is around 20 euros -lrb- $ 26 -rrb- where as in england you can pay up to 120 euros at some clubs .
most clubs have little or no debt so they 're making profits for reinvestment . " " if you ’ re a player on the transfer market , you want to be playing for a champions league team , " said jakob .
" if germany has an extra team in the competition then this means someone else will be able to attract players , agents and sponsors .
of course money ’ s involved , but it ’ s the glamour and prestige of the champions league which will help you keep your youngsters and your stars , meaning you 'll remain competitive .

" of course you learn from playing at the world cup or by facing european competition but this is not new for german players and teams , " jakob told deutsche welle .
one of the reasons german teams are doing so well in europe , says jakob , is because of the youth development .
“ bundesliga clubs have to have education and training facilities for young people under dfb rules they introduced in 2000 , so now we have better and more talented youngsters who play a more modern style .
we also have young , modern coaches to guide them . " cash flow essential to maintaining bundesliga 's success according to marcus bark , the bundesliga 's comparatively stable financial situation - in relation to other debt-ridden leagues - is also aiding german teams . " in other leagues , the best players are sold off , making only a few clubs capable of fielding good teams in europe , " he said .
" in germany , the clubs pay well and on time .
they 're very well run and the money is used to develop talent and to hold onto players - again , look at lahm and schweinstieger at bayern ; they ’ ve been approached by europe 's biggest clubs but have chosen to stay . " if money helps bundesliga teams produce european stars of the future and keep at least some of them from the clutches of the leading clubs in the continent ’ s other leagues , then the bundesliga will need a steady stream of revenue if germany 's record in europe is to continue to improve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's loss could be germany 's champions league gain marcus bark and joerg jakob do n't see this as being a problem , even less so in the coming years as the bundesliga looks ready to usurp the underperforming italian league to snatch a fourth champions league place under uefa 's coefficient system which takes into account the results of a particular nation 's clubs in european competitions over the preceding five years . " the bundesliga attracts money , it generates money , and it keeps money , " bark said .
" buying in stars like robben , ribery , raul and huntelaar , the league has become more attractive which brings in bigger crowds .
the reasonable ticket prices also help ; a ticket on average for a bundesliga game is around 20 euros -lrb- $ 26 -rrb- where as in england you can pay up to 120 euros at some clubs .
most clubs have little or no debt so they 're making profits for reinvestment . " " if you ’ re a player on the transfer market , you want to be playing for a champions league team , " said jakob .
" if germany has an extra team in the competition then this means someone else will be able to attract players , agents and sponsors .
of course money ’ s involved , but it ’ s the glamour and prestige of the champions league which will help you keep your youngsters and your stars , meaning you 'll remain competitive .

schalke 04 , who have endured some tough times domestically this season , also topped their group ahead of more fancied teams such as benfica and lyon .
" bayern munich and schalke have played a lot better in the champions league this season than they have in the bundesliga , " freelance soccer writer and sometime sportschau.de correspondent marcus bark told deutsche welle .
" schalke coach felix magath has even gone as far as to say that his team takes the champions league more seriously , although it 's hard to believe that this is true . "
out of the three german teams who qualified for this season 's champions league , only werder bremen failed to make it out of the group stage .
" for the past few seasons , two out of the three german teams have gone relatively far in the champions league , " bark said .
" even wolfsburg who dropped out of the champions league at the group stage last year , went on to reach the quarter-finals of the europa league . "
in this season 's europa league , bayer leverkusen and vfb stuttgart have mirrored the success of bayern and schalke by qualifying as the winners of their groups , with only borussia dortmund - somewhat surprisingly considering their domestic form - failing to reach the last 32 .
close followers of the bundesliga may not be that surprised to see such a strong german showing .
this season is hardly a one-off .
consistency breeds consistency for germans in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern romped to last year 's final before losing to inter both bayern and stuttgart made it into the knock-out rounds of the champions league last season - with the bavarian giants , who also made it to the quarter-finals the year before , romping all the way to the final .
the 2009 europa league finalists werder bremen , wolfsburg and hamburg all made it to the quarter-finals of the europa league last season with hamburg progressing to the semi-finals - as they did the year before - before defeat to fulham ended their dream of competing for the title in their own stadium .
german teams have been putting in consistently strong performances in european competition for over a decade now , with at least one of the bundesliga 's six allotted representatives progressing to the quarter-finals or further in both the champions and europa leagues over the past five years .
exposure to foreign opposition honing german skills marcus bark believes that the german national team ’ s long history of success helps to breed players ready for the styles and challenges of foreign opponents , and that this season 's champions league is a case in point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young but experienced : kroos , mueller and badstuber " i think german teams have done so well in europe this season because a lot of the young german stars in these teams performed very well at the world cup , " he said .
" if you look at bayern 's team with lahm , schweinsteiger , kroos , mueller and badstuber , they all have international experience and confidence at that level . "
joerg jakob , deputy editor-in-chief at kicker magazine , agrees that foreign experience helps when attempting to win european trophies but believes that the bundesliga 's recent success is based more on the rise of its young stars .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 17.12.2010 german parliament at odds over papal address großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone thinks it 's such a good idea for the pope to speak in parliament pope benedict xvi is scheduled to speak in parliament when he visits germany in september 2011 .
this has caused a great stir among politicians . pope benedict xvi is not scheduled to talk in the bundestag , the lower house of the german parliament , until september 2011 , but his visit has already stirred up a hot debate between the opposition greens and chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the greens oppose the papal speech in parliament and hans-christian stroebele , a green party grandee , said he would not listen to the pope 's speech .
stroebele has protested against speeches in the past , when he left parliament to ignore speeches by george w. bush and vladimir putin .
other greens said they will attend the speech , but echoed the criticism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stroebele said he would leave the bundestag during the papal speech " the german bundestag is supposed to be neutral when it comes to state visitors , " volker beck , head of the greens ' parliamentary group said .
as the pope is first and foremost the leader of a religious group , it would raise the question which representatives from other religious groups could be invited next , he added .
the greens lay great importance on the equal treatment of different religions and fear this to be compromised by the pope ’ s visit .
the cdu dismissed the concerns and went on the offensive .
greens are against everything " the greens are simply against everything and everyone , " cdu secretary general hermann groehe said .
" you can only hope that this ' party against everything ' reflects a bit over christmas .
it would be an honor to have the pope speak in parliament . "
cem oezdemir , leader of the greens , rebuffed the sharp attacks .
" the pope should speak in parliament if he wishes to do so , " he said .
oezdemir added he believed in an open dialogue .
the greens ' concerns were backed by social democrat rolf schwanitz who is also a member of a group within his party that campaigns for laicism .
he said he had reservations about the papal speech .
wolfgang thierse , the social democrat vice president of the german parliament , called the greens narrow-minded .
the head of the protestant church , nikolaus schneider , said the pope 's invitation to speak in the bundestag was " understandable , because the pope is also a head of state . "
christian stroebele added another twist to the debate in an interview with the saturday editions of the waz group newspapers in germany .
he said he might consider staying in parliament and listening to the pope 's speech if he were allowed to ask a question .
yet stroebele , who describes himself as a catholic , maintained the pope had failed to modernize the church .
" the holy father still promotes exorcism .
for me that shows a medieval institution , " he said . author : sarah steffen -lrb- epd , dpa , afp , kna -rrb- editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a prime example is the euro bonds dispute . the two birth defects of the monetary union have come back to brutally haunt the eu : from the outset there was no common economic policy running parallel to the common currency .
hence huge imbalances were created in the eurozone .
and secondly , some of the member countries should never have been included in the euro in the first place .
greece is only the most flagrant , but not the only , example .
for a long time the eu has closed its eyes to these facts .
now they must deal with the consequences in a hurry .
in principle , the measures adopted are heading in the right direction .
governments are committing themselves to do everything necessary to protect the stability of the euro .
the starkness and vagueness of this statement is not a disadvantage .
obviously in theory there are limits to aid , but when numbers are mentioned , speculators are immediately encouraged to test the limits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph hasselbach , dw correspondent in brussels the permanent crisis mechanism is a sign of this mutual protection .
any doubts that the euro countries would abandon a country in an emergency , would cause a chain reaction .
this would break apart the monetary union , and if that happened , the germans especially would find it very expensive .
on the other hand , we can expect a lot of resentment if economic policy is adjusted belatedly in the euro countries .
some people might not perhaps realize what that means .
it is not just about fiscal consolidation , in itself difficult enough .
it 's also about sacred cows like national taxes , retirement policy and labor market legislation , to name only a few major areas .
this is about long national traditions , painstakingly developed social consensus .
while an alignment wo n't lead to a complete standardization , countries can not remain as they are now with differences as big as they are .
it is important that the benchmark for any harmonization is n't a so-called golden mean , but global competitiveness .
time is short .
the crisis is forcing the euro-zone countries to a level of integration that they would not have addressed voluntarily .
but that 's how it is in most cases .
if europe tries hard , it could actually emerge from the crisis stronger .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 17.12.2010 european leaders seal deal on permanent crisis fund großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders were meeting for the seventh time this year european leaders have agreed on a permanent rescue fund to cover countries in need of financial assistance .
but at germany 's behest , aid will only be paid if it 's considered ' indispensable ' to the stability of the euro . european leaders have set up a permament emergency fund to help debt-laden countries , and have agreed to rewrite some of the bloc 's rules in a bid to shore up the value of the euro .
germany lobbied hard for changes to the lisbon treaty and a pledge to pay out aid only if it 's " indispensable , " as leaders meeting in brussels on thursday agreed on the need to make a temporary trillion dollar rescue fund into a permanent one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she was satisfied with the result " we stand ready to do whatever is required to ensure the stability of the eurozone , " said the president of the european council , herman van rompuy , after thursday 's meeting .
chancellor angela merkel expressed satisfaction with the results of the meeting , describing it as a " further step " towards greater coordination of economic policy within the eurozone .
" we will do whatever is required to secure the financial stability of the euro , " merkel told reporters at a friday press conference after the summit wrapped up .
french president nicolas sarkozy , a close ally of merkel 's on the issue of eurozone economic alignment , announced that he and merkel would be presenting new proposals on how to make the member countries work more closely .
" we have to tackle the competitiveness gaps within the 16 eurozone countries , " sarkozy said .
from the middle of 2013 , loans and guarantees similar to those offered to greece and ireland this year will only be offered if judged to be " indispensable " in saving the euro as a currency .
no spending cuts , no help that wording was added at the insistence of germany , likely to be the biggest individual contributor to future rescue funding .
berlin also stipulated that any bailout deal would require the recipient government to introduce a program of public spending cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank is to increase its capital base a two-sentence amendment was made to the eu 's lisbon treaty to permit the creation of the permanent rescue facility , the european stability mechanism .
article 125 of the 2007 lisbon treaty stated that the european union " shall not be liable for or assume the commitments of central governments , regional , local or other public authorities , other government bodies ... "
merkel pressed for changes to the article , because she said that a permanent mechanism might otherwise face a successful challenge in germany ’ s constitutional court .
leaders hope to have the necessary changes to the treaty ratified by the end of 2012 , with decisions on enacting rescue packages to be taken unanimously - effectively giving germany a veto .
it was also decided that there was no need to increase the existing rescue fund , which some analysts say would be insufficient in the case of future bailouts .
a number of countries led by germany put forward the argument that there was sufficient capacity in the present reserve . bonds kept off agenda discussion about the introduction of " e-bonds , " which would allow all european nations to borrow money at common rates , was kept off the agenda . merkel has said that the common bond plan " would not rid europe of its weaknesses , it would simply transmit them across the board . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal is next on the list of countries likely to need help underlining the need to reassure financial markets over fears that portugal and spain may be in need of bailouts soon , the european central bank also announced on thursday that it would double its capital to 10.76 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.3 billion -rrb- to cope with an increase in market volatility .
leaders were meeting in their seventh summit of a busy year , as markets have grown increasingly wary that eu states might default on loans secured through individual government bonds .
the eu and international monetary fund set up a eurozone safety net fund , worth an estimated 750 billion euros , in may .

bayer leverkusen drew against title holders atletico , with both german sides progressing . there was a dream start for new stuttgart head coach bruno labbadia , his players notching up five goals in their europa league soccer clash at home to danish club odense bk on thursday .
timo gebhart grabbed the first for stuttgart - who are already through to the next stage of the competition - on 20 minutes , scoring when his own header was chested back to his feet by odense defender anders moller christensen .

christian gentner was quickest to the ball after it hit defender thomas helveg , to make it 3-0 before pavel pogrebnyak made it 4-0 five minutes later .

he 's apologized for his recent comments that gay fans should n't fornicate at the qatar world cup . fifa president sepp blatter has apologized for saying that gay fans should " refrain from sexual activity " if they go to the 2022 world cup in qatar .
homosexuality is illegal in qatar and blatter 's original comments provoked anger among gay rights groups .
" i regret my comment , i did n't want to hurt anyone .
we are against discrimination .
i apologize for that comment , " blatter told a press conference ahead of saturday 's club world cup .
" it was not my intention and it will never be my intention to go into any discrimination because this is exactly what we -lrb- fifa -rrb- are against , so therefore if somebody feels they have been hurt , then i regret and i present apologies for that , " he added .
gay rights activists have reacted furiously after the comments and called for the head of the world soccer governing body to either apologize or resign after his comments this week .
former nba basketball star john amaechi - who revealed he was gay in 2007 - led the attack , accusing the fifa president of " epic , archaic , neanderthal , ignorance . "
a reputation for gaffes " with little more than an afterthought fifa has endorsed the marginalization of lgbt -lsb- lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender -rsb- people around the world , " he wrote on his blog .

but was it worth leaving bed ? the snow does n't seem to have stopped falling for days , who knows how many degrees below zero it is outside , and all i can think of is staying under the covers and hibernating the next six months away . even with the heat blasting out of my radiators , i feel like i 've already turned into an icicle .
when the phone rings and the invitation comes for a trip to the christmas market i know i 'd have to be seriously deranged to voluntarily stand around in the freezing cold , my hands wrapped around a cup of hot alcoholic red liquid , dressed up with a few spices and a piece of moldy orange .
and i know my hangover the next day is guaranteed to be worse than if i 'd knocked back 15 tequila slammers . my friend valiantly proposes the traditional snacks of backfisch and kartoffelpuffer .
like a lump of fried cod wedged into a tiny roll or fried potato pancakes with apple sauce will convince me to expose myself to the worst mother nature has to offer germany 's capital .
" bah humbug ! "
i hear him mumble . scrooge ! ?
who me ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mulled wine is an essential part of the christmas market visit no , i 've got nothing against christmas , just against the cold !
give me a carol concert any day , a cup of nice mulled wine in front of an open fire , a jar of cookies perhaps and i 'll be whistling " we wish you a merry christmas " all the way into february - as long as i do n't have to step out the door . yet somehow the words , " ok , if i really must , " escape my lips in a whisper . this is germany after all and that means everyone must " do " at least one christmas market a year , if not two or three .
the idea is to wrap yourself in about a thousand layers and drag your reluctant body to the town square . frozen travels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : snow arrived early in berlin this year but that 's easier said than done in berlin .
from my place in neukoelln is no town square in sight , let alone a father christmas , string of tinsel or a loudspeaker blaring " jingle bells . "
i 'm going to have to brave the cold and leave my neighborhood before finding a warming mug of gluehwein . stumbling because of my partially frozen legs , i get off the tram only to be nearly knocked down by the siberian wind .
trudging through the snow , i focus on the ferris wheel at the christmas market on alexanderplatz to keep myself from turning around .
its flashing lights are all i can see as even the television tower has disappeared into the fog . when i find him , my friend is already propping up a kiosk ; sipping on his mulled wine and watching excited kids skate round and round on the ice rink .
tourists sing " away in a manger " in japanese or " the little drummer boy " in french .
my friend 's enthusiasm increases as i order the first of many gluehweins and join in for the next round of carols . measuring markets - and mulled wine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all gifts are worth giving these markets are not only about song and wine .
you 're supposed to wander the rows of stalls and buy socks your granddad does n't need , a wooly hat your mum will never wear , an amusing game for your boyfriend that he 'll never play .
but it 's all so expensive and little of it is even " made in germany . " but holy shit shopping is just around the corner .
it 's a designer christmas market that aims to open the wallets of 30-somethings who already buy anything they really want and can afford the far-from-cheap prices .
but the t-shirts with quirky designs , the cookies and candles with berlin motifs , the hand-knitted caps , and whacky trousers made out of pullovers have all been created by local artists , who plug their wares with wit .
i order another gluehwein and buy a hat . it keeps me snug at my next stop : the self-proclaimed " most beautiful christmas market in berlin " near the historic thoroughfare unter den linden .
tucked between the opera house and the friedrichswerder church , the market is indeed lovely .
the lights are tastefully arranged , the stands recall medieval times and the gluehwein tastes surprisingly good . yet not as good as the tiny christmas market in friedrichshain , where it is positively delicious and the atmosphere is delightful .
all around the samariter church are charming wooden shacks , where merry people sell mouth-watering home-baked cookies , colorful soft toys , teapots and other gifts friends and relatives are likely to appreciate . laden with colorful paper bags , i lumber home and immediately crawl back under the covers . the next day , the gluehwein 's warming effect has been replaced with a searing headache and burning throat .
i sneeze and think i should have followed my instincts .
instead i drank liters of cheap red wine and sang carols in all languages at the top of my voice .
next year , i will know better ! but in the meantime , merry christmas ! author : anne thomas editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 17.12.2010 electric cars hit us streets although future still uncertain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeffrey kaffee drives the first volt sold to the public out of the showroom the roll-out of electric cars by big automakers nissan and gm has sparked discussion about their prospects and acceptance by the larger public .
big hurdles remain but many are confident about electrics ' future . electric cars have had many false dawns over the years , but their proponents in the motor industry say now their time has come .
this december , two mass-market electric vehicles are hitting dealerships in selected markets around the world .
the general motors volt and nissan 's leaf are both aimed at delivering emissions-free driving at affordable prices .
motor trend magazine has called the chevy volt a " breakthrough " and a " game changer " and named it its 2011 car of the year .
a retiree in new jersey became the owner of the first volt , a gas-electric hybrid , to be sold to the public on december 15 , while nissan rolled out its leaf in a handful of us cities earlier this month .
both are scheduled for sale in europe in 2011 .
the developments have some experts saying that a major change is underway in the automobile industry .
general motors ' volt relies on a battery for the first 40 miles or 60 kilometers , after which a gas-powered engine kicks in to recharge the battery , which extends the range of the sedan by another 300 miles , or 480 kilometers .
in contrast , the leaf is all-electric with a range of around 100 miles , and just like early gas-powered vehicles , it might be difficult to find fuel nearby .
however , unlike the car 's predecessors , the leaf has a gps system .
press a small blue button and it will search for the nearest charging station .
still , many fear that ' range anxiety ' will put drivers off the all-electrics and that electric cars will remain a niche product .
but others say zero-emission vehicles will gain traction in the long term .
" we are the most bullish today by saying ten percent of the market 2020 will be zero emission , " nissan renault ceo carlos ghosn told a stanford university forum .
" frankly , i think the numbers will move up . ”
sticker shock bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the all-electric nissan leaf is more affordable it all sounds promising , although the price tag could limit its popularity .
even with a federal tax credit , the volt will set consumers back $ 33,500 -lrb- 25,155 euros -rrb- .
nissan 's leaf will not collide with bank accounts with quite the same ferocity .
tax incentives from washington and the state of california will bring the price of the four-door automobile down to just over $ 20,000 , about the same price as a gas-powered sedan .
still , that 's almost where the similarities with its gasoline-dependent brethren end .
starting up the leaf is a quiet process – there 's no traditional cranking sound of a starter .
there 's also no internal combustion engine .
instead , the car relies on lithium-ion batteries .
when it 's running , it emits a faint hum which has been added to alert pedestrians that a car is nearby .
nissan has spent $ 5 billion developing electric cars and ghosn insists this is a safe bet .
he says electric car sales will rise if oil prices go up and carbon dioxide restrictions get tougher .

while the cars themselves do n't emit greenhouse gases , the electricity plants where they get their energy from may .
" as a us average , a battery electric car we think would reduce greenhouse gas emission by about 40 percent compared to a conventional vehicle , " said timothy lipman of the university of california , berkeley .

according to a recent report by the national research council , the current us electric grid could provide enough electricity to power 80 percent of today 's cars , if they were electric and provided that they were charged during off-peak hours , such as overnight .
however , some are looking at a different approach .

big hurdles remain but many are confident about electrics ' future . electric cars have had many false dawns over the years , but their proponents in the motor industry say now their time has come .
this december , two mass-market electric vehicles are hitting dealerships in selected markets around the world .
the general motors volt and nissan 's leaf are both aimed at delivering emissions-free driving at affordable prices .
motor trend magazine has called the chevy volt a " breakthrough " and a " game changer " and named it its 2011 car of the year .
a retiree in new jersey became the owner of the first volt , a gas-electric hybrid , to be sold to the public on december 15 , while nissan rolled out its leaf in a handful of us cities earlier this month .
both are scheduled for sale in europe in 2011 .
the developments have some experts saying that a major change is underway in the automobile industry .
general motors ' volt relies on a battery for the first 40 miles or 60 kilometers , after which a gas-powered engine kicks in to recharge the battery , which extends the range of the sedan by another 300 miles , or 480 kilometers .
in contrast , the leaf is all-electric with a range of around 100 miles , and just like early gas-powered vehicles , it might be difficult to find fuel nearby .
however , unlike the car 's predecessors , the leaf has a gps system .
press a small blue button and it will search for the nearest charging station .
still , many fear that ' range anxiety ' will put drivers off the all-electrics and that electric cars will remain a niche product .
but others say zero-emission vehicles will gain traction in the long term .
" we are the most bullish today by saying ten percent of the market 2020 will be zero emission , " nissan renault ceo carlos ghosn told a stanford university forum .
" frankly , i think the numbers will move up . ”
sticker shock bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the all-electric nissan leaf is more affordable it all sounds promising , although the price tag could limit its popularity .
even with a federal tax credit , the volt will set consumers back $ 33,500 -lrb- 25,155 euros -rrb- .
nissan 's leaf will not collide with bank accounts with quite the same ferocity .
tax incentives from washington and the state of california will bring the price of the four-door automobile down to just over $ 20,000 , about the same price as a gas-powered sedan .
still , that 's almost where the similarities with its gasoline-dependent brethren end .
starting up the leaf is a quiet process – there 's no traditional cranking sound of a starter .
there 's also no internal combustion engine .
instead , the car relies on lithium-ion batteries .
when it 's running , it emits a faint hum which has been added to alert pedestrians that a car is nearby .
nissan has spent $ 5 billion developing electric cars and ghosn insists this is a safe bet .
he says electric car sales will rise if oil prices go up and carbon dioxide restrictions get tougher .

while the cars themselves do n't emit greenhouse gases , the electricity plants where they get their energy from may .

in that we 've said that before about the stern , bald man this season and he 's gotten the job done -lrb- witness the 4-0 win at cologne on match day 12 -rrb- , we like his chances .
prediction : 2-1 moenchengladbach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a dire start , schalke are finding their groove saturday , dec .
18 schalke - cologne the billy goats took all three points off of high-flying eintracht last week , but did so in the ugliest - and most fortunate - of circumstances .
they could have easily gone 3-0 down within the first 20 minutes , but did n't and got a goal from 19-year-old debutant christian clemens early in the second half .
then they held of for dear life .
schalke , for their part , have been bossing around the likes of bayern , benfica and mainz in recent weeks .
expect to find a broken cologne somewhere under an avalanche come saturday evening .
prediction : 4-1 schalke bremen - kaiserslautern the fight bremen put up against dortmund last week was as credible as any team 's has been over the last couple of months , and on another day they might well have eked out a draw rather than a 2-0 loss .
that good showing , coupled with kaiserslautern 's pitiful away form this season -lrb- two wins , six losses -rrb- , means werder should head into the break three points richer .
prediction : 2-0 bremen wolfsburg - hoffenheim the great steve mcclaren experiment in wolfsburg is beginning to look like a failure .
after spending big to get his englishman for the touchline -lrb- not to mention his brazilian , diego , for the number 10 shirt -rrb- , dieter hoeness might just have to head back to the drawing board come january .
word is edin dzeko will get his big-money move to manchester city , mark van bommel will be on his way in from bayern , and - providing hoffenheim lower the boom on saturday - mcclaren will be heading down to the jobcentre .
and so it will come to pass … prediction : 2-1 hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eintracht will have to show a lot of fight to take down dortmund frankfurt - dortmund dortmund 's effort in spain on wednesday night was valiant , but was n't good enough to get the win over sevilla they needed to stay in the europa league .
it could also prove one exertion too many ahead of a tough match at eintracht on the weekend .
coach michael skibbe 's men have hit a rough patch recently , losing three of four , but have had some tough luck along the way . we see that luck changing on saturday , helping produce a surprise result .
prediction : 1-0 frankfurt nuremberg - hanover just when you 're ready to write off nuremberg as rubbish , and hanover as merely fortunate , they go and prove otherwise .
it was nuremberg who were lucky last week , drawing at hoffenheim on the back of stingy defending and late , opportunistic behavior in front of goal .
and hanover ?
they 're just good .
the reds ' 2-1 win over stuttgart was a master class in counter-attacking football , led by didier ya konan .
it 's a shame that the ivorian will miss this week 's match , but his running partner from earlier this season , mohammed abdelloue , is back from his break in training to replace him , and that should be enough to tide the team over .
prediction : 1-0 hanover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz fans ought to have a good time in hamburg this weekend st. pauli - mainz the st. pauli pirate brigade 's roger is not looking so jolly these days - they 've lost six of their last eight , and most of those losses were n't even close -lrb- see : 3-0 defeats to schalke , bremen and bayern -rrb- .
fortunately for pauli , mainz is in a funk of its own , losing five of their last seven .
but all but one of those losses was close - unlucky even , some might say .
thomas tuchel and co. should have enough juice to satisfy their fans at the millerntor … before the happy out-of-towners head to the nearby red light district for round two .
prediction : 3-1 mainz sunday , dec .
5 leverkusen - freiburg by now leverkusen must be aware that it is one of the few sides in the bundesliga with even an outside chance to overhaul dortmund for the title .
11 points is a tall order , but do-able - so long as a couple of big ifs fall into place .
dortmund must start losing games -lrb- something they 've done just once so far -rrb- , and the pharmaceuticals must find the mental toughness to turn the games they 've been drawing up to now -lrb- a whopping five on the season -rrb- in to wins .
this project has to start now , against freiburg , and we reckon it will .
prediction : 3-2 leverkusen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labbadia is already off to a good start at suttgart stuttgart - bayern many a commentator has remarked in the days since bruno labbadia 's appointment as stuttgart 's new coach that he has come at an opportune time .
the journeyman coach had three matches to win over the squad and the club 's fans .
first , a gimme against a danish tomato can called odense -lrb- duly won , 5-1 -rrb- , then two dates with bayern munich - in the league on sunday , then in the cup on wednesday .
take two out of three , or even a fighting draw with bayern in the league , and he can go into the winter break on a high . we think he 'll manage it .
prediction : 2-1 stuttgart last week 's results : n / a total for the season : 66 three points for a correct score prediction two points for a correct margin prediction one point for a correct winner prediction author : matt hermann editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the drastic downgrade hardly shows confidence in ongoing eu efforts to safeguard the euro at the brussels summit . ratings agency moody 's on friday dropped its rating on irish sovereign debt by five notches , suggesting it was less than enthused by thursday 's eu agreement on a permanent stability fund to protect debt-laden single currency users .
moody 's dropped ireland down five spots , from the third-highest available grade , aa2 , to baa1 , a risk level described as " lower medium grade . "
however , the agency added that this rating represented a " negative " outlook for a country , which would ordinarily have a very high credit rating .
moody 's said its decision was based " on the risk that the irish government 's financial strength could decline further if economic growth were to be weaker than currently projected or the costs of stabilizing the banking system turn out to be higher than currently forecast . "
european leaders gathered at a summit in brussels were seeking to shore up debt-laden eurozone countries , and the single european currency more generally ; but the measures agreed on thursday evidently did little to impress moody 's .
the establishment of a permanent rescue mechanism for eurozone members was designed , at least in part , to dispel concerns in the markets that europe may never repay its debts .
last , but not least bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen 's plan for recovery is unlikely to salvage his prime ministerial post " moody 's has this morning become the third of the three major ratings agencies to downgrade irish sovereign debt in the past four weeks , " the chief economist for dublin-based goodbody stockbroker 's , dermot o 'leary said .
" it has , however , outdone the other two with the scale of the downgrade . "
moody 's move follows similar , but smaller , reductions by fellow credit agencies , standard and poor 's and fitch .
the change means that investors will now demand a higher return in exchange for purchasing government bonds , effectively upping the price of existing and future loans for the irish government .
ireland recently became the second eurozone country , after greece , to seek emergency loans worth roughly 85 billion euros -lrb- $ 113 billion -rrb- from the european union and the international monetary fund .
the country 's rising national debt and enormous 2010 budget deficit - boosted by a government bailout of the country 's biggest moneylender , anglo irish bank - forced the government in dublin to call for help .
the financial turmoil has brought prime minister brian cowen 's coalition government to its knees , a snap election is expected early next year .

european leaders have agreed on a permanent rescue fund to cover countries in need of financial assistance .
german chancellor merkel hailed the summit as a success , but the measure has failed to reassure the markets . european leaders meeting in brussels have set up a permanent emergency fund to help debt-laden countries , and have agreed to rewrite some of the bloc 's rules in a bid to shore up the value of the euro .
" we will do everything to secure the financial stability of the euro as a whole , " german chancellor angela merkel said at a news conference after a european union summit .
she added that reform and stability will remain on the euro zone 's agenda next year as the bloc fights to secure the single currency and make its economies more competitive .
but the move was given an emphatic thumbs-down as the ratings agency moody 's downgraded ireland 's credit rating on friday by five notches , to baa1 , two notches above junk .
" while a downgrade had been anticipated , the severity of the downgrade is surprising , " dublin-based glas securities said .
spiraling debt eu leaders have spent most of 2010 trying to come up with successful measures to stop the region 's debt crisis spreading , but greece and ireland have already been forced to seek eu bailouts and portugal , spain , belgium and others are now in the spotlight .
on thursday leaders agreed on a change to the eu treaty to create the european stability mechanism -lrb- esm -rrb- – a permanent financial safety net of 750 billion euro from 2013 - that will help countries with liquidity problems and allow for debt restructuring of insolvent ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is determined to stabilize the euro eu leaders confirmed that private investors would be involved in the future euro zone rescue mechanism , a draft summit statement showed .
merkel said the fund would be sufficiently large .
" the more coherent economic policies are , the more we see by 2013 that states have made progress with a culture of stability , the lower the financial extent of the -lrb- rescue fund -rrb- will have to be , " she added .
germany lobbied hard for changes to the lisbon treaty and a pledge to pay out aid only if it 's " indispensable , " as leaders meeting in brussels on thursday agreed on the need to make a temporary trillion dollar rescue fund into a permanent one .
present dangers but market concerns are focused on whether the euro zone has sufficient immediate funds to come to the aid of the likes of portugal or spain , should they need a bailout next year .
" the new esm should safeguard the euro zone 's financial stability in the future .
however , it is to some extent window-dressing as it does not solve the current crisis , " said carsten brzeski , senior economist at ing bank .
the euro zone 's current fund - the european financial stability facility -lrb- efsf -rrb- - can borrow on the markets backed by euro zone government guarantees and has up to 440 billion euro to lend to governments cut off from market financing .
but many economists believe that even though only a small part of the efsf 's funds have been used to help ireland , it may turn out to be insufficient if more countries need help .
" european leaders failed to address the issue of debt sustainability and possible insolvency problems prior to 2013 .
debt restructuring , a common euro zone bond or an increase of the efsf ?
none of these issues have been addressed .
but they have to be , " brzeski said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markets reacted unvaforably to the eu summit " the preliminary outcome of the eu summit represents yet another missed opportunity by european policymakers to forcefully address investor concerns and calm markets in a more sustainable and pre-emptive manner , " said frank engels , economist at barclays capital .
underlining the need to reassure financial markets over fears that portugal and spain may be in need of bailouts soon , the european central bank also announced on thursday that it would double its capital to 10.76 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.3 billion -rrb- to cope with an increase in market volatility .
bonds kept off agenda discussion about the introduction of " e-bonds , " which would allow all european nations to borrow money at common rates , was kept off the agenda .
merkel has said that the common bond plan " would not rid europe of its weaknesses , it would simply transmit them across the board . "
germany is strongly opposed because e-bonds would effectively mean all 16 euro zone countries - or 17 when estonia joins the currency from jan .
1 , 2011 - financing a portion of their debt together and sharing a credit rating .
berlin , which is the benchmark issuer of debt in the euro zone and enjoys the lowest borrowing costs thanks to its economic strength and reliability , would have to surrender some of its credit to riskier euro states such as greece and ireland .
although germany is publicly opposed to the idea of euro-bonds , some in the euro zone back the idea .
" germany 's rejection of the expansion is another example of how euro zone governments do not agree on the best way forward to deal with this crisis , " said bnp paribas ' wattret .
" as a result , the measures taken have been piecemeal , unconvincing and reactive rather than pre-emptive .
this is going to have to change if confidence is to be restored in a lastingway , " he said .
leaders were meeting in their seventh summit of a busy year , as markets have grown increasingly wary that eu states might default on loans secured through individual government bonds .

dw-world.de opinion : heading in the right direction , but eurozone stability wo n't be easy as angela merkel tries to harmonize european economic policy , one should expect a lot more discord , according to christoph hasselbach , deutsche welle 's brussels correspondent .
a prime example is the euro bonds dispute .
-lrb- 17.12.2010 -rrb- irish debt dramatically downgraded despite eu rescue fund deal moody 's ratings agency has slashed its credit rating for ireland by five notches .
the drastic downgrade hardly shows confidence in ongoing eu efforts to safeguard the euro at the brussels summit .

but at germany 's behest , aid will only be paid if it 's considered ' indispensable ' to the stability of the euro .

the problem is becoming particularly acute in london , where 40 percent of all of the uk 's tb cases have been reported .
four in ten cases are reported in the capital , with the number of cases rising by nearly 50 percent since 1999 .
" it 's prevailing today in certain sections of the community that replicate conditions in victorian london , " tb expert alimuddin zumla of university college london told deutsche welle .
" most of the tb occurs in areas where there 's deprivation and poverty , and that 's where all the homeless are .
so we 've set up an endemic cycle of transmission . "
in all european countries , tuberculosis is largely concentrated in high-risk groups , such as migrants , refugees , homeless people , drug users , prisoners and hiv-infected people .
it is caused by a bacterial infection , usually of the lungs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some tb strains in south africa are resistant to all known tb drugs the increase in the number of tb cases in the uk has largely been among immigrant groups , although most were not new migrants .
among the cases of those born overseas , 85 percent had lived in the uk for two or more years and about half had lived in the country for five or more years .
the death toll from tb , which used to referred to as the " white plague " due to the pallor of those who had it , began to fall in london at the beginning of the 20th century thanks to improved living standards .
in the early 1960s , anti-tb drugs , better health services and bcg vaccinations continued to cut the number of cases .
the disease was thought to have been conquered by the early 1980s , but had something of a resurgence with the coming of hiv , which weakens the body 's immune system .
in london , as recently as 2000 , everyone thought the disease had been conquered , according to zumla .
but now among high-risk populations , tb rates are equivalent to those in africa .
drug resistant strains another alarming fact is that drug-resistant forms of the disease are beginning to be seen .
complying with the six-month regime of antibiotic treatment has meant that strains of tb have become resistant to drug treatments .
" people start feeling better after two months and stop taking their tablets and drug resistance occurs , " zumla said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in india , new treatment methods have helped cut the number of cases the situation is very serious in south africa , where strains have developed which are resistant to all known tb drugs .
in london , tb is showing up that is still treatable , but resistant to the most commonly used drugs .
zumla said the situation in london is reminiscent of multi-drug resistant tb outbreaks in prisons in the us in the 1990s .
they required a large financial investment to be brought under control .
he has called for a reconsideration of the delivery of tb services by britain 's national health service , standardized treatment and care methods and improvements in access to tb services .
he said because many with tb do not have permanent residences , it is difficult to get them to special clinics for treatment and ensure that they comply with drug regimens .
in new york , he said , a community-based model where health care workers take services to those affected has proven effective and should be adopted in the uk .
britain , one of the world 's major foreign-aid providers , is active in funding anti-tb programs overseas , but zumla says the country needs to look in its own backyard .
" we seem to neglect our own people here , " he said .

european leaders have agreed on a permanent rescue fund to cover countries in need of financial assistance .
german chancellor merkel hailed the summit as a success , but the measure has failed to reassure the markets . european leaders meeting in brussels have set up a permanent emergency fund to help debt-laden countries , and have agreed to rewrite some of the bloc 's rules in a bid to shore up the value of the euro .
" we will do everything to secure the financial stability of the euro as a whole , " german chancellor angela merkel said at a news conference after a european union summit .
she added that reform and stability will remain on the euro zone 's agenda next year as the bloc fights to secure the single currency and make its economies more competitive .
but the move was given an emphatic thumbs-down as the ratings agency moody 's downgraded ireland 's credit rating on friday by five notches , to baa1 , two notches above junk .
" while a downgrade had been anticipated , the severity of the downgrade is surprising , " dublin-based glas securities said .
spiraling debt eu leaders have spent most of 2010 trying to come up with successful measures to stop the region 's debt crisis spreading , but greece and ireland have already been forced to seek eu bailouts and portugal , spain , belgium and others are now in the spotlight .
on thursday leaders agreed on a change to the eu treaty to create the european stability mechanism -lrb- esm -rrb- – a permanent financial safety net of 750 billion euro from 2013 - that will help countries with liquidity problems and allow for debt restructuring of insolvent ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is determined to stabilize the euro eu leaders confirmed that private investors would be involved in the future euro zone rescue mechanism , a draft summit statement showed .
merkel said the fund would be sufficiently large .
" the more coherent economic policies are , the more we see by 2013 that states have made progress with a culture of stability , the lower the financial extent of the -lrb- rescue fund -rrb- will have to be , " she added .
germany lobbied hard for changes to the lisbon treaty and a pledge to pay out aid only if it 's " indispensable , " as leaders meeting in brussels on thursday agreed on the need to make a temporary trillion dollar rescue fund into a permanent one .
present dangers but market concerns are focused on whether the euro zone has sufficient immediate funds to come to the aid of the likes of portugal or spain , should they need a bailout next year .
" the new esm should safeguard the euro zone 's financial stability in the future .
however , it is to some extent window-dressing as it does not solve the current crisis , " said carsten brzeski , senior economist at ing bank .
the euro zone 's current fund - the european financial stability facility -lrb- efsf -rrb- - can borrow on the markets backed by euro zone government guarantees and has up to 440 billion euro to lend to governments cut off from market financing .
but many economists believe that even though only a small part of the efsf 's funds have been used to help ireland , it may turn out to be insufficient if more countries need help .
" european leaders failed to address the issue of debt sustainability and possible insolvency problems prior to 2013 .
debt restructuring , a common euro zone bond or an increase of the efsf ?
none of these issues have been addressed .
but they have to be , " brzeski said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markets reacted unvaforably to the eu summit " the preliminary outcome of the eu summit represents yet another missed opportunity by european policymakers to forcefully address investor concerns and calm markets in a more sustainable and pre-emptive manner , " said frank engels , economist at barclays capital .
underlining the need to reassure financial markets over fears that portugal and spain may be in need of bailouts soon , the european central bank also announced on thursday that it would double its capital to 10.76 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.3 billion -rrb- to cope with an increase in market volatility .
bonds kept off agenda discussion about the introduction of " e-bonds , " which would allow all european nations to borrow money at common rates , was kept off the agenda .
merkel has said that the common bond plan " would not rid europe of its weaknesses , it would simply transmit them across the board . "
germany is strongly opposed because e-bonds would effectively mean all 16 euro zone countries - or 17 when estonia joins the currency from jan .
1 , 2011 - financing a portion of their debt together and sharing a credit rating .
berlin , which is the benchmark issuer of debt in the euro zone and enjoys the lowest borrowing costs thanks to its economic strength and reliability , would have to surrender some of its credit to riskier euro states such as greece and ireland .
although germany is publicly opposed to the idea of euro-bonds , some in the euro zone back the idea .
" germany 's rejection of the expansion is another example of how euro zone governments do not agree on the best way forward to deal with this crisis , " said bnp paribas ' wattret .
" as a result , the measures taken have been piecemeal , unconvincing and reactive rather than pre-emptive .
this is going to have to change if confidence is to be restored in a lastingway , " he said .
leaders were meeting in their seventh summit of a busy year , as markets have grown increasingly wary that eu states might default on loans secured through individual government bonds .

dw-world.de opinion : heading in the right direction , but eurozone stability wo n't be easy as angela merkel tries to harmonize european economic policy , one should expect a lot more discord , according to christoph hasselbach , deutsche welle 's brussels correspondent .

but at germany 's behest , aid will only be paid if it 's considered ' indispensable ' to the stability of the euro .
-lrb- 17.12.2010 -rrb- merkel stands firm , but german parliament split over euro crisis in a speech to parliament , german chancellor angela merkel has fortified her stance against eurozone bonds and increasing the eu 's financial rescue fund a day ahead of an eu summit to consider new rules for the eurozone .

the motorway network came close to gridlock during the worst of the snowfall , with authorities in the western state of north rhine-westphalia alone recording a total of 185 kilometers -lrb- 115 miles -rrb- of traffic jams at one point late on thursday evening .
one single queue , on the a3 highway near leverkusen , stretched back 40 kilometers .
parts of the country even banned heavy goods vehicles from taking to the highways overnight , after several got bogged down in the snow ; but that ban has since been lifted .
although the situation is now clearing , police have asked all road users to plan plenty of extra time for their journeys , and to adapt their driving style to suit the conditions .
meanwhile , the german rail service , deutsche bahn - also facing numerous weather-related delays and cancellations - has opened up a free customer service phone hotline for timetable inquiries .

but was it worth leaving bed ? the snow does n't seem to have stopped falling for days , who knows how many degrees below zero it is outside , and all i can think of is staying under the covers and hibernating the next six months away . even with the heat blasting out of my radiators , i feel like i 've already turned into an icicle .
when the phone rings and the invitation comes for a trip to the christmas market i know i 'd have to be seriously deranged to voluntarily stand around in the freezing cold , my hands wrapped around a cup of hot alcoholic red liquid , dressed up with a few spices and a piece of moldy orange .
and i know my hangover the next day is guaranteed to be worse than if i 'd knocked back 15 tequila slammers . my friend valiantly proposes the traditional snacks of backfisch and kartoffelpuffer .
like a lump of fried cod wedged into a tiny roll or fried potato pancakes with apple sauce will convince me to expose myself to the worst mother nature has to offer germany 's capital .
" bah humbug ! "
i hear him mumble . scrooge ! ?
who me ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mulled wine is an essential part of the christmas market visit no , i 've got nothing against christmas , just against the cold !
give me a carol concert any day , a cup of nice mulled wine in front of an open fire , a jar of cookies perhaps and i 'll be whistling " we wish you a merry christmas " all the way into february - as long as i do n't have to step out the door . yet somehow the words , " ok , if i really must , " escape my lips in a whisper . this is germany after all and that means everyone must " do " at least one christmas market a year , if not two or three .
the idea is to wrap yourself in about a thousand layers and drag your reluctant body to the town square . frozen travels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : snow arrived early in berlin this year but that 's easier said than done in berlin .
from my place in neukoelln is no town square in sight , let alone a father christmas , string of tinsel or a loudspeaker blaring " jingle bells . "
i 'm going to have to brave the cold and leave my neighborhood before finding a warming mug of gluehwein . stumbling because of my partially frozen legs , i get off the tram only to be nearly knocked down by the siberian wind .
trudging through the snow , i focus on the ferris wheel at the christmas market on alexanderplatz to keep myself from turning around .
its flashing lights are all i can see as even the television tower has disappeared into the fog . when i find him , my friend is already propping up a kiosk ; sipping on his mulled wine and watching excited kids skate round and round on the ice rink .
tourists sing " away in a manger " in japanese or " the little drummer boy " in french .
my friend 's enthusiasm increases as i order the first of many gluehweins and join in for the next round of carols . measuring markets - and mulled wine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all gifts are worth giving these markets are not only about song and wine .
you 're supposed to wander the rows of stalls and buy socks your granddad does n't need , a wooly hat your mum will never wear , an amusing game for your boyfriend that he 'll never play .
but it 's all so expensive and little of it is even " made in germany . " but holy shit shopping is just around the corner .
it 's a designer christmas market that aims to open the wallets of 30-somethings who already buy anything they really want and can afford the far-from-cheap prices .
but the t-shirts with quirky designs , the cookies and candles with berlin motifs , the hand-knitted caps , and whacky trousers made out of pullovers have all been created by local artists , who plug their wares with wit .
i order another gluehwein and buy a hat . it keeps me snug at my next stop : the self-proclaimed " most beautiful christmas market in berlin " near the historic thoroughfare unter den linden .
tucked between the opera house and the friedrichswerder church , the market is indeed lovely .
the lights are tastefully arranged , the stands recall medieval times and the gluehwein tastes surprisingly good . yet not as good as the tiny christmas market in friedrichshain , where it is positively delicious and the atmosphere is delightful .
all around the samariter church are charming wooden shacks , where merry people sell mouth-watering home-baked cookies , colorful soft toys , teapots and other gifts friends and relatives are likely to appreciate . laden with colorful paper bags , i lumber home and immediately crawl back under the covers . the next day , the gluehwein 's warming effect has been replaced with a searing headache and burning throat .
i sneeze and think i should have followed my instincts .
instead i drank liters of cheap red wine and sang carols in all languages at the top of my voice .
next year , i will know better ! but in the meantime , merry christmas ! author : anne thomas editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 17.12.2010 electric cars hit us streets although future still uncertain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeffrey kaffee drives the first volt sold to the public out of the showroom the roll-out of electric cars by big automakers nissan and gm has sparked discussion about their prospects and acceptance by the larger public .
big hurdles remain but many are confident about electrics ' future . electric cars have had many false dawns over the years , but their proponents in the motor industry say now their time has come .
this december , two mass-market electric vehicles are hitting dealerships in selected markets around the world .
the general motors volt and nissan 's leaf are both aimed at delivering emissions-free driving at affordable prices .
motor trend magazine has called the chevy volt a " breakthrough " and a " game changer " and named it its 2011 car of the year .
a retiree in new jersey became the owner of the first volt , a gas-electric hybrid , to be sold to the public on december 15 , while nissan rolled out its leaf in a handful of us cities earlier this month .
both are scheduled for sale in europe in 2011 .
the developments have some experts saying that a major change is underway in the automobile industry .
general motors ' volt relies on a battery for the first 40 miles or 60 kilometers , after which a gas-powered engine kicks in to recharge the battery , which extends the range of the sedan by another 300 miles , or 480 kilometers .
in contrast , the leaf is all-electric with a range of around 100 miles , and just like early gas-powered vehicles , it might be difficult to find fuel nearby .
however , unlike the car 's predecessors , the leaf has a gps system .
press a small blue button and it will search for the nearest charging station .
still , many fear that ' range anxiety ' will put drivers off the all-electrics and that electric cars will remain a niche product .
but others say zero-emission vehicles will gain traction in the long term .
" we are the most bullish today by saying ten percent of the market 2020 will be zero emission , " nissan renault ceo carlos ghosn told a stanford university forum .
" frankly , i think the numbers will move up . ”
sticker shock bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the all-electric nissan leaf is more affordable it all sounds promising , although the price tag could limit its popularity .
even with a federal tax credit , the volt will set consumers back $ 33,500 -lrb- 25,155 euros -rrb- .
nissan 's leaf will not collide with bank accounts with quite the same ferocity .
tax incentives from washington and the state of california will bring the price of the four-door automobile down to just over $ 20,000 , about the same price as a gas-powered sedan .
still , that 's almost where the similarities with its gasoline-dependent brethren end .
starting up the leaf is a quiet process – there 's no traditional cranking sound of a starter .
there 's also no internal combustion engine .
instead , the car relies on lithium-ion batteries .
when it 's running , it emits a faint hum which has been added to alert pedestrians that a car is nearby .
nissan has spent $ 5 billion developing electric cars and ghosn insists this is a safe bet .
he says electric car sales will rise if oil prices go up and carbon dioxide restrictions get tougher .
event without new co2 rules , the international energy agency is promoting electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids as a way to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions , although the amount of the reduction depends on the electricity source .
while the cars themselves do n't emit greenhouse gases , the electricity plants where they get their energy from may .
" as a us average , a battery electric car we think would reduce greenhouse gas emission by about 40 percent compared to a conventional vehicle , " said timothy lipman of the university of california , berkeley .
" in california , because our grid is cleaner , it would probably be more like 60 percent reduction . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charging issues will have to be solved before electrics gain a wide following out of juice charging is a real issue when it comes to the acceptance or rejection of electrics with the wider population .
according to a recent report by the national research council , the current us electric grid could provide enough electricity to power 80 percent of today 's cars , if they were electric and provided that they were charged during off-peak hours , such as overnight .
however , some are looking at a different approach .
a company called " a better place " plans on offering electric car battery swapping pans , similar to mobile phone plans , in which monthly payments are based on the amounts of swapping and charging drivers do .
but some , such as berkeley 's lipman , doubt that such programs will be universally viable .
he said it might make sense to run a battery swapping operation in europe , where gas prices are relatively high , but in the us the system would probably not be able to compete with the relatively low price of gas . another battery-related worry has to do with a core component : lithium .
media reports say that bolivia , which has almost half the world supply of lithium , is considering tighter control of its lithium reserves .
other rare-earth resources , such as neodymium iron boron , could also pose problems .
china has the biggest deposits of this material has begun withholding it from the world market , pushing up its price .
future outlook government officials are already looking for substitutes for these materials .
one us government-funded research project is working on making electric cars easily affordable by radically redesigning their batteries , based on those used in hearing aids .
" we think that has the very distinct possibility of giving cars that now have a hundred mile range , a five hundred mile range at one third of the cost , " said us energy secretary david chu .
even if this technological breakthrough is far off on the horizon , lipman of berkeley 's transportation sustainability research center , says electric cars have a bright future .
he says they will eventually be embraced by more than just environmentalists .
" once people drive these cars , they see how they perform , how easy they are to operate , how quiet they are , the excellent acceleration and so forth , " he said .
" a lot of people are going to like these cars , not because they 're green , but because they 're better cars . "

there are some , however , who think it enhances creativity . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .

artists have n't abandoned search for psychedelic nirvana of inspiration do you think drugs can enhance artistic creativity ?
i know of no artwork made under drug influence that really is impressive and tells a good idea .
art is about ideas , drugs kill the ability to create them .
it 's funny how many great musicians failed more and more under the influence of drugs .
and if someone needs them to be creative or do art , he or she is maybe in the wrong profession .
the creativity should be naturally in you . - julius i do n't know , but i 've seen a number of movies and works of art where narcotics were clearly involved in their creation . - dairl yes , it is a medical fact that certain chemicals and enzymes make people more creative and active , no need to go far , look at caffeine as one .
people forget human beings are not only a soul but also a biological machine , a machine that is weak and sensitive to every element it interacts with , even if it is a substance or just a thought , weather conditions or social conditions , we react to everything around us and everything that is on the planet has impact on us in one way or another . - monie i have seen people paint under the influence of hashish and yes it definitely did enhance their creativity , the mind is free and hallucinating so it speaks for itself .
also look at movies , some were definitely written while under the influence . - johanna for some people , yes .
there is no given answer to the question .
people are different , and react differently when they ingest anything ... including food . - tracey to " open " a gate is not to reveal art .
if you can not find deep in your soul and mind the way to art , drugs are only a substitute not a tool that can enhance something . - adrian no , i have had artist friends try to get greater creativity from an altered state of mind , they get all excited and show their work , its just looks like art created by someone on drugs , not better quality . - jesse everyone is different , but it definitely does not work for me ...
i need clarity not cloudy .
as i say everyone is different , for some it may work .
i find when creating music high mostly i just jam endlessly or noodle if you will .
every day the same song is different , so one day it may sound great while the next disconnected and rambling .
for the listener it 's a 50/50 chance for a good show or recording . - randall depends on how creative the person is initially and how apt they are .
jimi hendrix was great guitar player because he practiced for many years and worked with other groups before he ever got famous . - erik i have no idea !
i do , however , know that substances , including alcohol , have taken the lives of many of our most talented creative minds ! - david compiled by stuart tiffen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 17.12.2010 irish debt dramatically downgraded despite eu rescue fund deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland 's international obligations just got a little larger moody 's ratings agency has slashed its credit rating for ireland by five notches .
the drastic downgrade hardly shows confidence in ongoing eu efforts to safeguard the euro at the brussels summit . ratings agency moody 's on friday dropped its rating on irish sovereign debt by five notches , suggesting it was less than enthused by thursday 's eu agreement on a permanent stability fund to protect debt-laden single currency users .
moody 's dropped ireland down five spots , from the third-highest available grade , aa2 , to baa1 , a risk level described as " lower medium grade . "
however , the agency added that this rating represented a " negative " outlook for a country , which would ordinarily have a very high credit rating .
moody 's said its decision was based " on the risk that the irish government 's financial strength could decline further if economic growth were to be weaker than currently projected or the costs of stabilizing the banking system turn out to be higher than currently forecast . "
european leaders gathered at a summit in brussels were seeking to shore up debt-laden eurozone countries , and the single european currency more generally ; but the measures agreed on thursday evidently did little to impress moody 's .
the establishment of a permanent rescue mechanism for eurozone members was designed , at least in part , to dispel concerns in the markets that europe may never repay its debts .
last , but not least bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen 's plan for recovery is unlikely to salvage his prime ministerial post " moody 's has this morning become the third of the three major ratings agencies to downgrade irish sovereign debt in the past four weeks , " the chief economist for dublin-based goodbody stockbroker 's , dermot o 'leary said .
" it has , however , outdone the other two with the scale of the downgrade . "
moody 's move follows similar , but smaller , reductions by fellow credit agencies , standard and poor 's and fitch .
the change means that investors will now demand a higher return in exchange for purchasing government bonds , effectively upping the price of existing and future loans for the irish government .
ireland recently became the second eurozone country , after greece , to seek emergency loans worth roughly 85 billion euros -lrb- $ 113 billion -rrb- from the european union and the international monetary fund .
the country 's rising national debt and enormous 2010 budget deficit - boosted by a government bailout of the country 's biggest moneylender , anglo irish bank - forced the government in dublin to call for help .
the financial turmoil has brought prime minister brian cowen 's coalition government to its knees , a snap election is expected early next year .

a prime example is the euro bonds dispute . the two birth defects of the monetary union have come back to brutally haunt the eu : from the outset there was no common economic policy running parallel to the common currency .
hence huge imbalances were created in the eurozone .
and secondly , some of the member countries should never have been included in the euro in the first place .
greece is only the most flagrant , but not the only , example .
for a long time the eu has closed its eyes to these facts .
now they must deal with the consequences in a hurry .
in principle , the measures adopted are heading in the right direction .
governments are committing themselves to do everything necessary to protect the stability of the euro .
the starkness and vagueness of this statement is not a disadvantage .
obviously in theory there are limits to aid , but when numbers are mentioned , speculators are immediately encouraged to test the limits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph hasselbach , dw correspondent in brussels the permanent crisis mechanism is a sign of this mutual protection .
any doubts that the euro countries would abandon a country in an emergency , would cause a chain reaction .
this would break apart the monetary union , and if that happened , the germans especially would find it very expensive .
on the other hand , we can expect a lot of resentment if economic policy is adjusted belatedly in the euro countries .
some people might not perhaps realize what that means .
it is not just about fiscal consolidation , in itself difficult enough .
it 's also about sacred cows like national taxes , retirement policy and labor market legislation , to name only a few major areas .
this is about long national traditions , painstakingly developed social consensus .
while an alignment wo n't lead to a complete standardization , countries can not remain as they are now with differences as big as they are .
it is important that the benchmark for any harmonization is n't a so-called golden mean , but global competitiveness .
time is short .
the crisis is forcing the euro-zone countries to a level of integration that they would not have addressed voluntarily .
but that 's how it is in most cases .
if europe tries hard , it could actually emerge from the crisis stronger .

but with extreme snow across europe , father christmas might just not be able to get to customers in time this year . this year 's holiday shopping season was supposed to generate record online retail sales across europe - from food deliveries to presents .
british online retail association imrg estimates a rise in sales for december by 16 percent to 6.4 billion pounds -lrb- 7.5 billion euros -rrb- .
for 2010 , germany expects some 18.3 billion euros in online sales , up 18 percent .
no food deliveries to scotland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some british companies have stopped their trucks from travelling up to scotland however , with winter having hit europe early and heavily this year , some online retailers are now feeling the effects of snow-blocked roads .
especially hard hit are the british isles .
few tesco delivery trucks are able to make their rounds due to snowy streets .
on its mail-order website , the giant british food retailer is informing customers that it is currently unable to take any new orders in scotland , among other regions .
marks and spencer 's is also issuing regular weather updates on its homepage .
and like tesco , the food and clothing retailer has also temporarily suspended orders from scotland .
" i think customers will not want to risk things and will go to local shops instead of buying online , " natalie berg from the industry analyst planet retail told financial times deutschland .
snowed-in side streets in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plenty of presents are still en route across europe germany is also affected .
more than 80,000 mail carriers across germany have to walk across unplowed streets .
conditions differ considerably from community to community , " some communities are simply not clearing side streets this year , " anke baumann , a spokeswoman from german postal service deutsche post / dhl , told deutsche welle .
" that means our mail carriers have to walk back and forth through the snow carrying single parcels every time because they ca n't even push carts through the snow . "
deutsche post is promising customers in germany that parcels dropped off by noon on december 22 will be delivered by december 24 , christmas eve .
" that 's a promise we 're doing our best to fulfil , " said baumann who , in the same breath , warned : " it might just be impossible in individual cases to stick to it . "
deutsche post has expanded its operating hours to cope with the adverse weather conditions .
parcels ordered from online retailer amazon , for instance , will be delivered on the sunday before christmas - an exception in germany where business traditionally comes to a standstill on sundays .
nevertheless , amazon germany is advising customers to check their order status online because , as a company spokesperson told deutsche welle , " delays of one or two days are currently likely to occur . "
germany 's biggest mail-order clothing retailer otto declined to comment whether goods were being delivered on time .
twice as many parcels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more goods ordered online and christmas coming up : postmen hardly ever get a break this year the festive season traditionally sees a hike in the number of parcels delivered every year .
and this year is no exception , thanks largely to the growing popularity of purchasing merchandise online .
in the weeks leading up to christmas , the number of parcels delivered daily in germany this year has already increased from an average 2.5 million to about 5 million .
" and it 's going to be even more in the last week before christmas , " said baumann .
while germany has struggled with snowed-in side streets and temporarily closed airports to keep deliveries moving , britain does n't seem to be prepared for continuous frost and snow at all .
the country lacks snowploughs to clear roads .
in edinburgh , in fact , the army has been called in to help clear streets .
the country 's postal service , royal mail , is investing 20 billion pounds to be able to handle the christmas mail and parcels .
shop while you wait bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an exception for christmas : parcels are being delivered also on sundays in germany harsh weather conditions have generally been understood to spur online sales because customers can shop comfortably from home .
with the expected delays this year , however , experts say some customers might refrain from ordering online this shopping season .
current conditions demonstrate how sensitive online retail is to adverse weather conditions .
online shopping is still for now more popular in britain than it is in germany but it is becoming rapidly popular in europe 's largest economy .
some of the increase , interestingly , is attributed to smartphone users who like to use their downtime to shop online with their phones .
poinsettias still available online orders have also increased for fleurop .
germany 's largest flower mail-order service operates a network of 8,000 florists nationwide .
that dense network shortens distances between florists and customers , ensuring swift delivery .
but in extreme weather conditions , flights can be delayed or cancelled altogether .
occasionally , fleurop florists have to warn customers that a certain flower might not be deliverable on time .
but a spokesperson from fleurop told deutsche welle that , so far , it has not been forced to issue a warning for the popular christmas plant poinsettia – which is still readily available across germany .

a prime example is the euro bonds dispute . the two birth defects of the monetary union have come back to brutally haunt the eu : from the outset there was no common economic policy running parallel to the common currency .
hence huge imbalances were created in the eurozone .
and secondly , some of the member countries should never have been included in the euro in the first place .
greece is only the most flagrant , but not the only , example .
for a long time the eu has closed its eyes to these facts .
now they must deal with the consequences in a hurry .
in principle , the measures adopted are heading in the right direction .
governments are committing themselves to do everything necessary to protect the stability of the euro .
the starkness and vagueness of this statement is not a disadvantage .
obviously in theory there are limits to aid , but when numbers are mentioned , speculators are immediately encouraged to test the limits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph hasselbach , dw correspondent in brussels the permanent crisis mechanism is a sign of this mutual protection .
any doubts that the euro countries would abandon a country in an emergency , would cause a chain reaction .
this would break apart the monetary union , and if that happened , the germans especially would find it very expensive .
on the other hand , we can expect a lot of resentment if economic policy is adjusted belatedly in the euro countries .
some people might not perhaps realize what that means .
it is not just about fiscal consolidation , in itself difficult enough .
it 's also about sacred cows like national taxes , retirement policy and labor market legislation , to name only a few major areas .
this is about long national traditions , painstakingly developed social consensus .
while an alignment wo n't lead to a complete standardization , countries can not remain as they are now with differences as big as they are .
it is important that the benchmark for any harmonization is n't a so-called golden mean , but global competitiveness .
time is short .
the crisis is forcing the euro-zone countries to a level of integration that they would not have addressed voluntarily .
but that 's how it is in most cases .
if europe tries hard , it could actually emerge from the crisis stronger .

hundreds of road traffic accidents and grounded airplanes have made life difficult for people and police alike . heavy snowfall across much of germany has caused widespread traffic jams and hundreds of accidents on the roads , as well as severely interrupting air and rail travel .
the blizzard " petra " has largely abated but the german weather service , the dwd , is still issuing mild weather warnings nationwide , describing the overall situation on its website as " extremely wintery across the board . "
meanwhile , authorities are scrambling to clear thursday 's heavy snowfall from the country 's highways , runways and railways .
airport backlogs germany 's largest airport , in frankfurt , was operating " entirely without disruptions " early on friday , according to a spokesman for the hub .
nevertheless , roughly 100 flights have been cancelled , partly because of problems at other european airports , and also as a knock-on effect from the airport 's brief closure on thursday night .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the going has been unusually slow on the fast-moving autobahns stuttgart airport , where snow was still falling heavily on friday morning , reported delays caused by the intermittent closure of runways in order to clear away fresh snow .
several other airports were still battling to minimize delays on friday , and the german red cross has been taking camp beds , sleeping bags and blankets to german terminals , anticipating more stranded passengers .
almost 200 kilometers of traffic jams the greatest disruptions hit germany 's road network , especially the highways .
thousands of road traffic accidents were recorded by german police on thursday , mostly caused by the adverse weather ; three people lost their lives in the crashes .
the motorway network came close to gridlock during the worst of the snowfall , with authorities in the western state of north rhine-westphalia alone recording a total of 185 kilometers -lrb- 115 miles -rrb- of traffic jams at one point late on thursday evening .
one single queue , on the a3 highway near leverkusen , stretched back 40 kilometers .
parts of the country even banned heavy goods vehicles from taking to the highways overnight , after several got bogged down in the snow ; but that ban has since been lifted .
although the situation is now clearing , police have asked all road users to plan plenty of extra time for their journeys , and to adapt their driving style to suit the conditions .
meanwhile , the german rail service , deutsche bahn - also facing numerous weather-related delays and cancellations - has opened up a free customer service phone hotline for timetable inquiries .

schalke , stuttgart and leverkusen , meanwhile , were handed less formidable foes in europe . bayern fans will be wary of their team ’ s next test in the champions league as the club were handed a difficult tie with cup holders inter milan .
they will also be looking for revenge in the two-legged match , having lost to inter in last year ’ s final .
bayern sporting director christian nerlinger was quick to confirm the club was relishing a chance to reverse last year ’ s defeat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern fans hope this season 's encounter does n't end in tears " we still dwell a little on the lost final in madrid and now we have the opportunity with these two new matches against inter to put things right , " said nerlinger .
" it 's going to be difficult , but it could n't be more interesting for us . "
having won their qualifying group e , the bavarians avoided many of the tournament ’ s strongest sides - but didn ’ t miss inter , who finished a somewhat surprising second to tottenham hotspur in group a. bayern president karl-heinz rummenigge spoke for most when he called inter " without a doubt the most difficult we could have drawn . "
schalke luckier the growing spanish faction at gelsenkirchen side schalke will be looking forward to the club ’ s match against valencia .
with spaniards raul , jose manuel jurado and sergio escudero in the squad , along with christian metzelder and klaas jan huntelaar , who have experience playing in the spanish top flight , schalke can count on a good deal of insight into the playing style of the club from spain ’ s mediterranean coast .
“ it ’ s an attractive , and at the same time difficult draw , ” said schalke ’ s coach and general manager felix magath .
“ all the same , it ’ s our goal to get past valencia . ”
the two teams squared off in the group stage in the fall of 2007 , when valencia got the better of schalke , beating them in germany and drawing at home .
but as schalke defender benedikt hoewedes pointed out , just as schalke is a much different team to three years ago , so is valencia .
“ they ’ ve lost two very strong players in david silva and david villa , ” said hoewedes .
the round of 16 draw in full bildunterschrift : the other cup german sides bayer leverkusen and vfb stuttgart found out their opponents in the europa league round of 32 on friday .
group h winners stuttgart face a rather tough test in benfica , the portuguese champions who dropped out of schalke ’ s group in the champions league .
leverkusen , who won group b , will fancy their chances against the relatively inexperienced ukrainian club metallist kharkov , second place finishers in group i. the europa league round of 32 fixtures are two-legged matches set for february 17th and 24th , or 15th and 22nd .

hundreds of road traffic accidents and grounded airplanes have made life difficult for people and police alike . heavy snowfall across much of germany has caused widespread traffic jams and hundreds of accidents on the roads , as well as severely interrupting air and rail travel .
the blizzard " petra " has largely abated but the german weather service , the dwd , is still issuing mild weather warnings nationwide , describing the overall situation on its website as " extremely wintery across the board . "
meanwhile , authorities are scrambling to clear thursday 's heavy snowfall from the country 's highways , runways and railways .
airport backlogs germany 's largest airport , in frankfurt , was operating " entirely without disruptions " early on friday , according to a spokesman for the hub .
nevertheless , roughly 100 flights have been cancelled , partly because of problems at other european airports , and also as a knock-on effect from the airport 's brief closure on thursday night .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the going has been unusually slow on the fast-moving autobahns stuttgart airport , where snow was still falling heavily on friday morning , reported delays caused by the intermittent closure of runways in order to clear away fresh snow .
several other airports were still battling to minimize delays on friday , and the german red cross has been taking camp beds , sleeping bags and blankets to german terminals , anticipating more stranded passengers .
almost 200 kilometers of traffic jams the greatest disruptions hit germany 's road network , especially the highways .
thousands of road traffic accidents were recorded by german police on thursday , mostly caused by the adverse weather ; three people lost their lives in the crashes .
the motorway network came close to gridlock during the worst of the snowfall , with authorities in the western state of north rhine-westphalia alone recording a total of 185 kilometers -lrb- 115 miles -rrb- of traffic jams at one point late on thursday evening .
one single queue , on the a3 highway near leverkusen , stretched back 40 kilometers .
parts of the country even banned heavy goods vehicles from taking to the highways overnight , after several got bogged down in the snow ; but that ban has since been lifted .
although the situation is now clearing , police have asked all road users to plan plenty of extra time for their journeys , and to adapt their driving style to suit the conditions .
meanwhile , the german rail service , deutsche bahn - also facing numerous weather-related delays and cancellations - has opened up a free customer service phone hotline for timetable inquiries .

but was it worth leaving bed ? the snow does n't seem to have stopped falling for days , who knows how many degrees below zero it is outside , and all i can think of is staying under the covers and hibernating the next six months away . even with the heat blasting out of my radiators , i feel like i 've already turned into an icicle .
when the phone rings and the invitation comes for a trip to the christmas market i know i 'd have to be seriously deranged to voluntarily stand around in the freezing cold , my hands wrapped around a cup of hot alcoholic red liquid , dressed up with a few spices and a piece of moldy orange .
and i know my hangover the next day is guaranteed to be worse than if i 'd knocked back 15 tequila slammers . my friend valiantly proposes the traditional snacks of backfisch and kartoffelpuffer .
like a lump of fried cod wedged into a tiny roll or fried potato pancakes with apple sauce will convince me to expose myself to the worst mother nature has to offer germany 's capital .
" bah humbug ! "
i hear him mumble . scrooge ! ?
who me ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mulled wine is an essential part of the christmas market visit no , i 've got nothing against christmas , just against the cold !
give me a carol concert any day , a cup of nice mulled wine in front of an open fire , a jar of cookies perhaps and i 'll be whistling " we wish you a merry christmas " all the way into february - as long as i do n't have to step out the door . yet somehow the words , " ok , if i really must , " escape my lips in a whisper . this is germany after all and that means everyone must " do " at least one christmas market a year , if not two or three .
the idea is to wrap yourself in about a thousand layers and drag your reluctant body to the town square . frozen travels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : snow arrived early in berlin this year but that 's easier said than done in berlin .
from my place in neukoelln is no town square in sight , let alone a father christmas , string of tinsel or a loudspeaker blaring " jingle bells . "
i 'm going to have to brave the cold and leave my neighborhood before finding a warming mug of gluehwein . stumbling because of my partially frozen legs , i get off the tram only to be nearly knocked down by the siberian wind .
trudging through the snow , i focus on the ferris wheel at the christmas market on alexanderplatz to keep myself from turning around .
its flashing lights are all i can see as even the television tower has disappeared into the fog . when i find him , my friend is already propping up a kiosk ; sipping on his mulled wine and watching excited kids skate round and round on the ice rink .
tourists sing " away in a manger " in japanese or " the little drummer boy " in french .
my friend 's enthusiasm increases as i order the first of many gluehweins and join in for the next round of carols . measuring markets - and mulled wine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all gifts are worth giving these markets are not only about song and wine .
you 're supposed to wander the rows of stalls and buy socks your granddad does n't need , a wooly hat your mum will never wear , an amusing game for your boyfriend that he 'll never play .
but it 's all so expensive and little of it is even " made in germany . " but holy shit shopping is just around the corner .
it 's a designer christmas market that aims to open the wallets of 30-somethings who already buy anything they really want and can afford the far-from-cheap prices .
but the t-shirts with quirky designs , the cookies and candles with berlin motifs , the hand-knitted caps , and whacky trousers made out of pullovers have all been created by local artists , who plug their wares with wit .
i order another gluehwein and buy a hat . it keeps me snug at my next stop : the self-proclaimed " most beautiful christmas market in berlin " near the historic thoroughfare unter den linden .
tucked between the opera house and the friedrichswerder church , the market is indeed lovely .
the lights are tastefully arranged , the stands recall medieval times and the gluehwein tastes surprisingly good . yet not as good as the tiny christmas market in friedrichshain , where it is positively delicious and the atmosphere is delightful .
all around the samariter church are charming wooden shacks , where merry people sell mouth-watering home-baked cookies , colorful soft toys , teapots and other gifts friends and relatives are likely to appreciate . laden with colorful paper bags , i lumber home and immediately crawl back under the covers . the next day , the gluehwein 's warming effect has been replaced with a searing headache and burning throat .
i sneeze and think i should have followed my instincts .
instead i drank liters of cheap red wine and sang carols in all languages at the top of my voice .
next year , i will know better ! but in the meantime , merry christmas ! author : anne thomas editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he 's apologized for his recent comments that gay fans should n't fornicate at the qatar world cup . fifa president sepp blatter has apologized for saying that gay fans should " refrain from sexual activity " if they go to the 2022 world cup in qatar .
homosexuality is illegal in qatar and blatter 's original comments provoked anger among gay rights groups .
" i regret my comment , i did n't want to hurt anyone .
we are against discrimination .
i apologize for that comment , " blatter told a press conference ahead of saturday 's club world cup .
" it was not my intention and it will never be my intention to go into any discrimination because this is exactly what we -lrb- fifa -rrb- are against , so therefore if somebody feels they have been hurt , then i regret and i present apologies for that , " he added .
gay rights activists have reacted furiously after the comments and called for the head of the world soccer governing body to either apologize or resign after his comments this week .
former nba basketball star john amaechi - who revealed he was gay in 2007 - led the attack , accusing the fifa president of " epic , archaic , neanderthal , ignorance . "
a reputation for gaffes " with little more than an afterthought fifa has endorsed the marginalization of lgbt -lsb- lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender -rsb- people around the world , " he wrote on his blog .
" anything less than a full reversal of his position is unacceptable , " amaechi added .
blatter 's remarks are just the latest example of the 74-year-old football chief putting his foot in his mouth .
he told women footballers in 2004 that the best way to make their sport more popular would be to wear " tighter shorts . "
earlier this year , he suggested that john terry 's alleged affair , which led to him being stripped of the england captaincy , would have been applauded in latin countries .
qatar was awarded the world cup this month ahead of australia , the united states , japan and south korea .

schalke , stuttgart and leverkusen , meanwhile , were handed less formidable foes in europe . bayern fans will be wary of their team ’ s next test in the champions league as the club were handed a difficult tie with cup holders inter milan .
they will also be looking for revenge in the two-legged match , having lost to inter in last year ’ s final .
bayern sporting director christian nerlinger was quick to confirm the club was relishing a chance to reverse last year ’ s defeat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern fans hope this season 's encounter does n't end in tears " we still dwell a little on the lost final in madrid and now we have the opportunity with these two new matches against inter to put things right , " said nerlinger .
" it 's going to be difficult , but it could n't be more interesting for us . "
having won their qualifying group e , the bavarians avoided many of the tournament ’ s strongest sides - but didn ’ t miss inter , who finished a somewhat surprising second to tottenham hotspur in group a. bayern president karl-heinz rummenigge spoke for most when he called inter " without a doubt the most difficult we could have drawn . "
schalke luckier the growing spanish faction at gelsenkirchen side schalke will be looking forward to the club ’ s match against valencia .
with spaniards raul , jose manuel jurado and sergio escudero in the squad , along with christian metzelder and klaas jan huntelaar , who have experience playing in the spanish top flight , schalke can count on a good deal of insight into the playing style of the club from spain ’ s mediterranean coast .
“ it ’ s an attractive , and at the same time difficult draw , ” said schalke ’ s coach and general manager felix magath .
“ all the same , it ’ s our goal to get past valencia . ”
the two teams squared off in the group stage in the fall of 2007 , when valencia got the better of schalke , beating them in germany and drawing at home .
but as schalke defender benedikt hoewedes pointed out , just as schalke is a much different team to three years ago , so is valencia .
“ they ’ ve lost two very strong players in david silva and david villa , ” said hoewedes .
the round of 16 draw in full bildunterschrift : the other cup german sides bayer leverkusen and vfb stuttgart found out their opponents in the europa league round of 32 on friday .
group h winners stuttgart face a rather tough test in benfica , the portuguese champions who dropped out of schalke ’ s group in the champions league .
leverkusen , who won group b , will fancy their chances against the relatively inexperienced ukrainian club metallist kharkov , second place finishers in group i. the europa league round of 32 fixtures are two-legged matches set for february 17th and 24th , or 15th and 22nd .

having won their qualifying group e , the bavarians avoided many of the tournament ’ s strongest sides - but didn ’ t miss inter , who finished a somewhat surprising second to tottenham hotspur in group a. bayern president karl-heinz rummenigge spoke for most when he called inter " without a doubt the most difficult we could have drawn . "
schalke luckier the growing spanish faction at gelsenkirchen side schalke will be looking forward to the club ’ s match against valencia .
with spaniards raul , jose manuel jurado and sergio escudero in the squad , along with christian metzelder and klaas jan huntelaar , who have experience playing in the spanish top flight , schalke can count on a good deal of insight into the playing style of the club from spain ’ s mediterranean coast .
“ it ’ s an attractive , and at the same time difficult draw , ” said schalke ’ s coach and general manager felix magath .
“ all the same , it ’ s our goal to get past valencia . ”
the two teams squared off in the group stage in the fall of 2007 , when valencia got the better of schalke , beating them in germany and drawing at home .
but as schalke defender benedikt hoewedes pointed out , just as schalke is a much different team to three years ago , so is valencia .
“ they ’ ve lost two very strong players in david silva and david villa , ” said hoewedes .
the round of 16 draw in full bildunterschrift : the other cup german sides bayer leverkusen and vfb stuttgart found out their opponents in the europa league round of 32 on friday .
group h winners stuttgart face a rather tough test in benfica , the portuguese champions who dropped out of schalke ’ s group in the champions league .
leverkusen , who won group b , will fancy their chances against the relatively inexperienced ukrainian club metallist kharkov , second place finishers in group i. the europa league round of 32 fixtures are two-legged matches set for february 17th and 24th , or 15th and 22nd .

the problem is becoming particularly acute in london , where 40 percent of all of the uk 's tb cases have been reported .
four in ten cases are reported in the capital , with the number of cases rising by nearly 50 percent since 1999 .
" it 's prevailing today in certain sections of the community that replicate conditions in victorian london , " tb expert alimuddin zumla of university college london told deutsche welle .
" most of the tb occurs in areas where there 's deprivation and poverty , and that 's where all the homeless are .
so we 've set up an endemic cycle of transmission . "
in all european countries , tuberculosis is largely concentrated in high-risk groups , such as migrants , refugees , homeless people , drug users , prisoners and hiv-infected people .
it is caused by a bacterial infection , usually of the lungs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some tb strains in south africa are resistant to all known tb drugs the increase in the number of tb cases in the uk has largely been among immigrant groups , although most were not new migrants .
among the cases of those born overseas , 85 percent had lived in the uk for two or more years and about half had lived in the country for five or more years .
the death toll from tb , which used to referred to as the " white plague " due to the pallor of those who had it , began to fall in london at the beginning of the 20th century thanks to improved living standards .
in the early 1960s , anti-tb drugs , better health services and bcg vaccinations continued to cut the number of cases .
the disease was thought to have been conquered by the early 1980s , but had something of a resurgence with the coming of hiv , which weakens the body 's immune system .
in london , as recently as 2000 , everyone thought the disease had been conquered , according to zumla .
but now among high-risk populations , tb rates are equivalent to those in africa .
drug resistant strains another alarming fact is that drug-resistant forms of the disease are beginning to be seen .
complying with the six-month regime of antibiotic treatment has meant that strains of tb have become resistant to drug treatments .
" people start feeling better after two months and stop taking their tablets and drug resistance occurs , " zumla said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in india , new treatment methods have helped cut the number of cases the situation is very serious in south africa , where strains have developed which are resistant to all known tb drugs .
in london , tb is showing up that is still treatable , but resistant to the most commonly used drugs .
zumla said the situation in london is reminiscent of multi-drug resistant tb outbreaks in prisons in the us in the 1990s .
they required a large financial investment to be brought under control .
he has called for a reconsideration of the delivery of tb services by britain 's national health service , standardized treatment and care methods and improvements in access to tb services .
he said because many with tb do not have permanent residences , it is difficult to get them to special clinics for treatment and ensure that they comply with drug regimens .
in new york , he said , a community-based model where health care workers take services to those affected has proven effective and should be adopted in the uk .
britain , one of the world 's major foreign-aid providers , is active in funding anti-tb programs overseas , but zumla says the country needs to look in its own backyard .
" we seem to neglect our own people here , " he said .

european leaders have agreed on a permanent rescue fund to cover countries in need of financial assistance .
german chancellor merkel hailed the summit as a success , but the measure has failed to reassure the markets . european leaders meeting in brussels have set up a permanent emergency fund to help debt-laden countries , and have agreed to rewrite some of the bloc 's rules in a bid to shore up the value of the euro .
" we will do everything to secure the financial stability of the euro as a whole , " german chancellor angela merkel said at a news conference after a european union summit .
she added that reform and stability will remain on the euro zone 's agenda next year as the bloc fights to secure the single currency and make its economies more competitive .
but the move was given an emphatic thumbs-down as the ratings agency moody 's downgraded ireland 's credit rating on friday by five notches , to baa1 , two notches above junk .
" while a downgrade had been anticipated , the severity of the downgrade is surprising , " dublin-based glas securities said .
spiraling debt eu leaders have spent most of 2010 trying to come up with successful measures to stop the region 's debt crisis spreading , but greece and ireland have already been forced to seek eu bailouts and portugal , spain , belgium and others are now in the spotlight .
on thursday leaders agreed on a change to the eu treaty to create the european stability mechanism -lrb- esm -rrb- – a permanent financial safety net of 750 billion euro from 2013 - that will help countries with liquidity problems and allow for debt restructuring of insolvent ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is determined to stabilize the euro eu leaders confirmed that private investors would be involved in the future euro zone rescue mechanism , a draft summit statement showed .
merkel said the fund would be sufficiently large .
" the more coherent economic policies are , the more we see by 2013 that states have made progress with a culture of stability , the lower the financial extent of the -lrb- rescue fund -rrb- will have to be , " she added .
germany lobbied hard for changes to the lisbon treaty and a pledge to pay out aid only if it 's " indispensable , " as leaders meeting in brussels on thursday agreed on the need to make a temporary trillion dollar rescue fund into a permanent one .
present dangers but market concerns are focused on whether the euro zone has sufficient immediate funds to come to the aid of the likes of portugal or spain , should they need a bailout next year .
" the new esm should safeguard the euro zone 's financial stability in the future .
however , it is to some extent window-dressing as it does not solve the current crisis , " said carsten brzeski , senior economist at ing bank .
the euro zone 's current fund - the european financial stability facility -lrb- efsf -rrb- - can borrow on the markets backed by euro zone government guarantees and has up to 440 billion euro to lend to governments cut off from market financing .
but many economists believe that even though only a small part of the efsf 's funds have been used to help ireland , it may turn out to be insufficient if more countries need help .
" european leaders failed to address the issue of debt sustainability and possible insolvency problems prior to 2013 .
debt restructuring , a common euro zone bond or an increase of the efsf ?
none of these issues have been addressed .
but they have to be , " brzeski said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markets reacted unvaforably to the eu summit " the preliminary outcome of the eu summit represents yet another missed opportunity by european policymakers to forcefully address investor concerns and calm markets in a more sustainable and pre-emptive manner , " said frank engels , economist at barclays capital .
underlining the need to reassure financial markets over fears that portugal and spain may be in need of bailouts soon , the european central bank also announced on thursday that it would double its capital to 10.76 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.3 billion -rrb- to cope with an increase in market volatility .
bonds kept off agenda discussion about the introduction of " e-bonds , " which would allow all european nations to borrow money at common rates , was kept off the agenda .
merkel has said that the common bond plan " would not rid europe of its weaknesses , it would simply transmit them across the board . "
germany is strongly opposed because e-bonds would effectively mean all 16 euro zone countries - or 17 when estonia joins the currency from jan .
1 , 2011 - financing a portion of their debt together and sharing a credit rating .
berlin , which is the benchmark issuer of debt in the euro zone and enjoys the lowest borrowing costs thanks to its economic strength and reliability , would have to surrender some of its credit to riskier euro states such as greece and ireland .
although germany is publicly opposed to the idea of euro-bonds , some in the euro zone back the idea .
" germany 's rejection of the expansion is another example of how euro zone governments do not agree on the best way forward to deal with this crisis , " said bnp paribas ' wattret .
" as a result , the measures taken have been piecemeal , unconvincing and reactive rather than pre-emptive .
this is going to have to change if confidence is to be restored in a lastingway , " he said .
leaders were meeting in their seventh summit of a busy year , as markets have grown increasingly wary that eu states might default on loans secured through individual government bonds .

as the nation slips toward chaos , the international community fears a return to war . ivory coast is bracing for more violent unrest following clashes on thursday in which at least 20 people were killed after security forces loyal to incumbent president laurent gbagbo fired on pro-alassane quattara supporters in abidjan .
the united states has in the meantime pulled all its non-emergency embassy staff out of the country .
the eu has given gbagbo until the end of the week to give up his claim to the presidency or face sanctions and possible un prosecution .
french president nicolas sarkozy said in brussels that eu leaders were unanimous in their call for gbagbo to leave office . earlier this week , eu foreign ministers approved a first round of sanctions , including an asset freeze and travel ban , on several other leading officials .
observers say that the key to power is control over the state television headquarters still held by gbagbo .
" state tv is crucial to gain and preserve power , " koné lanciné , general secretary of a broadcasting trade union , told deutsche welle .
" the fact that gbagbo still has some control in ivory coast is largely due to the fact that he controls the state-run media . "
on friday a number of independent newspapers were shut down to prevent them from reporting on the deadly clashes .
" rti -lrb- state broadcaster - ed . -rrb- has turned into a propaganda medium .
they 're disseminating hate in all its forms , ethnic hatred and racial hatred , " said lanciné .
the opposition challenger ouattara and incumbent gbagbo both claimed victory in the nov .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gbagbo and ouattara both claimed victory in the election despite ouattara 's support in the international community , gbagbo has defied international calls to cede power and has rejected the un 's ratification of the result .
the current situation raises fears of a return to the violent divisions which split the nation in two between the rebel-controlled north and government-controlled south during the civil war of 2002-2003 .
international concern heightens as crisis deepens the situation is already sending nervous ripples through the international community , especially in organizations responsible for funding development programs in the poverty-stricken nation .
the world bank and the african development bank have both questioned the " usefulness and effectiveness " of their aid programs to ivory coast given the breakdown in governance and have admitted to concerns that the turmoil in the country could drive many more ivorians further into poverty while causing instability and affecting economic prosperity in the wider west african sub-region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international organizations fear the unrest could spread " although the situation is troubling , the international community has reacted very quickly , " richard gowan , an africa expert with the european council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .

compromise seems impossible , even with un intervention dr. dirk khonert , the deputy director of the institute of african affairs at the german institute of global and area studies -lrb- giga -rrb- and a member of the eu election observation team in ivory coast , said that the main stumbling block to a solution was whether both rival candidates would be prepared to accept defeat .
" ouattara has a very strong international backing against gbagbo , " he told deutsche welle .
" thus , he derives his legitimacy not only internally but also externally by the backing of the international community .
it is difficult to imagine under these conditions that he and his followers would be inclined to accept a compromise on the question of the presidency . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un efforts to keep the peace may not prevent conflict it is unlikely that a compromise will satisfy either man as any deal may have to be brokered by the united nations which has given its support to ouattara , therefore alienating gbagbo 's team .
gbagbo has a long record of ignoring international pressure and appears to be ready to take the country to the brink of war to retain power .
he is also unlikely to consider the best option available to african union mediators which would be a government of national reconciliation , with ouattara as president and a significant input of gbagbo activists in the cabinet .
although the un security council has officially backed quattara as president , khonert said that security council intervention would not guarantee success .
" that would require a robust mandate , backed by considerable additional military engagement , which would be more than the 8,500 un troops currently present in ivory coast , and additional finance .
it is doubtful under the present conditions , whether the major parties involved would agree to this . " rival factions ready for a return to war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : concerns are high that a new civil war could divide the nation should the violent protests continue , ivory coast may find itself slipping closer to a new civil war .
ouatarra commands the support of the rebel-controlled north while gbagbo has the sworn allegiance of the army .
rebel leaders have already said that they will not wait long to take action should gbagbo refuse to stand down .
" in view of the history of violent conflicts in the ivory coast in the past decade , there is a high risk of a return to civil war , " khonert said .

as the nation slips toward chaos , the international community fears a return to war . ivory coast is bracing for more violent unrest following clashes on thursday in which at least 20 people were killed after security forces loyal to incumbent president laurent gbagbo fired on pro-alassane quattara supporters in abidjan .
the united states has in the meantime pulled all its non-emergency embassy staff out of the country .
the eu has given gbagbo until the end of the week to give up his claim to the presidency or face sanctions and possible un prosecution .
french president nicolas sarkozy said in brussels that eu leaders were unanimous in their call for gbagbo to leave office . earlier this week , eu foreign ministers approved a first round of sanctions , including an asset freeze and travel ban , on several other leading officials .
observers say that the key to power is control over the state television headquarters still held by gbagbo .
" state tv is crucial to gain and preserve power , " koné lanciné , general secretary of a broadcasting trade union , told deutsche welle .
" the fact that gbagbo still has some control in ivory coast is largely due to the fact that he controls the state-run media . "
on friday a number of independent newspapers were shut down to prevent them from reporting on the deadly clashes .
" rti -lrb- state broadcaster - ed . -rrb- has turned into a propaganda medium .
they 're disseminating hate in all its forms , ethnic hatred and racial hatred , " said lanciné .

as the nation slips toward chaos , the international community fears a return to war . ivory coast is bracing for more violent unrest following clashes on thursday in which at least 20 people were killed after security forces loyal to incumbent president laurent gbagbo fired on pro-alassane quattara supporters in abidjan .
the united states has in the meantime pulled all its non-emergency embassy staff out of the country .
the eu has given gbagbo until the end of the week to give up his claim to the presidency or face sanctions and possible un prosecution .
french president nicolas sarkozy said in brussels that eu leaders were unanimous in their call for gbagbo to leave office . earlier this week , eu foreign ministers approved a first round of sanctions , including an asset freeze and travel ban , on several other leading officials .
observers say that the key to power is control over the state television headquarters still held by gbagbo .
" state tv is crucial to gain and preserve power , " koné lanciné , general secretary of a broadcasting trade union , told deutsche welle .
" the fact that gbagbo still has some control in ivory coast is largely due to the fact that he controls the state-run media . "
on friday a number of independent newspapers were shut down to prevent them from reporting on the deadly clashes .
" rti -lrb- state broadcaster - ed . -rrb- has turned into a propaganda medium .
they 're disseminating hate in all its forms , ethnic hatred and racial hatred , " said lanciné .
the opposition challenger ouattara and incumbent gbagbo both claimed victory in the nov .
28 election and have both sworn themselves in as president .
ouattara was declared the winner by the country 's electoral commission after the run-off , with provisional results giving him a 10 percent lead over gbagbo .
the result in favor of ouattara has since been ratified by the united nations and recognized by the international community .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gbagbo and ouattara both claimed victory in the election despite ouattara 's support in the international community , gbagbo has defied international calls to cede power and has rejected the un 's ratification of the result .
the current situation raises fears of a return to the violent divisions which split the nation in two between the rebel-controlled north and government-controlled south during the civil war of 2002-2003 .
international concern heightens as crisis deepens the situation is already sending nervous ripples through the international community , especially in organizations responsible for funding development programs in the poverty-stricken nation .
the world bank and the african development bank have both questioned the " usefulness and effectiveness " of their aid programs to ivory coast given the breakdown in governance and have admitted to concerns that the turmoil in the country could drive many more ivorians further into poverty while causing instability and affecting economic prosperity in the wider west african sub-region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international organizations fear the unrest could spread " although the situation is troubling , the international community has reacted very quickly , " richard gowan , an africa expert with the european council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" the african union , ecowas and un have made it clear that the world is watching what happens next in cote d 'ivoire .
big firms with cocoa and mining interests in the country have done the same .
with luck , this level of scrutiny will deter both sides from escalating tensions into all-out violence . "
compromise seems impossible , even with un intervention dr. dirk khonert , the deputy director of the institute of african affairs at the german institute of global and area studies -lrb- giga -rrb- and a member of the eu election observation team in ivory coast , said that the main stumbling block to a solution was whether both rival candidates would be prepared to accept defeat .
" ouattara has a very strong international backing against gbagbo , " he told deutsche welle .
" thus , he derives his legitimacy not only internally but also externally by the backing of the international community .
it is difficult to imagine under these conditions that he and his followers would be inclined to accept a compromise on the question of the presidency . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un efforts to keep the peace may not prevent conflict it is unlikely that a compromise will satisfy either man as any deal may have to be brokered by the united nations which has given its support to ouattara , therefore alienating gbagbo 's team .
gbagbo has a long record of ignoring international pressure and appears to be ready to take the country to the brink of war to retain power .
he is also unlikely to consider the best option available to african union mediators which would be a government of national reconciliation , with ouattara as president and a significant input of gbagbo activists in the cabinet .
although the un security council has officially backed quattara as president , khonert said that security council intervention would not guarantee success .
" that would require a robust mandate , backed by considerable additional military engagement , which would be more than the 8,500 un troops currently present in ivory coast , and additional finance .
it is doubtful under the present conditions , whether the major parties involved would agree to this . " rival factions ready for a return to war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : concerns are high that a new civil war could divide the nation should the violent protests continue , ivory coast may find itself slipping closer to a new civil war .
ouatarra commands the support of the rebel-controlled north while gbagbo has the sworn allegiance of the army .
rebel leaders have already said that they will not wait long to take action should gbagbo refuse to stand down .
" in view of the history of violent conflicts in the ivory coast in the past decade , there is a high risk of a return to civil war , " khonert said .
" the most dangerous element is the unpredictable attitude of the militias of the presidential contenders ; the ' jeune patriots ' in abidjan or duekoué in the western region of the country . "
for richard gowan the worst-case scenario is a return to full-scale conflict .
" in that case , the un peacekeepers do n't have the forces to stop war and france , which has troops in the country , will want to avoid getting dragged into fighting .

european leaders have agreed on a permanent rescue fund to cover countries in need of financial assistance .
german chancellor merkel hailed the summit as a success , but the measure has failed to reassure the markets . european leaders meeting in brussels have set up a permanent emergency fund to help debt-laden countries , and have agreed to rewrite some of the bloc 's rules in a bid to shore up the value of the euro .
" we will do everything to secure the financial stability of the euro as a whole , " german chancellor angela merkel said at a news conference after a european union summit .
she added that reform and stability will remain on the euro zone 's agenda next year as the bloc fights to secure the single currency and make its economies more competitive .
but the move was given an emphatic thumbs-down as the ratings agency moody 's downgraded ireland 's credit rating on friday by five notches , to baa1 , two notches above junk .
" while a downgrade had been anticipated , the severity of the downgrade is surprising , " dublin-based glas securities said .
spiraling debt eu leaders have spent most of 2010 trying to come up with successful measures to stop the region 's debt crisis spreading , but greece and ireland have already been forced to seek eu bailouts and portugal , spain , belgium and others are now in the spotlight .
on thursday leaders agreed on a change to the eu treaty to create the european stability mechanism -lrb- esm -rrb- – a permanent financial safety net of 750 billion euro from 2013 - that will help countries with liquidity problems and allow for debt restructuring of insolvent ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is determined to stabilize the euro eu leaders confirmed that private investors would be involved in the future euro zone rescue mechanism , a draft summit statement showed .
merkel said the fund would be sufficiently large .
" the more coherent economic policies are , the more we see by 2013 that states have made progress with a culture of stability , the lower the financial extent of the -lrb- rescue fund -rrb- will have to be , " she added .
germany lobbied hard for changes to the lisbon treaty and a pledge to pay out aid only if it 's " indispensable , " as leaders meeting in brussels on thursday agreed on the need to make a temporary trillion dollar rescue fund into a permanent one .
present dangers but market concerns are focused on whether the euro zone has sufficient immediate funds to come to the aid of the likes of portugal or spain , should they need a bailout next year .
" the new esm should safeguard the euro zone 's financial stability in the future .
however , it is to some extent window-dressing as it does not solve the current crisis , " said carsten brzeski , senior economist at ing bank .
the euro zone 's current fund - the european financial stability facility -lrb- efsf -rrb- - can borrow on the markets backed by euro zone government guarantees and has up to 440 billion euro to lend to governments cut off from market financing .
but many economists believe that even though only a small part of the efsf 's funds have been used to help ireland , it may turn out to be insufficient if more countries need help .
" european leaders failed to address the issue of debt sustainability and possible insolvency problems prior to 2013 .
debt restructuring , a common euro zone bond or an increase of the efsf ?
none of these issues have been addressed .
but they have to be , " brzeski said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markets reacted unvaforably to the eu summit " the preliminary outcome of the eu summit represents yet another missed opportunity by european policymakers to forcefully address investor concerns and calm markets in a more sustainable and pre-emptive manner , " said frank engels , economist at barclays capital .
underlining the need to reassure financial markets over fears that portugal and spain may be in need of bailouts soon , the european central bank also announced on thursday that it would double its capital to 10.76 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.3 billion -rrb- to cope with an increase in market volatility .
bonds kept off agenda discussion about the introduction of " e-bonds , " which would allow all european nations to borrow money at common rates , was kept off the agenda .
merkel has said that the common bond plan " would not rid europe of its weaknesses , it would simply transmit them across the board . "
germany is strongly opposed because e-bonds would effectively mean all 16 euro zone countries - or 17 when estonia joins the currency from jan .
1 , 2011 - financing a portion of their debt together and sharing a credit rating .
berlin , which is the benchmark issuer of debt in the euro zone and enjoys the lowest borrowing costs thanks to its economic strength and reliability , would have to surrender some of its credit to riskier euro states such as greece and ireland .
although germany is publicly opposed to the idea of euro-bonds , some in the euro zone back the idea .
" germany 's rejection of the expansion is another example of how euro zone governments do not agree on the best way forward to deal with this crisis , " said bnp paribas ' wattret .
" as a result , the measures taken have been piecemeal , unconvincing and reactive rather than pre-emptive .
this is going to have to change if confidence is to be restored in a lastingway , " he said .
leaders were meeting in their seventh summit of a busy year , as markets have grown increasingly wary that eu states might default on loans secured through individual government bonds .

dw-world.de opinion : heading in the right direction , but eurozone stability wo n't be easy as angela merkel tries to harmonize european economic policy , one should expect a lot more discord , according to christoph hasselbach , deutsche welle 's brussels correspondent .
a prime example is the euro bonds dispute .
-lrb- 17.12.2010 -rrb- irish debt dramatically downgraded despite eu rescue fund deal moody 's ratings agency has slashed its credit rating for ireland by five notches .

but at germany 's behest , aid will only be paid if it 's considered ' indispensable ' to the stability of the euro .

european leaders have agreed on a permanent rescue fund to cover countries in need of financial assistance .
german chancellor merkel hailed the summit as a success , but the measure has failed to reassure the markets . european leaders meeting in brussels have set up a permanent emergency fund to help debt-laden countries , and have agreed to rewrite some of the bloc 's rules in a bid to shore up the value of the euro .
" we will do everything to secure the financial stability of the euro as a whole , " german chancellor angela merkel said at a news conference after a european union summit .
she added that reform and stability will remain on the euro zone 's agenda next year as the bloc fights to secure the single currency and make its economies more competitive .
but the move was given an emphatic thumbs-down as the ratings agency moody 's downgraded ireland 's credit rating on friday by five notches , to baa1 , two notches above junk .
" while a downgrade had been anticipated , the severity of the downgrade is surprising , " dublin-based glas securities said .
spiraling debt eu leaders have spent most of 2010 trying to come up with successful measures to stop the region 's debt crisis spreading , but greece and ireland have already been forced to seek eu bailouts and portugal , spain , belgium and others are now in the spotlight .
on thursday leaders agreed on a change to the eu treaty to create the european stability mechanism -lrb- esm -rrb- – a permanent financial safety net of 750 billion euro from 2013 - that will help countries with liquidity problems and allow for debt restructuring of insolvent ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is determined to stabilize the euro eu leaders confirmed that private investors would be involved in the future euro zone rescue mechanism , a draft summit statement showed .
merkel said the fund would be sufficiently large .
" the more coherent economic policies are , the more we see by 2013 that states have made progress with a culture of stability , the lower the financial extent of the -lrb- rescue fund -rrb- will have to be , " she added .
germany lobbied hard for changes to the lisbon treaty and a pledge to pay out aid only if it 's " indispensable , " as leaders meeting in brussels on thursday agreed on the need to make a temporary trillion dollar rescue fund into a permanent one .
present dangers but market concerns are focused on whether the euro zone has sufficient immediate funds to come to the aid of the likes of portugal or spain , should they need a bailout next year .
" the new esm should safeguard the euro zone 's financial stability in the future .
however , it is to some extent window-dressing as it does not solve the current crisis , " said carsten brzeski , senior economist at ing bank .
the euro zone 's current fund - the european financial stability facility -lrb- efsf -rrb- - can borrow on the markets backed by euro zone government guarantees and has up to 440 billion euro to lend to governments cut off from market financing .
but many economists believe that even though only a small part of the efsf 's funds have been used to help ireland , it may turn out to be insufficient if more countries need help .
" european leaders failed to address the issue of debt sustainability and possible insolvency problems prior to 2013 .
debt restructuring , a common euro zone bond or an increase of the efsf ?
none of these issues have been addressed .
but they have to be , " brzeski said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markets reacted unvaforably to the eu summit " the preliminary outcome of the eu summit represents yet another missed opportunity by european policymakers to forcefully address investor concerns and calm markets in a more sustainable and pre-emptive manner , " said frank engels , economist at barclays capital .
underlining the need to reassure financial markets over fears that portugal and spain may be in need of bailouts soon , the european central bank also announced on thursday that it would double its capital to 10.76 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.3 billion -rrb- to cope with an increase in market volatility .
bonds kept off agenda discussion about the introduction of " e-bonds , " which would allow all european nations to borrow money at common rates , was kept off the agenda .
merkel has said that the common bond plan " would not rid europe of its weaknesses , it would simply transmit them across the board . "
germany is strongly opposed because e-bonds would effectively mean all 16 euro zone countries - or 17 when estonia joins the currency from jan .
1 , 2011 - financing a portion of their debt together and sharing a credit rating .
berlin , which is the benchmark issuer of debt in the euro zone and enjoys the lowest borrowing costs thanks to its economic strength and reliability , would have to surrender some of its credit to riskier euro states such as greece and ireland .
although germany is publicly opposed to the idea of euro-bonds , some in the euro zone back the idea .
" germany 's rejection of the expansion is another example of how euro zone governments do not agree on the best way forward to deal with this crisis , " said bnp paribas ' wattret .
" as a result , the measures taken have been piecemeal , unconvincing and reactive rather than pre-emptive .
this is going to have to change if confidence is to be restored in a lastingway , " he said .
leaders were meeting in their seventh summit of a busy year , as markets have grown increasingly wary that eu states might default on loans secured through individual government bonds .

dw-world.de opinion : heading in the right direction , but eurozone stability wo n't be easy as angela merkel tries to harmonize european economic policy , one should expect a lot more discord , according to christoph hasselbach , deutsche welle 's brussels correspondent .
a prime example is the euro bonds dispute .
-lrb- 17.12.2010 -rrb- irish debt dramatically downgraded despite eu rescue fund deal moody 's ratings agency has slashed its credit rating for ireland by five notches .
the drastic downgrade hardly shows confidence in ongoing eu efforts to safeguard the euro at the brussels summit .
-lrb- 17.12.2010 -rrb- european leaders seal deal on permanent crisis fund european leaders have agreed on a permanent rescue fund to cover countries in need of financial assistance .
but at germany 's behest , aid will only be paid if it 's considered ' indispensable ' to the stability of the euro .
-lrb- 17.12.2010 -rrb- merkel stands firm , but german parliament split over euro crisis in a speech to parliament , german chancellor angela merkel has fortified her stance against eurozone bonds and increasing the eu 's financial rescue fund a day ahead of an eu summit to consider new rules for the eurozone .

hundreds of road traffic accidents and grounded airplanes have made life difficult for people and police alike . heavy snowfall across much of germany has caused widespread traffic jams and hundreds of accidents on the roads , as well as severely interrupting air and rail travel .
the blizzard " petra " has largely abated but the german weather service , the dwd , is still issuing mild weather warnings nationwide , describing the overall situation on its website as " extremely wintery across the board . "
meanwhile , authorities are scrambling to clear thursday 's heavy snowfall from the country 's highways , runways and railways .
airport backlogs germany 's largest airport , in frankfurt , was operating " entirely without disruptions " early on friday , according to a spokesman for the hub .
nevertheless , roughly 100 flights have been cancelled , partly because of problems at other european airports , and also as a knock-on effect from the airport 's brief closure on thursday night .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the going has been unusually slow on the fast-moving autobahns stuttgart airport , where snow was still falling heavily on friday morning , reported delays caused by the intermittent closure of runways in order to clear away fresh snow .
several other airports were still battling to minimize delays on friday , and the german red cross has been taking camp beds , sleeping bags and blankets to german terminals , anticipating more stranded passengers .
almost 200 kilometers of traffic jams the greatest disruptions hit germany 's road network , especially the highways .
thousands of road traffic accidents were recorded by german police on thursday , mostly caused by the adverse weather ; three people lost their lives in the crashes .
the motorway network came close to gridlock during the worst of the snowfall , with authorities in the western state of north rhine-westphalia alone recording a total of 185 kilometers -lrb- 115 miles -rrb- of traffic jams at one point late on thursday evening .
one single queue , on the a3 highway near leverkusen , stretched back 40 kilometers .
parts of the country even banned heavy goods vehicles from taking to the highways overnight , after several got bogged down in the snow ; but that ban has since been lifted .
although the situation is now clearing , police have asked all road users to plan plenty of extra time for their journeys , and to adapt their driving style to suit the conditions .
meanwhile , the german rail service , deutsche bahn - also facing numerous weather-related delays and cancellations - has opened up a free customer service phone hotline for timetable inquiries .

bayer leverkusen drew against title holders atletico , with both german sides progressing . there was a dream start for new stuttgart head coach bruno labbadia , his players notching up five goals in their europa league soccer clash at home to danish club odense bk on thursday .
timo gebhart grabbed the first for stuttgart - who are already through to the next stage of the competition - on 20 minutes , scoring when his own header was chested back to his feet by odense defender anders moller christensen .
the second came in the form of a mistake from odense defender daniel hoegh , who accidentally stabbed a cross by gebhart into his own team 's net .
christian gentner was quickest to the ball after it hit defender thomas helveg , to make it 3-0 before pavel pogrebnyak made it 4-0 five minutes later .
that goal left spectators bewildered as the ball , which appeared to have been blocked by moller christensen , somehow found its way across the line through backspin .
although fortune smiled briefly on odense two minutes later , when john utaka maintained his composure in front of goal to net a neat consolation , there was more in stuttgart 's armory when ciprian marica fired in a goal in during extra time to make the final score 5-1 .
stuttgart go through as leaders of their group on 15 points , six points ahead of second place young boys from switzerland .
leverkusen draw , holders go out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atletico made every effort but were ultimately denied in other europa league football action , bayer leverkusen secured a 1-1 draw against europa league title holders atletico madrid on wednesday , sending the spanish side out of the competition .
atletico needed a win against leverkusen - who had already qualified - and needed other results to go in their favor to progress .
the spanish side did dominate the first half of the game with uruguayan striker diego forlan coming close with a half-volley just ahead of the break .
despite this , leverkusen soaked up the pressure and it was the germans who scored first - after a full 69 minutes - patrick helmes slotting the ball past atletico goalkeeper david de gea .
although atletico responded quickly , with a side-footed goal from fran merida just three minutes later , the spaniards were unable to take the lead .
in any case , a victory would not have helped atletico .
greek side aris salonika secured a win that ensured they finished in second place behind group leaders leverkusen .
