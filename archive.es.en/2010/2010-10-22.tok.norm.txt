program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de oil industry -pipe- 22.10.2010 six months on , gulf of mexico could see new drilling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the moratorium lifted , companies can apply for new drill permits the us government lifted a moratorium on deepwater drilling in the gulf of mexico earlier this month .
now , six months after april 's massive oil spill , one company is planning to seek permits for new projects in the area . the gulf of mexico is seeing renewed interest as a drilling destination : on thursday , us oil giant chevron said it intended to apply for permission in the coming days to develop fresh projects there .
a spokesman for the company said it plans to invest $ 7.5 billion in a pair of new fields in waters off the coast of louisiana .
the move would make chevron among the first to seek permits for new drilling projects in the gulf of mexico , half a year after the deepwater horizon oil rig exploded on april 20 .
chevron could be among the first oil companies to exploit the end of a drilling moratorium , introduced by the obama administration in may when it faced public pressure for reacting to slowly to the environmental crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an explosion occurred on the deepwater horizon oil rig on april 20 competing pressures the drilling freeze applied to both new and current projects but was lifted on october 13 – several weeks before it was set to expire – amid pressure from oil companies and state governments concerned about productivity and jobs .
according to a government report , up to 12,000 jobs were lost due to the moratorium , a bitter pill to swallow as the country struggles with persistent high unemployment in a year of midterm elections .
us environmental advocacy groups have condemned the end of the moratorium , saying the risks of drilling remain too high .
six months after the deepwater horizon oil rig exploded – setting off the worst environmental disaster in us history and leaving 11 people dead – more than 16,000 specialists and volunteers are still working to cleanup the spill 's environmental effects .
british energy giant bp spent months trying to stop oil from leaking into the gulf – launching multiple failed " kill " operations to plug the blown-out wellhead .
they only succeeded in early august , when engineers filled the well with heavy drilling mud and cement , after millions of liters of oil had already leaked into the gulf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oil spill was the worst environmental disaster in us history rules and regulations oil and gas drilling projects are now subject to stricter regulations .
us interior secretary ken salazar said in a telephone press conference that they are meant to ensure safe energy generation .
" we are building the gold standard for offshore oil and gas regulation , " he said . in future , corporations will be required to prove that their oil rigs are equipped with working cut-off valves .
in addition , they must conform to specific construction standards .
oil rig workers will also be subject to special safety trainings .
regulators – who came in for heavy criticism for their coziness with the industry they were supposed to monitor – have been reformed .
the former minerals management service has been changed to the bureau of ocean energy management , and the agency has been subject to new ethics guidelines since late august .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 22.10.2010 warlords to run the wolesi jirga all over again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ratbil shamel , head of deutsche welle 's afghan service five weeks after the elections took place the results of the afghan elections are out .
although they are only preliminary results , they clearly show who the winners and losers are .
ratbil shamel has this opinion piece : now the secret , which never was one , is out .
the wolesi jirga , afghanistan ’ s lower house , will continue to be run by the country ’ s warlords over the next five years .
former mujahedin leaders and their allies have won in almost all the constituencies .
even in kabul , a city which at the beginning of the 1990s was almost completely destroyed by the battles between the various mujahedin groupings , the picture is the same .
hardly anybody in afghanistan is surprised by the results .
many had said even before the elections took place that they did not have any faith in afghanistan 's supposedly ' independent ' election commission -lrb- iec -rrb- .
and the fact that certain sections of the afghan population still went to vote has another explanation - they wanted to show that they , at least , take democracy seriously .
they went to the polls because they wanted to tell the world : " we afghans reject war , the taliban and extremism " .
many afghans perhaps don ’ t really know what democracy means or how a parliament functions but one thing that they know for sure is that a peaceful struggle is better than war .
and the people in afghanistan have been experiencing war for over 30 years .
yet hardly anyone is deluded enough to think that his / her vote makes a difference .
despite three elections in the past nine years , their lives have not improved for the better .
on the contrary .
the taliban are getting stronger and stronger by the day , while the government is becoming weaker .
and they know that the new parliament will not change much .
the erstwhile leaders of the mujahedin will certainly not fight for democratic reforms in the future .
their goal is clear - to strengthen their own position of power in the country .
this power will increase the more the international community pulls out of afghanistan .
some observers believe it will become increasingly difficult for president hamid karzai to govern but the opposite will be true .
karzai has long been counting on the mujahedin card .
his two deputies were chosen out of these ranks last year , despite national and international criticism .
but the real losers of this election , far more than hamid karzai , are the small democratic groupings in afghanistan .
in the past nine years , they have not managed to unite over a few common goals .
instead , they have founded countless political parties that carry no weight in afghanistan ’ s power struggle .
they fielded hundreds of candidates this time but will have to wake up to the fact that they have lost , again .
a further loser in these elections is the international community , especially the west .
democracy , peace and well-being were promised to the people of afghanistan almost a decade ago .
but the taliban and former warlords continue to determine the lives of the afghans .
afghanistan can not be left to the taliban and the warlords again .
the consequences of such a policy are clear to everybody – instability for the region and the world .

but in the wake of the global crisis , it 's germany that 's emerging with ease , which countries like the us can learn from . unemployment figures in germany are down to 1992 levels , and german exports are on the rise as if the global economic crisis had never happened .
in comparison , the economy in the united states is doing a lot worse : unemployment stands high at 9.6 percent , and growth rates are far from the positive figures that are coming out of germany .
and yet , there 's no secret recipe behind the success of the german economy , says thomas zielke , deputy delegate of the german economy in washington – it all comes down to exports , he told deutsche welle .
" it 's that great flexibility of companies , and the will to expand .
people are simply used to focusing on exports , " zielke said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shapiro says germany has been well prepared for the crisis that 's not necessarily the case in the us , he says , where companies are used to relying much more on their own domestic market .
in the united states , exports only make up 13 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , but the figure in germany is more than three times higher .
and while most of germany 's exports are going to other eu countries , the biggest growth rates are in exports to the rest of the world .
investing in exports if the domestic market crumbles in a time of recession , companies have little choice other than to invest in exports , robert shapiro , economic advisor to the us government , told deutsche welle .
" that has always been germany 's strength , " he said .
" the country has been very well prepared for that . "
there are other factors behind germany 's success in handling the crisis that shapiro and his colleagues have taken a closer look at .
one example is government action , such as subsidizing shortened working hours .
by covering part of the salaries of workers who are put on reduced hours , berlin has managed to avoid a situation where too many people had to be laid off during the recession .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a manufacturing-based economy can more easily focus on exports jacob kirkegaard of the peterson institute for international economics told deutsche welle that he felt a lot of respect for germany 's quick resurgence .
" germany has proven that it 's possible to handle a dramatic slump in sales and exports without mass firings , " he says .
" you just have much more flexibility than on the us market .
here the gut reaction is always : when the sales go down , people have to be fired .
and when the demand is back , there 's a lack of workers . "
too much government involvement ?
but shapiro cautions against simply adapting that system to the us economy .
cultural differences are part of the problem – americans are traditionally opposed to their government getting involved in running businesses .
he also warned that despite the currently positive outlook there are still many risks for germany .
european monetary policy is too fragile , he says , as it has to balance between the interests of all the eu member states .
the danger of countries running bankrupt is still there .
greece for instance has not seen its situation improve as much as the rest of europe had hoped it would .
and other member states like ireland or spain are still struggling to avoid a crisis .

and still , the us already seem to be readjusting their economic policy to follow more in the direction that germany is taking .
the obama government has recognized the importance of exports – the goal is to increase exports by five percent .
" the current administration has export at the top of its agenda , " thomas zielke says .
" obama has repeatedly said that he sees the future as being in manufacturing .
and he has put that directly in opposition to wall street and the financial crisis . "

cultural differences are part of the problem – americans are traditionally opposed to their government getting involved in running businesses .
he also warned that despite the currently positive outlook there are still many risks for germany .
european monetary policy is too fragile , he says , as it has to balance between the interests of all the eu member states .
the danger of countries running bankrupt is still there .
greece for instance has not seen its situation improve as much as the rest of europe had hoped it would .
and other member states like ireland or spain are still struggling to avoid a crisis .
a moral price to pay shapiro and kirkegaard agree that germany 's exports to china are also not without a downside .
there 's a moral price to pay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us economy is struggling despite austerity measures " germany is rather careful in criticizing china because of course berlin does not want to put its exports at risk .
the us however are much more outspoken .
but that of course has an impact on us exports to china . "
and still , the us already seem to be readjusting their economic policy to follow more in the direction that germany is taking .
the obama government has recognized the importance of exports – the goal is to increase exports by five percent .
" the current administration has export at the top of its agenda , " thomas zielke says .
" obama has repeatedly said that he sees the future as being in manufacturing .
and he has put that directly in opposition to wall street and the financial crisis . "

" let 's be honest about it , the simple truth is , in the aerospace or aeronautic business , none of us , none of the companies that play a role in it , has been growing without any government support , " enders told attendees of an aviation club lunch in london .
" so let 's accept reality . " in addition , the airbus chief said , the fight over subsidies could " accelerate the ascendancy " of aircraft manufacturers from countries such as china , russia and brazil , who are working on releasing new models that could pose direct threats to the current duopoly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ceo enders has been unusually frank about the wto battle " if we talk about china , if we talk about russia or others , does anyone in this room believe that they will step back and say : ' now we understand the wto rules , we will play exactly by the rules ' ? " he said .
" absolutely not , so this is why i call this an absurdity . " long quarrel europe 's airbus and chicago-based boeing , the globe 's first and second largest aircraft manufacturers , have been arguing their cases before the wto since 2004 .
the united states initiated wto dispute procedures then about subsidies to the european aircraft industry .
in response , the eu launched similar proceedings against the us . since then , the trans-atlantic dispute has become bogged down and a swift resolution does not appear to be on the horizon .
in a ruling at the end of june , the wto did fault europe over aid to airbus , saying the company has received subsidies in the form of loans from european governments at below market-rates and without maturity dates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus got a slap on the wrist in a wto ruling this summer however , airbus responded by saying the wto had thrown out several of the other charges brought by the us .
in a counter claim , airbus accused boeing of getting tax breaks from washington as well as money from nasa research funds and argues that much us defense research , funded by the pentagon , is of a dual technology nature and ends up being transferred over to the us civil aviation sector . it is likely that any resolution will only come after years of appeals by both sides . " it 's hard to see how it ends right now , " paul sheridan , an aviation analyst at london-based ascend worldwide , told deutsche welle .
" you could take the wto report about airbus and take boeing 's response and switch the names and it would probably look pretty similar .
they seem to be both accusing each other of the same thing . " new guys in town in the meantime , a group of new players is arriving on the scene , ready to release products that could go head to head with boeing and airbus ' headliners . one big worry in chicago and toulouse , airbus ' home base , is the commercial aircraft corporation of china ltd , or comac .
its 919 model , due to come on the market in 2016 , will directly compete with the airbus a320 and boeing 's 737 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's comac is making airbus and boeing nervous " airbus and boeing should be very worried about comac as a rival to their duopoly " sheridan said .
" comac is state-owned and once the chinese government demonstrates a willingness to do something they usually follow through with it . " other manufacturers , such as canada 's bombardier , brazil 's embraer or russia 's sukhoi are seeking to gain a foothold in the lucrative civil aviation market .
bombardier 's single-aisle plane is due to enter service in 2013 and will also pose a threat to the a320 and 737 . " airbus is saying to boeing that they need to resolve this whole issue , " zafar khan , an aviation expert at sg securities , told deutsche welle .
" while we 're squabbling , enders is saying , those other countries are all subsidizing their industries . " enders said there will probably be five or six commercial aircraft manufacturers in the next 10 years , which means the industry will be faced with new questions about consolidations , partnerships and mergers . subsides and the future subsidies , although disliked by the wto , are almost a given in the aviation industry , experts say .
that is partly due to the expense of producing the product , but also from the benefits governments see from having a successful aerospace player . " when it comes to the aerospace industry , everyone is looking for help from governments because these are major , major undertakings and governments clearly see them as strategically important businesses to have , " khan said . in a related development , negotiators from the european union and other countries , including the us , japan and brazil , are meeting in canada to talk about financing planes in each other 's home markets - and specifically , how much government assistance is allowed . the old rules saw an aviation deal dominated by the us and europe .

" we expect that within 10 days , the situation in terzigno can return to normal , " he told a news conference in rome after an emergency meeting .
the government 's plans to build a new dump in terzigno , which is located 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- southeast of naples in vesuvius national park , have for years met with fierce opposition by locals , who have repeatedly blocked access to the existing waste disposal site there .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 22.10.2010 european online risk study shows many parents clueless , kids blasé großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children are online at an increasingly young age more than one in eight european children has been upset by online content , a new eu study on internet risks shows .
but the study also showed that most children had had no upsetting experiences with the internet at all . a large majority of those interviewed for the study eu kids online reported no negative experiences at all online , results of the european union study " risks and safety on the internet " showed .
but the study also showed that parents are frequently out of touch with their kids ' virtual lives .
the european union and london school of economics survey was presented thursday at the safer internet forum in luxembourg , and included interviews with thousands of kids across europe from ireland to turkey .
among its findings , the study showed that an average of 12 percent of european children had been bothered or upset by something they experienced online .
these included encountering pornography , sexual or bullying messages , or having their personal data revealed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , just eight percent of kids said they were bothered by an online event indeed , the study showed that 39 percent of those questioned had had encountered a " risky " behavior - such as communicating with new people not met face-to-face , or seeing user-generated content that is potentially harmful , such as hate , self-harm , or drug-taking content .
but only a portion of those asked said they had been upset or bothered by it .
in germany , the percentage of kids who said they were upset by an online experience was , at eight percent , near the lowest end of the scale .
only portugal -lrb- seven percent -rrb- and italy -lrb- six percent -rrb- were lower .
topping the percentages of those most bothered or upset were children in denmark -lrb- 26 percent -rrb- , estonia -lrb- 25 percent -rrb- and romania and sweden -lrb- 21 percent . -rrb-
discrepancy due to ' schoolyard monopoly ' uwe hasebrink , a professor at hamburg 's hans bredow institute for media research , led the german arm of the study .
in an interview with the hamburg abendblatt newspaper , he said that german children " are in less danger " of meeting harmful content because they use the internet " less frequently and with less variety " than kids in other countries .
but markus beckedahl , whose blog netzpolitik.org focuses on the intersection between the internet and german politics , said he found it hard to understand the response gap between countries like denmark and sweden , and germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say parents , not children , should be targets of information campaigns " the study said that countries with high internet usage have more problems , " beckedahl told deutsche welle . " but something like 99 percent of german kids have internet access , and i do n't think they have more more internet usage in denmark . "
one big difference could be the fact that a huge portion of the social-network market for kids and teens in germany takes place on german-only networks like " schuelervz " -lrb- " student directory , " -rrb- german schoolkids ' version of facebook .
" these platforms have a near monopoly on the schoolyard , " he added . " maybe that makes the difference - in germany , the kids are in closed communities , and in other countries they are just on the internet . "
the age factor other poll findings showed children were using the internet at increasingly young ages : an average of seven in sweden and eight in several other northern european countries .
interviewers , who spoke with 23,000 children between the ages of nine and 16 , found it was the youngest children who had the hardest time coping with disturbing material online .
in response to this finding , the study recommended targeting spending and advice at younger age groups to reduce risk and enhance the opportunities of the internet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : younger children had more trouble coping with upsetting experiences parents were frequently unaware of the risks to which their children had been exposed , the study showed .
for example , more than half of parents whose children said they had been bullied online , said they knew nothing of the situation .
moreover , some 41 percent of parents whose child had seen sexual images online said their child had n't , and 61 percent of parents whose children had met offline with an online contact , also said their child had n't .
beckedahl added that parents should ideally " be aware what their kids are doing , and they should talk to them about what kind of experiences they are having on the internet . "
the study also found that while the overwhelming majority of european kids in the study use the internet at home -lrb- 85 percent -rrb- , many children do have private time to use the internet .
48 percent use it in their bedroom , and 31 percent via a mobile phone or other handheld device .
in some countries , like the united kingdom , ireland and sweden , over one in five young people use the internet regularly on a handheld device .
supporting education - for educators beckedahl acknowledged that because of this separation between parents and when their children are online , and their lack of awareness of where their kids go online , it may make things difficult for the parents to keep up . " parents often lack literacy in the social networks their children are using , " he said .
" they have no clue what kind of experiences and user interaction their kids would have , and they do n't really know what can happen . " his suggestion : shifting germany 's ongoing campaigns for media literacy away from children , and toward parents and teachers .
" peer to peer education exists already - children figure out how these platforms work themselves , " he noted . " the problem is , their parents and teachers are n't able to teach them to behave correctly , and prevent risks . "
the study 's authors plan to publish official conclusions and recommendations in november .
but even in thier preliminary findings , they acknowledge that the harmful potential of the internet is counterbalanced - if not easily outweighed - by the medium 's benefits .
plus , they note that a majority of the kids polled said they had not had any harmful experiences with the internet at all .
for his part , beckedahl would like to see the german debate on internet usage lose its negative tone .
" our debate about the internet needs to become more positive , " he said . " it is one of the greatest tools we ever had .
but if we only talk about the risks , people will fear the internet . "

but the study also showed that most children had had no upsetting experiences with the internet at all . a large majority of those interviewed for the study eu kids online reported no negative experiences at all online , results of the european union study " risks and safety on the internet " showed .
but the study also showed that parents are frequently out of touch with their kids ' virtual lives .
the european union and london school of economics survey was presented thursday at the safer internet forum in luxembourg , and included interviews with thousands of kids across europe from ireland to turkey .
among its findings , the study showed that an average of 12 percent of european children had been bothered or upset by something they experienced online .
these included encountering pornography , sexual or bullying messages , or having their personal data revealed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , just eight percent of kids said they were bothered by an online event indeed , the study showed that 39 percent of those questioned had had encountered a " risky " behavior - such as communicating with new people not met face-to-face , or seeing user-generated content that is potentially harmful , such as hate , self-harm , or drug-taking content .
but only a portion of those asked said they had been upset or bothered by it .
in germany , the percentage of kids who said they were upset by an online experience was , at eight percent , near the lowest end of the scale .
only portugal -lrb- seven percent -rrb- and italy -lrb- six percent -rrb- were lower .
topping the percentages of those most bothered or upset were children in denmark -lrb- 26 percent -rrb- , estonia -lrb- 25 percent -rrb- and romania and sweden -lrb- 21 percent . -rrb-
discrepancy due to ' schoolyard monopoly ' uwe hasebrink , a professor at hamburg 's hans bredow institute for media research , led the german arm of the study .
in an interview with the hamburg abendblatt newspaper , he said that german children " are in less danger " of meeting harmful content because they use the internet " less frequently and with less variety " than kids in other countries .
but markus beckedahl , whose blog netzpolitik.org focuses on the intersection between the internet and german politics , said he found it hard to understand the response gap between countries like denmark and sweden , and germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say parents , not children , should be targets of information campaigns " the study said that countries with high internet usage have more problems , " beckedahl told deutsche welle . " but something like 99 percent of german kids have internet access , and i do n't think they have more more internet usage in denmark . "
one big difference could be the fact that a huge portion of the social-network market for kids and teens in germany takes place on german-only networks like " schuelervz " -lrb- " student directory , " -rrb- german schoolkids ' version of facebook .
" these platforms have a near monopoly on the schoolyard , " he added . " maybe that makes the difference - in germany , the kids are in closed communities , and in other countries they are just on the internet . "

christian wulff and his turkish counterpart abdullah gul together laid the foundation stone for a new german-turkish university in istanbul .
the project will combine the strength of both of the two countries systems of higher education , president wulff said . around 5,000 students are to begin studies at the university next year .
german universities are to provide professors and teachers and the courses are to be taught mainly in german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff visited the blue mosque in istanbul at the close of his visit , wulff described the five days as " extremely positive . "
" i have felt at every stage the trust felt towards germany , " he said on friday .
he said key issues had been discussed openly , and there had been agreement on all the essential political questions .
turkey , he said , was on its way to becoming a successful economy .
religion and integration topping the agenda wulff 's visit was the first by a german president to turkey in more than a decade , and came at a time of heightened tension in germany itself over the place of its ethnic minorities , of which turks form the largest group .
wulff also became the first german head of state to address the turkish parliament .
in his speech on tuesday , the president explicitly addressed the problem of the integration of turkish immigrants in german .
" our fellow citizens of turkish origin are welcome in our country , and belong to our country , " he said .
" as their president , i urge every immigrant to actively integrate in german society . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff was the first german president to adress the turkish parliament germany has around four million muslims among its population of 82 million , with 2.5 million turks forming the largest ethnic minority .
wulff also pushed for more freedom of religion for christians within turkey , taking part in a church service in the southern city of tartus , said to be the birthplace of paul the apostle .
on friday morning , the german president met with bartholomew i , the istanbul-based greek orthodox patriarch of constantinople .
he later visited the blue mosque and the hagia sophia , formerly a christian church .

bayern needs points if they hope to free themselves of the rut that has them currently sitting in ninth place in the table .
" hamburg had the big chances , " said bayern captain philipp lahm , " so there are times when you have to be satisfied with one point . "
bayern have been deeply cut by a swathe of injuries this season and played without several key players friday , including mark van bommel , daniel van buyten and miroslav klose .
' better than nothing ' fourth-place hamburg could have used a win to gain ground on bayer leverkusen .
the two teams are currently even at 15 points with leverkusen ahead on goals , but leverkusen could widen the gap again on sunday with a win against mainz .
the match was relatively even , although hamburg did have better chances to score .
that included a very near-miss by jonathan pitroipa , who only had bayern keeper joerg butt to beat but bounced his shot off the right post .
" pitroipa should have scored , " hamburg coach armin veh said after the game .
" -lrb- but -rrb- at least we kept a clean sheet . "
" better one point against bayern than none , " added hamburg 's captain heiko westermann .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 22.10.2010 poor weather creates small but tasty vintage of riesling wines großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wine prices may increase when 2010 's grapes hit the market the 2010 wine yield has suffered across europe after a rainy and cold summer .
but german winemakers hope a unique blend of sugar and acid will make this year 's vintage an exceptional flavor - even if there is less of it . german winemakers harvested about half of the amount of grapes they took out of vineyards last year making it one of the worst yields in decades , according to michael bluemling , a wine grower on the moselle river . " it 's always disappointing when you 're harvesting less fruit than expected , " he told deutsche welle . this october bluemling harvested just 5,000 liters per hectare , less than half of the maximum yield of 12,500 liters .
a cold snap in june stifled what winegrowers call the fruit set - the critical phase when the grapevine 's flowers are fertilized and start growing into grapes . a rainy august also dampened hopes for the 2010 vintage .
grapes - and germans - suffered through twice as much rain and a third less sunshine compared to an average august . the lack of sun kept the grapes from fully developing and all the moisture led the botrytis fungus , which gives the riesling grapes their sweet taste , to develop too quickly .
this destroyed some of the crop , further reducing the harvest . problems for local economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael bluemling was disappointed by the low harvest the low yield could hit the local economy hard . " wine is everything for this area , " bluemling said .
" the romans cultivated wine 2,000 years ago and since then the wine growing is very important for this region . " the state rhineland-palatinate , where bluemling works , produces 90 percent of germany 's export wines and 70 percent of the nation 's total wine production .
some 12,000 businesses in the state are relying on the harvest to produce wine . despite this year 's catastrophic harvest , bluemling said he remains optimistic about how the riesling growers will fare over the next year because of 2009 's bumper harvest . " the wineries still have some wine from the last years and so all the wineries in our region are going to survive the smaller vintage and we hope that the next vintage will be totally different , " bluemling said . but hans rainer schultz from the wine research center in giesenheim is n't so optimistic . " the lower yield is going to be very painful for many wine growers , because some of them only harvested about 50 percent of what they normally harvest , " schultz said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grape fungus developed more quickly in the wet weather and reduced crop yields overall predictions for the german wine harvest show a 23 percent drop on the average yield .
schultz said german winegrowers were n't alone .
vineyards in austria and italy have seen their yields fall as well .
schultz said he think this lower yield will be reflected in wine prices . " within europe , the yield is going to be smaller , and i think on average the prices are going to increase , " he said . unusual taste regarding the taste of this year 's riesling wine , schutz is n't quite as glum .
he said despite a lot of fear about this year 's vintage , winemakers will be able to make a decent wine . " what was very unusual with riesling this year is that we had relatively high levels of sugar but at the same time relatively high levels of acid , " he said .
" i think that 's something that will make the 2010 vintage quite exciting , because this combination only happens very rarely . " while the 2010 vintage may turn out to be unusually good , he added that winemakers will have to wait and see if an increase in prices will be able to compensate winegrowers for their low yields . author : natalia dannenberg editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the answer lies as much on where the targets are located as who they are . even before us president barack obama took office , he said the united states would hunt down suspected terrorists and kill or capture them wherever they could be found . " there can be no safe haven for al-qaeda terrorists who killed thousands of americans and threaten our homeland today , " he said while on the campaign trail in march 2008 . pursuing that goal , the obama administration began using unmanned aerial vehicles to conduct strikes three days into his term and has ratcheted up the frequency of drone attacks compared to his predecessor george w. bush . us assurances the overall increase in drone strikes implies that obama 's lawyers feel they are on solid legal ground , according to kirsten ainley , a lecturer in the international relations department at the london school of economics . " harold koh -lsb- a top legal advisor at the us state department -rsb- has been very keen to justify the use of drones under international legal standards though he has n't specified precisely how they meet them , " ainley told deutsche welle .

while estimates on the number of civilians killed in the strikes vary widely , a brookings institution study from 2009 showed 10 civilian casualities for each militant killed . cia director leon panetta , however , said drones represent " the only game in town in terms of confronting or trying to disrupt the al-qaeda leadership .

" in cities and towns and in rural areas where there is no armed conflict going on it 's not appropriate to use battlefield weapons and tactics , " she told deutsche welle , adding that just because people at some point took part in an armed conflict , they can not indefinitely be regarded as participants . inordinate response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drones themselves do not pose a threat to international law even if militants return to pakistan , a nation with which the us is not at war , after conducting attacks in afghanistan , it 's up to pakistan - not the us or nato troops in afghanistan - to root out militants using its territory as a safe haven , o 'connell said . " you can carry out countermeasures ; you can certainly beef up your strength and defenses on your side of the border , but you do n't get to send your own military on another sovereign state 's territory because of that kind of lawlessness , " she said , adding that similar cases had been heard on this issue both with us agents in nicaragua and the conflict between congo and uganda . there are times when the use of force under international law comes under scrutiny , such as the nato bombing campaign in kosovo in 1999 , which prompted discussion about the use of force and humanitarian intervention .
but ainley said drone use is not an issue where she sees international law needing an update as there is no legal requirement that a human be close to where weapons are fired . " what is challenging international law is how we define what the battlefield of a war is , " she said . author : sean sinico editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he advocated in a speech on thursday tougher eurozone regulations , including sanctions to punish high deficits . the european union will be put to the test unless it tightens the measures in its stability and growth pact , according to german foreign minister guido westerwelle .
westerwelle said in a keynote speech to the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- in berlin on thursday that he was worried about europe , " because we will lose the people 's support if we simply proceed with our agenda after this crisis . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy agreed to fight against automatically imposed sanctions in renewed criticism of an agreement between chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy to drop demands for automatic sanctions on countries that breach the eurozone 's deficit ceiling , westerwelle urged political cooperation across europe to toughen the growth and stability pact .
" it is crucial that sanctions are not subjected to political opportunism , " westerwelle said .
merkel 's decision seemed to take westerwelle and other members of the governing coalition by surprise , but she insisted on thursday that she and westerwelle were on the same page regarding the proposal .
" we are completely in agreement , " merkel said , " that we should get a clear mandate for devising treaty changes by early next year , so these can be implemented by individual states by 2013 . " previously , merkel had supported the idea of more automatic sanctions that would take politics out of the equation , and her change of tune is seen by some as caving in to pressure from france . ' more sanctions , please ' westerwelle also warned against isolationist politics within the eu 's 27 member nations , saying that another financial crisis could ruin the fruits of decades of european politics .
" that 's why it 's so important that we act consistently and decisively in the interest of europe 's inner cohesion , " he said .
" a hard euro ca n't tolerate soft rules . "
westerwelle referred to the 22 proceedings brought against eu member states for acute deficits in the past few years .
he said sanctions had not been applied in a single one of these cases .
the foreign minister called for a mechanism to place sanctions on countries with bulging deficits , including bigger eu states .
the eurozone , westerwelle said , needed such a system to be consistent and ensure impartiality .
" it makes a big practical difference if sanctions are passed by a two-thirds majority , or blocked by a two-thirds majority , " he said .
westerwelle also countered those who might express discouragement with the european common currency , stressing that re-nationalization was not an option in the wake of the greek debt crisis .

match day nine represents the start of the second quarter of the bundesliga season , which means we 've entered what is officially termed the “ run-up to christmas ” - both in footballing and commercial terms . you may not know it , but we 're on the home straight towards christmas . this means two important things - kicking a ball and spending more money - will suddenly be jostling for attention in the brains of germany 's professional footballers . that may prove too heavy a mental burden , so on-field concentration could easily slip .
but given the form of the dw predictors over the last two weeks -lrb- 10 points from a possible 54 -rrb- , one more random factor can probably only help .
friday , october 22 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friday 's north-south derby is a bundesliga classic hamburg-bayern as the team that stopped the juggernaut that was mainz last week with a 1-0 away win , hamburg might be confident they can take on a bigger team of reds in what is known as the north-south derby .
but they are facing a resurgent bayern munich , who are clearly growing in confidence after a dreadful start , and who will be galvanized by the return of their famous dusel -lrb- luck -rrb- in their win over cfr cluj in the champions league .
moreover , bayern coach louis van gaal has made this a do-or-die game for his team 's championship hopes .
“ we ca n't drop many more points .
we have to win in hamburg , ” he told reporters after the cluj game .
the dutchman is basically baiting fate , and call me a fool , but i think fate will bite - gomez to get a deflected winner in injury time .
bayern 2-1 saturday , october 23 frankfurt-schalke schalke will also have an extra spring in their stride this weekend after a successful excursion in the champions league .
they watched israeli champions hapoel fold against the onslaught by the royal blues ’ star signing raul .
the spanish veteran scored two - one more than he has scored all season in the bundesliga - and there are signs that felix magath 's carefully constructed and thoroughly oiled schalke machine is finally beginning to find its gears .
that said , frankfurt are on a run of three straight wins , and greek forward theofanis gekas is on fire just now - he became the joint top scorer in the league during last week 's 3-0 drubbing of kaiserslautern .
hard not to see both sides scoring .
draw 2-2 moenchengladbach-werder bremen unlike bayern and schalke , werder ’ s champions league match this week was not a rousing home win , but a tough 1-1 draw away to the dutch champions fc twente .
they have n't kept a clean sheet in the league since match day three , and they lost their first choice goalkeeper tim wiese to a knee injury in the aforementioned melee in the netherlands .
their second-choice goalkeeper is also out , so they are relying on 21-year-old sebastian mielitz between the sticks , a rookie with two bundesliga games and half of wednesday 's european match to his name .
it 's a godsend , then , that werder are facing the only team in the bundesliga with a worse defensive record .
moenchengladbach are shipping an average of nearly three goals a game at the moment , are toiling one point above the relegation zone , and are without eight first-team players for this match .
you 'd have to expect the likes of claudio pizarro , aaron hunt and hugo almeida to do some damage .
werder bremen 4-1 freiburg-kaiserslautern freiburg might have lost away to werder last week , but it was a defiant loss , and they were inches away from snatching a draw in the closing minutes at the weserstadion .
for no discernable reason , the modest team from the far south-western corner of the country is riding around in the top half of the table above the likes of bayern , werder and wolfsburg .
kaiserslautern , meanwhile , are coming to town on the back of four morale-sapping losses to frankfurt -lrb- 0-3 -rrb- , hamburg -lrb- 1-2 -rrb- , hanover -lrb- 0-1 -rrb- and the carnage of a trip to dortmund -lrb- 0-5 -rrb- .
but freiburg are blinking nervously in the heady heights , and kaiserslautern could well figure their luck must be about to turn soon .
plus the last time they played a southern team they tonked bayern 2-0 .
draw 1-1 hanover-cologne bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's keeper is in a huff ... but that 's just one worry among many a blistering start to the season for hanover -lrb- 13 points from six games -rrb- came to a thudding end two games ago when they ran into st. pauli .
that 1-0 loss , coupled with the international break that followed , apparently sapped their momentum .
the club then crashed headlong into bayern and mario gomez last week - who scored a brilliant hat-trick .
but if hanover were looking for a confidence boosting opponent , they could hardly have asked for anyone better than cologne , to whom the word “ crisis ” has been attached for weeks .
the pram belonging to resident star lukas podolski is rapidly running out of rattles , and handbags were drawn when colombian keeper faryd mondragon swanned off to the us to play for colombia without permission .
cologne - second from bottom - are still waiting for their second win of the season , but it 's unlikely to come this weekend .
hanover 1-0 nuremberg-wolfsburg wolfsburg are an unpredictable bunch this time round .
their results chart looks like a stock market in a volatile boom-bust economy : three straight defeats were followed by three straight victories , and then last week 's thriller against leverkusen saw them do it all in microcosm - they gave up a 2-0 lead to lose 3-2 in the space of 10 minutes .
but despite this , it 's clear that new manager steve mcclaren is beginning to get his killer trio of edin dzeko , diego and grafite into a groove .
but modest nuremberg are not an easy team to crack , at least for a bottom half side .
but despite last week 's madness , the momentum seems to be with wolfsburg , and there should be more space between the teams than a single place .
wolfsburg 2-1 sunday , october 24 dortmund-hoffenheim the sunday matches all feature germany 's europa league representatives , who played thursday evening , but dortmund did not have to travel , so weariness should not be a factor for the league leaders .
this is good news , because this match should be a cracker .
it 's first against fourth , and dortmund are currently rampaging through the league like they used to back in the day , i.e. the mid-90s .
it 's a heartening sight for those who can remember when bayern had a proper rival , and they are up against - in theory - one of the most exciting new forces in german football in hoffenheim .
while they were undone last year by a thin squad , coach ralf rangnick ’ s men are looking a more robust force this time round .
but despite good results , their recent draw against struggling cologne shows how fallible they are .
dortmund 2-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like the good old days - dortmund on the rampage leverkusen-mainz this one should also be a great game , with second-placed mainz away to third-placed leverkusen .
mainz 's run of seven straight wins came to an abrupt halt last week against hamburg , so it will be interesting to see if the unfancied club can get the ball rolling again .
everyone is expecting this bunch of cheeky young jack-rabbits to finally wake up and realize it was all a big misunderstanding , and they should be hacking through years of mid-table obscurity like honest , decent folk .
so will they dare to dream ?
leverkusen , meanwhile , are exactly the kind of grizzled , seen-it-all veterans who will know how to sap the will of these idealistic young upstarts .
it 's a bit like morgan freeman and brad pitt in seven .
hopefully with a bit less torture .
leverkusen 2-1 stuttgart-st.pauli it would take some kind of devastating natural disaster for stuttgart 's season to get much worse , but last week 's 2-2 draw against schalke - orchestrated by nubile new manager jens keller - was a definite improvement .
coupled with that , their very handy 1-0 win over getafe in the europa league on thursday will have further boosted confidence .
when you have four points from eight games , i guess the only way is up .
they are facing a st. pauli side who may be all of twelve places above them , but have not exactly been the model of consistency in the last few match days .
but all things being equal , st. pauli did just record a very impressive 3-2 win over nuremberg , and will expect to beat stuttgart , even if it does take sheer will .

mainz 's run of seven straight wins came to an abrupt halt last week against hamburg , so it will be interesting to see if the unfancied club can get the ball rolling again .
everyone is expecting this bunch of cheeky young jack-rabbits to finally wake up and realize it was all a big misunderstanding , and they should be hacking through years of mid-table obscurity like honest , decent folk .
so will they dare to dream ?
leverkusen , meanwhile , are exactly the kind of grizzled , seen-it-all veterans who will know how to sap the will of these idealistic young upstarts .
it 's a bit like morgan freeman and brad pitt in seven .
hopefully with a bit less torture .
leverkusen 2-1 stuttgart-st.pauli it would take some kind of devastating natural disaster for stuttgart 's season to get much worse , but last week 's 2-2 draw against schalke - orchestrated by nubile new manager jens keller - was a definite improvement .
coupled with that , their very handy 1-0 win over getafe in the europa league on thursday will have further boosted confidence .
when you have four points from eight games , i guess the only way is up .
they are facing a st. pauli side who may be all of twelve places above them , but have not exactly been the model of consistency in the last few match days .
but all things being equal , st. pauli did just record a very impressive 3-2 win over nuremberg , and will expect to beat stuttgart , even if it does take sheer will .

match day nine represents the start of the second quarter of the bundesliga season , which means we 've entered what is officially termed the “ run-up to christmas ” - both in footballing and commercial terms . you may not know it , but we 're on the home straight towards christmas . this means two important things - kicking a ball and spending more money - will suddenly be jostling for attention in the brains of germany 's professional footballers . that may prove too heavy a mental burden , so on-field concentration could easily slip .
but given the form of the dw predictors over the last two weeks -lrb- 10 points from a possible 54 -rrb- , one more random factor can probably only help .
friday , october 22 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friday 's north-south derby is a bundesliga classic hamburg-bayern as the team that stopped the juggernaut that was mainz last week with a 1-0 away win , hamburg might be confident they can take on a bigger team of reds in what is known as the north-south derby .
but they are facing a resurgent bayern munich , who are clearly growing in confidence after a dreadful start , and who will be galvanized by the return of their famous dusel -lrb- luck -rrb- in their win over cfr cluj in the champions league .
moreover , bayern coach louis van gaal has made this a do-or-die game for his team 's championship hopes .
“ we ca n't drop many more points .
we have to win in hamburg , ” he told reporters after the cluj game .
the dutchman is basically baiting fate , and call me a fool , but i think fate will bite - gomez to get a deflected winner in injury time .
bayern 2-1 saturday , october 23 frankfurt-schalke schalke will also have an extra spring in their stride this weekend after a successful excursion in the champions league .
they watched israeli champions hapoel fold against the onslaught by the royal blues ’ star signing raul .
the spanish veteran scored two - one more than he has scored all season in the bundesliga - and there are signs that felix magath 's carefully constructed and thoroughly oiled schalke machine is finally beginning to find its gears .
that said , frankfurt are on a run of three straight wins , and greek forward theofanis gekas is on fire just now - he became the joint top scorer in the league during last week 's 3-0 drubbing of kaiserslautern .
hard not to see both sides scoring .
draw 2-2 moenchengladbach-werder bremen unlike bayern and schalke , werder ’ s champions league match this week was not a rousing home win , but a tough 1-1 draw away to the dutch champions fc twente .
they have n't kept a clean sheet in the league since match day three , and they lost their first choice goalkeeper tim wiese to a knee injury in the aforementioned melee in the netherlands .
their second-choice goalkeeper is also out , so they are relying on 21-year-old sebastian mielitz between the sticks , a rookie with two bundesliga games and half of wednesday 's european match to his name .
it 's a godsend , then , that werder are facing the only team in the bundesliga with a worse defensive record .
moenchengladbach are shipping an average of nearly three goals a game at the moment , are toiling one point above the relegation zone , and are without eight first-team players for this match .
you 'd have to expect the likes of claudio pizarro , aaron hunt and hugo almeida to do some damage .
werder bremen 4-1 freiburg-kaiserslautern freiburg might have lost away to werder last week , but it was a defiant loss , and they were inches away from snatching a draw in the closing minutes at the weserstadion .
for no discernable reason , the modest team from the far south-western corner of the country is riding around in the top half of the table above the likes of bayern , werder and wolfsburg .
kaiserslautern , meanwhile , are coming to town on the back of four morale-sapping losses to frankfurt -lrb- 0-3 -rrb- , hamburg -lrb- 1-2 -rrb- , hanover -lrb- 0-1 -rrb- and the carnage of a trip to dortmund -lrb- 0-5 -rrb- .
but freiburg are blinking nervously in the heady heights , and kaiserslautern could well figure their luck must be about to turn soon .
plus the last time they played a southern team they tonked bayern 2-0 .
draw 1-1 hanover-cologne bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's keeper is in a huff ... but that 's just one worry among many a blistering start to the season for hanover -lrb- 13 points from six games -rrb- came to a thudding end two games ago when they ran into st. pauli .
that 1-0 loss , coupled with the international break that followed , apparently sapped their momentum .
the club then crashed headlong into bayern and mario gomez last week - who scored a brilliant hat-trick .
but if hanover were looking for a confidence boosting opponent , they could hardly have asked for anyone better than cologne , to whom the word “ crisis ” has been attached for weeks .
the pram belonging to resident star lukas podolski is rapidly running out of rattles , and handbags were drawn when colombian keeper faryd mondragon swanned off to the us to play for colombia without permission .
cologne - second from bottom - are still waiting for their second win of the season , but it 's unlikely to come this weekend .
hanover 1-0 nuremberg-wolfsburg wolfsburg are an unpredictable bunch this time round .
their results chart looks like a stock market in a volatile boom-bust economy : three straight defeats were followed by three straight victories , and then last week 's thriller against leverkusen saw them do it all in microcosm - they gave up a 2-0 lead to lose 3-2 in the space of 10 minutes .
but despite this , it 's clear that new manager steve mcclaren is beginning to get his killer trio of edin dzeko , diego and grafite into a groove .
but modest nuremberg are not an easy team to crack , at least for a bottom half side .
but despite last week 's madness , the momentum seems to be with wolfsburg , and there should be more space between the teams than a single place .
wolfsburg 2-1 sunday , october 24 dortmund-hoffenheim the sunday matches all feature germany 's europa league representatives , who played thursday evening , but dortmund did not have to travel , so weariness should not be a factor for the league leaders .
this is good news , because this match should be a cracker .
it 's first against fourth , and dortmund are currently rampaging through the league like they used to back in the day , i.e. the mid-90s .
it 's a heartening sight for those who can remember when bayern had a proper rival , and they are up against - in theory - one of the most exciting new forces in german football in hoffenheim .
while they were undone last year by a thin squad , coach ralf rangnick ’ s men are looking a more robust force this time round .
but despite good results , their recent draw against struggling cologne shows how fallible they are .
dortmund 2-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like the good old days - dortmund on the rampage leverkusen-mainz this one should also be a great game , with second-placed mainz away to third-placed leverkusen .

unions have called for more strike action . the french senate has voted through president nicolas sarkozy 's unpopular reform of the country 's pension system , which would raise the minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 and the maximum age for a full pension from 65 to 67 .
the bill has already been passed by the national assembly , but still needs to be approved by a parliamentary committee , a process that is likely to be completed next wednesday .

deutsche welle 's jane paulick got her geek chic on and had a look . weird sights are nothing unusual within berlin 's nightlife , but the scene i witnessed at the fc magnet club in the mitte district last week was weird in a very novel kind of way . in a neighborhood that 's widely known as party central , well over a hundred people had gathered to listen to self-proclaimed nerds hold forth on subjects close to their heart .
the event was berlin 's third ever ' nerdnite , ' and the evening 's topics included laser technology , geometry in islamic art and buffy the vampire slayer . according to urban dictionary , a ' nerd ' is " an individual who does not conform to society 's belief that all people should follow trends and do what their peers do .
-lsb- they are -rsb- often highly intelligent but socially rejected because of their obsession with a given subject . " celebrating dorkdom it 's a description that many in berlin must identify with , because the club was packed to the rafters .
nerdy is obviously the new sexy , even if the subheading on nerdnite 's website is " be here and be square . " but as far as i could tell , the audience was made up neither of squares nor social rejects .
give or take a few pairs of heavy-framed spectacles , they were the same people usually sighted propping up bars and burning up dance floors at clubs with strict door policies .
so what on earth were they doing listening to barbara - known to her friends as ' laser babs ' - waxing lyrical on the awesomeness of laws of physics ? " i think people come to nerdnite for fun , beer and some edutainment as well , " said co-organizer jan renz .
" it 's a mixture of assembling interesting facts about random topics and realizing that other people have nerdy interests as well , from the professor to the laser engineer , from the beer-loving dude to the housewife next door . " are lectures the new concerts ? it 's not the only event of its kind in the capital these days .
a concept first dreamt up in japan , pecha kucha nights have recently become a regular fixture at the festsaal kreuzberg club , and involve someone talking along to 20 images , for 20 seconds each , about a subject of their choice . then there are the berlin bunny lectures , organized by supatopcheckerbunny at the nbi club in prenzlauer berg , which feature invited experts discussing topics as diverse as nutrition , monarchy , outer space and reality versus illusion .
meanwhile , hip venues including the edelweiss and the lido have started hosting science slams , which see boffins vye for audience favor with arcane theories and facts . laser babs , however , prefers the more relaxed vibe at nerdnite . " what i like is that there 's no competitive aspect to it , " she said .
" that 's why it 's so popular ... nerds can let off steam without any pressure - and get free beer into the bargain , and the audience can chill out over a drink and marvel at how obsessive people can get about obscure stuff .
and everyone gets to feel part of something that 's kind of zeitgeisty . " back of the class speaking for myself , it takes a bit more than this to get me out on a chilly thursday evening .
the nerds ' enthusiasm for their subjects is endearing , and the audience appears genuinely enthralled .
in this age of disposable , dumbed-down entertainment , it 's reassuring to think that people are still fascinated by difficult topics - especially in berlin , where there 's no shortage of cheap thrills . but i find my gaze drifting repeatedly towards the episode of " the forgotten " that 's showing on the tv above the bar with the sound turned off .
does n't christian slater look old , i muse .
i force myself to concentrate on the powerpoint lecture , but it 's no good .
my inner egghead has n't been awoken .
it 's definitely still slumbering , and after a few hours of nerdnite , so am i. author : jane paulick editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he advocated in a speech on thursday tougher eurozone regulations , including sanctions to punish high deficits . the european union will be put to the test unless it tightens the measures in its stability and growth pact , according to german foreign minister guido westerwelle .
westerwelle said in a keynote speech to the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- in berlin on thursday that he was worried about europe , " because we will lose the people 's support if we simply proceed with our agenda after this crisis . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy agreed to fight against automatically imposed sanctions in renewed criticism of an agreement between chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy to drop demands for automatic sanctions on countries that breach the eurozone 's deficit ceiling , westerwelle urged political cooperation across europe to toughen the growth and stability pact .
" it is crucial that sanctions are not subjected to political opportunism , " westerwelle said .
merkel 's decision seemed to take westerwelle and other members of the governing coalition by surprise , but she insisted on thursday that she and westerwelle were on the same page regarding the proposal .
" we are completely in agreement , " merkel said , " that we should get a clear mandate for devising treaty changes by early next year , so these can be implemented by individual states by 2013 . " previously , merkel had supported the idea of more automatic sanctions that would take politics out of the equation , and her change of tune is seen by some as caving in to pressure from france . ' more sanctions , please ' westerwelle also warned against isolationist politics within the eu 's 27 member nations , saying that another financial crisis could ruin the fruits of decades of european politics .
" that 's why it 's so important that we act consistently and decisively in the interest of europe 's inner cohesion , " he said .
" a hard euro ca n't tolerate soft rules . "
westerwelle referred to the 22 proceedings brought against eu member states for acute deficits in the past few years .
he said sanctions had not been applied in a single one of these cases .
the foreign minister called for a mechanism to place sanctions on countries with bulging deficits , including bigger eu states .
the eurozone , westerwelle said , needed such a system to be consistent and ensure impartiality .
" it makes a big practical difference if sanctions are passed by a two-thirds majority , or blocked by a two-thirds majority , " he said .
westerwelle also countered those who might express discouragement with the european common currency , stressing that re-nationalization was not an option in the wake of the greek debt crisis .

the answer lies as much on where the targets are located as who they are . even before us president barack obama took office , he said the united states would hunt down suspected terrorists and kill or capture them wherever they could be found . " there can be no safe haven for al-qaeda terrorists who killed thousands of americans and threaten our homeland today , " he said while on the campaign trail in march 2008 . pursuing that goal , the obama administration began using unmanned aerial vehicles to conduct strikes three days into his term and has ratcheted up the frequency of drone attacks compared to his predecessor george w. bush . us assurances the overall increase in drone strikes implies that obama 's lawyers feel they are on solid legal ground , according to kirsten ainley , a lecturer in the international relations department at the london school of economics . " harold koh -lsb- a top legal advisor at the us state department -rsb- has been very keen to justify the use of drones under international legal standards though he has n't specified precisely how they meet them , " ainley told deutsche welle .
" but he has said ' we take international law very seriously and all of us actions meet with the standards of international law . " ' us strikes in pakistan 's northwest tribal regions , which border afghanistan , have resulted in at least 150 deaths since september 3 according to the afp news agency .
while estimates on the number of civilians killed in the strikes vary widely , a brookings institution study from 2009 showed 10 civilian casualities for each militant killed . cia director leon panetta , however , said drones represent " the only game in town in terms of confronting or trying to disrupt the al-qaeda leadership . " bildunterschrift : drones are capable of flying for hours on end right to self-defense in addition to doing what it sees as necessary to destroy terror networks , the united states is working within the framework of international law when conducting drone strikes , according to jordan paust of the university of houston law center . while the united states is not in a legal sense " at war " with al-qaeda , which has not been given the status even of an insurgent , he says the us can defend itself against attacks from the group , including engaging enemies in the expanded de facto theater of war into parts of pakistan . " we have a right of self-defense against non-state actors ' armed attacks on our soldiers in afghanistan , our country , our embassies abroad , " paust told deutsche welle . " as a matter of self-defense , a state can target any non-state actor that is directly participating in ongoing armed attacks , " he said , adding that al-qaeda and the taliban have been engaged in a process of armed attacks against us soldiers and others in afghanistan for years . on and off the battlefield other legal experts , however , disagree , saying that the scale of hostilities aimed at al-qaeda terrorists do not fit the mould of self-defense as detailed in article 51 of the un charter and that targeting individuals away from battlefields is not protected under international law . bildunterschrift : drones are remotely controlled far away from the places their missiles are fired while allowing for the legal use of drones on established fields of battle , mary ellen o 'connell , a professor of international law and international dispute resolution at notre dame university in the united states , said international law can not justify the use of unmanned aerial vehicles capable of dropping bombs and firing powerful missiles outside of the battlefield . " in cities and towns and in rural areas where there is no armed conflict going on it 's not appropriate to use battlefield weapons and tactics , " she told deutsche welle , adding that just because people at some point took part in an armed conflict , they can not indefinitely be regarded as participants . inordinate response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drones themselves do not pose a threat to international law even if militants return to pakistan , a nation with which the us is not at war , after conducting attacks in afghanistan , it 's up to pakistan - not the us or nato troops in afghanistan - to root out militants using its territory as a safe haven , o 'connell said . " you can carry out countermeasures ; you can certainly beef up your strength and defenses on your side of the border , but you do n't get to send your own military on another sovereign state 's territory because of that kind of lawlessness , " she said , adding that similar cases had been heard on this issue both with us agents in nicaragua and the conflict between congo and uganda . there are times when the use of force under international law comes under scrutiny , such as the nato bombing campaign in kosovo in 1999 , which prompted discussion about the use of force and humanitarian intervention .
but ainley said drone use is not an issue where she sees international law needing an update as there is no legal requirement that a human be close to where weapons are fired . " what is challenging international law is how we define what the battlefield of a war is , " she said . author : sean sinico editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de top us official apologizes for deaths of pakistani troops in a letter to pakistan 's army chief ashfaq kayani , admiral mullen , us chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , has expressed his condolences over the killings of two pakistani border troops in a nato helicopter strike .

the answer lies as much on where the targets are located as who they are . even before us president barack obama took office , he said the united states would hunt down suspected terrorists and kill or capture them wherever they could be found . " there can be no safe haven for al-qaeda terrorists who killed thousands of americans and threaten our homeland today , " he said while on the campaign trail in march 2008 . pursuing that goal , the obama administration began using unmanned aerial vehicles to conduct strikes three days into his term and has ratcheted up the frequency of drone attacks compared to his predecessor george w. bush . us assurances the overall increase in drone strikes implies that obama 's lawyers feel they are on solid legal ground , according to kirsten ainley , a lecturer in the international relations department at the london school of economics .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 22.10.2010 in match day nine , dw 's predictions head into the season 's second quarter großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's in store for dw 's picks on match day nine ?
match day nine represents the start of the second quarter of the bundesliga season , which means we 've entered what is officially termed the “ run-up to christmas ” - both in footballing and commercial terms . you may not know it , but we 're on the home straight towards christmas . this means two important things - kicking a ball and spending more money - will suddenly be jostling for attention in the brains of germany 's professional footballers . that may prove too heavy a mental burden , so on-field concentration could easily slip .
but given the form of the dw predictors over the last two weeks -lrb- 10 points from a possible 54 -rrb- , one more random factor can probably only help .
friday , october 22 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friday 's north-south derby is a bundesliga classic hamburg-bayern as the team that stopped the juggernaut that was mainz last week with a 1-0 away win , hamburg might be confident they can take on a bigger team of reds in what is known as the north-south derby .
but they are facing a resurgent bayern munich , who are clearly growing in confidence after a dreadful start , and who will be galvanized by the return of their famous dusel -lrb- luck -rrb- in their win over cfr cluj in the champions league .
moreover , bayern coach louis van gaal has made this a do-or-die game for his team 's championship hopes .
“ we ca n't drop many more points .
we have to win in hamburg , ” he told reporters after the cluj game .
the dutchman is basically baiting fate , and call me a fool , but i think fate will bite - gomez to get a deflected winner in injury time .
bayern 2-1 saturday , october 23 frankfurt-schalke schalke will also have an extra spring in their stride this weekend after a successful excursion in the champions league .
they watched israeli champions hapoel fold against the onslaught by the royal blues ’ star signing raul .
the spanish veteran scored two - one more than he has scored all season in the bundesliga - and there are signs that felix magath 's carefully constructed and thoroughly oiled schalke machine is finally beginning to find its gears .
that said , frankfurt are on a run of three straight wins , and greek forward theofanis gekas is on fire just now - he became the joint top scorer in the league during last week 's 3-0 drubbing of kaiserslautern .
hard not to see both sides scoring .
draw 2-2 moenchengladbach-werder bremen unlike bayern and schalke , werder ’ s champions league match this week was not a rousing home win , but a tough 1-1 draw away to the dutch champions fc twente .
they have n't kept a clean sheet in the league since match day three , and they lost their first choice goalkeeper tim wiese to a knee injury in the aforementioned melee in the netherlands .
their second-choice goalkeeper is also out , so they are relying on 21-year-old sebastian mielitz between the sticks , a rookie with two bundesliga games and half of wednesday 's european match to his name .
it 's a godsend , then , that werder are facing the only team in the bundesliga with a worse defensive record .
moenchengladbach are shipping an average of nearly three goals a game at the moment , are toiling one point above the relegation zone , and are without eight first-team players for this match .
you 'd have to expect the likes of claudio pizarro , aaron hunt and hugo almeida to do some damage .
werder bremen 4-1 freiburg-kaiserslautern freiburg might have lost away to werder last week , but it was a defiant loss , and they were inches away from snatching a draw in the closing minutes at the weserstadion .
for no discernable reason , the modest team from the far south-western corner of the country is riding around in the top half of the table above the likes of bayern , werder and wolfsburg .
kaiserslautern , meanwhile , are coming to town on the back of four morale-sapping losses to frankfurt -lrb- 0-3 -rrb- , hamburg -lrb- 1-2 -rrb- , hanover -lrb- 0-1 -rrb- and the carnage of a trip to dortmund -lrb- 0-5 -rrb- .
but freiburg are blinking nervously in the heady heights , and kaiserslautern could well figure their luck must be about to turn soon .
plus the last time they played a southern team they tonked bayern 2-0 .
draw 1-1 hanover-cologne bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's keeper is in a huff ... but that 's just one worry among many a blistering start to the season for hanover -lrb- 13 points from six games -rrb- came to a thudding end two games ago when they ran into st. pauli .
that 1-0 loss , coupled with the international break that followed , apparently sapped their momentum .
the club then crashed headlong into bayern and mario gomez last week - who scored a brilliant hat-trick .
but if hanover were looking for a confidence boosting opponent , they could hardly have asked for anyone better than cologne , to whom the word “ crisis ” has been attached for weeks .
the pram belonging to resident star lukas podolski is rapidly running out of rattles , and handbags were drawn when colombian keeper faryd mondragon swanned off to the us to play for colombia without permission .
cologne - second from bottom - are still waiting for their second win of the season , but it 's unlikely to come this weekend .
hanover 1-0 nuremberg-wolfsburg wolfsburg are an unpredictable bunch this time round .
their results chart looks like a stock market in a volatile boom-bust economy : three straight defeats were followed by three straight victories , and then last week 's thriller against leverkusen saw them do it all in microcosm - they gave up a 2-0 lead to lose 3-2 in the space of 10 minutes .
but despite this , it 's clear that new manager steve mcclaren is beginning to get his killer trio of edin dzeko , diego and grafite into a groove .
but modest nuremberg are not an easy team to crack , at least for a bottom half side .
but despite last week 's madness , the momentum seems to be with wolfsburg , and there should be more space between the teams than a single place .
wolfsburg 2-1 sunday , october 24 dortmund-hoffenheim the sunday matches all feature germany 's europa league representatives , who played thursday evening , but dortmund did not have to travel , so weariness should not be a factor for the league leaders .
this is good news , because this match should be a cracker .
it 's first against fourth , and dortmund are currently rampaging through the league like they used to back in the day , i.e. the mid-90s .
it 's a heartening sight for those who can remember when bayern had a proper rival , and they are up against - in theory - one of the most exciting new forces in german football in hoffenheim .
while they were undone last year by a thin squad , coach ralf rangnick ’ s men are looking a more robust force this time round .
but despite good results , their recent draw against struggling cologne shows how fallible they are .
dortmund 2-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like the good old days - dortmund on the rampage leverkusen-mainz this one should also be a great game , with second-placed mainz away to third-placed leverkusen .
mainz 's run of seven straight wins came to an abrupt halt last week against hamburg , so it will be interesting to see if the unfancied club can get the ball rolling again .
everyone is expecting this bunch of cheeky young jack-rabbits to finally wake up and realize it was all a big misunderstanding , and they should be hacking through years of mid-table obscurity like honest , decent folk .
so will they dare to dream ?
leverkusen , meanwhile , are exactly the kind of grizzled , seen-it-all veterans who will know how to sap the will of these idealistic young upstarts .
it 's a bit like morgan freeman and brad pitt in seven .
hopefully with a bit less torture .
leverkusen 2-1 stuttgart-st.pauli it would take some kind of devastating natural disaster for stuttgart 's season to get much worse , but last week 's 2-2 draw against schalke - orchestrated by nubile new manager jens keller - was a definite improvement .
coupled with that , their very handy 1-0 win over getafe in the europa league on thursday will have further boosted confidence .
when you have four points from eight games , i guess the only way is up .
they are facing a st. pauli side who may be all of twelve places above them , but have not exactly been the model of consistency in the last few match days .
but all things being equal , st. pauli did just record a very impressive 3-2 win over nuremberg , and will expect to beat stuttgart , even if it does take sheer will .

but they are facing a resurgent bayern munich , who are clearly growing in confidence after a dreadful start , and who will be galvanized by the return of their famous dusel -lrb- luck -rrb- in their win over cfr cluj in the champions league .
moreover , bayern coach louis van gaal has made this a do-or-die game for his team 's championship hopes .
“ we ca n't drop many more points .
we have to win in hamburg , ” he told reporters after the cluj game .
the dutchman is basically baiting fate , and call me a fool , but i think fate will bite - gomez to get a deflected winner in injury time .
bayern 2-1 saturday , october 23 frankfurt-schalke schalke will also have an extra spring in their stride this weekend after a successful excursion in the champions league .
they watched israeli champions hapoel fold against the onslaught by the royal blues ’ star signing raul .
the spanish veteran scored two - one more than he has scored all season in the bundesliga - and there are signs that felix magath 's carefully constructed and thoroughly oiled schalke machine is finally beginning to find its gears .
that said , frankfurt are on a run of three straight wins , and greek forward theofanis gekas is on fire just now - he became the joint top scorer in the league during last week 's 3-0 drubbing of kaiserslautern .
hard not to see both sides scoring .
draw 2-2 moenchengladbach-werder bremen unlike bayern and schalke , werder ’ s champions league match this week was not a rousing home win , but a tough 1-1 draw away to the dutch champions fc twente .
they have n't kept a clean sheet in the league since match day three , and they lost their first choice goalkeeper tim wiese to a knee injury in the aforementioned melee in the netherlands .
their second-choice goalkeeper is also out , so they are relying on 21-year-old sebastian mielitz between the sticks , a rookie with two bundesliga games and half of wednesday 's european match to his name .
it 's a godsend , then , that werder are facing the only team in the bundesliga with a worse defensive record .
moenchengladbach are shipping an average of nearly three goals a game at the moment , are toiling one point above the relegation zone , and are without eight first-team players for this match .
you 'd have to expect the likes of claudio pizarro , aaron hunt and hugo almeida to do some damage .
werder bremen 4-1 freiburg-kaiserslautern freiburg might have lost away to werder last week , but it was a defiant loss , and they were inches away from snatching a draw in the closing minutes at the weserstadion .
for no discernable reason , the modest team from the far south-western corner of the country is riding around in the top half of the table above the likes of bayern , werder and wolfsburg .
kaiserslautern , meanwhile , are coming to town on the back of four morale-sapping losses to frankfurt -lrb- 0-3 -rrb- , hamburg -lrb- 1-2 -rrb- , hanover -lrb- 0-1 -rrb- and the carnage of a trip to dortmund -lrb- 0-5 -rrb- .
but freiburg are blinking nervously in the heady heights , and kaiserslautern could well figure their luck must be about to turn soon .
plus the last time they played a southern team they tonked bayern 2-0 .
draw 1-1 hanover-cologne bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's keeper is in a huff ... but that 's just one worry among many a blistering start to the season for hanover -lrb- 13 points from six games -rrb- came to a thudding end two games ago when they ran into st. pauli .
that 1-0 loss , coupled with the international break that followed , apparently sapped their momentum .
the club then crashed headlong into bayern and mario gomez last week - who scored a brilliant hat-trick .
but if hanover were looking for a confidence boosting opponent , they could hardly have asked for anyone better than cologne , to whom the word “ crisis ” has been attached for weeks .
the pram belonging to resident star lukas podolski is rapidly running out of rattles , and handbags were drawn when colombian keeper faryd mondragon swanned off to the us to play for colombia without permission .
cologne - second from bottom - are still waiting for their second win of the season , but it 's unlikely to come this weekend .
hanover 1-0 nuremberg-wolfsburg wolfsburg are an unpredictable bunch this time round .
their results chart looks like a stock market in a volatile boom-bust economy : three straight defeats were followed by three straight victories , and then last week 's thriller against leverkusen saw them do it all in microcosm - they gave up a 2-0 lead to lose 3-2 in the space of 10 minutes .
but despite this , it 's clear that new manager steve mcclaren is beginning to get his killer trio of edin dzeko , diego and grafite into a groove .
but modest nuremberg are not an easy team to crack , at least for a bottom half side .
but despite last week 's madness , the momentum seems to be with wolfsburg , and there should be more space between the teams than a single place .
wolfsburg 2-1 sunday , october 24 dortmund-hoffenheim the sunday matches all feature germany 's europa league representatives , who played thursday evening , but dortmund did not have to travel , so weariness should not be a factor for the league leaders .
this is good news , because this match should be a cracker .
it 's first against fourth , and dortmund are currently rampaging through the league like they used to back in the day , i.e. the mid-90s .
it 's a heartening sight for those who can remember when bayern had a proper rival , and they are up against - in theory - one of the most exciting new forces in german football in hoffenheim .
while they were undone last year by a thin squad , coach ralf rangnick ’ s men are looking a more robust force this time round .
but despite good results , their recent draw against struggling cologne shows how fallible they are .
dortmund 2-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like the good old days - dortmund on the rampage leverkusen-mainz this one should also be a great game , with second-placed mainz away to third-placed leverkusen .
mainz 's run of seven straight wins came to an abrupt halt last week against hamburg , so it will be interesting to see if the unfancied club can get the ball rolling again .
everyone is expecting this bunch of cheeky young jack-rabbits to finally wake up and realize it was all a big misunderstanding , and they should be hacking through years of mid-table obscurity like honest , decent folk .
so will they dare to dream ?
leverkusen , meanwhile , are exactly the kind of grizzled , seen-it-all veterans who will know how to sap the will of these idealistic young upstarts .
it 's a bit like morgan freeman and brad pitt in seven .
hopefully with a bit less torture .
leverkusen 2-1 stuttgart-st.pauli it would take some kind of devastating natural disaster for stuttgart 's season to get much worse , but last week 's 2-2 draw against schalke - orchestrated by nubile new manager jens keller - was a definite improvement .
coupled with that , their very handy 1-0 win over getafe in the europa league on thursday will have further boosted confidence .
when you have four points from eight games , i guess the only way is up .
they are facing a st. pauli side who may be all of twelve places above them , but have not exactly been the model of consistency in the last few match days .
but all things being equal , st. pauli did just record a very impressive 3-2 win over nuremberg , and will expect to beat stuttgart , even if it does take sheer will .

match day nine represents the start of the second quarter of the bundesliga season , which means we 've entered what is officially termed the “ run-up to christmas ” - both in footballing and commercial terms . you may not know it , but we 're on the home straight towards christmas . this means two important things - kicking a ball and spending more money - will suddenly be jostling for attention in the brains of germany 's professional footballers . that may prove too heavy a mental burden , so on-field concentration could easily slip .

wolfsburg 2-1 sunday , october 24 dortmund-hoffenheim the sunday matches all feature germany 's europa league representatives , who played thursday evening , but dortmund did not have to travel , so weariness should not be a factor for the league leaders .
this is good news , because this match should be a cracker .
it 's first against fourth , and dortmund are currently rampaging through the league like they used to back in the day , i.e. the mid-90s .
it 's a heartening sight for those who can remember when bayern had a proper rival , and they are up against - in theory - one of the most exciting new forces in german football in hoffenheim .
while they were undone last year by a thin squad , coach ralf rangnick ’ s men are looking a more robust force this time round .
but despite good results , their recent draw against struggling cologne shows how fallible they are .
dortmund 2-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like the good old days - dortmund on the rampage leverkusen-mainz this one should also be a great game , with second-placed mainz away to third-placed leverkusen .
mainz 's run of seven straight wins came to an abrupt halt last week against hamburg , so it will be interesting to see if the unfancied club can get the ball rolling again .
everyone is expecting this bunch of cheeky young jack-rabbits to finally wake up and realize it was all a big misunderstanding , and they should be hacking through years of mid-table obscurity like honest , decent folk .
so will they dare to dream ?
leverkusen , meanwhile , are exactly the kind of grizzled , seen-it-all veterans who will know how to sap the will of these idealistic young upstarts .
it 's a bit like morgan freeman and brad pitt in seven .
hopefully with a bit less torture .
leverkusen 2-1 stuttgart-st.pauli it would take some kind of devastating natural disaster for stuttgart 's season to get much worse , but last week 's 2-2 draw against schalke - orchestrated by nubile new manager jens keller - was a definite improvement .
coupled with that , their very handy 1-0 win over getafe in the europa league on thursday will have further boosted confidence .
when you have four points from eight games , i guess the only way is up .
they are facing a st. pauli side who may be all of twelve places above them , but have not exactly been the model of consistency in the last few match days .
but all things being equal , st. pauli did just record a very impressive 3-2 win over nuremberg , and will expect to beat stuttgart , even if it does take sheer will .

deutsche welle 's jane paulick got her geek chic on and had a look . weird sights are nothing unusual within berlin 's nightlife , but the scene i witnessed at the fc magnet club in the mitte district last week was weird in a very novel kind of way . in a neighborhood that 's widely known as party central , well over a hundred people had gathered to listen to self-proclaimed nerds hold forth on subjects close to their heart .
the event was berlin 's third ever ' nerdnite , ' and the evening 's topics included laser technology , geometry in islamic art and buffy the vampire slayer . according to urban dictionary , a ' nerd ' is " an individual who does not conform to society 's belief that all people should follow trends and do what their peers do .
-lsb- they are -rsb- often highly intelligent but socially rejected because of their obsession with a given subject . " celebrating dorkdom it 's a description that many in berlin must identify with , because the club was packed to the rafters .
nerdy is obviously the new sexy , even if the subheading on nerdnite 's website is " be here and be square . " but as far as i could tell , the audience was made up neither of squares nor social rejects .
give or take a few pairs of heavy-framed spectacles , they were the same people usually sighted propping up bars and burning up dance floors at clubs with strict door policies .
so what on earth were they doing listening to barbara - known to her friends as ' laser babs ' - waxing lyrical on the awesomeness of laws of physics ? " i think people come to nerdnite for fun , beer and some edutainment as well , " said co-organizer jan renz .
" it 's a mixture of assembling interesting facts about random topics and realizing that other people have nerdy interests as well , from the professor to the laser engineer , from the beer-loving dude to the housewife next door . " are lectures the new concerts ? it 's not the only event of its kind in the capital these days .
a concept first dreamt up in japan , pecha kucha nights have recently become a regular fixture at the festsaal kreuzberg club , and involve someone talking along to 20 images , for 20 seconds each , about a subject of their choice . then there are the berlin bunny lectures , organized by supatopcheckerbunny at the nbi club in prenzlauer berg , which feature invited experts discussing topics as diverse as nutrition , monarchy , outer space and reality versus illusion .
meanwhile , hip venues including the edelweiss and the lido have started hosting science slams , which see boffins vye for audience favor with arcane theories and facts . laser babs , however , prefers the more relaxed vibe at nerdnite . " what i like is that there 's no competitive aspect to it , " she said .
" that 's why it 's so popular ... nerds can let off steam without any pressure - and get free beer into the bargain , and the audience can chill out over a drink and marvel at how obsessive people can get about obscure stuff .
and everyone gets to feel part of something that 's kind of zeitgeisty . " back of the class speaking for myself , it takes a bit more than this to get me out on a chilly thursday evening .
the nerds ' enthusiasm for their subjects is endearing , and the audience appears genuinely enthralled .
in this age of disposable , dumbed-down entertainment , it 's reassuring to think that people are still fascinated by difficult topics - especially in berlin , where there 's no shortage of cheap thrills . but i find my gaze drifting repeatedly towards the episode of " the forgotten " that 's showing on the tv above the bar with the sound turned off .
does n't christian slater look old , i muse .
i force myself to concentrate on the powerpoint lecture , but it 's no good .
my inner egghead has n't been awoken .
it 's definitely still slumbering , and after a few hours of nerdnite , so am i. author : jane paulick editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

unions have called for more strike action . the french senate has voted through president nicolas sarkozy 's unpopular reform of the country 's pension system , which would raise the minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 and the maximum age for a full pension from 65 to 67 .
the bill has already been passed by the national assembly , but still needs to be approved by a parliamentary committee , a process that is likely to be completed next wednesday .
" the day will come when former opponents will thank the president and the government ... for acting responsibly , " labor minister eric woerth said just before the upper house approved the bill by 177 votes to 153 .

the police moved in on the refinery near dawn after an emergency decree ordered the strikers back to work .
unions said three people were injured in the operation .
after a meeting with oil industry executives , prime minister francois fillon said it would take " several more days " for fuel supplies to return to normal .
the head of the body which represents the national petroleum industry said the industry was struggling to import fuel to make up for the lack of supply .
transport minister jean-louis borloo told reporters that about one in five gas stations had run out of fuel , down from more than a quarter on wednesday .
the government said it had no plans to start rationing fuel , but that it had ordered oil companies to pool their resources to ensure the country was supplied with gas , particularly for this weekend when national school vacations begin .

deutsche welle 's jane paulick got her geek chic on and had a look . weird sights are nothing unusual within berlin 's nightlife , but the scene i witnessed at the fc magnet club in the mitte district last week was weird in a very novel kind of way . in a neighborhood that 's widely known as party central , well over a hundred people had gathered to listen to self-proclaimed nerds hold forth on subjects close to their heart .
the event was berlin 's third ever ' nerdnite , ' and the evening 's topics included laser technology , geometry in islamic art and buffy the vampire slayer . according to urban dictionary , a ' nerd ' is " an individual who does not conform to society 's belief that all people should follow trends and do what their peers do .
-lsb- they are -rsb- often highly intelligent but socially rejected because of their obsession with a given subject . " celebrating dorkdom it 's a description that many in berlin must identify with , because the club was packed to the rafters .
nerdy is obviously the new sexy , even if the subheading on nerdnite 's website is " be here and be square . " but as far as i could tell , the audience was made up neither of squares nor social rejects .
give or take a few pairs of heavy-framed spectacles , they were the same people usually sighted propping up bars and burning up dance floors at clubs with strict door policies .
so what on earth were they doing listening to barbara - known to her friends as ' laser babs ' - waxing lyrical on the awesomeness of laws of physics ? " i think people come to nerdnite for fun , beer and some edutainment as well , " said co-organizer jan renz .
" it 's a mixture of assembling interesting facts about random topics and realizing that other people have nerdy interests as well , from the professor to the laser engineer , from the beer-loving dude to the housewife next door . " are lectures the new concerts ? it 's not the only event of its kind in the capital these days .
a concept first dreamt up in japan , pecha kucha nights have recently become a regular fixture at the festsaal kreuzberg club , and involve someone talking along to 20 images , for 20 seconds each , about a subject of their choice . then there are the berlin bunny lectures , organized by supatopcheckerbunny at the nbi club in prenzlauer berg , which feature invited experts discussing topics as diverse as nutrition , monarchy , outer space and reality versus illusion .
meanwhile , hip venues including the edelweiss and the lido have started hosting science slams , which see boffins vye for audience favor with arcane theories and facts . laser babs , however , prefers the more relaxed vibe at nerdnite . " what i like is that there 's no competitive aspect to it , " she said .
" that 's why it 's so popular ... nerds can let off steam without any pressure - and get free beer into the bargain , and the audience can chill out over a drink and marvel at how obsessive people can get about obscure stuff .
and everyone gets to feel part of something that 's kind of zeitgeisty . " back of the class speaking for myself , it takes a bit more than this to get me out on a chilly thursday evening .
the nerds ' enthusiasm for their subjects is endearing , and the audience appears genuinely enthralled .
in this age of disposable , dumbed-down entertainment , it 's reassuring to think that people are still fascinated by difficult topics - especially in berlin , where there 's no shortage of cheap thrills . but i find my gaze drifting repeatedly towards the episode of " the forgotten " that 's showing on the tv above the bar with the sound turned off .
does n't christian slater look old , i muse .
i force myself to concentrate on the powerpoint lecture , but it 's no good .
my inner egghead has n't been awoken .
it 's definitely still slumbering , and after a few hours of nerdnite , so am i. author : jane paulick editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 22.10.2010 as new powers emerge , political realism drives global agenda großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil , russia , india and china are pursuing their national interests as they gain in power the us and the eu campaigned for a common world order based on liberal values such as democracy and human rights .
but as the balance of power shifts toward developing countries , national interests are trumping values . during the 1990s , the advanced democracies of north america and western europe emerged as the powerbrokers of global politics .
russia shrank from the world stage as it slid into chaos after the collapse of the soviet union .
and the large developing countries - such as brazil , india and china - remained preoccupied with their own internal reforms .
as a consequence , the united states and the european union began to construct a world order based on liberal vales . they promoted a doctrine of free trade , democracy and human rights .
those nations that accepted - or at least did not challenge -these " international norms " were integrated into a growing network of economic globalization .
this network was governed by institutions such as the world trade organization , the international monetary fund and the world bank . meanwhile , leaders who actively undermined the liberal rules of the game - such as slobodan milosevic and saddam hussein - faced crippling sanctions and devastating airstrikes .
integration and confrontation became two sides of the same coin .
but in the new millennium a more diverse group of countries is sharing world power , which has made it difficult to form a consensus around a common global agenda .
as brazil , russia , india and china - often referred to as the brics - confidently pursue their own national interests , the liberal international order is buckling .
political paralysis in the west nearly a decade ago , developed and developing nations agreed in doha , qatar to a round of multilateral negotiations that would reduce poverty through trade liberalization .
the goal was to eliminate economic barriers that prevented poorer countries from sharing in the benefits of globalization .
although political leaders in the us and eu had traditionally championed free trade , they now found it politically difficult to turn the doha round into a final settlement .
the business community felt they were not getting enough , while labor unions believed an agreement would outsource more jobs to the developing world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the doha round failed , sparking criticism of the wto in the developing world meanwhile , the brics - which once opposed liberalization as an instrument of imperialism - now championed free trade .
the failure of state socialism and protectionism had pushed brazil , russia , india and china toward a model of export-led growth that depended on an open global economy .
" there 's an irony here , " jagdish bhagwati , an expert on international trade with the council on foreign relations and a professor at columbia university in new york , told deutsche welle .
" if you look at what leaders are doing - obama is probably the worst but sarkozy comes pretty close - the leadership itself seems to be hamstrung and paralyzed in an inability to celebrate the openness of markets . "
as the brics profited from openness , a growing number of voices in the us and eu began to view trade as a zero-sum game .
as a result , the doha round collapsed .
" it just means that we are not pushing forward , " bhagwati said .
" the real question during a time of recession is not moving backwards into additional protectionism . "
emerging powers take initiative in response to the doha round 's collapse and the onset of the economic crisis , the brics began to strengthen their relations among one another .
yet political differences between these countries have prevented them from forging a true alliance .
the democratic nations of india , brazil as well as south africa have established their own dialogue .
in turn , the autocratic regimes of russia and china have separately signed a series of agreements deepening what they call a " strategic partnership of cooperation . "
however , these nations do find common ground in their skepticism of the us and the eu 's international agenda .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and the eu have often spread their values in the developing world through force the us and the eu made human rights and democracy a central part of their foreign policies , jointly applying military force to spread these liberal norms in the balkans and afghanistan .
and the us unilaterally imposed these norms in iraq .
in contrast , the brics emphasize national sovereignty and non-intervention as a means to avoid unnecessary confrontation as they further their economic development . " there is a strong old north-south mindset in the world and that ties to a set of neutral countries in opposition to western imperialism , " thomas carothers , an expert on democracy and the rule of law with the carnegie endowment for international peace , told deutsche welle .
" as we move out of that mindset we could go in two directions , " carothers continued .
" they -lsb- brics -rsb- could begin to see the value of an international community based on norms ; or they could stick with the feeling of being pushed around by larger powers and have an emphasis on sovereignty . "
the return of realpolitik the us and the eu remain critically important in world politics , but their relative power is declining .
in response , they may be forced to make political compromises in order to coopt the new powers .
the global agenda rooted in democracy and human rights could give way to a more pragmatic approach .
finding common ground between emerging and established powers would mean focusing on economic interests instead of liberal norms .
" they -lsb- emerging powers -rsb- do n't choose their partners based on human rights or democracy , " daniel flemes , an expert on regional powers and the new world order with the german institute for global and area studies , told deutsche welle .
" their foreign policies are oriented toward their interests . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a club of great powers could emerge out of the g20 and it is difficult for the emerging powers to advance their interests within the current institutions - such as the imf and world bank - dominated by established powers , flemes said .
as a consequence , informal venues such as the g20 are becoming more important .
a club of great powers could emerge out of the g20 , and these great powers may then negotiate their interests among each other , he continued .
this development would indicate that realpolitik , the pragmatic emphasis on maintaining a stable balance of power , has trumped liberal norms in global politics .
but carothers believes that promoting these liberal norms is in fact rooted in pragmatism , since no country has become wealthy and industrialized without democratizing , and that powers like russia and china will ultimately have to go down that path toward democracy . " these international norms do reflect a more global approach to economy and society , " he said .

in contrast , the brics emphasize national sovereignty and non-intervention as a means to avoid unnecessary confrontation as they further their economic development . " there is a strong old north-south mindset in the world and that ties to a set of neutral countries in opposition to western imperialism , " thomas carothers , an expert on democracy and the rule of law with the carnegie endowment for international peace , told deutsche welle .
" as we move out of that mindset we could go in two directions , " carothers continued .
" they -lsb- brics -rsb- could begin to see the value of an international community based on norms ; or they could stick with the feeling of being pushed around by larger powers and have an emphasis on sovereignty . "
the return of realpolitik the us and the eu remain critically important in world politics , but their relative power is declining .
in response , they may be forced to make political compromises in order to coopt the new powers .
the global agenda rooted in democracy and human rights could give way to a more pragmatic approach .
finding common ground between emerging and established powers would mean focusing on economic interests instead of liberal norms .
" they -lsb- emerging powers -rsb- do n't choose their partners based on human rights or democracy , " daniel flemes , an expert on regional powers and the new world order with the german institute for global and area studies , told deutsche welle .
" their foreign policies are oriented toward their interests . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a club of great powers could emerge out of the g20 and it is difficult for the emerging powers to advance their interests within the current institutions - such as the imf and world bank - dominated by established powers , flemes said .
as a consequence , informal venues such as the g20 are becoming more important .
a club of great powers could emerge out of the g20 , and these great powers may then negotiate their interests among each other , he continued .
this development would indicate that realpolitik , the pragmatic emphasis on maintaining a stable balance of power , has trumped liberal norms in global politics .
but carothers believes that promoting these liberal norms is in fact rooted in pragmatism , since no country has become wealthy and industrialized without democratizing , and that powers like russia and china will ultimately have to go down that path toward democracy . " these international norms do reflect a more global approach to economy and society , " he said .
" we have to be more confident that over time we will ultimately find that our interests lie in a more normative international community . " author : spencer kimball editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but german winemakers hope a unique blend of sugar and acid will make this year 's vintage an exceptional flavor - even if there is less of it . german winemakers harvested about half of the amount of grapes they took out of vineyards last year making it one of the worst yields in decades , according to michael bluemling , a wine grower on the moselle river . " it 's always disappointing when you 're harvesting less fruit than expected , " he told deutsche welle . this october bluemling harvested just 5,000 liters per hectare , less than half of the maximum yield of 12,500 liters .
a cold snap in june stifled what winegrowers call the fruit set - the critical phase when the grapevine 's flowers are fertilized and start growing into grapes . a rainy august also dampened hopes for the 2010 vintage .
grapes - and germans - suffered through twice as much rain and a third less sunshine compared to an average august . the lack of sun kept the grapes from fully developing and all the moisture led the botrytis fungus , which gives the riesling grapes their sweet taste , to develop too quickly .

some 12,000 businesses in the state are relying on the harvest to produce wine . despite this year 's catastrophic harvest , bluemling said he remains optimistic about how the riesling growers will fare over the next year because of 2009 's bumper harvest . " the wineries still have some wine from the last years and so all the wineries in our region are going to survive the smaller vintage and we hope that the next vintage will be totally different , " bluemling said . but hans rainer schultz from the wine research center in giesenheim is n't so optimistic .

fluency in the language of the new country is an absolute must and should be a condition of entry .
even in my small country , down at the bottom of the world , we are headed in the direction of those at the top of the world ... better for people stay in their own country and fix the problems there than to travel the world and contribute to the downfall of every country they inhabit . - kay , new zealand the media keeps misinterpreting what chancellor merkel has said concerning multiculturalism .
she said that the " approach " taken in germany toward multiculturalism had failed , not multiculturalism itself .
to say multiculturalism has failed is a very unwise , untrue , and discouraging message to send out into the global community .
perhaps germany , as well as many other nations , needs to re-evaluate assimilation and acculturation and how diverse groups of people may achieve common national and international goals without losing personal identity and even celebrating it at times . - darrell , us it is my belief that if one chooses to take resources from a foreign society , then the one taking should give back more by enforcing the traditions and resources of the society which they joined .
after all , there is a reason for having left one 's own society and country .
therefore to moving oneself to another country , then insisting that the new location should serve the new inhabitants by changing , is counter productive .
germany is germany , and in present successful due to germany 's past , present and very bright future . - dan , us bravo president wulff .
immigrants should respect their adopted countries ' laws and customs and adapt to them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de global conflicts -pipe- 22.10.2010 us enters murky legal waters as drone use increases großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us drone attacks reached a record high in september as us president barack obama ramps up drone attacks in pakistani tribal regions , experts debate the limits international law places on drone use .
the answer lies as much on where the targets are located as who they are . even before us president barack obama took office , he said the united states would hunt down suspected terrorists and kill or capture them wherever they could be found . " there can be no safe haven for al-qaeda terrorists who killed thousands of americans and threaten our homeland today , " he said while on the campaign trail in march 2008 . pursuing that goal , the obama administration began using unmanned aerial vehicles to conduct strikes three days into his term and has ratcheted up the frequency of drone attacks compared to his predecessor george w. bush . us assurances the overall increase in drone strikes implies that obama 's lawyers feel they are on solid legal ground , according to kirsten ainley , a lecturer in the international relations department at the london school of economics . " harold koh -lsb- a top legal advisor at the us state department -rsb- has been very keen to justify the use of drones under international legal standards though he has n't specified precisely how they meet them , " ainley told deutsche welle .
" but he has said ' we take international law very seriously and all of us actions meet with the standards of international law . " ' us strikes in pakistan 's northwest tribal regions , which border afghanistan , have resulted in at least 150 deaths since september 3 according to the afp news agency .
while estimates on the number of civilians killed in the strikes vary widely , a brookings institution study from 2009 showed 10 civilian casualities for each militant killed . cia director leon panetta , however , said drones represent " the only game in town in terms of confronting or trying to disrupt the al-qaeda leadership . " bildunterschrift : drones are capable of flying for hours on end right to self-defense in addition to doing what it sees as necessary to destroy terror networks , the united states is working within the framework of international law when conducting drone strikes , according to jordan paust of the university of houston law center . while the united states is not in a legal sense " at war " with al-qaeda , which has not been given the status even of an insurgent , he says the us can defend itself against attacks from the group , including engaging enemies in the expanded de facto theater of war into parts of pakistan . " we have a right of self-defense against non-state actors ' armed attacks on our soldiers in afghanistan , our country , our embassies abroad , " paust told deutsche welle . " as a matter of self-defense , a state can target any non-state actor that is directly participating in ongoing armed attacks , " he said , adding that al-qaeda and the taliban have been engaged in a process of armed attacks against us soldiers and others in afghanistan for years . on and off the battlefield other legal experts , however , disagree , saying that the scale of hostilities aimed at al-qaeda terrorists do not fit the mould of self-defense as detailed in article 51 of the un charter and that targeting individuals away from battlefields is not protected under international law . bildunterschrift : drones are remotely controlled far away from the places their missiles are fired while allowing for the legal use of drones on established fields of battle , mary ellen o 'connell , a professor of international law and international dispute resolution at notre dame university in the united states , said international law can not justify the use of unmanned aerial vehicles capable of dropping bombs and firing powerful missiles outside of the battlefield . " in cities and towns and in rural areas where there is no armed conflict going on it 's not appropriate to use battlefield weapons and tactics , " she told deutsche welle , adding that just because people at some point took part in an armed conflict , they can not indefinitely be regarded as participants . inordinate response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drones themselves do not pose a threat to international law even if militants return to pakistan , a nation with which the us is not at war , after conducting attacks in afghanistan , it 's up to pakistan - not the us or nato troops in afghanistan - to root out militants using its territory as a safe haven , o 'connell said . " you can carry out countermeasures ; you can certainly beef up your strength and defenses on your side of the border , but you do n't get to send your own military on another sovereign state 's territory because of that kind of lawlessness , " she said , adding that similar cases had been heard on this issue both with us agents in nicaragua and the conflict between congo and uganda . there are times when the use of force under international law comes under scrutiny , such as the nato bombing campaign in kosovo in 1999 , which prompted discussion about the use of force and humanitarian intervention .
but ainley said drone use is not an issue where she sees international law needing an update as there is no legal requirement that a human be close to where weapons are fired . " what is challenging international law is how we define what the battlefield of a war is , " she said . author : sean sinico editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

unions have called for more strike action . the french senate has voted through president nicolas sarkozy 's unpopular reform of the country 's pension system , which would raise the minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 and the maximum age for a full pension from 65 to 67 .
the bill has already been passed by the national assembly , but still needs to be approved by a parliamentary committee , a process that is likely to be completed next wednesday .
" the day will come when former opponents will thank the president and the government ... for acting responsibly , " labor minister eric woerth said just before the upper house approved the bill by 177 votes to 153 .
ongoing strike action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nationwide strikes have left nearly a quarter of petrol stations dry earlier on friday , french authorities forced the end of a blockade of the grandpuits oil refinery near paris , as blockades and an 11-day strike at refineries left nearly a quarter of all gas stations dry .
the police moved in on the refinery near dawn after an emergency decree ordered the strikers back to work .
unions said three people were injured in the operation .
after a meeting with oil industry executives , prime minister francois fillon said it would take " several more days " for fuel supplies to return to normal .
the head of the body which represents the national petroleum industry said the industry was struggling to import fuel to make up for the lack of supply .
transport minister jean-louis borloo told reporters that about one in five gas stations had run out of fuel , down from more than a quarter on wednesday .
the government said it had no plans to start rationing fuel , but that it had ordered oil companies to pool their resources to ensure the country was supplied with gas , particularly for this weekend when national school vacations begin .
on thursday the country 's six main unions called for further nationwide marches to protest the reform and for a seventh and eighth day of protests for oct .

" by taking the french economy , businesses and daily life hostage , you will destroy jobs , " he said .
" we ca n't be the only country in the world where , when there 's a reform , a minority wants to block everyone else .
that 's not possible .
that 's not democracy . "
an opinion poll published by the bva institute and broadcast by canal plus television on friday found that most french voters support the strikes - 69 percent to 29 percent - but 52 percent oppose the blockage of refineries .
the french government insists that the reform is necessary to close a widening budget gap in national pension funds .
unions and political opponents say it unfairly penalizes workers for the mistakes of the global financial system .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de global conflicts -pipe- 22.10.2010 us enters murky legal waters as drone use increases großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us drone attacks reached a record high in september as us president barack obama ramps up drone attacks in pakistani tribal regions , experts debate the limits international law places on drone use .
the answer lies as much on where the targets are located as who they are . even before us president barack obama took office , he said the united states would hunt down suspected terrorists and kill or capture them wherever they could be found . " there can be no safe haven for al-qaeda terrorists who killed thousands of americans and threaten our homeland today , " he said while on the campaign trail in march 2008 . pursuing that goal , the obama administration began using unmanned aerial vehicles to conduct strikes three days into his term and has ratcheted up the frequency of drone attacks compared to his predecessor george w. bush . us assurances the overall increase in drone strikes implies that obama 's lawyers feel they are on solid legal ground , according to kirsten ainley , a lecturer in the international relations department at the london school of economics . " harold koh -lsb- a top legal advisor at the us state department -rsb- has been very keen to justify the use of drones under international legal standards though he has n't specified precisely how they meet them , " ainley told deutsche welle .
" but he has said ' we take international law very seriously and all of us actions meet with the standards of international law . " ' us strikes in pakistan 's northwest tribal regions , which border afghanistan , have resulted in at least 150 deaths since september 3 according to the afp news agency .
while estimates on the number of civilians killed in the strikes vary widely , a brookings institution study from 2009 showed 10 civilian casualities for each militant killed . cia director leon panetta , however , said drones represent " the only game in town in terms of confronting or trying to disrupt the al-qaeda leadership . " bildunterschrift : drones are capable of flying for hours on end right to self-defense in addition to doing what it sees as necessary to destroy terror networks , the united states is working within the framework of international law when conducting drone strikes , according to jordan paust of the university of houston law center . while the united states is not in a legal sense " at war " with al-qaeda , which has not been given the status even of an insurgent , he says the us can defend itself against attacks from the group , including engaging enemies in the expanded de facto theater of war into parts of pakistan . " we have a right of self-defense against non-state actors ' armed attacks on our soldiers in afghanistan , our country , our embassies abroad , " paust told deutsche welle . " as a matter of self-defense , a state can target any non-state actor that is directly participating in ongoing armed attacks , " he said , adding that al-qaeda and the taliban have been engaged in a process of armed attacks against us soldiers and others in afghanistan for years . on and off the battlefield other legal experts , however , disagree , saying that the scale of hostilities aimed at al-qaeda terrorists do not fit the mould of self-defense as detailed in article 51 of the un charter and that targeting individuals away from battlefields is not protected under international law . bildunterschrift : drones are remotely controlled far away from the places their missiles are fired while allowing for the legal use of drones on established fields of battle , mary ellen o 'connell , a professor of international law and international dispute resolution at notre dame university in the united states , said international law can not justify the use of unmanned aerial vehicles capable of dropping bombs and firing powerful missiles outside of the battlefield . " in cities and towns and in rural areas where there is no armed conflict going on it 's not appropriate to use battlefield weapons and tactics , " she told deutsche welle , adding that just because people at some point took part in an armed conflict , they can not indefinitely be regarded as participants . inordinate response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drones themselves do not pose a threat to international law even if militants return to pakistan , a nation with which the us is not at war , after conducting attacks in afghanistan , it 's up to pakistan - not the us or nato troops in afghanistan - to root out militants using its territory as a safe haven , o 'connell said . " you can carry out countermeasures ; you can certainly beef up your strength and defenses on your side of the border , but you do n't get to send your own military on another sovereign state 's territory because of that kind of lawlessness , " she said , adding that similar cases had been heard on this issue both with us agents in nicaragua and the conflict between congo and uganda . there are times when the use of force under international law comes under scrutiny , such as the nato bombing campaign in kosovo in 1999 , which prompted discussion about the use of force and humanitarian intervention .
but ainley said drone use is not an issue where she sees international law needing an update as there is no legal requirement that a human be close to where weapons are fired . " what is challenging international law is how we define what the battlefield of a war is , " she said . author : sean sinico editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

match day nine represents the start of the second quarter of the bundesliga season , which means we 've entered what is officially termed the “ run-up to christmas ” - both in footballing and commercial terms . you may not know it , but we 're on the home straight towards christmas . this means two important things - kicking a ball and spending more money - will suddenly be jostling for attention in the brains of germany 's professional footballers . that may prove too heavy a mental burden , so on-field concentration could easily slip .
but given the form of the dw predictors over the last two weeks -lrb- 10 points from a possible 54 -rrb- , one more random factor can probably only help .
friday , october 22 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friday 's north-south derby is a bundesliga classic hamburg-bayern as the team that stopped the juggernaut that was mainz last week with a 1-0 away win , hamburg might be confident they can take on a bigger team of reds in what is known as the north-south derby .
but they are facing a resurgent bayern munich , who are clearly growing in confidence after a dreadful start , and who will be galvanized by the return of their famous dusel -lrb- luck -rrb- in their win over cfr cluj in the champions league .
moreover , bayern coach louis van gaal has made this a do-or-die game for his team 's championship hopes .
“ we ca n't drop many more points .
we have to win in hamburg , ” he told reporters after the cluj game .
the dutchman is basically baiting fate , and call me a fool , but i think fate will bite - gomez to get a deflected winner in injury time .
bayern 2-1 saturday , october 23 frankfurt-schalke schalke will also have an extra spring in their stride this weekend after a successful excursion in the champions league .
they watched israeli champions hapoel fold against the onslaught by the royal blues ’ star signing raul .
the spanish veteran scored two - one more than he has scored all season in the bundesliga - and there are signs that felix magath 's carefully constructed and thoroughly oiled schalke machine is finally beginning to find its gears .
that said , frankfurt are on a run of three straight wins , and greek forward theofanis gekas is on fire just now - he became the joint top scorer in the league during last week 's 3-0 drubbing of kaiserslautern .
hard not to see both sides scoring .
draw 2-2 moenchengladbach-werder bremen unlike bayern and schalke , werder ’ s champions league match this week was not a rousing home win , but a tough 1-1 draw away to the dutch champions fc twente .
they have n't kept a clean sheet in the league since match day three , and they lost their first choice goalkeeper tim wiese to a knee injury in the aforementioned melee in the netherlands .
their second-choice goalkeeper is also out , so they are relying on 21-year-old sebastian mielitz between the sticks , a rookie with two bundesliga games and half of wednesday 's european match to his name .
it 's a godsend , then , that werder are facing the only team in the bundesliga with a worse defensive record .
moenchengladbach are shipping an average of nearly three goals a game at the moment , are toiling one point above the relegation zone , and are without eight first-team players for this match .
you 'd have to expect the likes of claudio pizarro , aaron hunt and hugo almeida to do some damage .
werder bremen 4-1 freiburg-kaiserslautern freiburg might have lost away to werder last week , but it was a defiant loss , and they were inches away from snatching a draw in the closing minutes at the weserstadion .
for no discernable reason , the modest team from the far south-western corner of the country is riding around in the top half of the table above the likes of bayern , werder and wolfsburg .
kaiserslautern , meanwhile , are coming to town on the back of four morale-sapping losses to frankfurt -lrb- 0-3 -rrb- , hamburg -lrb- 1-2 -rrb- , hanover -lrb- 0-1 -rrb- and the carnage of a trip to dortmund -lrb- 0-5 -rrb- .
but freiburg are blinking nervously in the heady heights , and kaiserslautern could well figure their luck must be about to turn soon .
plus the last time they played a southern team they tonked bayern 2-0 .
draw 1-1 hanover-cologne bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's keeper is in a huff ... but that 's just one worry among many a blistering start to the season for hanover -lrb- 13 points from six games -rrb- came to a thudding end two games ago when they ran into st. pauli .
that 1-0 loss , coupled with the international break that followed , apparently sapped their momentum .
the club then crashed headlong into bayern and mario gomez last week - who scored a brilliant hat-trick .
but if hanover were looking for a confidence boosting opponent , they could hardly have asked for anyone better than cologne , to whom the word “ crisis ” has been attached for weeks .
the pram belonging to resident star lukas podolski is rapidly running out of rattles , and handbags were drawn when colombian keeper faryd mondragon swanned off to the us to play for colombia without permission .
cologne - second from bottom - are still waiting for their second win of the season , but it 's unlikely to come this weekend .
hanover 1-0 nuremberg-wolfsburg wolfsburg are an unpredictable bunch this time round .
their results chart looks like a stock market in a volatile boom-bust economy : three straight defeats were followed by three straight victories , and then last week 's thriller against leverkusen saw them do it all in microcosm - they gave up a 2-0 lead to lose 3-2 in the space of 10 minutes .
but despite this , it 's clear that new manager steve mcclaren is beginning to get his killer trio of edin dzeko , diego and grafite into a groove .
but modest nuremberg are not an easy team to crack , at least for a bottom half side .
but despite last week 's madness , the momentum seems to be with wolfsburg , and there should be more space between the teams than a single place .
wolfsburg 2-1 sunday , october 24 dortmund-hoffenheim the sunday matches all feature germany 's europa league representatives , who played thursday evening , but dortmund did not have to travel , so weariness should not be a factor for the league leaders .
this is good news , because this match should be a cracker .
it 's first against fourth , and dortmund are currently rampaging through the league like they used to back in the day , i.e. the mid-90s .
it 's a heartening sight for those who can remember when bayern had a proper rival , and they are up against - in theory - one of the most exciting new forces in german football in hoffenheim .
while they were undone last year by a thin squad , coach ralf rangnick ’ s men are looking a more robust force this time round .
but despite good results , their recent draw against struggling cologne shows how fallible they are .
dortmund 2-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like the good old days - dortmund on the rampage leverkusen-mainz this one should also be a great game , with second-placed mainz away to third-placed leverkusen .
mainz 's run of seven straight wins came to an abrupt halt last week against hamburg , so it will be interesting to see if the unfancied club can get the ball rolling again .
everyone is expecting this bunch of cheeky young jack-rabbits to finally wake up and realize it was all a big misunderstanding , and they should be hacking through years of mid-table obscurity like honest , decent folk .
so will they dare to dream ?
leverkusen , meanwhile , are exactly the kind of grizzled , seen-it-all veterans who will know how to sap the will of these idealistic young upstarts .
it 's a bit like morgan freeman and brad pitt in seven .
hopefully with a bit less torture .
leverkusen 2-1 stuttgart-st.pauli it would take some kind of devastating natural disaster for stuttgart 's season to get much worse , but last week 's 2-2 draw against schalke - orchestrated by nubile new manager jens keller - was a definite improvement .
coupled with that , their very handy 1-0 win over getafe in the europa league on thursday will have further boosted confidence .
when you have four points from eight games , i guess the only way is up .
they are facing a st. pauli side who may be all of twelve places above them , but have not exactly been the model of consistency in the last few match days .
but all things being equal , st. pauli did just record a very impressive 3-2 win over nuremberg , and will expect to beat stuttgart , even if it does take sheer will .

hard not to see both sides scoring .
draw 2-2 moenchengladbach-werder bremen unlike bayern and schalke , werder ’ s champions league match this week was not a rousing home win , but a tough 1-1 draw away to the dutch champions fc twente .
they have n't kept a clean sheet in the league since match day three , and they lost their first choice goalkeeper tim wiese to a knee injury in the aforementioned melee in the netherlands .
their second-choice goalkeeper is also out , so they are relying on 21-year-old sebastian mielitz between the sticks , a rookie with two bundesliga games and half of wednesday 's european match to his name .
it 's a godsend , then , that werder are facing the only team in the bundesliga with a worse defensive record .
moenchengladbach are shipping an average of nearly three goals a game at the moment , are toiling one point above the relegation zone , and are without eight first-team players for this match .
you 'd have to expect the likes of claudio pizarro , aaron hunt and hugo almeida to do some damage .
werder bremen 4-1 freiburg-kaiserslautern freiburg might have lost away to werder last week , but it was a defiant loss , and they were inches away from snatching a draw in the closing minutes at the weserstadion .
for no discernable reason , the modest team from the far south-western corner of the country is riding around in the top half of the table above the likes of bayern , werder and wolfsburg .
kaiserslautern , meanwhile , are coming to town on the back of four morale-sapping losses to frankfurt -lrb- 0-3 -rrb- , hamburg -lrb- 1-2 -rrb- , hanover -lrb- 0-1 -rrb- and the carnage of a trip to dortmund -lrb- 0-5 -rrb- .
but freiburg are blinking nervously in the heady heights , and kaiserslautern could well figure their luck must be about to turn soon .
plus the last time they played a southern team they tonked bayern 2-0 .
draw 1-1 hanover-cologne bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's keeper is in a huff ... but that 's just one worry among many a blistering start to the season for hanover -lrb- 13 points from six games -rrb- came to a thudding end two games ago when they ran into st. pauli .
that 1-0 loss , coupled with the international break that followed , apparently sapped their momentum .
the club then crashed headlong into bayern and mario gomez last week - who scored a brilliant hat-trick .
but if hanover were looking for a confidence boosting opponent , they could hardly have asked for anyone better than cologne , to whom the word “ crisis ” has been attached for weeks .
the pram belonging to resident star lukas podolski is rapidly running out of rattles , and handbags were drawn when colombian keeper faryd mondragon swanned off to the us to play for colombia without permission .
cologne - second from bottom - are still waiting for their second win of the season , but it 's unlikely to come this weekend .
hanover 1-0 nuremberg-wolfsburg wolfsburg are an unpredictable bunch this time round .
their results chart looks like a stock market in a volatile boom-bust economy : three straight defeats were followed by three straight victories , and then last week 's thriller against leverkusen saw them do it all in microcosm - they gave up a 2-0 lead to lose 3-2 in the space of 10 minutes .
but despite this , it 's clear that new manager steve mcclaren is beginning to get his killer trio of edin dzeko , diego and grafite into a groove .
but modest nuremberg are not an easy team to crack , at least for a bottom half side .
but despite last week 's madness , the momentum seems to be with wolfsburg , and there should be more space between the teams than a single place .
wolfsburg 2-1 sunday , october 24 dortmund-hoffenheim the sunday matches all feature germany 's europa league representatives , who played thursday evening , but dortmund did not have to travel , so weariness should not be a factor for the league leaders .
this is good news , because this match should be a cracker .
it 's first against fourth , and dortmund are currently rampaging through the league like they used to back in the day , i.e. the mid-90s .
it 's a heartening sight for those who can remember when bayern had a proper rival , and they are up against - in theory - one of the most exciting new forces in german football in hoffenheim .
while they were undone last year by a thin squad , coach ralf rangnick ’ s men are looking a more robust force this time round .
but despite good results , their recent draw against struggling cologne shows how fallible they are .
dortmund 2-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like the good old days - dortmund on the rampage leverkusen-mainz this one should also be a great game , with second-placed mainz away to third-placed leverkusen .
mainz 's run of seven straight wins came to an abrupt halt last week against hamburg , so it will be interesting to see if the unfancied club can get the ball rolling again .
everyone is expecting this bunch of cheeky young jack-rabbits to finally wake up and realize it was all a big misunderstanding , and they should be hacking through years of mid-table obscurity like honest , decent folk .
so will they dare to dream ?
leverkusen , meanwhile , are exactly the kind of grizzled , seen-it-all veterans who will know how to sap the will of these idealistic young upstarts .
it 's a bit like morgan freeman and brad pitt in seven .
hopefully with a bit less torture .
leverkusen 2-1 stuttgart-st.pauli it would take some kind of devastating natural disaster for stuttgart 's season to get much worse , but last week 's 2-2 draw against schalke - orchestrated by nubile new manager jens keller - was a definite improvement .
coupled with that , their very handy 1-0 win over getafe in the europa league on thursday will have further boosted confidence .
when you have four points from eight games , i guess the only way is up .
they are facing a st. pauli side who may be all of twelve places above them , but have not exactly been the model of consistency in the last few match days .
but all things being equal , st. pauli did just record a very impressive 3-2 win over nuremberg , and will expect to beat stuttgart , even if it does take sheer will .

the answer lies as much on where the targets are located as who they are . even before us president barack obama took office , he said the united states would hunt down suspected terrorists and kill or capture them wherever they could be found . " there can be no safe haven for al-qaeda terrorists who killed thousands of americans and threaten our homeland today , " he said while on the campaign trail in march 2008 . pursuing that goal , the obama administration began using unmanned aerial vehicles to conduct strikes three days into his term and has ratcheted up the frequency of drone attacks compared to his predecessor george w. bush . us assurances the overall increase in drone strikes implies that obama 's lawyers feel they are on solid legal ground , according to kirsten ainley , a lecturer in the international relations department at the london school of economics . " harold koh -lsb- a top legal advisor at the us state department -rsb- has been very keen to justify the use of drones under international legal standards though he has n't specified precisely how they meet them , " ainley told deutsche welle .
" but he has said ' we take international law very seriously and all of us actions meet with the standards of international law . " ' us strikes in pakistan 's northwest tribal regions , which border afghanistan , have resulted in at least 150 deaths since september 3 according to the afp news agency .
while estimates on the number of civilians killed in the strikes vary widely , a brookings institution study from 2009 showed 10 civilian casualities for each militant killed . cia director leon panetta , however , said drones represent " the only game in town in terms of confronting or trying to disrupt the al-qaeda leadership . " bildunterschrift : drones are capable of flying for hours on end right to self-defense in addition to doing what it sees as necessary to destroy terror networks , the united states is working within the framework of international law when conducting drone strikes , according to jordan paust of the university of houston law center . while the united states is not in a legal sense " at war " with al-qaeda , which has not been given the status even of an insurgent , he says the us can defend itself against attacks from the group , including engaging enemies in the expanded de facto theater of war into parts of pakistan . " we have a right of self-defense against non-state actors ' armed attacks on our soldiers in afghanistan , our country , our embassies abroad , " paust told deutsche welle . " as a matter of self-defense , a state can target any non-state actor that is directly participating in ongoing armed attacks , " he said , adding that al-qaeda and the taliban have been engaged in a process of armed attacks against us soldiers and others in afghanistan for years . on and off the battlefield other legal experts , however , disagree , saying that the scale of hostilities aimed at al-qaeda terrorists do not fit the mould of self-defense as detailed in article 51 of the un charter and that targeting individuals away from battlefields is not protected under international law . bildunterschrift : drones are remotely controlled far away from the places their missiles are fired while allowing for the legal use of drones on established fields of battle , mary ellen o 'connell , a professor of international law and international dispute resolution at notre dame university in the united states , said international law can not justify the use of unmanned aerial vehicles capable of dropping bombs and firing powerful missiles outside of the battlefield . " in cities and towns and in rural areas where there is no armed conflict going on it 's not appropriate to use battlefield weapons and tactics , " she told deutsche welle , adding that just because people at some point took part in an armed conflict , they can not indefinitely be regarded as participants . inordinate response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drones themselves do not pose a threat to international law even if militants return to pakistan , a nation with which the us is not at war , after conducting attacks in afghanistan , it 's up to pakistan - not the us or nato troops in afghanistan - to root out militants using its territory as a safe haven , o 'connell said . " you can carry out countermeasures ; you can certainly beef up your strength and defenses on your side of the border , but you do n't get to send your own military on another sovereign state 's territory because of that kind of lawlessness , " she said , adding that similar cases had been heard on this issue both with us agents in nicaragua and the conflict between congo and uganda . there are times when the use of force under international law comes under scrutiny , such as the nato bombing campaign in kosovo in 1999 , which prompted discussion about the use of force and humanitarian intervention .

but german winemakers hope a unique blend of sugar and acid will make this year 's vintage an exceptional flavor - even if there is less of it . german winemakers harvested about half of the amount of grapes they took out of vineyards last year making it one of the worst yields in decades , according to michael bluemling , a wine grower on the moselle river . " it 's always disappointing when you 're harvesting less fruit than expected , " he told deutsche welle . this october bluemling harvested just 5,000 liters per hectare , less than half of the maximum yield of 12,500 liters .
a cold snap in june stifled what winegrowers call the fruit set - the critical phase when the grapevine 's flowers are fertilized and start growing into grapes . a rainy august also dampened hopes for the 2010 vintage .
grapes - and germans - suffered through twice as much rain and a third less sunshine compared to an average august . the lack of sun kept the grapes from fully developing and all the moisture led the botrytis fungus , which gives the riesling grapes their sweet taste , to develop too quickly .
this destroyed some of the crop , further reducing the harvest . problems for local economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael bluemling was disappointed by the low harvest the low yield could hit the local economy hard . " wine is everything for this area , " bluemling said .
" the romans cultivated wine 2,000 years ago and since then the wine growing is very important for this region . " the state rhineland-palatinate , where bluemling works , produces 90 percent of germany 's export wines and 70 percent of the nation 's total wine production .
some 12,000 businesses in the state are relying on the harvest to produce wine . despite this year 's catastrophic harvest , bluemling said he remains optimistic about how the riesling growers will fare over the next year because of 2009 's bumper harvest . " the wineries still have some wine from the last years and so all the wineries in our region are going to survive the smaller vintage and we hope that the next vintage will be totally different , " bluemling said . but hans rainer schultz from the wine research center in giesenheim is n't so optimistic . " the lower yield is going to be very painful for many wine growers , because some of them only harvested about 50 percent of what they normally harvest , " schultz said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grape fungus developed more quickly in the wet weather and reduced crop yields overall predictions for the german wine harvest show a 23 percent drop on the average yield .
schultz said german winegrowers were n't alone .
vineyards in austria and italy have seen their yields fall as well .
schultz said he think this lower yield will be reflected in wine prices . " within europe , the yield is going to be smaller , and i think on average the prices are going to increase , " he said . unusual taste regarding the taste of this year 's riesling wine , schutz is n't quite as glum .
he said despite a lot of fear about this year 's vintage , winemakers will be able to make a decent wine . " what was very unusual with riesling this year is that we had relatively high levels of sugar but at the same time relatively high levels of acid , " he said .
" i think that 's something that will make the 2010 vintage quite exciting , because this combination only happens very rarely . " while the 2010 vintage may turn out to be unusually good , he added that winemakers will have to wait and see if an increase in prices will be able to compensate winegrowers for their low yields . author : natalia dannenberg editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 22.10.2010 as new powers emerge , political realism drives global agenda großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil , russia , india and china are pursuing their national interests as they gain in power the us and the eu campaigned for a common world order based on liberal values such as democracy and human rights .
but as the balance of power shifts toward developing countries , national interests are trumping values . during the 1990s , the advanced democracies of north america and western europe emerged as the powerbrokers of global politics .
russia shrank from the world stage as it slid into chaos after the collapse of the soviet union .
and the large developing countries - such as brazil , india and china - remained preoccupied with their own internal reforms .
as a consequence , the united states and the european union began to construct a world order based on liberal vales . they promoted a doctrine of free trade , democracy and human rights .
those nations that accepted - or at least did not challenge -these " international norms " were integrated into a growing network of economic globalization .
this network was governed by institutions such as the world trade organization , the international monetary fund and the world bank . meanwhile , leaders who actively undermined the liberal rules of the game - such as slobodan milosevic and saddam hussein - faced crippling sanctions and devastating airstrikes .
integration and confrontation became two sides of the same coin .
but in the new millennium a more diverse group of countries is sharing world power , which has made it difficult to form a consensus around a common global agenda .
as brazil , russia , india and china - often referred to as the brics - confidently pursue their own national interests , the liberal international order is buckling .
political paralysis in the west nearly a decade ago , developed and developing nations agreed in doha , qatar to a round of multilateral negotiations that would reduce poverty through trade liberalization .
the goal was to eliminate economic barriers that prevented poorer countries from sharing in the benefits of globalization .
although political leaders in the us and eu had traditionally championed free trade , they now found it politically difficult to turn the doha round into a final settlement .
the business community felt they were not getting enough , while labor unions believed an agreement would outsource more jobs to the developing world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the doha round failed , sparking criticism of the wto in the developing world meanwhile , the brics - which once opposed liberalization as an instrument of imperialism - now championed free trade .
the failure of state socialism and protectionism had pushed brazil , russia , india and china toward a model of export-led growth that depended on an open global economy .
" there 's an irony here , " jagdish bhagwati , an expert on international trade with the council on foreign relations and a professor at columbia university in new york , told deutsche welle .
" if you look at what leaders are doing - obama is probably the worst but sarkozy comes pretty close - the leadership itself seems to be hamstrung and paralyzed in an inability to celebrate the openness of markets . "
as the brics profited from openness , a growing number of voices in the us and eu began to view trade as a zero-sum game .
as a result , the doha round collapsed .
" it just means that we are not pushing forward , " bhagwati said .
" the real question during a time of recession is not moving backwards into additional protectionism . "
emerging powers take initiative in response to the doha round 's collapse and the onset of the economic crisis , the brics began to strengthen their relations among one another .
yet political differences between these countries have prevented them from forging a true alliance .
the democratic nations of india , brazil as well as south africa have established their own dialogue .
in turn , the autocratic regimes of russia and china have separately signed a series of agreements deepening what they call a " strategic partnership of cooperation . "
however , these nations do find common ground in their skepticism of the us and the eu 's international agenda .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and the eu have often spread their values in the developing world through force the us and the eu made human rights and democracy a central part of their foreign policies , jointly applying military force to spread these liberal norms in the balkans and afghanistan .
and the us unilaterally imposed these norms in iraq .
in contrast , the brics emphasize national sovereignty and non-intervention as a means to avoid unnecessary confrontation as they further their economic development . " there is a strong old north-south mindset in the world and that ties to a set of neutral countries in opposition to western imperialism , " thomas carothers , an expert on democracy and the rule of law with the carnegie endowment for international peace , told deutsche welle .
" as we move out of that mindset we could go in two directions , " carothers continued .
" they -lsb- brics -rsb- could begin to see the value of an international community based on norms ; or they could stick with the feeling of being pushed around by larger powers and have an emphasis on sovereignty . "
the return of realpolitik the us and the eu remain critically important in world politics , but their relative power is declining .
in response , they may be forced to make political compromises in order to coopt the new powers .
the global agenda rooted in democracy and human rights could give way to a more pragmatic approach .
finding common ground between emerging and established powers would mean focusing on economic interests instead of liberal norms .
" they -lsb- emerging powers -rsb- do n't choose their partners based on human rights or democracy , " daniel flemes , an expert on regional powers and the new world order with the german institute for global and area studies , told deutsche welle .
" their foreign policies are oriented toward their interests . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a club of great powers could emerge out of the g20 and it is difficult for the emerging powers to advance their interests within the current institutions - such as the imf and world bank - dominated by established powers , flemes said .
as a consequence , informal venues such as the g20 are becoming more important .
a club of great powers could emerge out of the g20 , and these great powers may then negotiate their interests among each other , he continued .
this development would indicate that realpolitik , the pragmatic emphasis on maintaining a stable balance of power , has trumped liberal norms in global politics .
but carothers believes that promoting these liberal norms is in fact rooted in pragmatism , since no country has become wealthy and industrialized without democratizing , and that powers like russia and china will ultimately have to go down that path toward democracy . " these international norms do reflect a more global approach to economy and society , " he said .
" we have to be more confident that over time we will ultimately find that our interests lie in a more normative international community . " author : spencer kimball editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia shrank from the world stage as it slid into chaos after the collapse of the soviet union .
and the large developing countries - such as brazil , india and china - remained preoccupied with their own internal reforms .
as a consequence , the united states and the european union began to construct a world order based on liberal vales . they promoted a doctrine of free trade , democracy and human rights .
those nations that accepted - or at least did not challenge -these " international norms " were integrated into a growing network of economic globalization .
this network was governed by institutions such as the world trade organization , the international monetary fund and the world bank . meanwhile , leaders who actively undermined the liberal rules of the game - such as slobodan milosevic and saddam hussein - faced crippling sanctions and devastating airstrikes .
integration and confrontation became two sides of the same coin .
but in the new millennium a more diverse group of countries is sharing world power , which has made it difficult to form a consensus around a common global agenda .
as brazil , russia , india and china - often referred to as the brics - confidently pursue their own national interests , the liberal international order is buckling .
political paralysis in the west nearly a decade ago , developed and developing nations agreed in doha , qatar to a round of multilateral negotiations that would reduce poverty through trade liberalization .
the goal was to eliminate economic barriers that prevented poorer countries from sharing in the benefits of globalization .
although political leaders in the us and eu had traditionally championed free trade , they now found it politically difficult to turn the doha round into a final settlement .
the business community felt they were not getting enough , while labor unions believed an agreement would outsource more jobs to the developing world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the doha round failed , sparking criticism of the wto in the developing world meanwhile , the brics - which once opposed liberalization as an instrument of imperialism - now championed free trade .
the failure of state socialism and protectionism had pushed brazil , russia , india and china toward a model of export-led growth that depended on an open global economy .
" there 's an irony here , " jagdish bhagwati , an expert on international trade with the council on foreign relations and a professor at columbia university in new york , told deutsche welle .
" if you look at what leaders are doing - obama is probably the worst but sarkozy comes pretty close - the leadership itself seems to be hamstrung and paralyzed in an inability to celebrate the openness of markets . "
as the brics profited from openness , a growing number of voices in the us and eu began to view trade as a zero-sum game .
as a result , the doha round collapsed .
" it just means that we are not pushing forward , " bhagwati said .
" the real question during a time of recession is not moving backwards into additional protectionism . "
emerging powers take initiative in response to the doha round 's collapse and the onset of the economic crisis , the brics began to strengthen their relations among one another .
yet political differences between these countries have prevented them from forging a true alliance .
the democratic nations of india , brazil as well as south africa have established their own dialogue .
in turn , the autocratic regimes of russia and china have separately signed a series of agreements deepening what they call a " strategic partnership of cooperation . "
however , these nations do find common ground in their skepticism of the us and the eu 's international agenda .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and the eu have often spread their values in the developing world through force the us and the eu made human rights and democracy a central part of their foreign policies , jointly applying military force to spread these liberal norms in the balkans and afghanistan .
and the us unilaterally imposed these norms in iraq .
in contrast , the brics emphasize national sovereignty and non-intervention as a means to avoid unnecessary confrontation as they further their economic development . " there is a strong old north-south mindset in the world and that ties to a set of neutral countries in opposition to western imperialism , " thomas carothers , an expert on democracy and the rule of law with the carnegie endowment for international peace , told deutsche welle .
" as we move out of that mindset we could go in two directions , " carothers continued .
" they -lsb- brics -rsb- could begin to see the value of an international community based on norms ; or they could stick with the feeling of being pushed around by larger powers and have an emphasis on sovereignty . "
the return of realpolitik the us and the eu remain critically important in world politics , but their relative power is declining .
in response , they may be forced to make political compromises in order to coopt the new powers .
the global agenda rooted in democracy and human rights could give way to a more pragmatic approach .
finding common ground between emerging and established powers would mean focusing on economic interests instead of liberal norms .
" they -lsb- emerging powers -rsb- do n't choose their partners based on human rights or democracy , " daniel flemes , an expert on regional powers and the new world order with the german institute for global and area studies , told deutsche welle .
" their foreign policies are oriented toward their interests . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a club of great powers could emerge out of the g20 and it is difficult for the emerging powers to advance their interests within the current institutions - such as the imf and world bank - dominated by established powers , flemes said .
as a consequence , informal venues such as the g20 are becoming more important .
a club of great powers could emerge out of the g20 , and these great powers may then negotiate their interests among each other , he continued .
this development would indicate that realpolitik , the pragmatic emphasis on maintaining a stable balance of power , has trumped liberal norms in global politics .
but carothers believes that promoting these liberal norms is in fact rooted in pragmatism , since no country has become wealthy and industrialized without democratizing , and that powers like russia and china will ultimately have to go down that path toward democracy . " these international norms do reflect a more global approach to economy and society , " he said .
" we have to be more confident that over time we will ultimately find that our interests lie in a more normative international community . " author : spencer kimball editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 22.10.2010 german economic boom a role model for other countries großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economy has recovered based on its exports the german economy used to be criticized for being overregulated and unflexible .
but in the wake of the global crisis , it 's germany that 's emerging with ease , which countries like the us can learn from . unemployment figures in germany are down to 1992 levels , and german exports are on the rise as if the global economic crisis had never happened .
in comparison , the economy in the united states is doing a lot worse : unemployment stands high at 9.6 percent , and growth rates are far from the positive figures that are coming out of germany .
and yet , there 's no secret recipe behind the success of the german economy , says thomas zielke , deputy delegate of the german economy in washington – it all comes down to exports , he told deutsche welle .
" it 's that great flexibility of companies , and the will to expand .
people are simply used to focusing on exports , " zielke said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shapiro says germany has been well prepared for the crisis that 's not necessarily the case in the us , he says , where companies are used to relying much more on their own domestic market .
in the united states , exports only make up 13 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , but the figure in germany is more than three times higher .
and while most of germany 's exports are going to other eu countries , the biggest growth rates are in exports to the rest of the world .
investing in exports if the domestic market crumbles in a time of recession , companies have little choice other than to invest in exports , robert shapiro , economic advisor to the us government , told deutsche welle .
" that has always been germany 's strength , " he said .
" the country has been very well prepared for that . "
there are other factors behind germany 's success in handling the crisis that shapiro and his colleagues have taken a closer look at .

but in the wake of the global crisis , it 's germany that 's emerging with ease , which countries like the us can learn from . unemployment figures in germany are down to 1992 levels , and german exports are on the rise as if the global economic crisis had never happened .
in comparison , the economy in the united states is doing a lot worse : unemployment stands high at 9.6 percent , and growth rates are far from the positive figures that are coming out of germany .
and yet , there 's no secret recipe behind the success of the german economy , says thomas zielke , deputy delegate of the german economy in washington – it all comes down to exports , he told deutsche welle .
" it 's that great flexibility of companies , and the will to expand .
people are simply used to focusing on exports , " zielke said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shapiro says germany has been well prepared for the crisis that 's not necessarily the case in the us , he says , where companies are used to relying much more on their own domestic market .
in the united states , exports only make up 13 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , but the figure in germany is more than three times higher .
and while most of germany 's exports are going to other eu countries , the biggest growth rates are in exports to the rest of the world .
investing in exports if the domestic market crumbles in a time of recession , companies have little choice other than to invest in exports , robert shapiro , economic advisor to the us government , told deutsche welle .
" that has always been germany 's strength , " he said .
" the country has been very well prepared for that . "
there are other factors behind germany 's success in handling the crisis that shapiro and his colleagues have taken a closer look at .
one example is government action , such as subsidizing shortened working hours .
by covering part of the salaries of workers who are put on reduced hours , berlin has managed to avoid a situation where too many people had to be laid off during the recession .

the answer lies as much on where the targets are located as who they are . even before us president barack obama took office , he said the united states would hunt down suspected terrorists and kill or capture them wherever they could be found . " there can be no safe haven for al-qaeda terrorists who killed thousands of americans and threaten our homeland today , " he said while on the campaign trail in march 2008 . pursuing that goal , the obama administration began using unmanned aerial vehicles to conduct strikes three days into his term and has ratcheted up the frequency of drone attacks compared to his predecessor george w. bush . us assurances the overall increase in drone strikes implies that obama 's lawyers feel they are on solid legal ground , according to kirsten ainley , a lecturer in the international relations department at the london school of economics . " harold koh -lsb- a top legal advisor at the us state department -rsb- has been very keen to justify the use of drones under international legal standards though he has n't specified precisely how they meet them , " ainley told deutsche welle .
" but he has said ' we take international law very seriously and all of us actions meet with the standards of international law . " ' us strikes in pakistan 's northwest tribal regions , which border afghanistan , have resulted in at least 150 deaths since september 3 according to the afp news agency .
while estimates on the number of civilians killed in the strikes vary widely , a brookings institution study from 2009 showed 10 civilian casualities for each militant killed . cia director leon panetta , however , said drones represent " the only game in town in terms of confronting or trying to disrupt the al-qaeda leadership . " bildunterschrift : drones are capable of flying for hours on end right to self-defense in addition to doing what it sees as necessary to destroy terror networks , the united states is working within the framework of international law when conducting drone strikes , according to jordan paust of the university of houston law center . while the united states is not in a legal sense " at war " with al-qaeda , which has not been given the status even of an insurgent , he says the us can defend itself against attacks from the group , including engaging enemies in the expanded de facto theater of war into parts of pakistan . " we have a right of self-defense against non-state actors ' armed attacks on our soldiers in afghanistan , our country , our embassies abroad , " paust told deutsche welle . " as a matter of self-defense , a state can target any non-state actor that is directly participating in ongoing armed attacks , " he said , adding that al-qaeda and the taliban have been engaged in a process of armed attacks against us soldiers and others in afghanistan for years . on and off the battlefield other legal experts , however , disagree , saying that the scale of hostilities aimed at al-qaeda terrorists do not fit the mould of self-defense as detailed in article 51 of the un charter and that targeting individuals away from battlefields is not protected under international law . bildunterschrift : drones are remotely controlled far away from the places their missiles are fired while allowing for the legal use of drones on established fields of battle , mary ellen o 'connell , a professor of international law and international dispute resolution at notre dame university in the united states , said international law can not justify the use of unmanned aerial vehicles capable of dropping bombs and firing powerful missiles outside of the battlefield . " in cities and towns and in rural areas where there is no armed conflict going on it 's not appropriate to use battlefield weapons and tactics , " she told deutsche welle , adding that just because people at some point took part in an armed conflict , they can not indefinitely be regarded as participants . inordinate response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drones themselves do not pose a threat to international law even if militants return to pakistan , a nation with which the us is not at war , after conducting attacks in afghanistan , it 's up to pakistan - not the us or nato troops in afghanistan - to root out militants using its territory as a safe haven , o 'connell said . " you can carry out countermeasures ; you can certainly beef up your strength and defenses on your side of the border , but you do n't get to send your own military on another sovereign state 's territory because of that kind of lawlessness , " she said , adding that similar cases had been heard on this issue both with us agents in nicaragua and the conflict between congo and uganda . there are times when the use of force under international law comes under scrutiny , such as the nato bombing campaign in kosovo in 1999 , which prompted discussion about the use of force and humanitarian intervention .

the answer lies as much on where the targets are located as who they are . even before us president barack obama took office , he said the united states would hunt down suspected terrorists and kill or capture them wherever they could be found . " there can be no safe haven for al-qaeda terrorists who killed thousands of americans and threaten our homeland today , " he said while on the campaign trail in march 2008 . pursuing that goal , the obama administration began using unmanned aerial vehicles to conduct strikes three days into his term and has ratcheted up the frequency of drone attacks compared to his predecessor george w. bush . us assurances the overall increase in drone strikes implies that obama 's lawyers feel they are on solid legal ground , according to kirsten ainley , a lecturer in the international relations department at the london school of economics . " harold koh -lsb- a top legal advisor at the us state department -rsb- has been very keen to justify the use of drones under international legal standards though he has n't specified precisely how they meet them , " ainley told deutsche welle .
" but he has said ' we take international law very seriously and all of us actions meet with the standards of international law . " ' us strikes in pakistan 's northwest tribal regions , which border afghanistan , have resulted in at least 150 deaths since september 3 according to the afp news agency .
while estimates on the number of civilians killed in the strikes vary widely , a brookings institution study from 2009 showed 10 civilian casualities for each militant killed . cia director leon panetta , however , said drones represent " the only game in town in terms of confronting or trying to disrupt the al-qaeda leadership . " bildunterschrift : drones are capable of flying for hours on end right to self-defense in addition to doing what it sees as necessary to destroy terror networks , the united states is working within the framework of international law when conducting drone strikes , according to jordan paust of the university of houston law center . while the united states is not in a legal sense " at war " with al-qaeda , which has not been given the status even of an insurgent , he says the us can defend itself against attacks from the group , including engaging enemies in the expanded de facto theater of war into parts of pakistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de oil industry -pipe- 22.10.2010 six months on , gulf of mexico could see new drilling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the moratorium lifted , companies can apply for new drill permits the us government lifted a moratorium on deepwater drilling in the gulf of mexico earlier this month .
now , six months after april 's massive oil spill , one company is planning to seek permits for new projects in the area . the gulf of mexico is seeing renewed interest as a drilling destination : on thursday , us oil giant chevron said it intended to apply for permission in the coming days to develop fresh projects there .
a spokesman for the company said it plans to invest $ 7.5 billion in a pair of new fields in waters off the coast of louisiana .
the move would make chevron among the first to seek permits for new drilling projects in the gulf of mexico , half a year after the deepwater horizon oil rig exploded on april 20 .
chevron could be among the first oil companies to exploit the end of a drilling moratorium , introduced by the obama administration in may when it faced public pressure for reacting to slowly to the environmental crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an explosion occurred on the deepwater horizon oil rig on april 20 competing pressures the drilling freeze applied to both new and current projects but was lifted on october 13 – several weeks before it was set to expire – amid pressure from oil companies and state governments concerned about productivity and jobs .
according to a government report , up to 12,000 jobs were lost due to the moratorium , a bitter pill to swallow as the country struggles with persistent high unemployment in a year of midterm elections .
us environmental advocacy groups have condemned the end of the moratorium , saying the risks of drilling remain too high .
six months after the deepwater horizon oil rig exploded – setting off the worst environmental disaster in us history and leaving 11 people dead – more than 16,000 specialists and volunteers are still working to cleanup the spill 's environmental effects .
british energy giant bp spent months trying to stop oil from leaking into the gulf – launching multiple failed " kill " operations to plug the blown-out wellhead .
they only succeeded in early august , when engineers filled the well with heavy drilling mud and cement , after millions of liters of oil had already leaked into the gulf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oil spill was the worst environmental disaster in us history rules and regulations oil and gas drilling projects are now subject to stricter regulations .
us interior secretary ken salazar said in a telephone press conference that they are meant to ensure safe energy generation .
" we are building the gold standard for offshore oil and gas regulation , " he said . in future , corporations will be required to prove that their oil rigs are equipped with working cut-off valves .
in addition , they must conform to specific construction standards .
oil rig workers will also be subject to special safety trainings .
regulators – who came in for heavy criticism for their coziness with the industry they were supposed to monitor – have been reformed .
the former minerals management service has been changed to the bureau of ocean energy management , and the agency has been subject to new ethics guidelines since late august .

" hamburg had the big chances , " said bayern captain philipp lahm , " so there are times when you have to be satisfied with one point . "

the two teams are currently even at 15 points with leverkusen ahead on goals , but leverkusen could widen the gap again on sunday with a win against mainz .
the match was relatively even , although hamburg did have better chances to score .
that included a very near-miss by jonathan pitroipa , who only had bayern keeper joerg butt to beat but bounced his shot off the right post .

but german winemakers hope a unique blend of sugar and acid will make this year 's vintage an exceptional flavor - even if there is less of it . german winemakers harvested about half of the amount of grapes they took out of vineyards last year making it one of the worst yields in decades , according to michael bluemling , a wine grower on the moselle river . " it 's always disappointing when you 're harvesting less fruit than expected , " he told deutsche welle . this october bluemling harvested just 5,000 liters per hectare , less than half of the maximum yield of 12,500 liters .
a cold snap in june stifled what winegrowers call the fruit set - the critical phase when the grapevine 's flowers are fertilized and start growing into grapes . a rainy august also dampened hopes for the 2010 vintage .
grapes - and germans - suffered through twice as much rain and a third less sunshine compared to an average august . the lack of sun kept the grapes from fully developing and all the moisture led the botrytis fungus , which gives the riesling grapes their sweet taste , to develop too quickly .
this destroyed some of the crop , further reducing the harvest . problems for local economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael bluemling was disappointed by the low harvest the low yield could hit the local economy hard . " wine is everything for this area , " bluemling said .
" the romans cultivated wine 2,000 years ago and since then the wine growing is very important for this region . " the state rhineland-palatinate , where bluemling works , produces 90 percent of germany 's export wines and 70 percent of the nation 's total wine production .
some 12,000 businesses in the state are relying on the harvest to produce wine . despite this year 's catastrophic harvest , bluemling said he remains optimistic about how the riesling growers will fare over the next year because of 2009 's bumper harvest . " the wineries still have some wine from the last years and so all the wineries in our region are going to survive the smaller vintage and we hope that the next vintage will be totally different , " bluemling said . but hans rainer schultz from the wine research center in giesenheim is n't so optimistic . " the lower yield is going to be very painful for many wine growers , because some of them only harvested about 50 percent of what they normally harvest , " schultz said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grape fungus developed more quickly in the wet weather and reduced crop yields overall predictions for the german wine harvest show a 23 percent drop on the average yield .
schultz said german winegrowers were n't alone .
vineyards in austria and italy have seen their yields fall as well .
schultz said he think this lower yield will be reflected in wine prices . " within europe , the yield is going to be smaller , and i think on average the prices are going to increase , " he said . unusual taste regarding the taste of this year 's riesling wine , schutz is n't quite as glum .
he said despite a lot of fear about this year 's vintage , winemakers will be able to make a decent wine . " what was very unusual with riesling this year is that we had relatively high levels of sugar but at the same time relatively high levels of acid , " he said .
" i think that 's something that will make the 2010 vintage quite exciting , because this combination only happens very rarely . " while the 2010 vintage may turn out to be unusually good , he added that winemakers will have to wait and see if an increase in prices will be able to compensate winegrowers for their low yields . author : natalia dannenberg editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he advocated in a speech on thursday tougher eurozone regulations , including sanctions to punish high deficits . the european union will be put to the test unless it tightens the measures in its stability and growth pact , according to german foreign minister guido westerwelle .
westerwelle said in a keynote speech to the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- in berlin on thursday that he was worried about europe , " because we will lose the people 's support if we simply proceed with our agenda after this crisis . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy agreed to fight against automatically imposed sanctions in renewed criticism of an agreement between chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy to drop demands for automatic sanctions on countries that breach the eurozone 's deficit ceiling , westerwelle urged political cooperation across europe to toughen the growth and stability pact .
" it is crucial that sanctions are not subjected to political opportunism , " westerwelle said .
merkel 's decision seemed to take westerwelle and other members of the governing coalition by surprise , but she insisted on thursday that she and westerwelle were on the same page regarding the proposal .
" we are completely in agreement , " merkel said , " that we should get a clear mandate for devising treaty changes by early next year , so these can be implemented by individual states by 2013 . " previously , merkel had supported the idea of more automatic sanctions that would take politics out of the equation , and her change of tune is seen by some as caving in to pressure from france . ' more sanctions , please ' westerwelle also warned against isolationist politics within the eu 's 27 member nations , saying that another financial crisis could ruin the fruits of decades of european politics .
" that 's why it 's so important that we act consistently and decisively in the interest of europe 's inner cohesion , " he said .
" a hard euro ca n't tolerate soft rules . "
westerwelle referred to the 22 proceedings brought against eu member states for acute deficits in the past few years .
he said sanctions had not been applied in a single one of these cases .
the foreign minister called for a mechanism to place sanctions on countries with bulging deficits , including bigger eu states .
the eurozone , westerwelle said , needed such a system to be consistent and ensure impartiality .
" it makes a big practical difference if sanctions are passed by a two-thirds majority , or blocked by a two-thirds majority , " he said .
westerwelle also countered those who might express discouragement with the european common currency , stressing that re-nationalization was not an option in the wake of the greek debt crisis .

" that 's why it 's so important that we act consistently and decisively in the interest of europe 's inner cohesion , " he said .
" a hard euro ca n't tolerate soft rules . "
westerwelle referred to the 22 proceedings brought against eu member states for acute deficits in the past few years .
he said sanctions had not been applied in a single one of these cases .
the foreign minister called for a mechanism to place sanctions on countries with bulging deficits , including bigger eu states .
the eurozone , westerwelle said , needed such a system to be consistent and ensure impartiality .
" it makes a big practical difference if sanctions are passed by a two-thirds majority , or blocked by a two-thirds majority , " he said .
westerwelle also countered those who might express discouragement with the european common currency , stressing that re-nationalization was not an option in the wake of the greek debt crisis .

match day nine represents the start of the second quarter of the bundesliga season , which means we 've entered what is officially termed the “ run-up to christmas ” - both in footballing and commercial terms . you may not know it , but we 're on the home straight towards christmas . this means two important things - kicking a ball and spending more money - will suddenly be jostling for attention in the brains of germany 's professional footballers . that may prove too heavy a mental burden , so on-field concentration could easily slip .
but given the form of the dw predictors over the last two weeks -lrb- 10 points from a possible 54 -rrb- , one more random factor can probably only help .
friday , october 22 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friday 's north-south derby is a bundesliga classic hamburg-bayern as the team that stopped the juggernaut that was mainz last week with a 1-0 away win , hamburg might be confident they can take on a bigger team of reds in what is known as the north-south derby .
but they are facing a resurgent bayern munich , who are clearly growing in confidence after a dreadful start , and who will be galvanized by the return of their famous dusel -lrb- luck -rrb- in their win over cfr cluj in the champions league .
moreover , bayern coach louis van gaal has made this a do-or-die game for his team 's championship hopes .
“ we ca n't drop many more points .
we have to win in hamburg , ” he told reporters after the cluj game .
the dutchman is basically baiting fate , and call me a fool , but i think fate will bite - gomez to get a deflected winner in injury time .
bayern 2-1 saturday , october 23 frankfurt-schalke schalke will also have an extra spring in their stride this weekend after a successful excursion in the champions league .
they watched israeli champions hapoel fold against the onslaught by the royal blues ’ star signing raul .
the spanish veteran scored two - one more than he has scored all season in the bundesliga - and there are signs that felix magath 's carefully constructed and thoroughly oiled schalke machine is finally beginning to find its gears .
that said , frankfurt are on a run of three straight wins , and greek forward theofanis gekas is on fire just now - he became the joint top scorer in the league during last week 's 3-0 drubbing of kaiserslautern .
hard not to see both sides scoring .
draw 2-2 moenchengladbach-werder bremen unlike bayern and schalke , werder ’ s champions league match this week was not a rousing home win , but a tough 1-1 draw away to the dutch champions fc twente .
they have n't kept a clean sheet in the league since match day three , and they lost their first choice goalkeeper tim wiese to a knee injury in the aforementioned melee in the netherlands .
their second-choice goalkeeper is also out , so they are relying on 21-year-old sebastian mielitz between the sticks , a rookie with two bundesliga games and half of wednesday 's european match to his name .
it 's a godsend , then , that werder are facing the only team in the bundesliga with a worse defensive record .
moenchengladbach are shipping an average of nearly three goals a game at the moment , are toiling one point above the relegation zone , and are without eight first-team players for this match .
you 'd have to expect the likes of claudio pizarro , aaron hunt and hugo almeida to do some damage .
werder bremen 4-1 freiburg-kaiserslautern freiburg might have lost away to werder last week , but it was a defiant loss , and they were inches away from snatching a draw in the closing minutes at the weserstadion .
for no discernable reason , the modest team from the far south-western corner of the country is riding around in the top half of the table above the likes of bayern , werder and wolfsburg .
kaiserslautern , meanwhile , are coming to town on the back of four morale-sapping losses to frankfurt -lrb- 0-3 -rrb- , hamburg -lrb- 1-2 -rrb- , hanover -lrb- 0-1 -rrb- and the carnage of a trip to dortmund -lrb- 0-5 -rrb- .
but freiburg are blinking nervously in the heady heights , and kaiserslautern could well figure their luck must be about to turn soon .
plus the last time they played a southern team they tonked bayern 2-0 .
draw 1-1 hanover-cologne bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's keeper is in a huff ... but that 's just one worry among many a blistering start to the season for hanover -lrb- 13 points from six games -rrb- came to a thudding end two games ago when they ran into st. pauli .
that 1-0 loss , coupled with the international break that followed , apparently sapped their momentum .
the club then crashed headlong into bayern and mario gomez last week - who scored a brilliant hat-trick .
but if hanover were looking for a confidence boosting opponent , they could hardly have asked for anyone better than cologne , to whom the word “ crisis ” has been attached for weeks .
the pram belonging to resident star lukas podolski is rapidly running out of rattles , and handbags were drawn when colombian keeper faryd mondragon swanned off to the us to play for colombia without permission .
cologne - second from bottom - are still waiting for their second win of the season , but it 's unlikely to come this weekend .
hanover 1-0 nuremberg-wolfsburg wolfsburg are an unpredictable bunch this time round .
their results chart looks like a stock market in a volatile boom-bust economy : three straight defeats were followed by three straight victories , and then last week 's thriller against leverkusen saw them do it all in microcosm - they gave up a 2-0 lead to lose 3-2 in the space of 10 minutes .
but despite this , it 's clear that new manager steve mcclaren is beginning to get his killer trio of edin dzeko , diego and grafite into a groove .
but modest nuremberg are not an easy team to crack , at least for a bottom half side .
but despite last week 's madness , the momentum seems to be with wolfsburg , and there should be more space between the teams than a single place .
wolfsburg 2-1 sunday , october 24 dortmund-hoffenheim the sunday matches all feature germany 's europa league representatives , who played thursday evening , but dortmund did not have to travel , so weariness should not be a factor for the league leaders .
this is good news , because this match should be a cracker .
it 's first against fourth , and dortmund are currently rampaging through the league like they used to back in the day , i.e. the mid-90s .
it 's a heartening sight for those who can remember when bayern had a proper rival , and they are up against - in theory - one of the most exciting new forces in german football in hoffenheim .
while they were undone last year by a thin squad , coach ralf rangnick ’ s men are looking a more robust force this time round .
but despite good results , their recent draw against struggling cologne shows how fallible they are .
dortmund 2-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like the good old days - dortmund on the rampage leverkusen-mainz this one should also be a great game , with second-placed mainz away to third-placed leverkusen .
mainz 's run of seven straight wins came to an abrupt halt last week against hamburg , so it will be interesting to see if the unfancied club can get the ball rolling again .
everyone is expecting this bunch of cheeky young jack-rabbits to finally wake up and realize it was all a big misunderstanding , and they should be hacking through years of mid-table obscurity like honest , decent folk .
so will they dare to dream ?
leverkusen , meanwhile , are exactly the kind of grizzled , seen-it-all veterans who will know how to sap the will of these idealistic young upstarts .
it 's a bit like morgan freeman and brad pitt in seven .
hopefully with a bit less torture .
leverkusen 2-1 stuttgart-st.pauli it would take some kind of devastating natural disaster for stuttgart 's season to get much worse , but last week 's 2-2 draw against schalke - orchestrated by nubile new manager jens keller - was a definite improvement .
coupled with that , their very handy 1-0 win over getafe in the europa league on thursday will have further boosted confidence .
when you have four points from eight games , i guess the only way is up .
they are facing a st. pauli side who may be all of twelve places above them , but have not exactly been the model of consistency in the last few match days .
but all things being equal , st. pauli did just record a very impressive 3-2 win over nuremberg , and will expect to beat stuttgart , even if it does take sheer will .

but given the form of the dw predictors over the last two weeks -lrb- 10 points from a possible 54 -rrb- , one more random factor can probably only help .
friday , october 22 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friday 's north-south derby is a bundesliga classic hamburg-bayern as the team that stopped the juggernaut that was mainz last week with a 1-0 away win , hamburg might be confident they can take on a bigger team of reds in what is known as the north-south derby .
but they are facing a resurgent bayern munich , who are clearly growing in confidence after a dreadful start , and who will be galvanized by the return of their famous dusel -lrb- luck -rrb- in their win over cfr cluj in the champions league .
moreover , bayern coach louis van gaal has made this a do-or-die game for his team 's championship hopes .
“ we ca n't drop many more points .
we have to win in hamburg , ” he told reporters after the cluj game .
the dutchman is basically baiting fate , and call me a fool , but i think fate will bite - gomez to get a deflected winner in injury time .
bayern 2-1 saturday , october 23 frankfurt-schalke schalke will also have an extra spring in their stride this weekend after a successful excursion in the champions league .
they watched israeli champions hapoel fold against the onslaught by the royal blues ’ star signing raul .
the spanish veteran scored two - one more than he has scored all season in the bundesliga - and there are signs that felix magath 's carefully constructed and thoroughly oiled schalke machine is finally beginning to find its gears .
that said , frankfurt are on a run of three straight wins , and greek forward theofanis gekas is on fire just now - he became the joint top scorer in the league during last week 's 3-0 drubbing of kaiserslautern .
hard not to see both sides scoring .
draw 2-2 moenchengladbach-werder bremen unlike bayern and schalke , werder ’ s champions league match this week was not a rousing home win , but a tough 1-1 draw away to the dutch champions fc twente .
they have n't kept a clean sheet in the league since match day three , and they lost their first choice goalkeeper tim wiese to a knee injury in the aforementioned melee in the netherlands .
their second-choice goalkeeper is also out , so they are relying on 21-year-old sebastian mielitz between the sticks , a rookie with two bundesliga games and half of wednesday 's european match to his name .
it 's a godsend , then , that werder are facing the only team in the bundesliga with a worse defensive record .
moenchengladbach are shipping an average of nearly three goals a game at the moment , are toiling one point above the relegation zone , and are without eight first-team players for this match .
you 'd have to expect the likes of claudio pizarro , aaron hunt and hugo almeida to do some damage .
werder bremen 4-1 freiburg-kaiserslautern freiburg might have lost away to werder last week , but it was a defiant loss , and they were inches away from snatching a draw in the closing minutes at the weserstadion .
for no discernable reason , the modest team from the far south-western corner of the country is riding around in the top half of the table above the likes of bayern , werder and wolfsburg .
kaiserslautern , meanwhile , are coming to town on the back of four morale-sapping losses to frankfurt -lrb- 0-3 -rrb- , hamburg -lrb- 1-2 -rrb- , hanover -lrb- 0-1 -rrb- and the carnage of a trip to dortmund -lrb- 0-5 -rrb- .
but freiburg are blinking nervously in the heady heights , and kaiserslautern could well figure their luck must be about to turn soon .
plus the last time they played a southern team they tonked bayern 2-0 .
draw 1-1 hanover-cologne bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's keeper is in a huff ... but that 's just one worry among many a blistering start to the season for hanover -lrb- 13 points from six games -rrb- came to a thudding end two games ago when they ran into st. pauli .
that 1-0 loss , coupled with the international break that followed , apparently sapped their momentum .
the club then crashed headlong into bayern and mario gomez last week - who scored a brilliant hat-trick .
but if hanover were looking for a confidence boosting opponent , they could hardly have asked for anyone better than cologne , to whom the word “ crisis ” has been attached for weeks .
the pram belonging to resident star lukas podolski is rapidly running out of rattles , and handbags were drawn when colombian keeper faryd mondragon swanned off to the us to play for colombia without permission .
cologne - second from bottom - are still waiting for their second win of the season , but it 's unlikely to come this weekend .
hanover 1-0 nuremberg-wolfsburg wolfsburg are an unpredictable bunch this time round .
their results chart looks like a stock market in a volatile boom-bust economy : three straight defeats were followed by three straight victories , and then last week 's thriller against leverkusen saw them do it all in microcosm - they gave up a 2-0 lead to lose 3-2 in the space of 10 minutes .
but despite this , it 's clear that new manager steve mcclaren is beginning to get his killer trio of edin dzeko , diego and grafite into a groove .
but modest nuremberg are not an easy team to crack , at least for a bottom half side .
but despite last week 's madness , the momentum seems to be with wolfsburg , and there should be more space between the teams than a single place .
wolfsburg 2-1 sunday , october 24 dortmund-hoffenheim the sunday matches all feature germany 's europa league representatives , who played thursday evening , but dortmund did not have to travel , so weariness should not be a factor for the league leaders .
this is good news , because this match should be a cracker .
it 's first against fourth , and dortmund are currently rampaging through the league like they used to back in the day , i.e. the mid-90s .
it 's a heartening sight for those who can remember when bayern had a proper rival , and they are up against - in theory - one of the most exciting new forces in german football in hoffenheim .
while they were undone last year by a thin squad , coach ralf rangnick ’ s men are looking a more robust force this time round .
but despite good results , their recent draw against struggling cologne shows how fallible they are .
dortmund 2-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like the good old days - dortmund on the rampage leverkusen-mainz this one should also be a great game , with second-placed mainz away to third-placed leverkusen .
mainz 's run of seven straight wins came to an abrupt halt last week against hamburg , so it will be interesting to see if the unfancied club can get the ball rolling again .
everyone is expecting this bunch of cheeky young jack-rabbits to finally wake up and realize it was all a big misunderstanding , and they should be hacking through years of mid-table obscurity like honest , decent folk .
so will they dare to dream ?
leverkusen , meanwhile , are exactly the kind of grizzled , seen-it-all veterans who will know how to sap the will of these idealistic young upstarts .
it 's a bit like morgan freeman and brad pitt in seven .
hopefully with a bit less torture .
leverkusen 2-1 stuttgart-st.pauli it would take some kind of devastating natural disaster for stuttgart 's season to get much worse , but last week 's 2-2 draw against schalke - orchestrated by nubile new manager jens keller - was a definite improvement .
coupled with that , their very handy 1-0 win over getafe in the europa league on thursday will have further boosted confidence .
when you have four points from eight games , i guess the only way is up .
they are facing a st. pauli side who may be all of twelve places above them , but have not exactly been the model of consistency in the last few match days .
but all things being equal , st. pauli did just record a very impressive 3-2 win over nuremberg , and will expect to beat stuttgart , even if it does take sheer will .

unions have called for more strike action . the french senate has voted through president nicolas sarkozy 's unpopular reform of the country 's pension system , which would raise the minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 and the maximum age for a full pension from 65 to 67 .
the bill has already been passed by the national assembly , but still needs to be approved by a parliamentary committee , a process that is likely to be completed next wednesday .
" the day will come when former opponents will thank the president and the government ... for acting responsibly , " labor minister eric woerth said just before the upper house approved the bill by 177 votes to 153 .
ongoing strike action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nationwide strikes have left nearly a quarter of petrol stations dry earlier on friday , french authorities forced the end of a blockade of the grandpuits oil refinery near paris , as blockades and an 11-day strike at refineries left nearly a quarter of all gas stations dry .
the police moved in on the refinery near dawn after an emergency decree ordered the strikers back to work .
unions said three people were injured in the operation .
after a meeting with oil industry executives , prime minister francois fillon said it would take " several more days " for fuel supplies to return to normal .
the head of the body which represents the national petroleum industry said the industry was struggling to import fuel to make up for the lack of supply .
transport minister jean-louis borloo told reporters that about one in five gas stations had run out of fuel , down from more than a quarter on wednesday .
the government said it had no plans to start rationing fuel , but that it had ordered oil companies to pool their resources to ensure the country was supplied with gas , particularly for this weekend when national school vacations begin .
on thursday the country 's six main unions called for further nationwide marches to protest the reform and for a seventh and eighth day of protests for oct .
28 and nov .
6 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youths clashed with police at a protest in lyon sarkozy 's popularity at all-time low sarkozy , meanwhile , has accused trade union leaders of undermining france 's fragile economic recovery and vowed to take tough action against protestors who turn violent .
" by taking the french economy , businesses and daily life hostage , you will destroy jobs , " he said .
" we ca n't be the only country in the world where , when there 's a reform , a minority wants to block everyone else .
that 's not possible .
that 's not democracy . "
an opinion poll published by the bva institute and broadcast by canal plus television on friday found that most french voters support the strikes - 69 percent to 29 percent - but 52 percent oppose the blockage of refineries .
the french government insists that the reform is necessary to close a widening budget gap in national pension funds .
unions and political opponents say it unfairly penalizes workers for the mistakes of the global financial system .

unions have called for more strike action . the french senate has voted through president nicolas sarkozy 's unpopular reform of the country 's pension system , which would raise the minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 and the maximum age for a full pension from 65 to 67 .
the bill has already been passed by the national assembly , but still needs to be approved by a parliamentary committee , a process that is likely to be completed next wednesday .
" the day will come when former opponents will thank the president and the government ... for acting responsibly , " labor minister eric woerth said just before the upper house approved the bill by 177 votes to 153 .
ongoing strike action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nationwide strikes have left nearly a quarter of petrol stations dry earlier on friday , french authorities forced the end of a blockade of the grandpuits oil refinery near paris , as blockades and an 11-day strike at refineries left nearly a quarter of all gas stations dry .
the police moved in on the refinery near dawn after an emergency decree ordered the strikers back to work .
unions said three people were injured in the operation .
after a meeting with oil industry executives , prime minister francois fillon said it would take " several more days " for fuel supplies to return to normal .
the head of the body which represents the national petroleum industry said the industry was struggling to import fuel to make up for the lack of supply .
transport minister jean-louis borloo told reporters that about one in five gas stations had run out of fuel , down from more than a quarter on wednesday .
the government said it had no plans to start rationing fuel , but that it had ordered oil companies to pool their resources to ensure the country was supplied with gas , particularly for this weekend when national school vacations begin .
on thursday the country 's six main unions called for further nationwide marches to protest the reform and for a seventh and eighth day of protests for oct .

" we ca n't be the only country in the world where , when there 's a reform , a minority wants to block everyone else .

an opinion poll published by the bva institute and broadcast by canal plus television on friday found that most french voters support the strikes - 69 percent to 29 percent - but 52 percent oppose the blockage of refineries .
the french government insists that the reform is necessary to close a widening budget gap in national pension funds .
unions and political opponents say it unfairly penalizes workers for the mistakes of the global financial system .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 22.10.2010 european online risk study shows many parents clueless , kids blasé großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children are online at an increasingly young age more than one in eight european children has been upset by online content , a new eu study on internet risks shows .
but the study also showed that most children had had no upsetting experiences with the internet at all . a large majority of those interviewed for the study eu kids online reported no negative experiences at all online , results of the european union study " risks and safety on the internet " showed .
but the study also showed that parents are frequently out of touch with their kids ' virtual lives .
the european union and london school of economics survey was presented thursday at the safer internet forum in luxembourg , and included interviews with thousands of kids across europe from ireland to turkey .
among its findings , the study showed that an average of 12 percent of european children had been bothered or upset by something they experienced online .
these included encountering pornography , sexual or bullying messages , or having their personal data revealed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , just eight percent of kids said they were bothered by an online event indeed , the study showed that 39 percent of those questioned had had encountered a " risky " behavior - such as communicating with new people not met face-to-face , or seeing user-generated content that is potentially harmful , such as hate , self-harm , or drug-taking content .
but only a portion of those asked said they had been upset or bothered by it .
in germany , the percentage of kids who said they were upset by an online experience was , at eight percent , near the lowest end of the scale .
only portugal -lrb- seven percent -rrb- and italy -lrb- six percent -rrb- were lower .
topping the percentages of those most bothered or upset were children in denmark -lrb- 26 percent -rrb- , estonia -lrb- 25 percent -rrb- and romania and sweden -lrb- 21 percent . -rrb-
discrepancy due to ' schoolyard monopoly ' uwe hasebrink , a professor at hamburg 's hans bredow institute for media research , led the german arm of the study .
in an interview with the hamburg abendblatt newspaper , he said that german children " are in less danger " of meeting harmful content because they use the internet " less frequently and with less variety " than kids in other countries .
but markus beckedahl , whose blog netzpolitik.org focuses on the intersection between the internet and german politics , said he found it hard to understand the response gap between countries like denmark and sweden , and germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say parents , not children , should be targets of information campaigns " the study said that countries with high internet usage have more problems , " beckedahl told deutsche welle . " but something like 99 percent of german kids have internet access , and i do n't think they have more more internet usage in denmark . "
one big difference could be the fact that a huge portion of the social-network market for kids and teens in germany takes place on german-only networks like " schuelervz " -lrb- " student directory , " -rrb- german schoolkids ' version of facebook .
" these platforms have a near monopoly on the schoolyard , " he added . " maybe that makes the difference - in germany , the kids are in closed communities , and in other countries they are just on the internet . "
the age factor other poll findings showed children were using the internet at increasingly young ages : an average of seven in sweden and eight in several other northern european countries .
interviewers , who spoke with 23,000 children between the ages of nine and 16 , found it was the youngest children who had the hardest time coping with disturbing material online .
in response to this finding , the study recommended targeting spending and advice at younger age groups to reduce risk and enhance the opportunities of the internet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : younger children had more trouble coping with upsetting experiences parents were frequently unaware of the risks to which their children had been exposed , the study showed .
for example , more than half of parents whose children said they had been bullied online , said they knew nothing of the situation .
moreover , some 41 percent of parents whose child had seen sexual images online said their child had n't , and 61 percent of parents whose children had met offline with an online contact , also said their child had n't .
beckedahl added that parents should ideally " be aware what their kids are doing , and they should talk to them about what kind of experiences they are having on the internet . "
the study also found that while the overwhelming majority of european kids in the study use the internet at home -lrb- 85 percent -rrb- , many children do have private time to use the internet .
48 percent use it in their bedroom , and 31 percent via a mobile phone or other handheld device .
in some countries , like the united kingdom , ireland and sweden , over one in five young people use the internet regularly on a handheld device .
supporting education - for educators beckedahl acknowledged that because of this separation between parents and when their children are online , and their lack of awareness of where their kids go online , it may make things difficult for the parents to keep up . " parents often lack literacy in the social networks their children are using , " he said .
" they have no clue what kind of experiences and user interaction their kids would have , and they do n't really know what can happen . " his suggestion : shifting germany 's ongoing campaigns for media literacy away from children , and toward parents and teachers .
" peer to peer education exists already - children figure out how these platforms work themselves , " he noted . " the problem is , their parents and teachers are n't able to teach them to behave correctly , and prevent risks . "
the study 's authors plan to publish official conclusions and recommendations in november .
but even in thier preliminary findings , they acknowledge that the harmful potential of the internet is counterbalanced - if not easily outweighed - by the medium 's benefits .
plus , they note that a majority of the kids polled said they had not had any harmful experiences with the internet at all .
for his part , beckedahl would like to see the german debate on internet usage lose its negative tone .
" our debate about the internet needs to become more positive , " he said . " it is one of the greatest tools we ever had .
but if we only talk about the risks , people will fear the internet . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 22.10.2010 european online risk study shows many parents clueless , kids blasé großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children are online at an increasingly young age more than one in eight european children has been upset by online content , a new eu study on internet risks shows .
but the study also showed that most children had had no upsetting experiences with the internet at all . a large majority of those interviewed for the study eu kids online reported no negative experiences at all online , results of the european union study " risks and safety on the internet " showed .
but the study also showed that parents are frequently out of touch with their kids ' virtual lives .
the european union and london school of economics survey was presented thursday at the safer internet forum in luxembourg , and included interviews with thousands of kids across europe from ireland to turkey .
among its findings , the study showed that an average of 12 percent of european children had been bothered or upset by something they experienced online .
these included encountering pornography , sexual or bullying messages , or having their personal data revealed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , just eight percent of kids said they were bothered by an online event indeed , the study showed that 39 percent of those questioned had had encountered a " risky " behavior - such as communicating with new people not met face-to-face , or seeing user-generated content that is potentially harmful , such as hate , self-harm , or drug-taking content .
but only a portion of those asked said they had been upset or bothered by it .
in germany , the percentage of kids who said they were upset by an online experience was , at eight percent , near the lowest end of the scale .
only portugal -lrb- seven percent -rrb- and italy -lrb- six percent -rrb- were lower .
topping the percentages of those most bothered or upset were children in denmark -lrb- 26 percent -rrb- , estonia -lrb- 25 percent -rrb- and romania and sweden -lrb- 21 percent . -rrb-
discrepancy due to ' schoolyard monopoly ' uwe hasebrink , a professor at hamburg 's hans bredow institute for media research , led the german arm of the study .
in an interview with the hamburg abendblatt newspaper , he said that german children " are in less danger " of meeting harmful content because they use the internet " less frequently and with less variety " than kids in other countries .
but markus beckedahl , whose blog netzpolitik.org focuses on the intersection between the internet and german politics , said he found it hard to understand the response gap between countries like denmark and sweden , and germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say parents , not children , should be targets of information campaigns " the study said that countries with high internet usage have more problems , " beckedahl told deutsche welle . " but something like 99 percent of german kids have internet access , and i do n't think they have more more internet usage in denmark . "
one big difference could be the fact that a huge portion of the social-network market for kids and teens in germany takes place on german-only networks like " schuelervz " -lrb- " student directory , " -rrb- german schoolkids ' version of facebook .
" these platforms have a near monopoly on the schoolyard , " he added . " maybe that makes the difference - in germany , the kids are in closed communities , and in other countries they are just on the internet . "
the age factor other poll findings showed children were using the internet at increasingly young ages : an average of seven in sweden and eight in several other northern european countries .
interviewers , who spoke with 23,000 children between the ages of nine and 16 , found it was the youngest children who had the hardest time coping with disturbing material online .
in response to this finding , the study recommended targeting spending and advice at younger age groups to reduce risk and enhance the opportunities of the internet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : younger children had more trouble coping with upsetting experiences parents were frequently unaware of the risks to which their children had been exposed , the study showed .
for example , more than half of parents whose children said they had been bullied online , said they knew nothing of the situation .
moreover , some 41 percent of parents whose child had seen sexual images online said their child had n't , and 61 percent of parents whose children had met offline with an online contact , also said their child had n't .
beckedahl added that parents should ideally " be aware what their kids are doing , and they should talk to them about what kind of experiences they are having on the internet . "
the study also found that while the overwhelming majority of european kids in the study use the internet at home -lrb- 85 percent -rrb- , many children do have private time to use the internet .
48 percent use it in their bedroom , and 31 percent via a mobile phone or other handheld device .
in some countries , like the united kingdom , ireland and sweden , over one in five young people use the internet regularly on a handheld device .
supporting education - for educators beckedahl acknowledged that because of this separation between parents and when their children are online , and their lack of awareness of where their kids go online , it may make things difficult for the parents to keep up . " parents often lack literacy in the social networks their children are using , " he said .
" they have no clue what kind of experiences and user interaction their kids would have , and they do n't really know what can happen . " his suggestion : shifting germany 's ongoing campaigns for media literacy away from children , and toward parents and teachers .
" peer to peer education exists already - children figure out how these platforms work themselves , " he noted . " the problem is , their parents and teachers are n't able to teach them to behave correctly , and prevent risks . "
the study 's authors plan to publish official conclusions and recommendations in november .
but even in thier preliminary findings , they acknowledge that the harmful potential of the internet is counterbalanced - if not easily outweighed - by the medium 's benefits .
plus , they note that a majority of the kids polled said they had not had any harmful experiences with the internet at all .
for his part , beckedahl would like to see the german debate on internet usage lose its negative tone .
" our debate about the internet needs to become more positive , " he said . " it is one of the greatest tools we ever had .
but if we only talk about the risks , people will fear the internet . "

" let 's be honest about it , the simple truth is , in the aerospace or aeronautic business , none of us , none of the companies that play a role in it , has been growing without any government support , " enders told attendees of an aviation club lunch in london .
" so let 's accept reality . " in addition , the airbus chief said , the fight over subsidies could " accelerate the ascendancy " of aircraft manufacturers from countries such as china , russia and brazil , who are working on releasing new models that could pose direct threats to the current duopoly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ceo enders has been unusually frank about the wto battle " if we talk about china , if we talk about russia or others , does anyone in this room believe that they will step back and say : ' now we understand the wto rules , we will play exactly by the rules ' ? " he said .
" absolutely not , so this is why i call this an absurdity . " long quarrel europe 's airbus and chicago-based boeing , the globe 's first and second largest aircraft manufacturers , have been arguing their cases before the wto since 2004 .
the united states initiated wto dispute procedures then about subsidies to the european aircraft industry .
in response , the eu launched similar proceedings against the us . since then , the trans-atlantic dispute has become bogged down and a swift resolution does not appear to be on the horizon .
in a ruling at the end of june , the wto did fault europe over aid to airbus , saying the company has received subsidies in the form of loans from european governments at below market-rates and without maturity dates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus got a slap on the wrist in a wto ruling this summer however , airbus responded by saying the wto had thrown out several of the other charges brought by the us .
in a counter claim , airbus accused boeing of getting tax breaks from washington as well as money from nasa research funds and argues that much us defense research , funded by the pentagon , is of a dual technology nature and ends up being transferred over to the us civil aviation sector . it is likely that any resolution will only come after years of appeals by both sides . " it 's hard to see how it ends right now , " paul sheridan , an aviation analyst at london-based ascend worldwide , told deutsche welle .
" you could take the wto report about airbus and take boeing 's response and switch the names and it would probably look pretty similar .
they seem to be both accusing each other of the same thing . " new guys in town in the meantime , a group of new players is arriving on the scene , ready to release products that could go head to head with boeing and airbus ' headliners . one big worry in chicago and toulouse , airbus ' home base , is the commercial aircraft corporation of china ltd , or comac .
its 919 model , due to come on the market in 2016 , will directly compete with the airbus a320 and boeing 's 737 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's comac is making airbus and boeing nervous " airbus and boeing should be very worried about comac as a rival to their duopoly " sheridan said .
" comac is state-owned and once the chinese government demonstrates a willingness to do something they usually follow through with it . " other manufacturers , such as canada 's bombardier , brazil 's embraer or russia 's sukhoi are seeking to gain a foothold in the lucrative civil aviation market .
bombardier 's single-aisle plane is due to enter service in 2013 and will also pose a threat to the a320 and 737 . " airbus is saying to boeing that they need to resolve this whole issue , " zafar khan , an aviation expert at sg securities , told deutsche welle .
" while we 're squabbling , enders is saying , those other countries are all subsidizing their industries . " enders said there will probably be five or six commercial aircraft manufacturers in the next 10 years , which means the industry will be faced with new questions about consolidations , partnerships and mergers . subsides and the future subsidies , although disliked by the wto , are almost a given in the aviation industry , experts say .
that is partly due to the expense of producing the product , but also from the benefits governments see from having a successful aerospace player . " when it comes to the aerospace industry , everyone is looking for help from governments because these are major , major undertakings and governments clearly see them as strategically important businesses to have , " khan said . in a related development , negotiators from the european union and other countries , including the us , japan and brazil , are meeting in canada to talk about financing planes in each other 's home markets - and specifically , how much government assistance is allowed . the old rules saw an aviation deal dominated by the us and europe .
the current picture is a lot more complicated with a new batch of players wanting a piece of some very lucrative skies . author : kyle james editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

although they are only preliminary results , they clearly show who the winners and losers are .
ratbil shamel has this opinion piece : now the secret , which never was one , is out .
the wolesi jirga , afghanistan ’ s lower house , will continue to be run by the country ’ s warlords over the next five years .
former mujahedin leaders and their allies have won in almost all the constituencies .
even in kabul , a city which at the beginning of the 1990s was almost completely destroyed by the battles between the various mujahedin groupings , the picture is the same .
hardly anybody in afghanistan is surprised by the results .
many had said even before the elections took place that they did not have any faith in afghanistan 's supposedly ' independent ' election commission -lrb- iec -rrb- .
and the fact that certain sections of the afghan population still went to vote has another explanation - they wanted to show that they , at least , take democracy seriously .
they went to the polls because they wanted to tell the world : " we afghans reject war , the taliban and extremism " .
many afghans perhaps don ’ t really know what democracy means or how a parliament functions but one thing that they know for sure is that a peaceful struggle is better than war .
and the people in afghanistan have been experiencing war for over 30 years .
yet hardly anyone is deluded enough to think that his / her vote makes a difference .
despite three elections in the past nine years , their lives have not improved for the better .
on the contrary .
the taliban are getting stronger and stronger by the day , while the government is becoming weaker .
and they know that the new parliament will not change much .
the erstwhile leaders of the mujahedin will certainly not fight for democratic reforms in the future .
their goal is clear - to strengthen their own position of power in the country .
this power will increase the more the international community pulls out of afghanistan .
some observers believe it will become increasingly difficult for president hamid karzai to govern but the opposite will be true .
karzai has long been counting on the mujahedin card .
his two deputies were chosen out of these ranks last year , despite national and international criticism .
but the real losers of this election , far more than hamid karzai , are the small democratic groupings in afghanistan .
in the past nine years , they have not managed to unite over a few common goals .
instead , they have founded countless political parties that carry no weight in afghanistan ’ s power struggle .
they fielded hundreds of candidates this time but will have to wake up to the fact that they have lost , again .
a further loser in these elections is the international community , especially the west .
democracy , peace and well-being were promised to the people of afghanistan almost a decade ago .
but the taliban and former warlords continue to determine the lives of the afghans .
afghanistan can not be left to the taliban and the warlords again .
the consequences of such a policy are clear to everybody – instability for the region and the world .

" we expect that within 10 days , the situation in terzigno can return to normal , " he told a news conference in rome after an emergency meeting .
the government 's plans to build a new dump in terzigno , which is located 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- southeast of naples in vesuvius national park , have for years met with fierce opposition by locals , who have repeatedly blocked access to the existing waste disposal site there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dump is located in vesuvius national park on thursday , police confronted around 2,000 demonstrators , who threw stones , marbles and firecrackers and used tree trunks to block access to the dump .
compensation offered berlusconi also announced he would release 14 million euros -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- to modernize the existing facility , which the protesters say is overflowing and causing health problems .
the problem has been a major issue for the italian government for several years , with berlusconi declaring a national disaster in 2008 .
the rubbish row has not escaped the european union 's notice either .
the european commission has taken legal action against italy to force the government to solve the crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi 's election pledge to solve the crisis has not materialized " the infringement procedures are ongoing , " spokesman joe hennon said on friday .
" italian authorities need to draw up a plan to manage rubbish in the region , " he added .
the european court of justice found earlier this year that italy had no adequate system for waste disposal in the naples region and said that the problem was a risk to human health and the environment .

but in the wake of the global crisis , it 's germany that 's emerging with ease , which countries like the us can learn from . unemployment figures in germany are down to 1992 levels , and german exports are on the rise as if the global economic crisis had never happened .
in comparison , the economy in the united states is doing a lot worse : unemployment stands high at 9.6 percent , and growth rates are far from the positive figures that are coming out of germany .
and yet , there 's no secret recipe behind the success of the german economy , says thomas zielke , deputy delegate of the german economy in washington – it all comes down to exports , he told deutsche welle .
" it 's that great flexibility of companies , and the will to expand .
people are simply used to focusing on exports , " zielke said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shapiro says germany has been well prepared for the crisis that 's not necessarily the case in the us , he says , where companies are used to relying much more on their own domestic market .
in the united states , exports only make up 13 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , but the figure in germany is more than three times higher .
and while most of germany 's exports are going to other eu countries , the biggest growth rates are in exports to the rest of the world .
investing in exports if the domestic market crumbles in a time of recession , companies have little choice other than to invest in exports , robert shapiro , economic advisor to the us government , told deutsche welle .
" that has always been germany 's strength , " he said .
" the country has been very well prepared for that . "
there are other factors behind germany 's success in handling the crisis that shapiro and his colleagues have taken a closer look at .
one example is government action , such as subsidizing shortened working hours .
by covering part of the salaries of workers who are put on reduced hours , berlin has managed to avoid a situation where too many people had to be laid off during the recession .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a manufacturing-based economy can more easily focus on exports jacob kirkegaard of the peterson institute for international economics told deutsche welle that he felt a lot of respect for germany 's quick resurgence .
" germany has proven that it 's possible to handle a dramatic slump in sales and exports without mass firings , " he says .
" you just have much more flexibility than on the us market .
here the gut reaction is always : when the sales go down , people have to be fired .
and when the demand is back , there 's a lack of workers . "
too much government involvement ?
but shapiro cautions against simply adapting that system to the us economy .
cultural differences are part of the problem – americans are traditionally opposed to their government getting involved in running businesses .
he also warned that despite the currently positive outlook there are still many risks for germany .
european monetary policy is too fragile , he says , as it has to balance between the interests of all the eu member states .
the danger of countries running bankrupt is still there .
greece for instance has not seen its situation improve as much as the rest of europe had hoped it would .
and other member states like ireland or spain are still struggling to avoid a crisis .
a moral price to pay shapiro and kirkegaard agree that germany 's exports to china are also not without a downside .
there 's a moral price to pay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us economy is struggling despite austerity measures " germany is rather careful in criticizing china because of course berlin does not want to put its exports at risk .
the us however are much more outspoken .
but that of course has an impact on us exports to china . "
and still , the us already seem to be readjusting their economic policy to follow more in the direction that germany is taking .
the obama government has recognized the importance of exports – the goal is to increase exports by five percent .
" the current administration has export at the top of its agenda , " thomas zielke says .
" obama has repeatedly said that he sees the future as being in manufacturing .
and he has put that directly in opposition to wall street and the financial crisis . "

although they are only preliminary results , they clearly show who the winners and losers are .
ratbil shamel has this opinion piece : now the secret , which never was one , is out .
the wolesi jirga , afghanistan ’ s lower house , will continue to be run by the country ’ s warlords over the next five years .
former mujahedin leaders and their allies have won in almost all the constituencies .
even in kabul , a city which at the beginning of the 1990s was almost completely destroyed by the battles between the various mujahedin groupings , the picture is the same .
hardly anybody in afghanistan is surprised by the results .
many had said even before the elections took place that they did not have any faith in afghanistan 's supposedly ' independent ' election commission -lrb- iec -rrb- .
and the fact that certain sections of the afghan population still went to vote has another explanation - they wanted to show that they , at least , take democracy seriously .
they went to the polls because they wanted to tell the world : " we afghans reject war , the taliban and extremism " .
many afghans perhaps don ’ t really know what democracy means or how a parliament functions but one thing that they know for sure is that a peaceful struggle is better than war .
and the people in afghanistan have been experiencing war for over 30 years .
yet hardly anyone is deluded enough to think that his / her vote makes a difference .
despite three elections in the past nine years , their lives have not improved for the better .
on the contrary .
the taliban are getting stronger and stronger by the day , while the government is becoming weaker .
and they know that the new parliament will not change much .
the erstwhile leaders of the mujahedin will certainly not fight for democratic reforms in the future .
their goal is clear - to strengthen their own position of power in the country .
this power will increase the more the international community pulls out of afghanistan .
some observers believe it will become increasingly difficult for president hamid karzai to govern but the opposite will be true .
karzai has long been counting on the mujahedin card .
his two deputies were chosen out of these ranks last year , despite national and international criticism .
but the real losers of this election , far more than hamid karzai , are the small democratic groupings in afghanistan .
in the past nine years , they have not managed to unite over a few common goals .
instead , they have founded countless political parties that carry no weight in afghanistan ’ s power struggle .
they fielded hundreds of candidates this time but will have to wake up to the fact that they have lost , again .
a further loser in these elections is the international community , especially the west .
democracy , peace and well-being were promised to the people of afghanistan almost a decade ago .
but the taliban and former warlords continue to determine the lives of the afghans .
afghanistan can not be left to the taliban and the warlords again .
the consequences of such a policy are clear to everybody – instability for the region and the world .

after the first day of talks , both sides claimed their positions had been strengthened . veteran conservative politician heiner geissler , who is leading the mediation talks on the controversial rail project stuttgart 21 , said the first round was a good start for " an experiment in democracy , " calling the discussions fair and to the point .
" i did n't get the impression that either party was just trying to score points , " he said after six and a half hours of talks .
it was the first time that mediation talks of this nature have been shown live on television and on the internet .
geissler said the debate was very technical , but that both parties had made an effort to avoid too much jargon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mediators hope the talks will help clarify the project 's pros and cons stefan mappus , the premier of the southern state of baden-wuerttemberg , where stuttgart is located , said it was a " good day for democracy " and that the talks were aimed at easing fears among the local population about the perceived disadvantages of a planned new underground train station .
controversial project the project , which has been the subject of protracted , sometimes violent protests , involves demolishing most of stuttgart 's old train station and replacing it with a new underground facility , with the addition of a new line creating a fast connection to the nearby city of ulm .
deutsche bahn board member volker kefer argued that the state needs a modern rail hub to be able to compete with airlines and that stuttgart 21 was the right way to do it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters say a modern underground station is an economic necessity but opponents insist that modernizing the existing station is the better option .
" we think your project is a step backwards , not forwards , " the mayor of nearby tuebingen , boris palmer told kefer on friday .
palmer also called on mappus to clear the way for a referendum on the project .
while deutsche bahn argues that the new underground station will boost passenger numbers by two million , critics say the figures do not add up and costs are likely to escalate .
the mediation talks are to continue every friday until dec .
3 .
more demonstrations are planned for saturday , when up to 40,000 people are expected in stuttgart to demonstrate both for and against the project .

the interior ministry accuses the group of ' street terrorism . ' in a series of overnight raids on friday , spanish police arrested 13 suspected members of a group labeled as the youth wing of the radical basque separatist group eta , the spanish interior ministry said .
the raids involved 300 police officers and took place in the northern basque region , the neighboring navarre and catalonia .
authorities continued searching homes and other locations after the arrests , seizing documents and computer storage devices .
all the suspects were between 20 and 29 years old and were to be transferred to madrid later in the day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta 's most recent ceasefire announcement was viewed skeptically the ministry said the segi organization acts as " a recruiting ground which eta continues to turn to so as to regenerate its militant network . "
it accuses members of the group of " street terrorism , " or acts of urban anti-state violence like throwing molotov cocktails at symbols of the spanish state .
armed struggle the group was banned by the spanish supreme court in 2007 when it ruled that it had links to terrorism .
the european union classifies segi as a terrorist organization .
police detained about three dozen other suspected segi members , many of them suspected leaders , in november 2009 .
eta has been blamed for the deaths of some 825 people in more than 40 years of its violent struggle for an independent basque state .
in a video statement on september 5 , eta said it had decided to halt " armed offensive actions . "
the announcement was largely met with skepticism , as eta had previously announced ceasefires only to break them shortly thereafter .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 22.10.2010 merkel and rasmussen bank on russia for missile defense shield großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen and merkel reiterated support for the missile shield after talks in berlin , nato secretary general rasmussen said there was no alternative to a common european anti-missile shield .
the organization hopes to get russia on board for a common security structure . german chancellor angela merkel and nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen have reiterated their support for a planned european anti-missile defense shield and have expressed hope that russia will drop its objections to the plan .
moscow has in the past been the major stumbling block for the missile defense shield .
russia sees the shield as being at least partly directed against its own military might whereas nato and washington say its sole purpose is to protect europe from possible attack by rogue states such as iran or north korea .
at the nato summit november , the western alliance is hoping to reach agreement on a new strategic plan aimed at giving nato a new focus two decades after the end of the cold war .
in a surprise move , russian president dmitry medvedev earlier this week agreed to attend next month 's talks in portugal .
he indicated moscow was open to dialogue about the shield .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev in talks with sarkozy and merkel agreed to attend the upcoming nato summit " the openness of russia towards discussion over the missile defense system is a good signal , " merkel told reporters in berlin on friday .
but she cautioned that cooperation with russia would be slow in the making .
euro-atlantic security rasmussen added the threat of north korean or iranian missiles would affect russian cities as well as central european ones .
" we simply can not afford becoming the hostage of such an attack , " the nato chief said , saying that only a common defense system - with the inclusion of russia - could provide for a " true euro-atlantic security architecture . "
" there is a broad scope of areas where we could develop a broad scope of practical cooperation with russia , " rasmussen said , pointing not only to missile defense but also to afghanistan and international counter-terrorism .
both merkel and rasmussen however dismissed the idea of russia becoming part of the northern atlantic treaty organization any time soon .
" things have developed well in the last year , but i do n't think we should ask too much of one another , " the german chancellor said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel cautioned that cooperation with russia would be slow in the making rasmussen pointed out that russia had made it clear that joining nato was not an option for moscow and that a strategic partnership was the only realistic option .
" i 've taken note of some statements from moscow that russia would never apply for nato membership , because it was able to take care of security matters on its own , " the nato chief said .
" so , let 's rather pursue what i consider a realistic future , namely a true strategic partnership between nato and russia . "
merkel backs french nuclear arsenal german chancellor merkel also touched on berlin 's shifting position on nuclear defense .
she said nato members should retain nuclear capabilities as long as other , potentially hostile , countries still had nuclear weapons .
previously , german foreign minister guido westerwelle had expressed hopes that the missile shield would allow for a nuclear powers to cut their arsenals .
germany and france had been at odds over the issue earlier this week when french president nicolas sarkozy blatantly dismissed the idea that france would accept any foreign intervention in its nuclear arms policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there still is need for nuclear deterrent , merkel said paris insists on keeping its own nuclear weapons .
merkel ’ s statements after the talks with rasmussen on friday seemed to be aimed directly at concerns of western nuclear powers such as france that the defense shield could pressure them into reducing their arsenals .
reducing nuclear weapons needed to be based on the principle of reciprocity , merkel said .
" as long as there are nuclear weapons in the world , we need to have these capabilities . "
germany itself does not have any nuclear weapons , but has us weapons stationed on its territory .
nato as an international forum on security rasmussen however called for a general broadening of nato 's role , making it more of a political organization as opposed to having a solely military agenda .
" nato has to become a forum for consultation on international security , " he said .
cooperation with other regions of the world ought to be fostered , he added .
countries like china , india and pakistan should work in close dialogue with nato .
such a " cooperative approach " was not intended to be directed against any third countries but would rather work along the lines of united nations policies , rasmussen said .

but in the wake of the global crisis , it 's germany that 's emerging with ease , which countries like the us can learn from . unemployment figures in germany are down to 1992 levels , and german exports are on the rise as if the global economic crisis had never happened .
in comparison , the economy in the united states is doing a lot worse : unemployment stands high at 9.6 percent , and growth rates are far from the positive figures that are coming out of germany .
and yet , there 's no secret recipe behind the success of the german economy , says thomas zielke , deputy delegate of the german economy in washington – it all comes down to exports , he told deutsche welle .
" it 's that great flexibility of companies , and the will to expand .
people are simply used to focusing on exports , " zielke said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shapiro says germany has been well prepared for the crisis that 's not necessarily the case in the us , he says , where companies are used to relying much more on their own domestic market .
in the united states , exports only make up 13 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , but the figure in germany is more than three times higher .
and while most of germany 's exports are going to other eu countries , the biggest growth rates are in exports to the rest of the world .
investing in exports if the domestic market crumbles in a time of recession , companies have little choice other than to invest in exports , robert shapiro , economic advisor to the us government , told deutsche welle .
" that has always been germany 's strength , " he said .
" the country has been very well prepared for that . "
there are other factors behind germany 's success in handling the crisis that shapiro and his colleagues have taken a closer look at .
one example is government action , such as subsidizing shortened working hours .
by covering part of the salaries of workers who are put on reduced hours , berlin has managed to avoid a situation where too many people had to be laid off during the recession .

" you just have much more flexibility than on the us market .
here the gut reaction is always : when the sales go down , people have to be fired .
and when the demand is back , there 's a lack of workers . "
too much government involvement ?
but shapiro cautions against simply adapting that system to the us economy .
cultural differences are part of the problem – americans are traditionally opposed to their government getting involved in running businesses .
he also warned that despite the currently positive outlook there are still many risks for germany .
european monetary policy is too fragile , he says , as it has to balance between the interests of all the eu member states .
the danger of countries running bankrupt is still there .
greece for instance has not seen its situation improve as much as the rest of europe had hoped it would .

" we expect that within 10 days , the situation in terzigno can return to normal , " he told a news conference in rome after an emergency meeting .
the government 's plans to build a new dump in terzigno , which is located 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- southeast of naples in vesuvius national park , have for years met with fierce opposition by locals , who have repeatedly blocked access to the existing waste disposal site there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dump is located in vesuvius national park on thursday , police confronted around 2,000 demonstrators , who threw stones , marbles and firecrackers and used tree trunks to block access to the dump .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 22.10.2010 german economic boom a role model for other countries großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economy has recovered based on its exports the german economy used to be criticized for being overregulated and unflexible .
but in the wake of the global crisis , it 's germany that 's emerging with ease , which countries like the us can learn from . unemployment figures in germany are down to 1992 levels , and german exports are on the rise as if the global economic crisis had never happened .
in comparison , the economy in the united states is doing a lot worse : unemployment stands high at 9.6 percent , and growth rates are far from the positive figures that are coming out of germany .
and yet , there 's no secret recipe behind the success of the german economy , says thomas zielke , deputy delegate of the german economy in washington – it all comes down to exports , he told deutsche welle .
" it 's that great flexibility of companies , and the will to expand .
people are simply used to focusing on exports , " zielke said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shapiro says germany has been well prepared for the crisis that 's not necessarily the case in the us , he says , where companies are used to relying much more on their own domestic market .
in the united states , exports only make up 13 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , but the figure in germany is more than three times higher .
and while most of germany 's exports are going to other eu countries , the biggest growth rates are in exports to the rest of the world .
investing in exports if the domestic market crumbles in a time of recession , companies have little choice other than to invest in exports , robert shapiro , economic advisor to the us government , told deutsche welle .
" that has always been germany 's strength , " he said .
" the country has been very well prepared for that . "
there are other factors behind germany 's success in handling the crisis that shapiro and his colleagues have taken a closer look at .
one example is government action , such as subsidizing shortened working hours .
by covering part of the salaries of workers who are put on reduced hours , berlin has managed to avoid a situation where too many people had to be laid off during the recession .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a manufacturing-based economy can more easily focus on exports jacob kirkegaard of the peterson institute for international economics told deutsche welle that he felt a lot of respect for germany 's quick resurgence .
" germany has proven that it 's possible to handle a dramatic slump in sales and exports without mass firings , " he says .
" you just have much more flexibility than on the us market .
here the gut reaction is always : when the sales go down , people have to be fired .
and when the demand is back , there 's a lack of workers . "
too much government involvement ?
but shapiro cautions against simply adapting that system to the us economy .
cultural differences are part of the problem – americans are traditionally opposed to their government getting involved in running businesses .
he also warned that despite the currently positive outlook there are still many risks for germany .
european monetary policy is too fragile , he says , as it has to balance between the interests of all the eu member states .
the danger of countries running bankrupt is still there .
greece for instance has not seen its situation improve as much as the rest of europe had hoped it would .
and other member states like ireland or spain are still struggling to avoid a crisis .
a moral price to pay shapiro and kirkegaard agree that germany 's exports to china are also not without a downside .
there 's a moral price to pay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us economy is struggling despite austerity measures " germany is rather careful in criticizing china because of course berlin does not want to put its exports at risk .
the us however are much more outspoken .
but that of course has an impact on us exports to china . "
and still , the us already seem to be readjusting their economic policy to follow more in the direction that germany is taking .
the obama government has recognized the importance of exports – the goal is to increase exports by five percent .
" the current administration has export at the top of its agenda , " thomas zielke says .
" obama has repeatedly said that he sees the future as being in manufacturing .
and he has put that directly in opposition to wall street and the financial crisis . "

although they are only preliminary results , they clearly show who the winners and losers are .
ratbil shamel has this opinion piece : now the secret , which never was one , is out .
the wolesi jirga , afghanistan ’ s lower house , will continue to be run by the country ’ s warlords over the next five years .
former mujahedin leaders and their allies have won in almost all the constituencies .
even in kabul , a city which at the beginning of the 1990s was almost completely destroyed by the battles between the various mujahedin groupings , the picture is the same .
hardly anybody in afghanistan is surprised by the results .
many had said even before the elections took place that they did not have any faith in afghanistan 's supposedly ' independent ' election commission -lrb- iec -rrb- .
and the fact that certain sections of the afghan population still went to vote has another explanation - they wanted to show that they , at least , take democracy seriously .
they went to the polls because they wanted to tell the world : " we afghans reject war , the taliban and extremism " .
many afghans perhaps don ’ t really know what democracy means or how a parliament functions but one thing that they know for sure is that a peaceful struggle is better than war .
and the people in afghanistan have been experiencing war for over 30 years .
yet hardly anyone is deluded enough to think that his / her vote makes a difference .
despite three elections in the past nine years , their lives have not improved for the better .
on the contrary .
the taliban are getting stronger and stronger by the day , while the government is becoming weaker .
and they know that the new parliament will not change much .
the erstwhile leaders of the mujahedin will certainly not fight for democratic reforms in the future .
their goal is clear - to strengthen their own position of power in the country .
this power will increase the more the international community pulls out of afghanistan .
some observers believe it will become increasingly difficult for president hamid karzai to govern but the opposite will be true .
karzai has long been counting on the mujahedin card .
his two deputies were chosen out of these ranks last year , despite national and international criticism .
but the real losers of this election , far more than hamid karzai , are the small democratic groupings in afghanistan .
in the past nine years , they have not managed to unite over a few common goals .
instead , they have founded countless political parties that carry no weight in afghanistan ’ s power struggle .
they fielded hundreds of candidates this time but will have to wake up to the fact that they have lost , again .
a further loser in these elections is the international community , especially the west .
democracy , peace and well-being were promised to the people of afghanistan almost a decade ago .
but the taliban and former warlords continue to determine the lives of the afghans .
afghanistan can not be left to the taliban and the warlords again .
the consequences of such a policy are clear to everybody – instability for the region and the world .

" so let 's accept reality .

" absolutely not , so this is why i call this an absurdity . " long quarrel europe 's airbus and chicago-based boeing , the globe 's first and second largest aircraft manufacturers , have been arguing their cases before the wto since 2004 .
the united states initiated wto dispute procedures then about subsidies to the european aircraft industry .
in response , the eu launched similar proceedings against the us . since then , the trans-atlantic dispute has become bogged down and a swift resolution does not appear to be on the horizon .

bayern needs points if they hope to free themselves of the rut that has them currently sitting in ninth place in the table .
" hamburg had the big chances , " said bayern captain philipp lahm , " so there are times when you have to be satisfied with one point . "
bayern have been deeply cut by a swathe of injuries this season and played without several key players friday , including mark van bommel , daniel van buyten and miroslav klose .
' better than nothing ' fourth-place hamburg could have used a win to gain ground on bayer leverkusen .
the two teams are currently even at 15 points with leverkusen ahead on goals , but leverkusen could widen the gap again on sunday with a win against mainz .
the match was relatively even , although hamburg did have better chances to score .
that included a very near-miss by jonathan pitroipa , who only had bayern keeper joerg butt to beat but bounced his shot off the right post .
" pitroipa should have scored , " hamburg coach armin veh said after the game .
" -lrb- but -rrb- at least we kept a clean sheet . "
" better one point against bayern than none , " added hamburg 's captain heiko westermann .

but the study also showed that most children had had no upsetting experiences with the internet at all . a large majority of those interviewed for the study eu kids online reported no negative experiences at all online , results of the european union study " risks and safety on the internet " showed .
but the study also showed that parents are frequently out of touch with their kids ' virtual lives .
the european union and london school of economics survey was presented thursday at the safer internet forum in luxembourg , and included interviews with thousands of kids across europe from ireland to turkey .
among its findings , the study showed that an average of 12 percent of european children had been bothered or upset by something they experienced online .
these included encountering pornography , sexual or bullying messages , or having their personal data revealed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , just eight percent of kids said they were bothered by an online event indeed , the study showed that 39 percent of those questioned had had encountered a " risky " behavior - such as communicating with new people not met face-to-face , or seeing user-generated content that is potentially harmful , such as hate , self-harm , or drug-taking content .
but only a portion of those asked said they had been upset or bothered by it .
in germany , the percentage of kids who said they were upset by an online experience was , at eight percent , near the lowest end of the scale .
only portugal -lrb- seven percent -rrb- and italy -lrb- six percent -rrb- were lower .
topping the percentages of those most bothered or upset were children in denmark -lrb- 26 percent -rrb- , estonia -lrb- 25 percent -rrb- and romania and sweden -lrb- 21 percent . -rrb-
discrepancy due to ' schoolyard monopoly ' uwe hasebrink , a professor at hamburg 's hans bredow institute for media research , led the german arm of the study .
in an interview with the hamburg abendblatt newspaper , he said that german children " are in less danger " of meeting harmful content because they use the internet " less frequently and with less variety " than kids in other countries .
but markus beckedahl , whose blog netzpolitik.org focuses on the intersection between the internet and german politics , said he found it hard to understand the response gap between countries like denmark and sweden , and germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say parents , not children , should be targets of information campaigns " the study said that countries with high internet usage have more problems , " beckedahl told deutsche welle . " but something like 99 percent of german kids have internet access , and i do n't think they have more more internet usage in denmark . "
one big difference could be the fact that a huge portion of the social-network market for kids and teens in germany takes place on german-only networks like " schuelervz " -lrb- " student directory , " -rrb- german schoolkids ' version of facebook .
" these platforms have a near monopoly on the schoolyard , " he added . " maybe that makes the difference - in germany , the kids are in closed communities , and in other countries they are just on the internet . "
the age factor other poll findings showed children were using the internet at increasingly young ages : an average of seven in sweden and eight in several other northern european countries .
interviewers , who spoke with 23,000 children between the ages of nine and 16 , found it was the youngest children who had the hardest time coping with disturbing material online .
in response to this finding , the study recommended targeting spending and advice at younger age groups to reduce risk and enhance the opportunities of the internet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : younger children had more trouble coping with upsetting experiences parents were frequently unaware of the risks to which their children had been exposed , the study showed .
for example , more than half of parents whose children said they had been bullied online , said they knew nothing of the situation .
moreover , some 41 percent of parents whose child had seen sexual images online said their child had n't , and 61 percent of parents whose children had met offline with an online contact , also said their child had n't .
beckedahl added that parents should ideally " be aware what their kids are doing , and they should talk to them about what kind of experiences they are having on the internet . "
the study also found that while the overwhelming majority of european kids in the study use the internet at home -lrb- 85 percent -rrb- , many children do have private time to use the internet .
48 percent use it in their bedroom , and 31 percent via a mobile phone or other handheld device .
in some countries , like the united kingdom , ireland and sweden , over one in five young people use the internet regularly on a handheld device .
supporting education - for educators beckedahl acknowledged that because of this separation between parents and when their children are online , and their lack of awareness of where their kids go online , it may make things difficult for the parents to keep up . " parents often lack literacy in the social networks their children are using , " he said .
" they have no clue what kind of experiences and user interaction their kids would have , and they do n't really know what can happen . " his suggestion : shifting germany 's ongoing campaigns for media literacy away from children , and toward parents and teachers .
" peer to peer education exists already - children figure out how these platforms work themselves , " he noted . " the problem is , their parents and teachers are n't able to teach them to behave correctly , and prevent risks . "
the study 's authors plan to publish official conclusions and recommendations in november .
but even in thier preliminary findings , they acknowledge that the harmful potential of the internet is counterbalanced - if not easily outweighed - by the medium 's benefits .
plus , they note that a majority of the kids polled said they had not had any harmful experiences with the internet at all .
for his part , beckedahl would like to see the german debate on internet usage lose its negative tone .
" our debate about the internet needs to become more positive , " he said . " it is one of the greatest tools we ever had .
but if we only talk about the risks , people will fear the internet . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 22.10.2010 merkel and rasmussen bank on russia for missile defense shield großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen and merkel reiterated support for the missile shield after talks in berlin , nato secretary general rasmussen said there was no alternative to a common european anti-missile shield .
the organization hopes to get russia on board for a common security structure . german chancellor angela merkel and nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen have reiterated their support for a planned european anti-missile defense shield and have expressed hope that russia will drop its objections to the plan .
moscow has in the past been the major stumbling block for the missile defense shield .
russia sees the shield as being at least partly directed against its own military might whereas nato and washington say its sole purpose is to protect europe from possible attack by rogue states such as iran or north korea .
at the nato summit november , the western alliance is hoping to reach agreement on a new strategic plan aimed at giving nato a new focus two decades after the end of the cold war .
in a surprise move , russian president dmitry medvedev earlier this week agreed to attend next month 's talks in portugal .
he indicated moscow was open to dialogue about the shield .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev in talks with sarkozy and merkel agreed to attend the upcoming nato summit " the openness of russia towards discussion over the missile defense system is a good signal , " merkel told reporters in berlin on friday .
but she cautioned that cooperation with russia would be slow in the making .
euro-atlantic security rasmussen added the threat of north korean or iranian missiles would affect russian cities as well as central european ones .
" we simply can not afford becoming the hostage of such an attack , " the nato chief said , saying that only a common defense system - with the inclusion of russia - could provide for a " true euro-atlantic security architecture . "
" there is a broad scope of areas where we could develop a broad scope of practical cooperation with russia , " rasmussen said , pointing not only to missile defense but also to afghanistan and international counter-terrorism .
both merkel and rasmussen however dismissed the idea of russia becoming part of the northern atlantic treaty organization any time soon .
" things have developed well in the last year , but i do n't think we should ask too much of one another , " the german chancellor said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel cautioned that cooperation with russia would be slow in the making rasmussen pointed out that russia had made it clear that joining nato was not an option for moscow and that a strategic partnership was the only realistic option .
" i 've taken note of some statements from moscow that russia would never apply for nato membership , because it was able to take care of security matters on its own , " the nato chief said .
" so , let 's rather pursue what i consider a realistic future , namely a true strategic partnership between nato and russia . "
merkel backs french nuclear arsenal german chancellor merkel also touched on berlin 's shifting position on nuclear defense .
she said nato members should retain nuclear capabilities as long as other , potentially hostile , countries still had nuclear weapons .
previously , german foreign minister guido westerwelle had expressed hopes that the missile shield would allow for a nuclear powers to cut their arsenals .
germany and france had been at odds over the issue earlier this week when french president nicolas sarkozy blatantly dismissed the idea that france would accept any foreign intervention in its nuclear arms policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there still is need for nuclear deterrent , merkel said paris insists on keeping its own nuclear weapons .
merkel ’ s statements after the talks with rasmussen on friday seemed to be aimed directly at concerns of western nuclear powers such as france that the defense shield could pressure them into reducing their arsenals .
reducing nuclear weapons needed to be based on the principle of reciprocity , merkel said .
" as long as there are nuclear weapons in the world , we need to have these capabilities . "
germany itself does not have any nuclear weapons , but has us weapons stationed on its territory .
nato as an international forum on security rasmussen however called for a general broadening of nato 's role , making it more of a political organization as opposed to having a solely military agenda .
" nato has to become a forum for consultation on international security , " he said .
cooperation with other regions of the world ought to be fostered , he added .
countries like china , india and pakistan should work in close dialogue with nato .
such a " cooperative approach " was not intended to be directed against any third countries but would rather work along the lines of united nations policies , rasmussen said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 22.10.2010 european online risk study shows many parents clueless , kids blasé großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children are online at an increasingly young age more than one in eight european children has been upset by online content , a new eu study on internet risks shows .
but the study also showed that most children had had no upsetting experiences with the internet at all . a large majority of those interviewed for the study eu kids online reported no negative experiences at all online , results of the european union study " risks and safety on the internet " showed .
but the study also showed that parents are frequently out of touch with their kids ' virtual lives .
the european union and london school of economics survey was presented thursday at the safer internet forum in luxembourg , and included interviews with thousands of kids across europe from ireland to turkey .
among its findings , the study showed that an average of 12 percent of european children had been bothered or upset by something they experienced online .
these included encountering pornography , sexual or bullying messages , or having their personal data revealed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , just eight percent of kids said they were bothered by an online event indeed , the study showed that 39 percent of those questioned had had encountered a " risky " behavior - such as communicating with new people not met face-to-face , or seeing user-generated content that is potentially harmful , such as hate , self-harm , or drug-taking content .
but only a portion of those asked said they had been upset or bothered by it .
in germany , the percentage of kids who said they were upset by an online experience was , at eight percent , near the lowest end of the scale .
only portugal -lrb- seven percent -rrb- and italy -lrb- six percent -rrb- were lower .
topping the percentages of those most bothered or upset were children in denmark -lrb- 26 percent -rrb- , estonia -lrb- 25 percent -rrb- and romania and sweden -lrb- 21 percent . -rrb-
discrepancy due to ' schoolyard monopoly ' uwe hasebrink , a professor at hamburg 's hans bredow institute for media research , led the german arm of the study .
in an interview with the hamburg abendblatt newspaper , he said that german children " are in less danger " of meeting harmful content because they use the internet " less frequently and with less variety " than kids in other countries .
but markus beckedahl , whose blog netzpolitik.org focuses on the intersection between the internet and german politics , said he found it hard to understand the response gap between countries like denmark and sweden , and germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say parents , not children , should be targets of information campaigns " the study said that countries with high internet usage have more problems , " beckedahl told deutsche welle . " but something like 99 percent of german kids have internet access , and i do n't think they have more more internet usage in denmark . "
one big difference could be the fact that a huge portion of the social-network market for kids and teens in germany takes place on german-only networks like " schuelervz " -lrb- " student directory , " -rrb- german schoolkids ' version of facebook .
" these platforms have a near monopoly on the schoolyard , " he added . " maybe that makes the difference - in germany , the kids are in closed communities , and in other countries they are just on the internet . "
the age factor other poll findings showed children were using the internet at increasingly young ages : an average of seven in sweden and eight in several other northern european countries .
interviewers , who spoke with 23,000 children between the ages of nine and 16 , found it was the youngest children who had the hardest time coping with disturbing material online .
in response to this finding , the study recommended targeting spending and advice at younger age groups to reduce risk and enhance the opportunities of the internet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : younger children had more trouble coping with upsetting experiences parents were frequently unaware of the risks to which their children had been exposed , the study showed .
for example , more than half of parents whose children said they had been bullied online , said they knew nothing of the situation .
moreover , some 41 percent of parents whose child had seen sexual images online said their child had n't , and 61 percent of parents whose children had met offline with an online contact , also said their child had n't .
beckedahl added that parents should ideally " be aware what their kids are doing , and they should talk to them about what kind of experiences they are having on the internet . "
the study also found that while the overwhelming majority of european kids in the study use the internet at home -lrb- 85 percent -rrb- , many children do have private time to use the internet .
48 percent use it in their bedroom , and 31 percent via a mobile phone or other handheld device .
in some countries , like the united kingdom , ireland and sweden , over one in five young people use the internet regularly on a handheld device .
supporting education - for educators beckedahl acknowledged that because of this separation between parents and when their children are online , and their lack of awareness of where their kids go online , it may make things difficult for the parents to keep up . " parents often lack literacy in the social networks their children are using , " he said .
" they have no clue what kind of experiences and user interaction their kids would have , and they do n't really know what can happen . " his suggestion : shifting germany 's ongoing campaigns for media literacy away from children , and toward parents and teachers .

president wulff urges turks to ' actively integrate ' in germany immigrants in any country should adopt their new homeland 's way of life .
fluency in the language of the new country is an absolute must and should be a condition of entry .
even in my small country , down at the bottom of the world , we are headed in the direction of those at the top of the world ... better for people stay in their own country and fix the problems there than to travel the world and contribute to the downfall of every country they inhabit . - kay , new zealand the media keeps misinterpreting what chancellor merkel has said concerning multiculturalism .
she said that the " approach " taken in germany toward multiculturalism had failed , not multiculturalism itself .
to say multiculturalism has failed is a very unwise , untrue , and discouraging message to send out into the global community .
perhaps germany , as well as many other nations , needs to re-evaluate assimilation and acculturation and how diverse groups of people may achieve common national and international goals without losing personal identity and even celebrating it at times . - darrell , us it is my belief that if one chooses to take resources from a foreign society , then the one taking should give back more by enforcing the traditions and resources of the society which they joined .
after all , there is a reason for having left one 's own society and country .
therefore to moving oneself to another country , then insisting that the new location should serve the new inhabitants by changing , is counter productive .
germany is germany , and in present successful due to germany 's past , present and very bright future . - dan , us bravo president wulff .
immigrants should respect their adopted countries ' laws and customs and adapt to them .

bayern needs points if they hope to free themselves of the rut that has them currently sitting in ninth place in the table .
" hamburg had the big chances , " said bayern captain philipp lahm , " so there are times when you have to be satisfied with one point . "
bayern have been deeply cut by a swathe of injuries this season and played without several key players friday , including mark van bommel , daniel van buyten and miroslav klose .
' better than nothing ' fourth-place hamburg could have used a win to gain ground on bayer leverkusen .
the two teams are currently even at 15 points with leverkusen ahead on goals , but leverkusen could widen the gap again on sunday with a win against mainz .
the match was relatively even , although hamburg did have better chances to score .
that included a very near-miss by jonathan pitroipa , who only had bayern keeper joerg butt to beat but bounced his shot off the right post .
" pitroipa should have scored , " hamburg coach armin veh said after the game .
" -lrb- but -rrb- at least we kept a clean sheet . "
" better one point against bayern than none , " added hamburg 's captain heiko westermann .

the leader of the freedom party is facing charges of inciting racial hatred against muslims . dutch anti-islam politician geert wilders welcomed the decision by a dutch court to order a retrial with new judges , after he complained that the current judges were biased .
" this gives me a new chance of a new fair trial , " wilders told the reuters news agency .
" i 'm confident i can only be acquitted , because i have broken no law , but spoken the truth , " he insisted .
wilders ' lawyer had asked the court to replace the judges because of concern about their being biased , after they did not immediately approve a request to hear testimony from a witness the defense considered crucial to its case .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilders has caused outrage among muslims back to square one the amsterdam court ruled that the defense 's fear of bias was " understandable " , meaning the entire trial process will have to be repeated , although it was not clear when it would reopen .
wilders has repeatedly equated islam and muslims with fascism and violence , and he also called for the koran to be banned in the netherlands .
the dutch politician 's anti-immigration freedom party was one of the big winners in june 's national elections and , while not part of the government , it has agreed to prop it up in crucial decisions .

bayern needs points if they hope to free themselves of the rut that has them currently sitting in ninth place in the table .
" hamburg had the big chances , " said bayern captain philipp lahm , " so there are times when you have to be satisfied with one point . "
bayern have been deeply cut by a swathe of injuries this season and played without several key players friday , including mark van bommel , daniel van buyten and miroslav klose .
' better than nothing ' fourth-place hamburg could have used a win to gain ground on bayer leverkusen .
the two teams are currently even at 15 points with leverkusen ahead on goals , but leverkusen could widen the gap again on sunday with a win against mainz .
the match was relatively even , although hamburg did have better chances to score .
that included a very near-miss by jonathan pitroipa , who only had bayern keeper joerg butt to beat but bounced his shot off the right post .
" pitroipa should have scored , " hamburg coach armin veh said after the game .
" -lrb- but -rrb- at least we kept a clean sheet . "
" better one point against bayern than none , " added hamburg 's captain heiko westermann .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 22.10.2010 as new powers emerge , political realism drives global agenda großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil , russia , india and china are pursuing their national interests as they gain in power the us and the eu campaigned for a common world order based on liberal values such as democracy and human rights .
but as the balance of power shifts toward developing countries , national interests are trumping values . during the 1990s , the advanced democracies of north america and western europe emerged as the powerbrokers of global politics .
russia shrank from the world stage as it slid into chaos after the collapse of the soviet union .
and the large developing countries - such as brazil , india and china - remained preoccupied with their own internal reforms .
as a consequence , the united states and the european union began to construct a world order based on liberal vales . they promoted a doctrine of free trade , democracy and human rights .
those nations that accepted - or at least did not challenge -these " international norms " were integrated into a growing network of economic globalization .
this network was governed by institutions such as the world trade organization , the international monetary fund and the world bank . meanwhile , leaders who actively undermined the liberal rules of the game - such as slobodan milosevic and saddam hussein - faced crippling sanctions and devastating airstrikes .
integration and confrontation became two sides of the same coin .
but in the new millennium a more diverse group of countries is sharing world power , which has made it difficult to form a consensus around a common global agenda .
as brazil , russia , india and china - often referred to as the brics - confidently pursue their own national interests , the liberal international order is buckling .
political paralysis in the west nearly a decade ago , developed and developing nations agreed in doha , qatar to a round of multilateral negotiations that would reduce poverty through trade liberalization .
the goal was to eliminate economic barriers that prevented poorer countries from sharing in the benefits of globalization .
although political leaders in the us and eu had traditionally championed free trade , they now found it politically difficult to turn the doha round into a final settlement .
the business community felt they were not getting enough , while labor unions believed an agreement would outsource more jobs to the developing world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the doha round failed , sparking criticism of the wto in the developing world meanwhile , the brics - which once opposed liberalization as an instrument of imperialism - now championed free trade .
the failure of state socialism and protectionism had pushed brazil , russia , india and china toward a model of export-led growth that depended on an open global economy .
" there 's an irony here , " jagdish bhagwati , an expert on international trade with the council on foreign relations and a professor at columbia university in new york , told deutsche welle .
" if you look at what leaders are doing - obama is probably the worst but sarkozy comes pretty close - the leadership itself seems to be hamstrung and paralyzed in an inability to celebrate the openness of markets . "
as the brics profited from openness , a growing number of voices in the us and eu began to view trade as a zero-sum game .
as a result , the doha round collapsed .
" it just means that we are not pushing forward , " bhagwati said .
" the real question during a time of recession is not moving backwards into additional protectionism . "
emerging powers take initiative in response to the doha round 's collapse and the onset of the economic crisis , the brics began to strengthen their relations among one another .
yet political differences between these countries have prevented them from forging a true alliance .
the democratic nations of india , brazil as well as south africa have established their own dialogue .
in turn , the autocratic regimes of russia and china have separately signed a series of agreements deepening what they call a " strategic partnership of cooperation . "
however , these nations do find common ground in their skepticism of the us and the eu 's international agenda .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and the eu have often spread their values in the developing world through force the us and the eu made human rights and democracy a central part of their foreign policies , jointly applying military force to spread these liberal norms in the balkans and afghanistan .
and the us unilaterally imposed these norms in iraq .
in contrast , the brics emphasize national sovereignty and non-intervention as a means to avoid unnecessary confrontation as they further their economic development . " there is a strong old north-south mindset in the world and that ties to a set of neutral countries in opposition to western imperialism , " thomas carothers , an expert on democracy and the rule of law with the carnegie endowment for international peace , told deutsche welle .
" as we move out of that mindset we could go in two directions , " carothers continued .
" they -lsb- brics -rsb- could begin to see the value of an international community based on norms ; or they could stick with the feeling of being pushed around by larger powers and have an emphasis on sovereignty . "
the return of realpolitik the us and the eu remain critically important in world politics , but their relative power is declining .
in response , they may be forced to make political compromises in order to coopt the new powers .
the global agenda rooted in democracy and human rights could give way to a more pragmatic approach .
finding common ground between emerging and established powers would mean focusing on economic interests instead of liberal norms .
" they -lsb- emerging powers -rsb- do n't choose their partners based on human rights or democracy , " daniel flemes , an expert on regional powers and the new world order with the german institute for global and area studies , told deutsche welle .
" their foreign policies are oriented toward their interests . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a club of great powers could emerge out of the g20 and it is difficult for the emerging powers to advance their interests within the current institutions - such as the imf and world bank - dominated by established powers , flemes said .
as a consequence , informal venues such as the g20 are becoming more important .
a club of great powers could emerge out of the g20 , and these great powers may then negotiate their interests among each other , he continued .
this development would indicate that realpolitik , the pragmatic emphasis on maintaining a stable balance of power , has trumped liberal norms in global politics .
but carothers believes that promoting these liberal norms is in fact rooted in pragmatism , since no country has become wealthy and industrialized without democratizing , and that powers like russia and china will ultimately have to go down that path toward democracy . " these international norms do reflect a more global approach to economy and society , " he said .

as a consequence , the united states and the european union began to construct a world order based on liberal vales . they promoted a doctrine of free trade , democracy and human rights .
those nations that accepted - or at least did not challenge -these " international norms " were integrated into a growing network of economic globalization .
this network was governed by institutions such as the world trade organization , the international monetary fund and the world bank . meanwhile , leaders who actively undermined the liberal rules of the game - such as slobodan milosevic and saddam hussein - faced crippling sanctions and devastating airstrikes .
integration and confrontation became two sides of the same coin .
but in the new millennium a more diverse group of countries is sharing world power , which has made it difficult to form a consensus around a common global agenda .
as brazil , russia , india and china - often referred to as the brics - confidently pursue their own national interests , the liberal international order is buckling .
political paralysis in the west nearly a decade ago , developed and developing nations agreed in doha , qatar to a round of multilateral negotiations that would reduce poverty through trade liberalization .
the goal was to eliminate economic barriers that prevented poorer countries from sharing in the benefits of globalization .
although political leaders in the us and eu had traditionally championed free trade , they now found it politically difficult to turn the doha round into a final settlement .
the business community felt they were not getting enough , while labor unions believed an agreement would outsource more jobs to the developing world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the doha round failed , sparking criticism of the wto in the developing world meanwhile , the brics - which once opposed liberalization as an instrument of imperialism - now championed free trade .
the failure of state socialism and protectionism had pushed brazil , russia , india and china toward a model of export-led growth that depended on an open global economy .
" there 's an irony here , " jagdish bhagwati , an expert on international trade with the council on foreign relations and a professor at columbia university in new york , told deutsche welle .
" if you look at what leaders are doing - obama is probably the worst but sarkozy comes pretty close - the leadership itself seems to be hamstrung and paralyzed in an inability to celebrate the openness of markets . "
as the brics profited from openness , a growing number of voices in the us and eu began to view trade as a zero-sum game .
as a result , the doha round collapsed .
" it just means that we are not pushing forward , " bhagwati said .
" the real question during a time of recession is not moving backwards into additional protectionism . "
emerging powers take initiative in response to the doha round 's collapse and the onset of the economic crisis , the brics began to strengthen their relations among one another .
yet political differences between these countries have prevented them from forging a true alliance .
the democratic nations of india , brazil as well as south africa have established their own dialogue .
in turn , the autocratic regimes of russia and china have separately signed a series of agreements deepening what they call a " strategic partnership of cooperation . "
however , these nations do find common ground in their skepticism of the us and the eu 's international agenda .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and the eu have often spread their values in the developing world through force the us and the eu made human rights and democracy a central part of their foreign policies , jointly applying military force to spread these liberal norms in the balkans and afghanistan .
and the us unilaterally imposed these norms in iraq .
in contrast , the brics emphasize national sovereignty and non-intervention as a means to avoid unnecessary confrontation as they further their economic development . " there is a strong old north-south mindset in the world and that ties to a set of neutral countries in opposition to western imperialism , " thomas carothers , an expert on democracy and the rule of law with the carnegie endowment for international peace , told deutsche welle .
" as we move out of that mindset we could go in two directions , " carothers continued .
" they -lsb- brics -rsb- could begin to see the value of an international community based on norms ; or they could stick with the feeling of being pushed around by larger powers and have an emphasis on sovereignty . "
the return of realpolitik the us and the eu remain critically important in world politics , but their relative power is declining .
in response , they may be forced to make political compromises in order to coopt the new powers .
the global agenda rooted in democracy and human rights could give way to a more pragmatic approach .
finding common ground between emerging and established powers would mean focusing on economic interests instead of liberal norms .
" they -lsb- emerging powers -rsb- do n't choose their partners based on human rights or democracy , " daniel flemes , an expert on regional powers and the new world order with the german institute for global and area studies , told deutsche welle .
" their foreign policies are oriented toward their interests . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a club of great powers could emerge out of the g20 and it is difficult for the emerging powers to advance their interests within the current institutions - such as the imf and world bank - dominated by established powers , flemes said .
as a consequence , informal venues such as the g20 are becoming more important .
a club of great powers could emerge out of the g20 , and these great powers may then negotiate their interests among each other , he continued .
this development would indicate that realpolitik , the pragmatic emphasis on maintaining a stable balance of power , has trumped liberal norms in global politics .
but carothers believes that promoting these liberal norms is in fact rooted in pragmatism , since no country has become wealthy and industrialized without democratizing , and that powers like russia and china will ultimately have to go down that path toward democracy . " these international norms do reflect a more global approach to economy and society , " he said .

bayern needs points if they hope to free themselves of the rut that has them currently sitting in ninth place in the table .
" hamburg had the big chances , " said bayern captain philipp lahm , " so there are times when you have to be satisfied with one point . "
bayern have been deeply cut by a swathe of injuries this season and played without several key players friday , including mark van bommel , daniel van buyten and miroslav klose .
' better than nothing ' fourth-place hamburg could have used a win to gain ground on bayer leverkusen .
the two teams are currently even at 15 points with leverkusen ahead on goals , but leverkusen could widen the gap again on sunday with a win against mainz .
the match was relatively even , although hamburg did have better chances to score .
that included a very near-miss by jonathan pitroipa , who only had bayern keeper joerg butt to beat but bounced his shot off the right post .
" pitroipa should have scored , " hamburg coach armin veh said after the game .
" -lrb- but -rrb- at least we kept a clean sheet . "
" better one point against bayern than none , " added hamburg 's captain heiko westermann .

unions have called for more strike action . the french senate has voted through president nicolas sarkozy 's unpopular reform of the country 's pension system , which would raise the minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 and the maximum age for a full pension from 65 to 67 .
the bill has already been passed by the national assembly , but still needs to be approved by a parliamentary committee , a process that is likely to be completed next wednesday .
" the day will come when former opponents will thank the president and the government ... for acting responsibly , " labor minister eric woerth said just before the upper house approved the bill by 177 votes to 153 .
ongoing strike action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nationwide strikes have left nearly a quarter of petrol stations dry earlier on friday , french authorities forced the end of a blockade of the grandpuits oil refinery near paris , as blockades and an 11-day strike at refineries left nearly a quarter of all gas stations dry .
the police moved in on the refinery near dawn after an emergency decree ordered the strikers back to work .
unions said three people were injured in the operation .
after a meeting with oil industry executives , prime minister francois fillon said it would take " several more days " for fuel supplies to return to normal .
the head of the body which represents the national petroleum industry said the industry was struggling to import fuel to make up for the lack of supply .
transport minister jean-louis borloo told reporters that about one in five gas stations had run out of fuel , down from more than a quarter on wednesday .
the government said it had no plans to start rationing fuel , but that it had ordered oil companies to pool their resources to ensure the country was supplied with gas , particularly for this weekend when national school vacations begin .

" we ca n't be the only country in the world where , when there 's a reform , a minority wants to block everyone else .

an opinion poll published by the bva institute and broadcast by canal plus television on friday found that most french voters support the strikes - 69 percent to 29 percent - but 52 percent oppose the blockage of refineries .
the french government insists that the reform is necessary to close a widening budget gap in national pension funds .
unions and political opponents say it unfairly penalizes workers for the mistakes of the global financial system .

match day nine represents the start of the second quarter of the bundesliga season , which means we 've entered what is officially termed the “ run-up to christmas ” - both in footballing and commercial terms . you may not know it , but we 're on the home straight towards christmas . this means two important things - kicking a ball and spending more money - will suddenly be jostling for attention in the brains of germany 's professional footballers . that may prove too heavy a mental burden , so on-field concentration could easily slip .
but given the form of the dw predictors over the last two weeks -lrb- 10 points from a possible 54 -rrb- , one more random factor can probably only help .
friday , october 22 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friday 's north-south derby is a bundesliga classic hamburg-bayern as the team that stopped the juggernaut that was mainz last week with a 1-0 away win , hamburg might be confident they can take on a bigger team of reds in what is known as the north-south derby .
but they are facing a resurgent bayern munich , who are clearly growing in confidence after a dreadful start , and who will be galvanized by the return of their famous dusel -lrb- luck -rrb- in their win over cfr cluj in the champions league .
moreover , bayern coach louis van gaal has made this a do-or-die game for his team 's championship hopes .
“ we ca n't drop many more points .
we have to win in hamburg , ” he told reporters after the cluj game .
the dutchman is basically baiting fate , and call me a fool , but i think fate will bite - gomez to get a deflected winner in injury time .
bayern 2-1 saturday , october 23 frankfurt-schalke schalke will also have an extra spring in their stride this weekend after a successful excursion in the champions league .
they watched israeli champions hapoel fold against the onslaught by the royal blues ’ star signing raul .
the spanish veteran scored two - one more than he has scored all season in the bundesliga - and there are signs that felix magath 's carefully constructed and thoroughly oiled schalke machine is finally beginning to find its gears .
that said , frankfurt are on a run of three straight wins , and greek forward theofanis gekas is on fire just now - he became the joint top scorer in the league during last week 's 3-0 drubbing of kaiserslautern .
hard not to see both sides scoring .
draw 2-2 moenchengladbach-werder bremen unlike bayern and schalke , werder ’ s champions league match this week was not a rousing home win , but a tough 1-1 draw away to the dutch champions fc twente .
they have n't kept a clean sheet in the league since match day three , and they lost their first choice goalkeeper tim wiese to a knee injury in the aforementioned melee in the netherlands .
their second-choice goalkeeper is also out , so they are relying on 21-year-old sebastian mielitz between the sticks , a rookie with two bundesliga games and half of wednesday 's european match to his name .
it 's a godsend , then , that werder are facing the only team in the bundesliga with a worse defensive record .
moenchengladbach are shipping an average of nearly three goals a game at the moment , are toiling one point above the relegation zone , and are without eight first-team players for this match .
you 'd have to expect the likes of claudio pizarro , aaron hunt and hugo almeida to do some damage .
werder bremen 4-1 freiburg-kaiserslautern freiburg might have lost away to werder last week , but it was a defiant loss , and they were inches away from snatching a draw in the closing minutes at the weserstadion .
for no discernable reason , the modest team from the far south-western corner of the country is riding around in the top half of the table above the likes of bayern , werder and wolfsburg .
kaiserslautern , meanwhile , are coming to town on the back of four morale-sapping losses to frankfurt -lrb- 0-3 -rrb- , hamburg -lrb- 1-2 -rrb- , hanover -lrb- 0-1 -rrb- and the carnage of a trip to dortmund -lrb- 0-5 -rrb- .
but freiburg are blinking nervously in the heady heights , and kaiserslautern could well figure their luck must be about to turn soon .
plus the last time they played a southern team they tonked bayern 2-0 .
draw 1-1 hanover-cologne bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's keeper is in a huff ... but that 's just one worry among many a blistering start to the season for hanover -lrb- 13 points from six games -rrb- came to a thudding end two games ago when they ran into st. pauli .
that 1-0 loss , coupled with the international break that followed , apparently sapped their momentum .
the club then crashed headlong into bayern and mario gomez last week - who scored a brilliant hat-trick .
but if hanover were looking for a confidence boosting opponent , they could hardly have asked for anyone better than cologne , to whom the word “ crisis ” has been attached for weeks .
the pram belonging to resident star lukas podolski is rapidly running out of rattles , and handbags were drawn when colombian keeper faryd mondragon swanned off to the us to play for colombia without permission .
cologne - second from bottom - are still waiting for their second win of the season , but it 's unlikely to come this weekend .
hanover 1-0 nuremberg-wolfsburg wolfsburg are an unpredictable bunch this time round .
their results chart looks like a stock market in a volatile boom-bust economy : three straight defeats were followed by three straight victories , and then last week 's thriller against leverkusen saw them do it all in microcosm - they gave up a 2-0 lead to lose 3-2 in the space of 10 minutes .
but despite this , it 's clear that new manager steve mcclaren is beginning to get his killer trio of edin dzeko , diego and grafite into a groove .
but modest nuremberg are not an easy team to crack , at least for a bottom half side .
but despite last week 's madness , the momentum seems to be with wolfsburg , and there should be more space between the teams than a single place .
wolfsburg 2-1 sunday , october 24 dortmund-hoffenheim the sunday matches all feature germany 's europa league representatives , who played thursday evening , but dortmund did not have to travel , so weariness should not be a factor for the league leaders .
this is good news , because this match should be a cracker .
it 's first against fourth , and dortmund are currently rampaging through the league like they used to back in the day , i.e. the mid-90s .
it 's a heartening sight for those who can remember when bayern had a proper rival , and they are up against - in theory - one of the most exciting new forces in german football in hoffenheim .
while they were undone last year by a thin squad , coach ralf rangnick ’ s men are looking a more robust force this time round .
but despite good results , their recent draw against struggling cologne shows how fallible they are .
dortmund 2-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like the good old days - dortmund on the rampage leverkusen-mainz this one should also be a great game , with second-placed mainz away to third-placed leverkusen .
mainz 's run of seven straight wins came to an abrupt halt last week against hamburg , so it will be interesting to see if the unfancied club can get the ball rolling again .
everyone is expecting this bunch of cheeky young jack-rabbits to finally wake up and realize it was all a big misunderstanding , and they should be hacking through years of mid-table obscurity like honest , decent folk .
so will they dare to dream ?
leverkusen , meanwhile , are exactly the kind of grizzled , seen-it-all veterans who will know how to sap the will of these idealistic young upstarts .
it 's a bit like morgan freeman and brad pitt in seven .
hopefully with a bit less torture .
leverkusen 2-1 stuttgart-st.pauli it would take some kind of devastating natural disaster for stuttgart 's season to get much worse , but last week 's 2-2 draw against schalke - orchestrated by nubile new manager jens keller - was a definite improvement .
coupled with that , their very handy 1-0 win over getafe in the europa league on thursday will have further boosted confidence .
when you have four points from eight games , i guess the only way is up .
they are facing a st. pauli side who may be all of twelve places above them , but have not exactly been the model of consistency in the last few match days .
but all things being equal , st. pauli did just record a very impressive 3-2 win over nuremberg , and will expect to beat stuttgart , even if it does take sheer will .

they have n't kept a clean sheet in the league since match day three , and they lost their first choice goalkeeper tim wiese to a knee injury in the aforementioned melee in the netherlands .
their second-choice goalkeeper is also out , so they are relying on 21-year-old sebastian mielitz between the sticks , a rookie with two bundesliga games and half of wednesday 's european match to his name .
it 's a godsend , then , that werder are facing the only team in the bundesliga with a worse defensive record .
moenchengladbach are shipping an average of nearly three goals a game at the moment , are toiling one point above the relegation zone , and are without eight first-team players for this match .
you 'd have to expect the likes of claudio pizarro , aaron hunt and hugo almeida to do some damage .
werder bremen 4-1 freiburg-kaiserslautern freiburg might have lost away to werder last week , but it was a defiant loss , and they were inches away from snatching a draw in the closing minutes at the weserstadion .
for no discernable reason , the modest team from the far south-western corner of the country is riding around in the top half of the table above the likes of bayern , werder and wolfsburg .
kaiserslautern , meanwhile , are coming to town on the back of four morale-sapping losses to frankfurt -lrb- 0-3 -rrb- , hamburg -lrb- 1-2 -rrb- , hanover -lrb- 0-1 -rrb- and the carnage of a trip to dortmund -lrb- 0-5 -rrb- .
but freiburg are blinking nervously in the heady heights , and kaiserslautern could well figure their luck must be about to turn soon .
plus the last time they played a southern team they tonked bayern 2-0 .
draw 1-1 hanover-cologne bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's keeper is in a huff ... but that 's just one worry among many a blistering start to the season for hanover -lrb- 13 points from six games -rrb- came to a thudding end two games ago when they ran into st. pauli .
that 1-0 loss , coupled with the international break that followed , apparently sapped their momentum .
the club then crashed headlong into bayern and mario gomez last week - who scored a brilliant hat-trick .
but if hanover were looking for a confidence boosting opponent , they could hardly have asked for anyone better than cologne , to whom the word “ crisis ” has been attached for weeks .
the pram belonging to resident star lukas podolski is rapidly running out of rattles , and handbags were drawn when colombian keeper faryd mondragon swanned off to the us to play for colombia without permission .
cologne - second from bottom - are still waiting for their second win of the season , but it 's unlikely to come this weekend .
hanover 1-0 nuremberg-wolfsburg wolfsburg are an unpredictable bunch this time round .
their results chart looks like a stock market in a volatile boom-bust economy : three straight defeats were followed by three straight victories , and then last week 's thriller against leverkusen saw them do it all in microcosm - they gave up a 2-0 lead to lose 3-2 in the space of 10 minutes .
but despite this , it 's clear that new manager steve mcclaren is beginning to get his killer trio of edin dzeko , diego and grafite into a groove .
but modest nuremberg are not an easy team to crack , at least for a bottom half side .
but despite last week 's madness , the momentum seems to be with wolfsburg , and there should be more space between the teams than a single place .
wolfsburg 2-1 sunday , october 24 dortmund-hoffenheim the sunday matches all feature germany 's europa league representatives , who played thursday evening , but dortmund did not have to travel , so weariness should not be a factor for the league leaders .
this is good news , because this match should be a cracker .
it 's first against fourth , and dortmund are currently rampaging through the league like they used to back in the day , i.e. the mid-90s .
it 's a heartening sight for those who can remember when bayern had a proper rival , and they are up against - in theory - one of the most exciting new forces in german football in hoffenheim .
while they were undone last year by a thin squad , coach ralf rangnick ’ s men are looking a more robust force this time round .
but despite good results , their recent draw against struggling cologne shows how fallible they are .
dortmund 2-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like the good old days - dortmund on the rampage leverkusen-mainz this one should also be a great game , with second-placed mainz away to third-placed leverkusen .
mainz 's run of seven straight wins came to an abrupt halt last week against hamburg , so it will be interesting to see if the unfancied club can get the ball rolling again .
everyone is expecting this bunch of cheeky young jack-rabbits to finally wake up and realize it was all a big misunderstanding , and they should be hacking through years of mid-table obscurity like honest , decent folk .
so will they dare to dream ?
leverkusen , meanwhile , are exactly the kind of grizzled , seen-it-all veterans who will know how to sap the will of these idealistic young upstarts .
it 's a bit like morgan freeman and brad pitt in seven .
hopefully with a bit less torture .
leverkusen 2-1 stuttgart-st.pauli it would take some kind of devastating natural disaster for stuttgart 's season to get much worse , but last week 's 2-2 draw against schalke - orchestrated by nubile new manager jens keller - was a definite improvement .
coupled with that , their very handy 1-0 win over getafe in the europa league on thursday will have further boosted confidence .
when you have four points from eight games , i guess the only way is up .
they are facing a st. pauli side who may be all of twelve places above them , but have not exactly been the model of consistency in the last few match days .
but all things being equal , st. pauli did just record a very impressive 3-2 win over nuremberg , and will expect to beat stuttgart , even if it does take sheer will .

match day nine represents the start of the second quarter of the bundesliga season , which means we 've entered what is officially termed the “ run-up to christmas ” - both in footballing and commercial terms . you may not know it , but we 're on the home straight towards christmas . this means two important things - kicking a ball and spending more money - will suddenly be jostling for attention in the brains of germany 's professional footballers . that may prove too heavy a mental burden , so on-field concentration could easily slip .
but given the form of the dw predictors over the last two weeks -lrb- 10 points from a possible 54 -rrb- , one more random factor can probably only help .
friday , october 22 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friday 's north-south derby is a bundesliga classic hamburg-bayern as the team that stopped the juggernaut that was mainz last week with a 1-0 away win , hamburg might be confident they can take on a bigger team of reds in what is known as the north-south derby .
but they are facing a resurgent bayern munich , who are clearly growing in confidence after a dreadful start , and who will be galvanized by the return of their famous dusel -lrb- luck -rrb- in their win over cfr cluj in the champions league .
moreover , bayern coach louis van gaal has made this a do-or-die game for his team 's championship hopes .
“ we ca n't drop many more points .
we have to win in hamburg , ” he told reporters after the cluj game .
the dutchman is basically baiting fate , and call me a fool , but i think fate will bite - gomez to get a deflected winner in injury time .
bayern 2-1 saturday , october 23 frankfurt-schalke schalke will also have an extra spring in their stride this weekend after a successful excursion in the champions league .
they watched israeli champions hapoel fold against the onslaught by the royal blues ’ star signing raul .
the spanish veteran scored two - one more than he has scored all season in the bundesliga - and there are signs that felix magath 's carefully constructed and thoroughly oiled schalke machine is finally beginning to find its gears .
that said , frankfurt are on a run of three straight wins , and greek forward theofanis gekas is on fire just now - he became the joint top scorer in the league during last week 's 3-0 drubbing of kaiserslautern .

he advocated in a speech on thursday tougher eurozone regulations , including sanctions to punish high deficits . the european union will be put to the test unless it tightens the measures in its stability and growth pact , according to german foreign minister guido westerwelle .
westerwelle said in a keynote speech to the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- in berlin on thursday that he was worried about europe , " because we will lose the people 's support if we simply proceed with our agenda after this crisis . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy agreed to fight against automatically imposed sanctions in renewed criticism of an agreement between chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy to drop demands for automatic sanctions on countries that breach the eurozone 's deficit ceiling , westerwelle urged political cooperation across europe to toughen the growth and stability pact .
" it is crucial that sanctions are not subjected to political opportunism , " westerwelle said .
merkel 's decision seemed to take westerwelle and other members of the governing coalition by surprise , but she insisted on thursday that she and westerwelle were on the same page regarding the proposal .
" we are completely in agreement , " merkel said , " that we should get a clear mandate for devising treaty changes by early next year , so these can be implemented by individual states by 2013 . " previously , merkel had supported the idea of more automatic sanctions that would take politics out of the equation , and her change of tune is seen by some as caving in to pressure from france . ' more sanctions , please ' westerwelle also warned against isolationist politics within the eu 's 27 member nations , saying that another financial crisis could ruin the fruits of decades of european politics .
" that 's why it 's so important that we act consistently and decisively in the interest of europe 's inner cohesion , " he said .
" a hard euro ca n't tolerate soft rules . "
westerwelle referred to the 22 proceedings brought against eu member states for acute deficits in the past few years .
he said sanctions had not been applied in a single one of these cases .
the foreign minister called for a mechanism to place sanctions on countries with bulging deficits , including bigger eu states .
the eurozone , westerwelle said , needed such a system to be consistent and ensure impartiality .
" it makes a big practical difference if sanctions are passed by a two-thirds majority , or blocked by a two-thirds majority , " he said .
westerwelle also countered those who might express discouragement with the european common currency , stressing that re-nationalization was not an option in the wake of the greek debt crisis .

christian wulff and his turkish counterpart abdullah gul together laid the foundation stone for a new german-turkish university in istanbul .
the project will combine the strength of both of the two countries systems of higher education , president wulff said . around 5,000 students are to begin studies at the university next year .
german universities are to provide professors and teachers and the courses are to be taught mainly in german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff visited the blue mosque in istanbul at the close of his visit , wulff described the five days as " extremely positive . "
" i have felt at every stage the trust felt towards germany , " he said on friday .
he said key issues had been discussed openly , and there had been agreement on all the essential political questions .
turkey , he said , was on its way to becoming a successful economy .
religion and integration topping the agenda wulff 's visit was the first by a german president to turkey in more than a decade , and came at a time of heightened tension in germany itself over the place of its ethnic minorities , of which turks form the largest group .
wulff also became the first german head of state to address the turkish parliament .
in his speech on tuesday , the president explicitly addressed the problem of the integration of turkish immigrants in german .
" our fellow citizens of turkish origin are welcome in our country , and belong to our country , " he said .

after the first day of talks , both sides claimed their positions had been strengthened . veteran conservative politician heiner geissler , who is leading the mediation talks on the controversial rail project stuttgart 21 , said the first round was a good start for " an experiment in democracy , " calling the discussions fair and to the point .
" i did n't get the impression that either party was just trying to score points , " he said after six and a half hours of talks .
it was the first time that mediation talks of this nature have been shown live on television and on the internet .
geissler said the debate was very technical , but that both parties had made an effort to avoid too much jargon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mediators hope the talks will help clarify the project 's pros and cons stefan mappus , the premier of the southern state of baden-wuerttemberg , where stuttgart is located , said it was a " good day for democracy " and that the talks were aimed at easing fears among the local population about the perceived disadvantages of a planned new underground train station .
controversial project the project , which has been the subject of protracted , sometimes violent protests , involves demolishing most of stuttgart 's old train station and replacing it with a new underground facility , with the addition of a new line creating a fast connection to the nearby city of ulm .
deutsche bahn board member volker kefer argued that the state needs a modern rail hub to be able to compete with airlines and that stuttgart 21 was the right way to do it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters say a modern underground station is an economic necessity but opponents insist that modernizing the existing station is the better option .
" we think your project is a step backwards , not forwards , " the mayor of nearby tuebingen , boris palmer told kefer on friday .
palmer also called on mappus to clear the way for a referendum on the project .
while deutsche bahn argues that the new underground station will boost passenger numbers by two million , critics say the figures do not add up and costs are likely to escalate .
the mediation talks are to continue every friday until dec .
3 .
more demonstrations are planned for saturday , when up to 40,000 people are expected in stuttgart to demonstrate both for and against the project .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de oil industry -pipe- 22.10.2010 six months on , gulf of mexico could see new drilling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the moratorium lifted , companies can apply for new drill permits the us government lifted a moratorium on deepwater drilling in the gulf of mexico earlier this month .
now , six months after april 's massive oil spill , one company is planning to seek permits for new projects in the area . the gulf of mexico is seeing renewed interest as a drilling destination : on thursday , us oil giant chevron said it intended to apply for permission in the coming days to develop fresh projects there .
a spokesman for the company said it plans to invest $ 7.5 billion in a pair of new fields in waters off the coast of louisiana .
the move would make chevron among the first to seek permits for new drilling projects in the gulf of mexico , half a year after the deepwater horizon oil rig exploded on april 20 .
chevron could be among the first oil companies to exploit the end of a drilling moratorium , introduced by the obama administration in may when it faced public pressure for reacting to slowly to the environmental crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an explosion occurred on the deepwater horizon oil rig on april 20 competing pressures the drilling freeze applied to both new and current projects but was lifted on october 13 – several weeks before it was set to expire – amid pressure from oil companies and state governments concerned about productivity and jobs .
according to a government report , up to 12,000 jobs were lost due to the moratorium , a bitter pill to swallow as the country struggles with persistent high unemployment in a year of midterm elections .
us environmental advocacy groups have condemned the end of the moratorium , saying the risks of drilling remain too high .
six months after the deepwater horizon oil rig exploded – setting off the worst environmental disaster in us history and leaving 11 people dead – more than 16,000 specialists and volunteers are still working to cleanup the spill 's environmental effects .
british energy giant bp spent months trying to stop oil from leaking into the gulf – launching multiple failed " kill " operations to plug the blown-out wellhead .
they only succeeded in early august , when engineers filled the well with heavy drilling mud and cement , after millions of liters of oil had already leaked into the gulf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oil spill was the worst environmental disaster in us history rules and regulations oil and gas drilling projects are now subject to stricter regulations .
us interior secretary ken salazar said in a telephone press conference that they are meant to ensure safe energy generation .
" we are building the gold standard for offshore oil and gas regulation , " he said . in future , corporations will be required to prove that their oil rigs are equipped with working cut-off valves .
in addition , they must conform to specific construction standards .
oil rig workers will also be subject to special safety trainings .
regulators – who came in for heavy criticism for their coziness with the industry they were supposed to monitor – have been reformed .
the former minerals management service has been changed to the bureau of ocean energy management , and the agency has been subject to new ethics guidelines since late august .

president wulff urges turks to ' actively integrate ' in germany immigrants in any country should adopt their new homeland 's way of life .
fluency in the language of the new country is an absolute must and should be a condition of entry .
even in my small country , down at the bottom of the world , we are headed in the direction of those at the top of the world ... better for people stay in their own country and fix the problems there than to travel the world and contribute to the downfall of every country they inhabit . - kay , new zealand the media keeps misinterpreting what chancellor merkel has said concerning multiculturalism .
she said that the " approach " taken in germany toward multiculturalism had failed , not multiculturalism itself .
to say multiculturalism has failed is a very unwise , untrue , and discouraging message to send out into the global community .
perhaps germany , as well as many other nations , needs to re-evaluate assimilation and acculturation and how diverse groups of people may achieve common national and international goals without losing personal identity and even celebrating it at times . - darrell , us it is my belief that if one chooses to take resources from a foreign society , then the one taking should give back more by enforcing the traditions and resources of the society which they joined .
after all , there is a reason for having left one 's own society and country .
therefore to moving oneself to another country , then insisting that the new location should serve the new inhabitants by changing , is counter productive .
germany is germany , and in present successful due to germany 's past , present and very bright future . - dan , us bravo president wulff .
immigrants should respect their adopted countries ' laws and customs and adapt to them .
if the immigrant does not wish to accept the laws then it is apparent they made a bad decision when they chose to immigrate . - celine , us compiled by stuart tiffen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de china -pipe- 22.10.2010 china ’ s tight grip on democratic tendencies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bribery is a common practice in china : such as buying votes at elections china ’ s communist party has allowed grassroots elections for many years .
but bribery is widespread .
the electoral system still has many pitfalls and china has not been too eager to incorporate more democratic elements . since 1986 villagers in china have been allowed to vote every three years .
they can elect the party chief of their village .
but only 20 percent of such elections are competitive .
often there is only one candidate , in some cases simply chosen by the communist party .
in many cases such elections are manipulated with votes being bought .
prosecutors in the southern chinese province of hainan found that bribes have gone up in recent years .
candidates used to pay villagers the equivalent of 1.50 us dollar for their support at the ballot box .
today the price has gone up to 177 dollars .
money for votes in villages where there are substantial assets such as land for leasing and other business opportunities , candidates are most likely to buy votes , says joseph cheng , chair professor of political science at the city university of hong kong .
" some village entrepreneurs like to get the position of the village chief for reasons of prestige or for the purpose of building networks .
so they are willing to spend money to secure their electoral position , " he explains .
civil society reports of bribery and other abuse in democratic processes at grassroots level can be seen regularly in the official chinese media .
it helps to convey the impression that democracy is a flawed concept .
the lack of a civil society in china is also a reason why people do not develop a feeling for democratic procedures , experts say .
but china is developing quickly , according to thomas heberer from duisburg university .
call for democratic reforms " one can now plan one 's life as one likes and not be directed by the state or the party any more .
this is the moment when individual autonomy gains in strength .
this is a precondition for building citizens .
and citizens are a precondition for establishing a civil society , " says heberer .
recently voices have been calling for democratic reform within the communist party , a demand reiterated by premier wen jiabao .
but his remarks have not been echoed by other leaders .
and the statements have not been reported by official state media .
keeping control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grassroots elections were introduced in the late 1980s .
china 's leaders are not elected by the people china ’ s leadership wants to contain democratic developments within the country .
they don ’ t want to implement anything that may get out of control . village elections have not advanced to higher levels because at town and township level the leaders are from the party cadres .
but if they are elected by the people , this will be in direct contradiction to the basic principle that the party controls the cadres .
still , there is some hope .
china ’ s future leaders are better educated and have more exposure to the western world .
some experts think that china ’ s potential future president xi jinping might introduce more democratic reforms after coming to power .
however , his father was a high ranking party official who condemned the pro-democracy crackdown in tiananmen square .
so far , says joseph cheng , xi jinping has not given any indication that he may be a great reformer .

" we expect that within 10 days , the situation in terzigno can return to normal , " he told a news conference in rome after an emergency meeting .
the government 's plans to build a new dump in terzigno , which is located 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- southeast of naples in vesuvius national park , have for years met with fierce opposition by locals , who have repeatedly blocked access to the existing waste disposal site there .

although they are only preliminary results , they clearly show who the winners and losers are .
ratbil shamel has this opinion piece : now the secret , which never was one , is out .
the wolesi jirga , afghanistan ’ s lower house , will continue to be run by the country ’ s warlords over the next five years .
former mujahedin leaders and their allies have won in almost all the constituencies .
even in kabul , a city which at the beginning of the 1990s was almost completely destroyed by the battles between the various mujahedin groupings , the picture is the same .
hardly anybody in afghanistan is surprised by the results .
many had said even before the elections took place that they did not have any faith in afghanistan 's supposedly ' independent ' election commission -lrb- iec -rrb- .
and the fact that certain sections of the afghan population still went to vote has another explanation - they wanted to show that they , at least , take democracy seriously .
they went to the polls because they wanted to tell the world : " we afghans reject war , the taliban and extremism " .
many afghans perhaps don ’ t really know what democracy means or how a parliament functions but one thing that they know for sure is that a peaceful struggle is better than war .
and the people in afghanistan have been experiencing war for over 30 years .
yet hardly anyone is deluded enough to think that his / her vote makes a difference .
despite three elections in the past nine years , their lives have not improved for the better .
on the contrary .
the taliban are getting stronger and stronger by the day , while the government is becoming weaker .
and they know that the new parliament will not change much .
the erstwhile leaders of the mujahedin will certainly not fight for democratic reforms in the future .
their goal is clear - to strengthen their own position of power in the country .
this power will increase the more the international community pulls out of afghanistan .
some observers believe it will become increasingly difficult for president hamid karzai to govern but the opposite will be true .
karzai has long been counting on the mujahedin card .
his two deputies were chosen out of these ranks last year , despite national and international criticism .
but the real losers of this election , far more than hamid karzai , are the small democratic groupings in afghanistan .
in the past nine years , they have not managed to unite over a few common goals .
instead , they have founded countless political parties that carry no weight in afghanistan ’ s power struggle .
they fielded hundreds of candidates this time but will have to wake up to the fact that they have lost , again .
a further loser in these elections is the international community , especially the west .
democracy , peace and well-being were promised to the people of afghanistan almost a decade ago .
but the taliban and former warlords continue to determine the lives of the afghans .
afghanistan can not be left to the taliban and the warlords again .
the consequences of such a policy are clear to everybody – instability for the region and the world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 22.10.2010 merkel and rasmussen bank on russia for missile defense shield großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen and merkel reiterated support for the missile shield after talks in berlin , nato secretary general rasmussen said there was no alternative to a common european anti-missile shield .
the organization hopes to get russia on board for a common security structure . german chancellor angela merkel and nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen have reiterated their support for a planned european anti-missile defense shield and have expressed hope that russia will drop its objections to the plan .
moscow has in the past been the major stumbling block for the missile defense shield .
russia sees the shield as being at least partly directed against its own military might whereas nato and washington say its sole purpose is to protect europe from possible attack by rogue states such as iran or north korea .
at the nato summit november , the western alliance is hoping to reach agreement on a new strategic plan aimed at giving nato a new focus two decades after the end of the cold war .
in a surprise move , russian president dmitry medvedev earlier this week agreed to attend next month 's talks in portugal .
he indicated moscow was open to dialogue about the shield .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev in talks with sarkozy and merkel agreed to attend the upcoming nato summit " the openness of russia towards discussion over the missile defense system is a good signal , " merkel told reporters in berlin on friday .
but she cautioned that cooperation with russia would be slow in the making .
euro-atlantic security rasmussen added the threat of north korean or iranian missiles would affect russian cities as well as central european ones .
" we simply can not afford becoming the hostage of such an attack , " the nato chief said , saying that only a common defense system - with the inclusion of russia - could provide for a " true euro-atlantic security architecture . "
" there is a broad scope of areas where we could develop a broad scope of practical cooperation with russia , " rasmussen said , pointing not only to missile defense but also to afghanistan and international counter-terrorism .
both merkel and rasmussen however dismissed the idea of russia becoming part of the northern atlantic treaty organization any time soon .
" things have developed well in the last year , but i do n't think we should ask too much of one another , " the german chancellor said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel cautioned that cooperation with russia would be slow in the making rasmussen pointed out that russia had made it clear that joining nato was not an option for moscow and that a strategic partnership was the only realistic option .
" i 've taken note of some statements from moscow that russia would never apply for nato membership , because it was able to take care of security matters on its own , " the nato chief said .
" so , let 's rather pursue what i consider a realistic future , namely a true strategic partnership between nato and russia . "
merkel backs french nuclear arsenal german chancellor merkel also touched on berlin 's shifting position on nuclear defense .
she said nato members should retain nuclear capabilities as long as other , potentially hostile , countries still had nuclear weapons .
previously , german foreign minister guido westerwelle had expressed hopes that the missile shield would allow for a nuclear powers to cut their arsenals .
germany and france had been at odds over the issue earlier this week when french president nicolas sarkozy blatantly dismissed the idea that france would accept any foreign intervention in its nuclear arms policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there still is need for nuclear deterrent , merkel said paris insists on keeping its own nuclear weapons .
merkel ’ s statements after the talks with rasmussen on friday seemed to be aimed directly at concerns of western nuclear powers such as france that the defense shield could pressure them into reducing their arsenals .
reducing nuclear weapons needed to be based on the principle of reciprocity , merkel said .
" as long as there are nuclear weapons in the world , we need to have these capabilities . "
germany itself does not have any nuclear weapons , but has us weapons stationed on its territory .
nato as an international forum on security rasmussen however called for a general broadening of nato 's role , making it more of a political organization as opposed to having a solely military agenda .
" nato has to become a forum for consultation on international security , " he said .
cooperation with other regions of the world ought to be fostered , he added .
countries like china , india and pakistan should work in close dialogue with nato .
such a " cooperative approach " was not intended to be directed against any third countries but would rather work along the lines of united nations policies , rasmussen said .

" let 's be honest about it , the simple truth is , in the aerospace or aeronautic business , none of us , none of the companies that play a role in it , has been growing without any government support , " enders told attendees of an aviation club lunch in london .
" so let 's accept reality . " in addition , the airbus chief said , the fight over subsidies could " accelerate the ascendancy " of aircraft manufacturers from countries such as china , russia and brazil , who are working on releasing new models that could pose direct threats to the current duopoly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ceo enders has been unusually frank about the wto battle " if we talk about china , if we talk about russia or others , does anyone in this room believe that they will step back and say : ' now we understand the wto rules , we will play exactly by the rules ' ? " he said .
" absolutely not , so this is why i call this an absurdity . " long quarrel europe 's airbus and chicago-based boeing , the globe 's first and second largest aircraft manufacturers , have been arguing their cases before the wto since 2004 .
the united states initiated wto dispute procedures then about subsidies to the european aircraft industry .
in response , the eu launched similar proceedings against the us . since then , the trans-atlantic dispute has become bogged down and a swift resolution does not appear to be on the horizon .
in a ruling at the end of june , the wto did fault europe over aid to airbus , saying the company has received subsidies in the form of loans from european governments at below market-rates and without maturity dates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus got a slap on the wrist in a wto ruling this summer however , airbus responded by saying the wto had thrown out several of the other charges brought by the us .
in a counter claim , airbus accused boeing of getting tax breaks from washington as well as money from nasa research funds and argues that much us defense research , funded by the pentagon , is of a dual technology nature and ends up being transferred over to the us civil aviation sector . it is likely that any resolution will only come after years of appeals by both sides . " it 's hard to see how it ends right now , " paul sheridan , an aviation analyst at london-based ascend worldwide , told deutsche welle .
" you could take the wto report about airbus and take boeing 's response and switch the names and it would probably look pretty similar .
they seem to be both accusing each other of the same thing . " new guys in town in the meantime , a group of new players is arriving on the scene , ready to release products that could go head to head with boeing and airbus ' headliners . one big worry in chicago and toulouse , airbus ' home base , is the commercial aircraft corporation of china ltd , or comac .
its 919 model , due to come on the market in 2016 , will directly compete with the airbus a320 and boeing 's 737 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's comac is making airbus and boeing nervous " airbus and boeing should be very worried about comac as a rival to their duopoly " sheridan said .
" comac is state-owned and once the chinese government demonstrates a willingness to do something they usually follow through with it . " other manufacturers , such as canada 's bombardier , brazil 's embraer or russia 's sukhoi are seeking to gain a foothold in the lucrative civil aviation market .
bombardier 's single-aisle plane is due to enter service in 2013 and will also pose a threat to the a320 and 737 . " airbus is saying to boeing that they need to resolve this whole issue , " zafar khan , an aviation expert at sg securities , told deutsche welle .
" while we 're squabbling , enders is saying , those other countries are all subsidizing their industries . " enders said there will probably be five or six commercial aircraft manufacturers in the next 10 years , which means the industry will be faced with new questions about consolidations , partnerships and mergers . subsides and the future subsidies , although disliked by the wto , are almost a given in the aviation industry , experts say .
that is partly due to the expense of producing the product , but also from the benefits governments see from having a successful aerospace player . " when it comes to the aerospace industry , everyone is looking for help from governments because these are major , major undertakings and governments clearly see them as strategically important businesses to have , " khan said . in a related development , negotiators from the european union and other countries , including the us , japan and brazil , are meeting in canada to talk about financing planes in each other 's home markets - and specifically , how much government assistance is allowed . the old rules saw an aviation deal dominated by the us and europe .
the current picture is a lot more complicated with a new batch of players wanting a piece of some very lucrative skies . author : kyle james editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 22.10.2010 european online risk study shows many parents clueless , kids blasé großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children are online at an increasingly young age more than one in eight european children has been upset by online content , a new eu study on internet risks shows .
but the study also showed that most children had had no upsetting experiences with the internet at all . a large majority of those interviewed for the study eu kids online reported no negative experiences at all online , results of the european union study " risks and safety on the internet " showed .
but the study also showed that parents are frequently out of touch with their kids ' virtual lives .
the european union and london school of economics survey was presented thursday at the safer internet forum in luxembourg , and included interviews with thousands of kids across europe from ireland to turkey .
among its findings , the study showed that an average of 12 percent of european children had been bothered or upset by something they experienced online .
these included encountering pornography , sexual or bullying messages , or having their personal data revealed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , just eight percent of kids said they were bothered by an online event indeed , the study showed that 39 percent of those questioned had had encountered a " risky " behavior - such as communicating with new people not met face-to-face , or seeing user-generated content that is potentially harmful , such as hate , self-harm , or drug-taking content .
but only a portion of those asked said they had been upset or bothered by it .
in germany , the percentage of kids who said they were upset by an online experience was , at eight percent , near the lowest end of the scale .
only portugal -lrb- seven percent -rrb- and italy -lrb- six percent -rrb- were lower .
topping the percentages of those most bothered or upset were children in denmark -lrb- 26 percent -rrb- , estonia -lrb- 25 percent -rrb- and romania and sweden -lrb- 21 percent . -rrb-
discrepancy due to ' schoolyard monopoly ' uwe hasebrink , a professor at hamburg 's hans bredow institute for media research , led the german arm of the study .
in an interview with the hamburg abendblatt newspaper , he said that german children " are in less danger " of meeting harmful content because they use the internet " less frequently and with less variety " than kids in other countries .
but markus beckedahl , whose blog netzpolitik.org focuses on the intersection between the internet and german politics , said he found it hard to understand the response gap between countries like denmark and sweden , and germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say parents , not children , should be targets of information campaigns " the study said that countries with high internet usage have more problems , " beckedahl told deutsche welle . " but something like 99 percent of german kids have internet access , and i do n't think they have more more internet usage in denmark . "
one big difference could be the fact that a huge portion of the social-network market for kids and teens in germany takes place on german-only networks like " schuelervz " -lrb- " student directory , " -rrb- german schoolkids ' version of facebook .
" these platforms have a near monopoly on the schoolyard , " he added . " maybe that makes the difference - in germany , the kids are in closed communities , and in other countries they are just on the internet . "
the age factor other poll findings showed children were using the internet at increasingly young ages : an average of seven in sweden and eight in several other northern european countries .
interviewers , who spoke with 23,000 children between the ages of nine and 16 , found it was the youngest children who had the hardest time coping with disturbing material online .
in response to this finding , the study recommended targeting spending and advice at younger age groups to reduce risk and enhance the opportunities of the internet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : younger children had more trouble coping with upsetting experiences parents were frequently unaware of the risks to which their children had been exposed , the study showed .
for example , more than half of parents whose children said they had been bullied online , said they knew nothing of the situation .
moreover , some 41 percent of parents whose child had seen sexual images online said their child had n't , and 61 percent of parents whose children had met offline with an online contact , also said their child had n't .
beckedahl added that parents should ideally " be aware what their kids are doing , and they should talk to them about what kind of experiences they are having on the internet . "
the study also found that while the overwhelming majority of european kids in the study use the internet at home -lrb- 85 percent -rrb- , many children do have private time to use the internet .
48 percent use it in their bedroom , and 31 percent via a mobile phone or other handheld device .
in some countries , like the united kingdom , ireland and sweden , over one in five young people use the internet regularly on a handheld device .
supporting education - for educators beckedahl acknowledged that because of this separation between parents and when their children are online , and their lack of awareness of where their kids go online , it may make things difficult for the parents to keep up . " parents often lack literacy in the social networks their children are using , " he said .
" they have no clue what kind of experiences and user interaction their kids would have , and they do n't really know what can happen . " his suggestion : shifting germany 's ongoing campaigns for media literacy away from children , and toward parents and teachers .
" peer to peer education exists already - children figure out how these platforms work themselves , " he noted . " the problem is , their parents and teachers are n't able to teach them to behave correctly , and prevent risks . "
the study 's authors plan to publish official conclusions and recommendations in november .
but even in thier preliminary findings , they acknowledge that the harmful potential of the internet is counterbalanced - if not easily outweighed - by the medium 's benefits .
plus , they note that a majority of the kids polled said they had not had any harmful experiences with the internet at all .
for his part , beckedahl would like to see the german debate on internet usage lose its negative tone .
" our debate about the internet needs to become more positive , " he said . " it is one of the greatest tools we ever had .
but if we only talk about the risks , people will fear the internet . "

moreover , some 41 percent of parents whose child had seen sexual images online said their child had n't , and 61 percent of parents whose children had met offline with an online contact , also said their child had n't .
beckedahl added that parents should ideally " be aware what their kids are doing , and they should talk to them about what kind of experiences they are having on the internet . "
the study also found that while the overwhelming majority of european kids in the study use the internet at home -lrb- 85 percent -rrb- , many children do have private time to use the internet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 22.10.2010 european online risk study shows many parents clueless , kids blasé großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children are online at an increasingly young age more than one in eight european children has been upset by online content , a new eu study on internet risks shows .
but the study also showed that most children had had no upsetting experiences with the internet at all . a large majority of those interviewed for the study eu kids online reported no negative experiences at all online , results of the european union study " risks and safety on the internet " showed .
but the study also showed that parents are frequently out of touch with their kids ' virtual lives .
the european union and london school of economics survey was presented thursday at the safer internet forum in luxembourg , and included interviews with thousands of kids across europe from ireland to turkey .
among its findings , the study showed that an average of 12 percent of european children had been bothered or upset by something they experienced online .
these included encountering pornography , sexual or bullying messages , or having their personal data revealed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , just eight percent of kids said they were bothered by an online event indeed , the study showed that 39 percent of those questioned had had encountered a " risky " behavior - such as communicating with new people not met face-to-face , or seeing user-generated content that is potentially harmful , such as hate , self-harm , or drug-taking content .
but only a portion of those asked said they had been upset or bothered by it .
in germany , the percentage of kids who said they were upset by an online experience was , at eight percent , near the lowest end of the scale .
only portugal -lrb- seven percent -rrb- and italy -lrb- six percent -rrb- were lower .
topping the percentages of those most bothered or upset were children in denmark -lrb- 26 percent -rrb- , estonia -lrb- 25 percent -rrb- and romania and sweden -lrb- 21 percent . -rrb-
discrepancy due to ' schoolyard monopoly ' uwe hasebrink , a professor at hamburg 's hans bredow institute for media research , led the german arm of the study .
in an interview with the hamburg abendblatt newspaper , he said that german children " are in less danger " of meeting harmful content because they use the internet " less frequently and with less variety " than kids in other countries .
but markus beckedahl , whose blog netzpolitik.org focuses on the intersection between the internet and german politics , said he found it hard to understand the response gap between countries like denmark and sweden , and germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say parents , not children , should be targets of information campaigns " the study said that countries with high internet usage have more problems , " beckedahl told deutsche welle . " but something like 99 percent of german kids have internet access , and i do n't think they have more more internet usage in denmark . "
one big difference could be the fact that a huge portion of the social-network market for kids and teens in germany takes place on german-only networks like " schuelervz " -lrb- " student directory , " -rrb- german schoolkids ' version of facebook .
" these platforms have a near monopoly on the schoolyard , " he added . " maybe that makes the difference - in germany , the kids are in closed communities , and in other countries they are just on the internet . "
the age factor other poll findings showed children were using the internet at increasingly young ages : an average of seven in sweden and eight in several other northern european countries .
interviewers , who spoke with 23,000 children between the ages of nine and 16 , found it was the youngest children who had the hardest time coping with disturbing material online .
in response to this finding , the study recommended targeting spending and advice at younger age groups to reduce risk and enhance the opportunities of the internet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : younger children had more trouble coping with upsetting experiences parents were frequently unaware of the risks to which their children had been exposed , the study showed .
for example , more than half of parents whose children said they had been bullied online , said they knew nothing of the situation .
moreover , some 41 percent of parents whose child had seen sexual images online said their child had n't , and 61 percent of parents whose children had met offline with an online contact , also said their child had n't .

match day nine represents the start of the second quarter of the bundesliga season , which means we 've entered what is officially termed the “ run-up to christmas ” - both in footballing and commercial terms . you may not know it , but we 're on the home straight towards christmas . this means two important things - kicking a ball and spending more money - will suddenly be jostling for attention in the brains of germany 's professional footballers . that may prove too heavy a mental burden , so on-field concentration could easily slip .
but given the form of the dw predictors over the last two weeks -lrb- 10 points from a possible 54 -rrb- , one more random factor can probably only help .
friday , october 22 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friday 's north-south derby is a bundesliga classic hamburg-bayern as the team that stopped the juggernaut that was mainz last week with a 1-0 away win , hamburg might be confident they can take on a bigger team of reds in what is known as the north-south derby .
but they are facing a resurgent bayern munich , who are clearly growing in confidence after a dreadful start , and who will be galvanized by the return of their famous dusel -lrb- luck -rrb- in their win over cfr cluj in the champions league .
moreover , bayern coach louis van gaal has made this a do-or-die game for his team 's championship hopes .
“ we ca n't drop many more points .
we have to win in hamburg , ” he told reporters after the cluj game .
the dutchman is basically baiting fate , and call me a fool , but i think fate will bite - gomez to get a deflected winner in injury time .
bayern 2-1 saturday , october 23 frankfurt-schalke schalke will also have an extra spring in their stride this weekend after a successful excursion in the champions league .
they watched israeli champions hapoel fold against the onslaught by the royal blues ’ star signing raul .
the spanish veteran scored two - one more than he has scored all season in the bundesliga - and there are signs that felix magath 's carefully constructed and thoroughly oiled schalke machine is finally beginning to find its gears .
that said , frankfurt are on a run of three straight wins , and greek forward theofanis gekas is on fire just now - he became the joint top scorer in the league during last week 's 3-0 drubbing of kaiserslautern .
hard not to see both sides scoring .
draw 2-2 moenchengladbach-werder bremen unlike bayern and schalke , werder ’ s champions league match this week was not a rousing home win , but a tough 1-1 draw away to the dutch champions fc twente .
they have n't kept a clean sheet in the league since match day three , and they lost their first choice goalkeeper tim wiese to a knee injury in the aforementioned melee in the netherlands .
their second-choice goalkeeper is also out , so they are relying on 21-year-old sebastian mielitz between the sticks , a rookie with two bundesliga games and half of wednesday 's european match to his name .
it 's a godsend , then , that werder are facing the only team in the bundesliga with a worse defensive record .
moenchengladbach are shipping an average of nearly three goals a game at the moment , are toiling one point above the relegation zone , and are without eight first-team players for this match .
you 'd have to expect the likes of claudio pizarro , aaron hunt and hugo almeida to do some damage .
werder bremen 4-1 freiburg-kaiserslautern freiburg might have lost away to werder last week , but it was a defiant loss , and they were inches away from snatching a draw in the closing minutes at the weserstadion .
for no discernable reason , the modest team from the far south-western corner of the country is riding around in the top half of the table above the likes of bayern , werder and wolfsburg .
kaiserslautern , meanwhile , are coming to town on the back of four morale-sapping losses to frankfurt -lrb- 0-3 -rrb- , hamburg -lrb- 1-2 -rrb- , hanover -lrb- 0-1 -rrb- and the carnage of a trip to dortmund -lrb- 0-5 -rrb- .
but freiburg are blinking nervously in the heady heights , and kaiserslautern could well figure their luck must be about to turn soon .
plus the last time they played a southern team they tonked bayern 2-0 .
draw 1-1 hanover-cologne bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's keeper is in a huff ... but that 's just one worry among many a blistering start to the season for hanover -lrb- 13 points from six games -rrb- came to a thudding end two games ago when they ran into st. pauli .
that 1-0 loss , coupled with the international break that followed , apparently sapped their momentum .
the club then crashed headlong into bayern and mario gomez last week - who scored a brilliant hat-trick .
but if hanover were looking for a confidence boosting opponent , they could hardly have asked for anyone better than cologne , to whom the word “ crisis ” has been attached for weeks .
the pram belonging to resident star lukas podolski is rapidly running out of rattles , and handbags were drawn when colombian keeper faryd mondragon swanned off to the us to play for colombia without permission .
cologne - second from bottom - are still waiting for their second win of the season , but it 's unlikely to come this weekend .
hanover 1-0 nuremberg-wolfsburg wolfsburg are an unpredictable bunch this time round .
their results chart looks like a stock market in a volatile boom-bust economy : three straight defeats were followed by three straight victories , and then last week 's thriller against leverkusen saw them do it all in microcosm - they gave up a 2-0 lead to lose 3-2 in the space of 10 minutes .
but despite this , it 's clear that new manager steve mcclaren is beginning to get his killer trio of edin dzeko , diego and grafite into a groove .
but modest nuremberg are not an easy team to crack , at least for a bottom half side .
but despite last week 's madness , the momentum seems to be with wolfsburg , and there should be more space between the teams than a single place .
wolfsburg 2-1 sunday , october 24 dortmund-hoffenheim the sunday matches all feature germany 's europa league representatives , who played thursday evening , but dortmund did not have to travel , so weariness should not be a factor for the league leaders .
this is good news , because this match should be a cracker .
it 's first against fourth , and dortmund are currently rampaging through the league like they used to back in the day , i.e. the mid-90s .
it 's a heartening sight for those who can remember when bayern had a proper rival , and they are up against - in theory - one of the most exciting new forces in german football in hoffenheim .
while they were undone last year by a thin squad , coach ralf rangnick ’ s men are looking a more robust force this time round .
but despite good results , their recent draw against struggling cologne shows how fallible they are .
dortmund 2-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like the good old days - dortmund on the rampage leverkusen-mainz this one should also be a great game , with second-placed mainz away to third-placed leverkusen .
mainz 's run of seven straight wins came to an abrupt halt last week against hamburg , so it will be interesting to see if the unfancied club can get the ball rolling again .
everyone is expecting this bunch of cheeky young jack-rabbits to finally wake up and realize it was all a big misunderstanding , and they should be hacking through years of mid-table obscurity like honest , decent folk .
so will they dare to dream ?
leverkusen , meanwhile , are exactly the kind of grizzled , seen-it-all veterans who will know how to sap the will of these idealistic young upstarts .
it 's a bit like morgan freeman and brad pitt in seven .
hopefully with a bit less torture .
leverkusen 2-1 stuttgart-st.pauli it would take some kind of devastating natural disaster for stuttgart 's season to get much worse , but last week 's 2-2 draw against schalke - orchestrated by nubile new manager jens keller - was a definite improvement .
coupled with that , their very handy 1-0 win over getafe in the europa league on thursday will have further boosted confidence .
when you have four points from eight games , i guess the only way is up .
they are facing a st. pauli side who may be all of twelve places above them , but have not exactly been the model of consistency in the last few match days .
but all things being equal , st. pauli did just record a very impressive 3-2 win over nuremberg , and will expect to beat stuttgart , even if it does take sheer will .

he advocated in a speech on thursday tougher eurozone regulations , including sanctions to punish high deficits . the european union will be put to the test unless it tightens the measures in its stability and growth pact , according to german foreign minister guido westerwelle .
westerwelle said in a keynote speech to the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- in berlin on thursday that he was worried about europe , " because we will lose the people 's support if we simply proceed with our agenda after this crisis . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy agreed to fight against automatically imposed sanctions in renewed criticism of an agreement between chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy to drop demands for automatic sanctions on countries that breach the eurozone 's deficit ceiling , westerwelle urged political cooperation across europe to toughen the growth and stability pact .
" it is crucial that sanctions are not subjected to political opportunism , " westerwelle said .
merkel 's decision seemed to take westerwelle and other members of the governing coalition by surprise , but she insisted on thursday that she and westerwelle were on the same page regarding the proposal .
" we are completely in agreement , " merkel said , " that we should get a clear mandate for devising treaty changes by early next year , so these can be implemented by individual states by 2013 . " previously , merkel had supported the idea of more automatic sanctions that would take politics out of the equation , and her change of tune is seen by some as caving in to pressure from france . ' more sanctions , please ' westerwelle also warned against isolationist politics within the eu 's 27 member nations , saying that another financial crisis could ruin the fruits of decades of european politics .
" that 's why it 's so important that we act consistently and decisively in the interest of europe 's inner cohesion , " he said .
" a hard euro ca n't tolerate soft rules . "
westerwelle referred to the 22 proceedings brought against eu member states for acute deficits in the past few years .
he said sanctions had not been applied in a single one of these cases .
the foreign minister called for a mechanism to place sanctions on countries with bulging deficits , including bigger eu states .
the eurozone , westerwelle said , needed such a system to be consistent and ensure impartiality .
" it makes a big practical difference if sanctions are passed by a two-thirds majority , or blocked by a two-thirds majority , " he said .
westerwelle also countered those who might express discouragement with the european common currency , stressing that re-nationalization was not an option in the wake of the greek debt crisis .

president wulff urges turks to ' actively integrate ' in germany immigrants in any country should adopt their new homeland 's way of life .
fluency in the language of the new country is an absolute must and should be a condition of entry .
even in my small country , down at the bottom of the world , we are headed in the direction of those at the top of the world ... better for people stay in their own country and fix the problems there than to travel the world and contribute to the downfall of every country they inhabit . - kay , new zealand the media keeps misinterpreting what chancellor merkel has said concerning multiculturalism .
she said that the " approach " taken in germany toward multiculturalism had failed , not multiculturalism itself .
to say multiculturalism has failed is a very unwise , untrue , and discouraging message to send out into the global community .
perhaps germany , as well as many other nations , needs to re-evaluate assimilation and acculturation and how diverse groups of people may achieve common national and international goals without losing personal identity and even celebrating it at times . - darrell , us it is my belief that if one chooses to take resources from a foreign society , then the one taking should give back more by enforcing the traditions and resources of the society which they joined .
after all , there is a reason for having left one 's own society and country .
therefore to moving oneself to another country , then insisting that the new location should serve the new inhabitants by changing , is counter productive .
germany is germany , and in present successful due to germany 's past , present and very bright future . - dan , us bravo president wulff .
immigrants should respect their adopted countries ' laws and customs and adapt to them .
if the immigrant does not wish to accept the laws then it is apparent they made a bad decision when they chose to immigrate . - celine , us compiled by stuart tiffen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de oil industry -pipe- 22.10.2010 six months on , gulf of mexico could see new drilling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the moratorium lifted , companies can apply for new drill permits the us government lifted a moratorium on deepwater drilling in the gulf of mexico earlier this month .
now , six months after april 's massive oil spill , one company is planning to seek permits for new projects in the area . the gulf of mexico is seeing renewed interest as a drilling destination : on thursday , us oil giant chevron said it intended to apply for permission in the coming days to develop fresh projects there .
a spokesman for the company said it plans to invest $ 7.5 billion in a pair of new fields in waters off the coast of louisiana .
the move would make chevron among the first to seek permits for new drilling projects in the gulf of mexico , half a year after the deepwater horizon oil rig exploded on april 20 .
chevron could be among the first oil companies to exploit the end of a drilling moratorium , introduced by the obama administration in may when it faced public pressure for reacting to slowly to the environmental crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an explosion occurred on the deepwater horizon oil rig on april 20 competing pressures the drilling freeze applied to both new and current projects but was lifted on october 13 – several weeks before it was set to expire – amid pressure from oil companies and state governments concerned about productivity and jobs .
according to a government report , up to 12,000 jobs were lost due to the moratorium , a bitter pill to swallow as the country struggles with persistent high unemployment in a year of midterm elections .
us environmental advocacy groups have condemned the end of the moratorium , saying the risks of drilling remain too high .
six months after the deepwater horizon oil rig exploded – setting off the worst environmental disaster in us history and leaving 11 people dead – more than 16,000 specialists and volunteers are still working to cleanup the spill 's environmental effects .
british energy giant bp spent months trying to stop oil from leaking into the gulf – launching multiple failed " kill " operations to plug the blown-out wellhead .
they only succeeded in early august , when engineers filled the well with heavy drilling mud and cement , after millions of liters of oil had already leaked into the gulf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oil spill was the worst environmental disaster in us history rules and regulations oil and gas drilling projects are now subject to stricter regulations .
us interior secretary ken salazar said in a telephone press conference that they are meant to ensure safe energy generation .
" we are building the gold standard for offshore oil and gas regulation , " he said . in future , corporations will be required to prove that their oil rigs are equipped with working cut-off valves .
in addition , they must conform to specific construction standards .
oil rig workers will also be subject to special safety trainings .
regulators – who came in for heavy criticism for their coziness with the industry they were supposed to monitor – have been reformed .
the former minerals management service has been changed to the bureau of ocean energy management , and the agency has been subject to new ethics guidelines since late august .

unions have called for more strike action . the french senate has voted through president nicolas sarkozy 's unpopular reform of the country 's pension system , which would raise the minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 and the maximum age for a full pension from 65 to 67 .
the bill has already been passed by the national assembly , but still needs to be approved by a parliamentary committee , a process that is likely to be completed next wednesday .
" the day will come when former opponents will thank the president and the government ... for acting responsibly , " labor minister eric woerth said just before the upper house approved the bill by 177 votes to 153 .

the police moved in on the refinery near dawn after an emergency decree ordered the strikers back to work .
unions said three people were injured in the operation .
after a meeting with oil industry executives , prime minister francois fillon said it would take " several more days " for fuel supplies to return to normal .
the head of the body which represents the national petroleum industry said the industry was struggling to import fuel to make up for the lack of supply .
transport minister jean-louis borloo told reporters that about one in five gas stations had run out of fuel , down from more than a quarter on wednesday .
the government said it had no plans to start rationing fuel , but that it had ordered oil companies to pool their resources to ensure the country was supplied with gas , particularly for this weekend when national school vacations begin .

" we ca n't be the only country in the world where , when there 's a reform , a minority wants to block everyone else .

he advocated in a speech on thursday tougher eurozone regulations , including sanctions to punish high deficits . the european union will be put to the test unless it tightens the measures in its stability and growth pact , according to german foreign minister guido westerwelle .
westerwelle said in a keynote speech to the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- in berlin on thursday that he was worried about europe , " because we will lose the people 's support if we simply proceed with our agenda after this crisis . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy agreed to fight against automatically imposed sanctions in renewed criticism of an agreement between chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy to drop demands for automatic sanctions on countries that breach the eurozone 's deficit ceiling , westerwelle urged political cooperation across europe to toughen the growth and stability pact .
" it is crucial that sanctions are not subjected to political opportunism , " westerwelle said .
merkel 's decision seemed to take westerwelle and other members of the governing coalition by surprise , but she insisted on thursday that she and westerwelle were on the same page regarding the proposal .
" we are completely in agreement , " merkel said , " that we should get a clear mandate for devising treaty changes by early next year , so these can be implemented by individual states by 2013 . " previously , merkel had supported the idea of more automatic sanctions that would take politics out of the equation , and her change of tune is seen by some as caving in to pressure from france . ' more sanctions , please ' westerwelle also warned against isolationist politics within the eu 's 27 member nations , saying that another financial crisis could ruin the fruits of decades of european politics .
" that 's why it 's so important that we act consistently and decisively in the interest of europe 's inner cohesion , " he said .
" a hard euro ca n't tolerate soft rules . "
westerwelle referred to the 22 proceedings brought against eu member states for acute deficits in the past few years .
he said sanctions had not been applied in a single one of these cases .
the foreign minister called for a mechanism to place sanctions on countries with bulging deficits , including bigger eu states .
the eurozone , westerwelle said , needed such a system to be consistent and ensure impartiality .
" it makes a big practical difference if sanctions are passed by a two-thirds majority , or blocked by a two-thirds majority , " he said .
westerwelle also countered those who might express discouragement with the european common currency , stressing that re-nationalization was not an option in the wake of the greek debt crisis .

but german winemakers hope a unique blend of sugar and acid will make this year 's vintage an exceptional flavor - even if there is less of it . german winemakers harvested about half of the amount of grapes they took out of vineyards last year making it one of the worst yields in decades , according to michael bluemling , a wine grower on the moselle river . " it 's always disappointing when you 're harvesting less fruit than expected , " he told deutsche welle . this october bluemling harvested just 5,000 liters per hectare , less than half of the maximum yield of 12,500 liters .
a cold snap in june stifled what winegrowers call the fruit set - the critical phase when the grapevine 's flowers are fertilized and start growing into grapes . a rainy august also dampened hopes for the 2010 vintage .
grapes - and germans - suffered through twice as much rain and a third less sunshine compared to an average august . the lack of sun kept the grapes from fully developing and all the moisture led the botrytis fungus , which gives the riesling grapes their sweet taste , to develop too quickly .
this destroyed some of the crop , further reducing the harvest . problems for local economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael bluemling was disappointed by the low harvest the low yield could hit the local economy hard . " wine is everything for this area , " bluemling said .
" the romans cultivated wine 2,000 years ago and since then the wine growing is very important for this region . " the state rhineland-palatinate , where bluemling works , produces 90 percent of germany 's export wines and 70 percent of the nation 's total wine production .
some 12,000 businesses in the state are relying on the harvest to produce wine . despite this year 's catastrophic harvest , bluemling said he remains optimistic about how the riesling growers will fare over the next year because of 2009 's bumper harvest . " the wineries still have some wine from the last years and so all the wineries in our region are going to survive the smaller vintage and we hope that the next vintage will be totally different , " bluemling said . but hans rainer schultz from the wine research center in giesenheim is n't so optimistic . " the lower yield is going to be very painful for many wine growers , because some of them only harvested about 50 percent of what they normally harvest , " schultz said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grape fungus developed more quickly in the wet weather and reduced crop yields overall predictions for the german wine harvest show a 23 percent drop on the average yield .
schultz said german winegrowers were n't alone .
vineyards in austria and italy have seen their yields fall as well .
schultz said he think this lower yield will be reflected in wine prices . " within europe , the yield is going to be smaller , and i think on average the prices are going to increase , " he said . unusual taste regarding the taste of this year 's riesling wine , schutz is n't quite as glum .
he said despite a lot of fear about this year 's vintage , winemakers will be able to make a decent wine . " what was very unusual with riesling this year is that we had relatively high levels of sugar but at the same time relatively high levels of acid , " he said .
" i think that 's something that will make the 2010 vintage quite exciting , because this combination only happens very rarely . " while the 2010 vintage may turn out to be unusually good , he added that winemakers will have to wait and see if an increase in prices will be able to compensate winegrowers for their low yields . author : natalia dannenberg editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

president wulff urges turks to ' actively integrate ' in germany immigrants in any country should adopt their new homeland 's way of life .
fluency in the language of the new country is an absolute must and should be a condition of entry .
even in my small country , down at the bottom of the world , we are headed in the direction of those at the top of the world ... better for people stay in their own country and fix the problems there than to travel the world and contribute to the downfall of every country they inhabit . - kay , new zealand the media keeps misinterpreting what chancellor merkel has said concerning multiculturalism .
she said that the " approach " taken in germany toward multiculturalism had failed , not multiculturalism itself .
to say multiculturalism has failed is a very unwise , untrue , and discouraging message to send out into the global community .
perhaps germany , as well as many other nations , needs to re-evaluate assimilation and acculturation and how diverse groups of people may achieve common national and international goals without losing personal identity and even celebrating it at times . - darrell , us it is my belief that if one chooses to take resources from a foreign society , then the one taking should give back more by enforcing the traditions and resources of the society which they joined .
after all , there is a reason for having left one 's own society and country .
therefore to moving oneself to another country , then insisting that the new location should serve the new inhabitants by changing , is counter productive .
germany is germany , and in present successful due to germany 's past , present and very bright future . - dan , us bravo president wulff .
immigrants should respect their adopted countries ' laws and customs and adapt to them .
if the immigrant does not wish to accept the laws then it is apparent they made a bad decision when they chose to immigrate . - celine , us compiled by stuart tiffen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

match day nine represents the start of the second quarter of the bundesliga season , which means we 've entered what is officially termed the “ run-up to christmas ” - both in footballing and commercial terms . you may not know it , but we 're on the home straight towards christmas . this means two important things - kicking a ball and spending more money - will suddenly be jostling for attention in the brains of germany 's professional footballers . that may prove too heavy a mental burden , so on-field concentration could easily slip .
but given the form of the dw predictors over the last two weeks -lrb- 10 points from a possible 54 -rrb- , one more random factor can probably only help .

but they are facing a resurgent bayern munich , who are clearly growing in confidence after a dreadful start , and who will be galvanized by the return of their famous dusel -lrb- luck -rrb- in their win over cfr cluj in the champions league .
moreover , bayern coach louis van gaal has made this a do-or-die game for his team 's championship hopes .
“ we ca n't drop many more points .
we have to win in hamburg , ” he told reporters after the cluj game .
the dutchman is basically baiting fate , and call me a fool , but i think fate will bite - gomez to get a deflected winner in injury time .
bayern 2-1 saturday , october 23 frankfurt-schalke schalke will also have an extra spring in their stride this weekend after a successful excursion in the champions league .
they watched israeli champions hapoel fold against the onslaught by the royal blues ’ star signing raul .
the spanish veteran scored two - one more than he has scored all season in the bundesliga - and there are signs that felix magath 's carefully constructed and thoroughly oiled schalke machine is finally beginning to find its gears .
that said , frankfurt are on a run of three straight wins , and greek forward theofanis gekas is on fire just now - he became the joint top scorer in the league during last week 's 3-0 drubbing of kaiserslautern .
hard not to see both sides scoring .
draw 2-2 moenchengladbach-werder bremen unlike bayern and schalke , werder ’ s champions league match this week was not a rousing home win , but a tough 1-1 draw away to the dutch champions fc twente .
they have n't kept a clean sheet in the league since match day three , and they lost their first choice goalkeeper tim wiese to a knee injury in the aforementioned melee in the netherlands .
their second-choice goalkeeper is also out , so they are relying on 21-year-old sebastian mielitz between the sticks , a rookie with two bundesliga games and half of wednesday 's european match to his name .
it 's a godsend , then , that werder are facing the only team in the bundesliga with a worse defensive record .
moenchengladbach are shipping an average of nearly three goals a game at the moment , are toiling one point above the relegation zone , and are without eight first-team players for this match .
you 'd have to expect the likes of claudio pizarro , aaron hunt and hugo almeida to do some damage .
werder bremen 4-1 freiburg-kaiserslautern freiburg might have lost away to werder last week , but it was a defiant loss , and they were inches away from snatching a draw in the closing minutes at the weserstadion .
for no discernable reason , the modest team from the far south-western corner of the country is riding around in the top half of the table above the likes of bayern , werder and wolfsburg .
kaiserslautern , meanwhile , are coming to town on the back of four morale-sapping losses to frankfurt -lrb- 0-3 -rrb- , hamburg -lrb- 1-2 -rrb- , hanover -lrb- 0-1 -rrb- and the carnage of a trip to dortmund -lrb- 0-5 -rrb- .
but freiburg are blinking nervously in the heady heights , and kaiserslautern could well figure their luck must be about to turn soon .
plus the last time they played a southern team they tonked bayern 2-0 .
draw 1-1 hanover-cologne bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's keeper is in a huff ... but that 's just one worry among many a blistering start to the season for hanover -lrb- 13 points from six games -rrb- came to a thudding end two games ago when they ran into st. pauli .
that 1-0 loss , coupled with the international break that followed , apparently sapped their momentum .
the club then crashed headlong into bayern and mario gomez last week - who scored a brilliant hat-trick .
but if hanover were looking for a confidence boosting opponent , they could hardly have asked for anyone better than cologne , to whom the word “ crisis ” has been attached for weeks .
the pram belonging to resident star lukas podolski is rapidly running out of rattles , and handbags were drawn when colombian keeper faryd mondragon swanned off to the us to play for colombia without permission .
cologne - second from bottom - are still waiting for their second win of the season , but it 's unlikely to come this weekend .
hanover 1-0 nuremberg-wolfsburg wolfsburg are an unpredictable bunch this time round .
their results chart looks like a stock market in a volatile boom-bust economy : three straight defeats were followed by three straight victories , and then last week 's thriller against leverkusen saw them do it all in microcosm - they gave up a 2-0 lead to lose 3-2 in the space of 10 minutes .
but despite this , it 's clear that new manager steve mcclaren is beginning to get his killer trio of edin dzeko , diego and grafite into a groove .
but modest nuremberg are not an easy team to crack , at least for a bottom half side .
but despite last week 's madness , the momentum seems to be with wolfsburg , and there should be more space between the teams than a single place .
wolfsburg 2-1 sunday , october 24 dortmund-hoffenheim the sunday matches all feature germany 's europa league representatives , who played thursday evening , but dortmund did not have to travel , so weariness should not be a factor for the league leaders .
this is good news , because this match should be a cracker .
it 's first against fourth , and dortmund are currently rampaging through the league like they used to back in the day , i.e. the mid-90s .
it 's a heartening sight for those who can remember when bayern had a proper rival , and they are up against - in theory - one of the most exciting new forces in german football in hoffenheim .
while they were undone last year by a thin squad , coach ralf rangnick ’ s men are looking a more robust force this time round .
but despite good results , their recent draw against struggling cologne shows how fallible they are .
dortmund 2-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like the good old days - dortmund on the rampage leverkusen-mainz this one should also be a great game , with second-placed mainz away to third-placed leverkusen .
mainz 's run of seven straight wins came to an abrupt halt last week against hamburg , so it will be interesting to see if the unfancied club can get the ball rolling again .
everyone is expecting this bunch of cheeky young jack-rabbits to finally wake up and realize it was all a big misunderstanding , and they should be hacking through years of mid-table obscurity like honest , decent folk .
so will they dare to dream ?
leverkusen , meanwhile , are exactly the kind of grizzled , seen-it-all veterans who will know how to sap the will of these idealistic young upstarts .
it 's a bit like morgan freeman and brad pitt in seven .
hopefully with a bit less torture .
leverkusen 2-1 stuttgart-st.pauli it would take some kind of devastating natural disaster for stuttgart 's season to get much worse , but last week 's 2-2 draw against schalke - orchestrated by nubile new manager jens keller - was a definite improvement .
coupled with that , their very handy 1-0 win over getafe in the europa league on thursday will have further boosted confidence .
when you have four points from eight games , i guess the only way is up .
they are facing a st. pauli side who may be all of twelve places above them , but have not exactly been the model of consistency in the last few match days .
but all things being equal , st. pauli did just record a very impressive 3-2 win over nuremberg , and will expect to beat stuttgart , even if it does take sheer will .

match day nine represents the start of the second quarter of the bundesliga season , which means we 've entered what is officially termed the “ run-up to christmas ” - both in footballing and commercial terms . you may not know it , but we 're on the home straight towards christmas . this means two important things - kicking a ball and spending more money - will suddenly be jostling for attention in the brains of germany 's professional footballers . that may prove too heavy a mental burden , so on-field concentration could easily slip .

president wulff urges turks to ' actively integrate ' in germany immigrants in any country should adopt their new homeland 's way of life .
fluency in the language of the new country is an absolute must and should be a condition of entry .
even in my small country , down at the bottom of the world , we are headed in the direction of those at the top of the world ... better for people stay in their own country and fix the problems there than to travel the world and contribute to the downfall of every country they inhabit . - kay , new zealand the media keeps misinterpreting what chancellor merkel has said concerning multiculturalism .
she said that the " approach " taken in germany toward multiculturalism had failed , not multiculturalism itself .
to say multiculturalism has failed is a very unwise , untrue , and discouraging message to send out into the global community .
perhaps germany , as well as many other nations , needs to re-evaluate assimilation and acculturation and how diverse groups of people may achieve common national and international goals without losing personal identity and even celebrating it at times . - darrell , us it is my belief that if one chooses to take resources from a foreign society , then the one taking should give back more by enforcing the traditions and resources of the society which they joined .
after all , there is a reason for having left one 's own society and country .
therefore to moving oneself to another country , then insisting that the new location should serve the new inhabitants by changing , is counter productive .
germany is germany , and in present successful due to germany 's past , present and very bright future . - dan , us bravo president wulff .
immigrants should respect their adopted countries ' laws and customs and adapt to them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 22.10.2010 as new powers emerge , political realism drives global agenda großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil , russia , india and china are pursuing their national interests as they gain in power the us and the eu campaigned for a common world order based on liberal values such as democracy and human rights .
but as the balance of power shifts toward developing countries , national interests are trumping values . during the 1990s , the advanced democracies of north america and western europe emerged as the powerbrokers of global politics .
russia shrank from the world stage as it slid into chaos after the collapse of the soviet union .
and the large developing countries - such as brazil , india and china - remained preoccupied with their own internal reforms .
as a consequence , the united states and the european union began to construct a world order based on liberal vales . they promoted a doctrine of free trade , democracy and human rights .
those nations that accepted - or at least did not challenge -these " international norms " were integrated into a growing network of economic globalization .

political paralysis in the west nearly a decade ago , developed and developing nations agreed in doha , qatar to a round of multilateral negotiations that would reduce poverty through trade liberalization .
the goal was to eliminate economic barriers that prevented poorer countries from sharing in the benefits of globalization .
although political leaders in the us and eu had traditionally championed free trade , they now found it politically difficult to turn the doha round into a final settlement .

" there 's an irony here , " jagdish bhagwati , an expert on international trade with the council on foreign relations and a professor at columbia university in new york , told deutsche welle .
" if you look at what leaders are doing - obama is probably the worst but sarkozy comes pretty close - the leadership itself seems to be hamstrung and paralyzed in an inability to celebrate the openness of markets . "
as the brics profited from openness , a growing number of voices in the us and eu began to view trade as a zero-sum game .
as a result , the doha round collapsed .

emerging powers take initiative in response to the doha round 's collapse and the onset of the economic crisis , the brics began to strengthen their relations among one another .
yet political differences between these countries have prevented them from forging a true alliance .
the democratic nations of india , brazil as well as south africa have established their own dialogue .

and the us unilaterally imposed these norms in iraq .
in contrast , the brics emphasize national sovereignty and non-intervention as a means to avoid unnecessary confrontation as they further their economic development . " there is a strong old north-south mindset in the world and that ties to a set of neutral countries in opposition to western imperialism , " thomas carothers , an expert on democracy and the rule of law with the carnegie endowment for international peace , told deutsche welle .
" as we move out of that mindset we could go in two directions , " carothers continued .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a club of great powers could emerge out of the g20 and it is difficult for the emerging powers to advance their interests within the current institutions - such as the imf and world bank - dominated by established powers , flemes said .

a club of great powers could emerge out of the g20 , and these great powers may then negotiate their interests among each other , he continued .
this development would indicate that realpolitik , the pragmatic emphasis on maintaining a stable balance of power , has trumped liberal norms in global politics .
but carothers believes that promoting these liberal norms is in fact rooted in pragmatism , since no country has become wealthy and industrialized without democratizing , and that powers like russia and china will ultimately have to go down that path toward democracy .

but as the balance of power shifts toward developing countries , national interests are trumping values . during the 1990s , the advanced democracies of north america and western europe emerged as the powerbrokers of global politics .
russia shrank from the world stage as it slid into chaos after the collapse of the soviet union .
and the large developing countries - such as brazil , india and china - remained preoccupied with their own internal reforms .
as a consequence , the united states and the european union began to construct a world order based on liberal vales . they promoted a doctrine of free trade , democracy and human rights .
those nations that accepted - or at least did not challenge -these " international norms " were integrated into a growing network of economic globalization .
this network was governed by institutions such as the world trade organization , the international monetary fund and the world bank . meanwhile , leaders who actively undermined the liberal rules of the game - such as slobodan milosevic and saddam hussein - faced crippling sanctions and devastating airstrikes .
integration and confrontation became two sides of the same coin .
but in the new millennium a more diverse group of countries is sharing world power , which has made it difficult to form a consensus around a common global agenda .
as brazil , russia , india and china - often referred to as the brics - confidently pursue their own national interests , the liberal international order is buckling .
political paralysis in the west nearly a decade ago , developed and developing nations agreed in doha , qatar to a round of multilateral negotiations that would reduce poverty through trade liberalization .
the goal was to eliminate economic barriers that prevented poorer countries from sharing in the benefits of globalization .
although political leaders in the us and eu had traditionally championed free trade , they now found it politically difficult to turn the doha round into a final settlement .
the business community felt they were not getting enough , while labor unions believed an agreement would outsource more jobs to the developing world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the doha round failed , sparking criticism of the wto in the developing world meanwhile , the brics - which once opposed liberalization as an instrument of imperialism - now championed free trade .
the failure of state socialism and protectionism had pushed brazil , russia , india and china toward a model of export-led growth that depended on an open global economy .
" there 's an irony here , " jagdish bhagwati , an expert on international trade with the council on foreign relations and a professor at columbia university in new york , told deutsche welle .
" if you look at what leaders are doing - obama is probably the worst but sarkozy comes pretty close - the leadership itself seems to be hamstrung and paralyzed in an inability to celebrate the openness of markets . "
as the brics profited from openness , a growing number of voices in the us and eu began to view trade as a zero-sum game .
as a result , the doha round collapsed .
" it just means that we are not pushing forward , " bhagwati said .
" the real question during a time of recession is not moving backwards into additional protectionism . "
emerging powers take initiative in response to the doha round 's collapse and the onset of the economic crisis , the brics began to strengthen their relations among one another .
yet political differences between these countries have prevented them from forging a true alliance .

but as the balance of power shifts toward developing countries , national interests are trumping values . during the 1990s , the advanced democracies of north america and western europe emerged as the powerbrokers of global politics .
russia shrank from the world stage as it slid into chaos after the collapse of the soviet union .
and the large developing countries - such as brazil , india and china - remained preoccupied with their own internal reforms .
as a consequence , the united states and the european union began to construct a world order based on liberal vales . they promoted a doctrine of free trade , democracy and human rights .
those nations that accepted - or at least did not challenge -these " international norms " were integrated into a growing network of economic globalization .
this network was governed by institutions such as the world trade organization , the international monetary fund and the world bank . meanwhile , leaders who actively undermined the liberal rules of the game - such as slobodan milosevic and saddam hussein - faced crippling sanctions and devastating airstrikes .
integration and confrontation became two sides of the same coin .
but in the new millennium a more diverse group of countries is sharing world power , which has made it difficult to form a consensus around a common global agenda .
as brazil , russia , india and china - often referred to as the brics - confidently pursue their own national interests , the liberal international order is buckling .
political paralysis in the west nearly a decade ago , developed and developing nations agreed in doha , qatar to a round of multilateral negotiations that would reduce poverty through trade liberalization .
the goal was to eliminate economic barriers that prevented poorer countries from sharing in the benefits of globalization .
although political leaders in the us and eu had traditionally championed free trade , they now found it politically difficult to turn the doha round into a final settlement .
the business community felt they were not getting enough , while labor unions believed an agreement would outsource more jobs to the developing world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the doha round failed , sparking criticism of the wto in the developing world meanwhile , the brics - which once opposed liberalization as an instrument of imperialism - now championed free trade .
the failure of state socialism and protectionism had pushed brazil , russia , india and china toward a model of export-led growth that depended on an open global economy .
" there 's an irony here , " jagdish bhagwati , an expert on international trade with the council on foreign relations and a professor at columbia university in new york , told deutsche welle .
" if you look at what leaders are doing - obama is probably the worst but sarkozy comes pretty close - the leadership itself seems to be hamstrung and paralyzed in an inability to celebrate the openness of markets . "
as the brics profited from openness , a growing number of voices in the us and eu began to view trade as a zero-sum game .
as a result , the doha round collapsed .
" it just means that we are not pushing forward , " bhagwati said .
" the real question during a time of recession is not moving backwards into additional protectionism . "
emerging powers take initiative in response to the doha round 's collapse and the onset of the economic crisis , the brics began to strengthen their relations among one another .
yet political differences between these countries have prevented them from forging a true alliance .
the democratic nations of india , brazil as well as south africa have established their own dialogue .
in turn , the autocratic regimes of russia and china have separately signed a series of agreements deepening what they call a " strategic partnership of cooperation . "
however , these nations do find common ground in their skepticism of the us and the eu 's international agenda .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and the eu have often spread their values in the developing world through force the us and the eu made human rights and democracy a central part of their foreign policies , jointly applying military force to spread these liberal norms in the balkans and afghanistan .
and the us unilaterally imposed these norms in iraq .
in contrast , the brics emphasize national sovereignty and non-intervention as a means to avoid unnecessary confrontation as they further their economic development . " there is a strong old north-south mindset in the world and that ties to a set of neutral countries in opposition to western imperialism , " thomas carothers , an expert on democracy and the rule of law with the carnegie endowment for international peace , told deutsche welle .
" as we move out of that mindset we could go in two directions , " carothers continued .
" they -lsb- brics -rsb- could begin to see the value of an international community based on norms ; or they could stick with the feeling of being pushed around by larger powers and have an emphasis on sovereignty . "
the return of realpolitik the us and the eu remain critically important in world politics , but their relative power is declining .
in response , they may be forced to make political compromises in order to coopt the new powers .
the global agenda rooted in democracy and human rights could give way to a more pragmatic approach .
finding common ground between emerging and established powers would mean focusing on economic interests instead of liberal norms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 22.10.2010 poor weather creates small but tasty vintage of riesling wines großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wine prices may increase when 2010 's grapes hit the market the 2010 wine yield has suffered across europe after a rainy and cold summer .
but german winemakers hope a unique blend of sugar and acid will make this year 's vintage an exceptional flavor - even if there is less of it . german winemakers harvested about half of the amount of grapes they took out of vineyards last year making it one of the worst yields in decades , according to michael bluemling , a wine grower on the moselle river . " it 's always disappointing when you 're harvesting less fruit than expected , " he told deutsche welle . this october bluemling harvested just 5,000 liters per hectare , less than half of the maximum yield of 12,500 liters .
a cold snap in june stifled what winegrowers call the fruit set - the critical phase when the grapevine 's flowers are fertilized and start growing into grapes . a rainy august also dampened hopes for the 2010 vintage .
grapes - and germans - suffered through twice as much rain and a third less sunshine compared to an average august . the lack of sun kept the grapes from fully developing and all the moisture led the botrytis fungus , which gives the riesling grapes their sweet taste , to develop too quickly .
this destroyed some of the crop , further reducing the harvest . problems for local economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael bluemling was disappointed by the low harvest the low yield could hit the local economy hard . " wine is everything for this area , " bluemling said .
" the romans cultivated wine 2,000 years ago and since then the wine growing is very important for this region . " the state rhineland-palatinate , where bluemling works , produces 90 percent of germany 's export wines and 70 percent of the nation 's total wine production .
some 12,000 businesses in the state are relying on the harvest to produce wine . despite this year 's catastrophic harvest , bluemling said he remains optimistic about how the riesling growers will fare over the next year because of 2009 's bumper harvest . " the wineries still have some wine from the last years and so all the wineries in our region are going to survive the smaller vintage and we hope that the next vintage will be totally different , " bluemling said . but hans rainer schultz from the wine research center in giesenheim is n't so optimistic . " the lower yield is going to be very painful for many wine growers , because some of them only harvested about 50 percent of what they normally harvest , " schultz said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grape fungus developed more quickly in the wet weather and reduced crop yields overall predictions for the german wine harvest show a 23 percent drop on the average yield .
schultz said german winegrowers were n't alone .
vineyards in austria and italy have seen their yields fall as well .
schultz said he think this lower yield will be reflected in wine prices . " within europe , the yield is going to be smaller , and i think on average the prices are going to increase , " he said . unusual taste regarding the taste of this year 's riesling wine , schutz is n't quite as glum .
he said despite a lot of fear about this year 's vintage , winemakers will be able to make a decent wine . " what was very unusual with riesling this year is that we had relatively high levels of sugar but at the same time relatively high levels of acid , " he said .
" i think that 's something that will make the 2010 vintage quite exciting , because this combination only happens very rarely . " while the 2010 vintage may turn out to be unusually good , he added that winemakers will have to wait and see if an increase in prices will be able to compensate winegrowers for their low yields . author : natalia dannenberg editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after the first day of talks , both sides claimed their positions had been strengthened . veteran conservative politician heiner geissler , who is leading the mediation talks on the controversial rail project stuttgart 21 , said the first round was a good start for " an experiment in democracy , " calling the discussions fair and to the point .
" i did n't get the impression that either party was just trying to score points , " he said after six and a half hours of talks .
it was the first time that mediation talks of this nature have been shown live on television and on the internet .
geissler said the debate was very technical , but that both parties had made an effort to avoid too much jargon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mediators hope the talks will help clarify the project 's pros and cons stefan mappus , the premier of the southern state of baden-wuerttemberg , where stuttgart is located , said it was a " good day for democracy " and that the talks were aimed at easing fears among the local population about the perceived disadvantages of a planned new underground train station .
controversial project the project , which has been the subject of protracted , sometimes violent protests , involves demolishing most of stuttgart 's old train station and replacing it with a new underground facility , with the addition of a new line creating a fast connection to the nearby city of ulm .
deutsche bahn board member volker kefer argued that the state needs a modern rail hub to be able to compete with airlines and that stuttgart 21 was the right way to do it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters say a modern underground station is an economic necessity but opponents insist that modernizing the existing station is the better option .
" we think your project is a step backwards , not forwards , " the mayor of nearby tuebingen , boris palmer told kefer on friday .
palmer also called on mappus to clear the way for a referendum on the project .
while deutsche bahn argues that the new underground station will boost passenger numbers by two million , critics say the figures do not add up and costs are likely to escalate .
the mediation talks are to continue every friday until dec .
3 .
more demonstrations are planned for saturday , when up to 40,000 people are expected in stuttgart to demonstrate both for and against the project .

bayern needs points if they hope to free themselves of the rut that has them currently sitting in ninth place in the table .
" hamburg had the big chances , " said bayern captain philipp lahm , " so there are times when you have to be satisfied with one point . "
bayern have been deeply cut by a swathe of injuries this season and played without several key players friday , including mark van bommel , daniel van buyten and miroslav klose .
' better than nothing ' fourth-place hamburg could have used a win to gain ground on bayer leverkusen .
the two teams are currently even at 15 points with leverkusen ahead on goals , but leverkusen could widen the gap again on sunday with a win against mainz .
the match was relatively even , although hamburg did have better chances to score .
that included a very near-miss by jonathan pitroipa , who only had bayern keeper joerg butt to beat but bounced his shot off the right post .
" pitroipa should have scored , " hamburg coach armin veh said after the game .
" -lrb- but -rrb- at least we kept a clean sheet . "
" better one point against bayern than none , " added hamburg 's captain heiko westermann .

" we expect that within 10 days , the situation in terzigno can return to normal , " he told a news conference in rome after an emergency meeting .
the government 's plans to build a new dump in terzigno , which is located 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- southeast of naples in vesuvius national park , have for years met with fierce opposition by locals , who have repeatedly blocked access to the existing waste disposal site there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dump is located in vesuvius national park on thursday , police confronted around 2,000 demonstrators , who threw stones , marbles and firecrackers and used tree trunks to block access to the dump .
compensation offered berlusconi also announced he would release 14 million euros -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- to modernize the existing facility , which the protesters say is overflowing and causing health problems .
the problem has been a major issue for the italian government for several years , with berlusconi declaring a national disaster in 2008 .
the rubbish row has not escaped the european union 's notice either .
the european commission has taken legal action against italy to force the government to solve the crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi 's election pledge to solve the crisis has not materialized " the infringement procedures are ongoing , " spokesman joe hennon said on friday .
" italian authorities need to draw up a plan to manage rubbish in the region , " he added .
the european court of justice found earlier this year that italy had no adequate system for waste disposal in the naples region and said that the problem was a risk to human health and the environment .

but the study also showed that most children had had no upsetting experiences with the internet at all . a large majority of those interviewed for the study eu kids online reported no negative experiences at all online , results of the european union study " risks and safety on the internet " showed .
but the study also showed that parents are frequently out of touch with their kids ' virtual lives .
the european union and london school of economics survey was presented thursday at the safer internet forum in luxembourg , and included interviews with thousands of kids across europe from ireland to turkey .
among its findings , the study showed that an average of 12 percent of european children had been bothered or upset by something they experienced online .
these included encountering pornography , sexual or bullying messages , or having their personal data revealed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , just eight percent of kids said they were bothered by an online event indeed , the study showed that 39 percent of those questioned had had encountered a " risky " behavior - such as communicating with new people not met face-to-face , or seeing user-generated content that is potentially harmful , such as hate , self-harm , or drug-taking content .
but only a portion of those asked said they had been upset or bothered by it .
in germany , the percentage of kids who said they were upset by an online experience was , at eight percent , near the lowest end of the scale .
only portugal -lrb- seven percent -rrb- and italy -lrb- six percent -rrb- were lower .
topping the percentages of those most bothered or upset were children in denmark -lrb- 26 percent -rrb- , estonia -lrb- 25 percent -rrb- and romania and sweden -lrb- 21 percent . -rrb-
discrepancy due to ' schoolyard monopoly ' uwe hasebrink , a professor at hamburg 's hans bredow institute for media research , led the german arm of the study .
in an interview with the hamburg abendblatt newspaper , he said that german children " are in less danger " of meeting harmful content because they use the internet " less frequently and with less variety " than kids in other countries .
but markus beckedahl , whose blog netzpolitik.org focuses on the intersection between the internet and german politics , said he found it hard to understand the response gap between countries like denmark and sweden , and germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say parents , not children , should be targets of information campaigns " the study said that countries with high internet usage have more problems , " beckedahl told deutsche welle . " but something like 99 percent of german kids have internet access , and i do n't think they have more more internet usage in denmark . "
one big difference could be the fact that a huge portion of the social-network market for kids and teens in germany takes place on german-only networks like " schuelervz " -lrb- " student directory , " -rrb- german schoolkids ' version of facebook .
" these platforms have a near monopoly on the schoolyard , " he added . " maybe that makes the difference - in germany , the kids are in closed communities , and in other countries they are just on the internet . "
the age factor other poll findings showed children were using the internet at increasingly young ages : an average of seven in sweden and eight in several other northern european countries .
interviewers , who spoke with 23,000 children between the ages of nine and 16 , found it was the youngest children who had the hardest time coping with disturbing material online .
in response to this finding , the study recommended targeting spending and advice at younger age groups to reduce risk and enhance the opportunities of the internet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : younger children had more trouble coping with upsetting experiences parents were frequently unaware of the risks to which their children had been exposed , the study showed .
for example , more than half of parents whose children said they had been bullied online , said they knew nothing of the situation .
moreover , some 41 percent of parents whose child had seen sexual images online said their child had n't , and 61 percent of parents whose children had met offline with an online contact , also said their child had n't .
beckedahl added that parents should ideally " be aware what their kids are doing , and they should talk to them about what kind of experiences they are having on the internet . "
the study also found that while the overwhelming majority of european kids in the study use the internet at home -lrb- 85 percent -rrb- , many children do have private time to use the internet .
48 percent use it in their bedroom , and 31 percent via a mobile phone or other handheld device .
in some countries , like the united kingdom , ireland and sweden , over one in five young people use the internet regularly on a handheld device .
supporting education - for educators beckedahl acknowledged that because of this separation between parents and when their children are online , and their lack of awareness of where their kids go online , it may make things difficult for the parents to keep up . " parents often lack literacy in the social networks their children are using , " he said .
" they have no clue what kind of experiences and user interaction their kids would have , and they do n't really know what can happen . " his suggestion : shifting germany 's ongoing campaigns for media literacy away from children , and toward parents and teachers .
" peer to peer education exists already - children figure out how these platforms work themselves , " he noted . " the problem is , their parents and teachers are n't able to teach them to behave correctly , and prevent risks . "
the study 's authors plan to publish official conclusions and recommendations in november .
but even in thier preliminary findings , they acknowledge that the harmful potential of the internet is counterbalanced - if not easily outweighed - by the medium 's benefits .
plus , they note that a majority of the kids polled said they had not had any harmful experiences with the internet at all .
for his part , beckedahl would like to see the german debate on internet usage lose its negative tone .
" our debate about the internet needs to become more positive , " he said . " it is one of the greatest tools we ever had .
but if we only talk about the risks , people will fear the internet . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 22.10.2010 merkel and rasmussen bank on russia for missile defense shield großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen and merkel reiterated support for the missile shield after talks in berlin , nato secretary general rasmussen said there was no alternative to a common european anti-missile shield .
the organization hopes to get russia on board for a common security structure . german chancellor angela merkel and nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen have reiterated their support for a planned european anti-missile defense shield and have expressed hope that russia will drop its objections to the plan .
moscow has in the past been the major stumbling block for the missile defense shield .
russia sees the shield as being at least partly directed against its own military might whereas nato and washington say its sole purpose is to protect europe from possible attack by rogue states such as iran or north korea .
at the nato summit november , the western alliance is hoping to reach agreement on a new strategic plan aimed at giving nato a new focus two decades after the end of the cold war .
in a surprise move , russian president dmitry medvedev earlier this week agreed to attend next month 's talks in portugal .
he indicated moscow was open to dialogue about the shield .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev in talks with sarkozy and merkel agreed to attend the upcoming nato summit " the openness of russia towards discussion over the missile defense system is a good signal , " merkel told reporters in berlin on friday .
but she cautioned that cooperation with russia would be slow in the making .
euro-atlantic security rasmussen added the threat of north korean or iranian missiles would affect russian cities as well as central european ones .
" we simply can not afford becoming the hostage of such an attack , " the nato chief said , saying that only a common defense system - with the inclusion of russia - could provide for a " true euro-atlantic security architecture . "
" there is a broad scope of areas where we could develop a broad scope of practical cooperation with russia , " rasmussen said , pointing not only to missile defense but also to afghanistan and international counter-terrorism .
both merkel and rasmussen however dismissed the idea of russia becoming part of the northern atlantic treaty organization any time soon .
" things have developed well in the last year , but i do n't think we should ask too much of one another , " the german chancellor said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel cautioned that cooperation with russia would be slow in the making rasmussen pointed out that russia had made it clear that joining nato was not an option for moscow and that a strategic partnership was the only realistic option .
" i 've taken note of some statements from moscow that russia would never apply for nato membership , because it was able to take care of security matters on its own , " the nato chief said .
" so , let 's rather pursue what i consider a realistic future , namely a true strategic partnership between nato and russia . "
merkel backs french nuclear arsenal german chancellor merkel also touched on berlin 's shifting position on nuclear defense .
she said nato members should retain nuclear capabilities as long as other , potentially hostile , countries still had nuclear weapons .
previously , german foreign minister guido westerwelle had expressed hopes that the missile shield would allow for a nuclear powers to cut their arsenals .
germany and france had been at odds over the issue earlier this week when french president nicolas sarkozy blatantly dismissed the idea that france would accept any foreign intervention in its nuclear arms policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there still is need for nuclear deterrent , merkel said paris insists on keeping its own nuclear weapons .
merkel ’ s statements after the talks with rasmussen on friday seemed to be aimed directly at concerns of western nuclear powers such as france that the defense shield could pressure them into reducing their arsenals .

" as long as there are nuclear weapons in the world , we need to have these capabilities . "
germany itself does not have any nuclear weapons , but has us weapons stationed on its territory .
nato as an international forum on security rasmussen however called for a general broadening of nato 's role , making it more of a political organization as opposed to having a solely military agenda .
" nato has to become a forum for consultation on international security , " he said .
cooperation with other regions of the world ought to be fostered , he added .
countries like china , india and pakistan should work in close dialogue with nato .
such a " cooperative approach " was not intended to be directed against any third countries but would rather work along the lines of united nations policies , rasmussen said .

but in the wake of the global crisis , it 's germany that 's emerging with ease , which countries like the us can learn from . unemployment figures in germany are down to 1992 levels , and german exports are on the rise as if the global economic crisis had never happened .
in comparison , the economy in the united states is doing a lot worse : unemployment stands high at 9.6 percent , and growth rates are far from the positive figures that are coming out of germany .
and yet , there 's no secret recipe behind the success of the german economy , says thomas zielke , deputy delegate of the german economy in washington – it all comes down to exports , he told deutsche welle .
" it 's that great flexibility of companies , and the will to expand .
people are simply used to focusing on exports , " zielke said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shapiro says germany has been well prepared for the crisis that 's not necessarily the case in the us , he says , where companies are used to relying much more on their own domestic market .
in the united states , exports only make up 13 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , but the figure in germany is more than three times higher .
and while most of germany 's exports are going to other eu countries , the biggest growth rates are in exports to the rest of the world .
investing in exports if the domestic market crumbles in a time of recession , companies have little choice other than to invest in exports , robert shapiro , economic advisor to the us government , told deutsche welle .
" that has always been germany 's strength , " he said .
" the country has been very well prepared for that . "
there are other factors behind germany 's success in handling the crisis that shapiro and his colleagues have taken a closer look at .
one example is government action , such as subsidizing shortened working hours .
by covering part of the salaries of workers who are put on reduced hours , berlin has managed to avoid a situation where too many people had to be laid off during the recession .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a manufacturing-based economy can more easily focus on exports jacob kirkegaard of the peterson institute for international economics told deutsche welle that he felt a lot of respect for germany 's quick resurgence .
" germany has proven that it 's possible to handle a dramatic slump in sales and exports without mass firings , " he says .
" you just have much more flexibility than on the us market .
here the gut reaction is always : when the sales go down , people have to be fired .
and when the demand is back , there 's a lack of workers . "
too much government involvement ?
but shapiro cautions against simply adapting that system to the us economy .
cultural differences are part of the problem – americans are traditionally opposed to their government getting involved in running businesses .
he also warned that despite the currently positive outlook there are still many risks for germany .
european monetary policy is too fragile , he says , as it has to balance between the interests of all the eu member states .
the danger of countries running bankrupt is still there .
greece for instance has not seen its situation improve as much as the rest of europe had hoped it would .
and other member states like ireland or spain are still struggling to avoid a crisis .
a moral price to pay shapiro and kirkegaard agree that germany 's exports to china are also not without a downside .
there 's a moral price to pay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us economy is struggling despite austerity measures " germany is rather careful in criticizing china because of course berlin does not want to put its exports at risk .
the us however are much more outspoken .
but that of course has an impact on us exports to china . "
and still , the us already seem to be readjusting their economic policy to follow more in the direction that germany is taking .
the obama government has recognized the importance of exports – the goal is to increase exports by five percent .
" the current administration has export at the top of its agenda , " thomas zielke says .
" obama has repeatedly said that he sees the future as being in manufacturing .
and he has put that directly in opposition to wall street and the financial crisis . "

although they are only preliminary results , they clearly show who the winners and losers are .
ratbil shamel has this opinion piece : now the secret , which never was one , is out .
the wolesi jirga , afghanistan ’ s lower house , will continue to be run by the country ’ s warlords over the next five years .
former mujahedin leaders and their allies have won in almost all the constituencies .
even in kabul , a city which at the beginning of the 1990s was almost completely destroyed by the battles between the various mujahedin groupings , the picture is the same .
hardly anybody in afghanistan is surprised by the results .
many had said even before the elections took place that they did not have any faith in afghanistan 's supposedly ' independent ' election commission -lrb- iec -rrb- .
and the fact that certain sections of the afghan population still went to vote has another explanation - they wanted to show that they , at least , take democracy seriously .
they went to the polls because they wanted to tell the world : " we afghans reject war , the taliban and extremism " .
many afghans perhaps don ’ t really know what democracy means or how a parliament functions but one thing that they know for sure is that a peaceful struggle is better than war .
and the people in afghanistan have been experiencing war for over 30 years .
yet hardly anyone is deluded enough to think that his / her vote makes a difference .
despite three elections in the past nine years , their lives have not improved for the better .
on the contrary .
the taliban are getting stronger and stronger by the day , while the government is becoming weaker .
and they know that the new parliament will not change much .
the erstwhile leaders of the mujahedin will certainly not fight for democratic reforms in the future .
their goal is clear - to strengthen their own position of power in the country .
this power will increase the more the international community pulls out of afghanistan .
some observers believe it will become increasingly difficult for president hamid karzai to govern but the opposite will be true .
karzai has long been counting on the mujahedin card .
his two deputies were chosen out of these ranks last year , despite national and international criticism .
but the real losers of this election , far more than hamid karzai , are the small democratic groupings in afghanistan .
in the past nine years , they have not managed to unite over a few common goals .
instead , they have founded countless political parties that carry no weight in afghanistan ’ s power struggle .
they fielded hundreds of candidates this time but will have to wake up to the fact that they have lost , again .
a further loser in these elections is the international community , especially the west .
democracy , peace and well-being were promised to the people of afghanistan almost a decade ago .
but the taliban and former warlords continue to determine the lives of the afghans .
afghanistan can not be left to the taliban and the warlords again .
the consequences of such a policy are clear to everybody – instability for the region and the world .

" we expect that within 10 days , the situation in terzigno can return to normal , " he told a news conference in rome after an emergency meeting .
the government 's plans to build a new dump in terzigno , which is located 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- southeast of naples in vesuvius national park , have for years met with fierce opposition by locals , who have repeatedly blocked access to the existing waste disposal site there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dump is located in vesuvius national park on thursday , police confronted around 2,000 demonstrators , who threw stones , marbles and firecrackers and used tree trunks to block access to the dump .
compensation offered berlusconi also announced he would release 14 million euros -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- to modernize the existing facility , which the protesters say is overflowing and causing health problems .
the problem has been a major issue for the italian government for several years , with berlusconi declaring a national disaster in 2008 .
the rubbish row has not escaped the european union 's notice either .
the european commission has taken legal action against italy to force the government to solve the crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi 's election pledge to solve the crisis has not materialized " the infringement procedures are ongoing , " spokesman joe hennon said on friday .
" italian authorities need to draw up a plan to manage rubbish in the region , " he added .
the european court of justice found earlier this year that italy had no adequate system for waste disposal in the naples region and said that the problem was a risk to human health and the environment .

" we expect that within 10 days , the situation in terzigno can return to normal , " he told a news conference in rome after an emergency meeting .
the government 's plans to build a new dump in terzigno , which is located 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- southeast of naples in vesuvius national park , have for years met with fierce opposition by locals , who have repeatedly blocked access to the existing waste disposal site there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dump is located in vesuvius national park on thursday , police confronted around 2,000 demonstrators , who threw stones , marbles and firecrackers and used tree trunks to block access to the dump .
compensation offered berlusconi also announced he would release 14 million euros -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- to modernize the existing facility , which the protesters say is overflowing and causing health problems .
the problem has been a major issue for the italian government for several years , with berlusconi declaring a national disaster in 2008 .
the rubbish row has not escaped the european union 's notice either .
the european commission has taken legal action against italy to force the government to solve the crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi 's election pledge to solve the crisis has not materialized " the infringement procedures are ongoing , " spokesman joe hennon said on friday .
" italian authorities need to draw up a plan to manage rubbish in the region , " he added .
the european court of justice found earlier this year that italy had no adequate system for waste disposal in the naples region and said that the problem was a risk to human health and the environment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 22.10.2010 european online risk study shows many parents clueless , kids blasé großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children are online at an increasingly young age more than one in eight european children has been upset by online content , a new eu study on internet risks shows .
but the study also showed that most children had had no upsetting experiences with the internet at all . a large majority of those interviewed for the study eu kids online reported no negative experiences at all online , results of the european union study " risks and safety on the internet " showed .
but the study also showed that parents are frequently out of touch with their kids ' virtual lives .
the european union and london school of economics survey was presented thursday at the safer internet forum in luxembourg , and included interviews with thousands of kids across europe from ireland to turkey .
among its findings , the study showed that an average of 12 percent of european children had been bothered or upset by something they experienced online .
these included encountering pornography , sexual or bullying messages , or having their personal data revealed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , just eight percent of kids said they were bothered by an online event indeed , the study showed that 39 percent of those questioned had had encountered a " risky " behavior - such as communicating with new people not met face-to-face , or seeing user-generated content that is potentially harmful , such as hate , self-harm , or drug-taking content .
but only a portion of those asked said they had been upset or bothered by it .
in germany , the percentage of kids who said they were upset by an online experience was , at eight percent , near the lowest end of the scale .
only portugal -lrb- seven percent -rrb- and italy -lrb- six percent -rrb- were lower .
topping the percentages of those most bothered or upset were children in denmark -lrb- 26 percent -rrb- , estonia -lrb- 25 percent -rrb- and romania and sweden -lrb- 21 percent . -rrb-
discrepancy due to ' schoolyard monopoly ' uwe hasebrink , a professor at hamburg 's hans bredow institute for media research , led the german arm of the study .
in an interview with the hamburg abendblatt newspaper , he said that german children " are in less danger " of meeting harmful content because they use the internet " less frequently and with less variety " than kids in other countries .
but markus beckedahl , whose blog netzpolitik.org focuses on the intersection between the internet and german politics , said he found it hard to understand the response gap between countries like denmark and sweden , and germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say parents , not children , should be targets of information campaigns " the study said that countries with high internet usage have more problems , " beckedahl told deutsche welle . " but something like 99 percent of german kids have internet access , and i do n't think they have more more internet usage in denmark . "
one big difference could be the fact that a huge portion of the social-network market for kids and teens in germany takes place on german-only networks like " schuelervz " -lrb- " student directory , " -rrb- german schoolkids ' version of facebook .
" these platforms have a near monopoly on the schoolyard , " he added . " maybe that makes the difference - in germany , the kids are in closed communities , and in other countries they are just on the internet . "
the age factor other poll findings showed children were using the internet at increasingly young ages : an average of seven in sweden and eight in several other northern european countries .
interviewers , who spoke with 23,000 children between the ages of nine and 16 , found it was the youngest children who had the hardest time coping with disturbing material online .
in response to this finding , the study recommended targeting spending and advice at younger age groups to reduce risk and enhance the opportunities of the internet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : younger children had more trouble coping with upsetting experiences parents were frequently unaware of the risks to which their children had been exposed , the study showed .
for example , more than half of parents whose children said they had been bullied online , said they knew nothing of the situation .
moreover , some 41 percent of parents whose child had seen sexual images online said their child had n't , and 61 percent of parents whose children had met offline with an online contact , also said their child had n't .
beckedahl added that parents should ideally " be aware what their kids are doing , and they should talk to them about what kind of experiences they are having on the internet . "
the study also found that while the overwhelming majority of european kids in the study use the internet at home -lrb- 85 percent -rrb- , many children do have private time to use the internet .
48 percent use it in their bedroom , and 31 percent via a mobile phone or other handheld device .
in some countries , like the united kingdom , ireland and sweden , over one in five young people use the internet regularly on a handheld device .
supporting education - for educators beckedahl acknowledged that because of this separation between parents and when their children are online , and their lack of awareness of where their kids go online , it may make things difficult for the parents to keep up . " parents often lack literacy in the social networks their children are using , " he said .
" they have no clue what kind of experiences and user interaction their kids would have , and they do n't really know what can happen . " his suggestion : shifting germany 's ongoing campaigns for media literacy away from children , and toward parents and teachers .
" peer to peer education exists already - children figure out how these platforms work themselves , " he noted . " the problem is , their parents and teachers are n't able to teach them to behave correctly , and prevent risks . "
the study 's authors plan to publish official conclusions and recommendations in november .
but even in thier preliminary findings , they acknowledge that the harmful potential of the internet is counterbalanced - if not easily outweighed - by the medium 's benefits .
plus , they note that a majority of the kids polled said they had not had any harmful experiences with the internet at all .
for his part , beckedahl would like to see the german debate on internet usage lose its negative tone .
" our debate about the internet needs to become more positive , " he said . " it is one of the greatest tools we ever had .
but if we only talk about the risks , people will fear the internet . "

the leader of the freedom party is facing charges of inciting racial hatred against muslims . dutch anti-islam politician geert wilders welcomed the decision by a dutch court to order a retrial with new judges , after he complained that the current judges were biased .
" this gives me a new chance of a new fair trial , " wilders told the reuters news agency .
" i 'm confident i can only be acquitted , because i have broken no law , but spoken the truth , " he insisted .
wilders ' lawyer had asked the court to replace the judges because of concern about their being biased , after they did not immediately approve a request to hear testimony from a witness the defense considered crucial to its case .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilders has caused outrage among muslims back to square one the amsterdam court ruled that the defense 's fear of bias was " understandable " , meaning the entire trial process will have to be repeated , although it was not clear when it would reopen .
wilders has repeatedly equated islam and muslims with fascism and violence , and he also called for the koran to be banned in the netherlands .
the dutch politician 's anti-immigration freedom party was one of the big winners in june 's national elections and , while not part of the government , it has agreed to prop it up in crucial decisions .

but in the wake of the global crisis , it 's germany that 's emerging with ease , which countries like the us can learn from . unemployment figures in germany are down to 1992 levels , and german exports are on the rise as if the global economic crisis had never happened .
in comparison , the economy in the united states is doing a lot worse : unemployment stands high at 9.6 percent , and growth rates are far from the positive figures that are coming out of germany .
and yet , there 's no secret recipe behind the success of the german economy , says thomas zielke , deputy delegate of the german economy in washington – it all comes down to exports , he told deutsche welle .
" it 's that great flexibility of companies , and the will to expand .
people are simply used to focusing on exports , " zielke said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shapiro says germany has been well prepared for the crisis that 's not necessarily the case in the us , he says , where companies are used to relying much more on their own domestic market .
in the united states , exports only make up 13 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , but the figure in germany is more than three times higher .
and while most of germany 's exports are going to other eu countries , the biggest growth rates are in exports to the rest of the world .
investing in exports if the domestic market crumbles in a time of recession , companies have little choice other than to invest in exports , robert shapiro , economic advisor to the us government , told deutsche welle .
" that has always been germany 's strength , " he said .
" the country has been very well prepared for that . "
there are other factors behind germany 's success in handling the crisis that shapiro and his colleagues have taken a closer look at .
one example is government action , such as subsidizing shortened working hours .
by covering part of the salaries of workers who are put on reduced hours , berlin has managed to avoid a situation where too many people had to be laid off during the recession .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a manufacturing-based economy can more easily focus on exports jacob kirkegaard of the peterson institute for international economics told deutsche welle that he felt a lot of respect for germany 's quick resurgence .
" germany has proven that it 's possible to handle a dramatic slump in sales and exports without mass firings , " he says .
" you just have much more flexibility than on the us market .
here the gut reaction is always : when the sales go down , people have to be fired .
and when the demand is back , there 's a lack of workers . "
too much government involvement ?
but shapiro cautions against simply adapting that system to the us economy .
cultural differences are part of the problem – americans are traditionally opposed to their government getting involved in running businesses .
he also warned that despite the currently positive outlook there are still many risks for germany .
european monetary policy is too fragile , he says , as it has to balance between the interests of all the eu member states .
the danger of countries running bankrupt is still there .
greece for instance has not seen its situation improve as much as the rest of europe had hoped it would .
and other member states like ireland or spain are still struggling to avoid a crisis .
a moral price to pay shapiro and kirkegaard agree that germany 's exports to china are also not without a downside .
there 's a moral price to pay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us economy is struggling despite austerity measures " germany is rather careful in criticizing china because of course berlin does not want to put its exports at risk .
the us however are much more outspoken .
but that of course has an impact on us exports to china . "
and still , the us already seem to be readjusting their economic policy to follow more in the direction that germany is taking .
the obama government has recognized the importance of exports – the goal is to increase exports by five percent .
" the current administration has export at the top of its agenda , " thomas zielke says .
" obama has repeatedly said that he sees the future as being in manufacturing .
and he has put that directly in opposition to wall street and the financial crisis . "

christian wulff and his turkish counterpart abdullah gul together laid the foundation stone for a new german-turkish university in istanbul .
the project will combine the strength of both of the two countries systems of higher education , president wulff said . around 5,000 students are to begin studies at the university next year .
german universities are to provide professors and teachers and the courses are to be taught mainly in german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff visited the blue mosque in istanbul at the close of his visit , wulff described the five days as " extremely positive . "
" i have felt at every stage the trust felt towards germany , " he said on friday .
he said key issues had been discussed openly , and there had been agreement on all the essential political questions .
turkey , he said , was on its way to becoming a successful economy .
religion and integration topping the agenda wulff 's visit was the first by a german president to turkey in more than a decade , and came at a time of heightened tension in germany itself over the place of its ethnic minorities , of which turks form the largest group .
wulff also became the first german head of state to address the turkish parliament .
in his speech on tuesday , the president explicitly addressed the problem of the integration of turkish immigrants in german .
" our fellow citizens of turkish origin are welcome in our country , and belong to our country , " he said .
" as their president , i urge every immigrant to actively integrate in german society . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff was the first german president to adress the turkish parliament germany has around four million muslims among its population of 82 million , with 2.5 million turks forming the largest ethnic minority .
wulff also pushed for more freedom of religion for christians within turkey , taking part in a church service in the southern city of tartus , said to be the birthplace of paul the apostle .
on friday morning , the german president met with bartholomew i , the istanbul-based greek orthodox patriarch of constantinople .
he later visited the blue mosque and the hagia sophia , formerly a christian church .

but bribery is widespread .
the electoral system still has many pitfalls and china has not been too eager to incorporate more democratic elements . since 1986 villagers in china have been allowed to vote every three years .
they can elect the party chief of their village .
but only 20 percent of such elections are competitive .
often there is only one candidate , in some cases simply chosen by the communist party .
in many cases such elections are manipulated with votes being bought .
prosecutors in the southern chinese province of hainan found that bribes have gone up in recent years .
candidates used to pay villagers the equivalent of 1.50 us dollar for their support at the ballot box .
today the price has gone up to 177 dollars .
money for votes in villages where there are substantial assets such as land for leasing and other business opportunities , candidates are most likely to buy votes , says joseph cheng , chair professor of political science at the city university of hong kong .
" some village entrepreneurs like to get the position of the village chief for reasons of prestige or for the purpose of building networks .
so they are willing to spend money to secure their electoral position , " he explains .
civil society reports of bribery and other abuse in democratic processes at grassroots level can be seen regularly in the official chinese media .
it helps to convey the impression that democracy is a flawed concept .
the lack of a civil society in china is also a reason why people do not develop a feeling for democratic procedures , experts say .
but china is developing quickly , according to thomas heberer from duisburg university .
call for democratic reforms " one can now plan one 's life as one likes and not be directed by the state or the party any more .
this is the moment when individual autonomy gains in strength .
this is a precondition for building citizens .
and citizens are a precondition for establishing a civil society , " says heberer .
recently voices have been calling for democratic reform within the communist party , a demand reiterated by premier wen jiabao .
but his remarks have not been echoed by other leaders .
and the statements have not been reported by official state media .
keeping control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grassroots elections were introduced in the late 1980s .
china 's leaders are not elected by the people china ’ s leadership wants to contain democratic developments within the country .
they don ’ t want to implement anything that may get out of control . village elections have not advanced to higher levels because at town and township level the leaders are from the party cadres .
but if they are elected by the people , this will be in direct contradiction to the basic principle that the party controls the cadres .
still , there is some hope .
china ’ s future leaders are better educated and have more exposure to the western world .
some experts think that china ’ s potential future president xi jinping might introduce more democratic reforms after coming to power .
however , his father was a high ranking party official who condemned the pro-democracy crackdown in tiananmen square .
so far , says joseph cheng , xi jinping has not given any indication that he may be a great reformer .

although they are only preliminary results , they clearly show who the winners and losers are .
ratbil shamel has this opinion piece : now the secret , which never was one , is out .
the wolesi jirga , afghanistan ’ s lower house , will continue to be run by the country ’ s warlords over the next five years .
former mujahedin leaders and their allies have won in almost all the constituencies .
even in kabul , a city which at the beginning of the 1990s was almost completely destroyed by the battles between the various mujahedin groupings , the picture is the same .
hardly anybody in afghanistan is surprised by the results .
many had said even before the elections took place that they did not have any faith in afghanistan 's supposedly ' independent ' election commission -lrb- iec -rrb- .
and the fact that certain sections of the afghan population still went to vote has another explanation - they wanted to show that they , at least , take democracy seriously .
they went to the polls because they wanted to tell the world : " we afghans reject war , the taliban and extremism " .
many afghans perhaps don ’ t really know what democracy means or how a parliament functions but one thing that they know for sure is that a peaceful struggle is better than war .
and the people in afghanistan have been experiencing war for over 30 years .
yet hardly anyone is deluded enough to think that his / her vote makes a difference .
despite three elections in the past nine years , their lives have not improved for the better .
on the contrary .
the taliban are getting stronger and stronger by the day , while the government is becoming weaker .
and they know that the new parliament will not change much .
the erstwhile leaders of the mujahedin will certainly not fight for democratic reforms in the future .
their goal is clear - to strengthen their own position of power in the country .
this power will increase the more the international community pulls out of afghanistan .
some observers believe it will become increasingly difficult for president hamid karzai to govern but the opposite will be true .
karzai has long been counting on the mujahedin card .
his two deputies were chosen out of these ranks last year , despite national and international criticism .
but the real losers of this election , far more than hamid karzai , are the small democratic groupings in afghanistan .
in the past nine years , they have not managed to unite over a few common goals .
instead , they have founded countless political parties that carry no weight in afghanistan ’ s power struggle .
they fielded hundreds of candidates this time but will have to wake up to the fact that they have lost , again .
a further loser in these elections is the international community , especially the west .
democracy , peace and well-being were promised to the people of afghanistan almost a decade ago .
but the taliban and former warlords continue to determine the lives of the afghans .
afghanistan can not be left to the taliban and the warlords again .
the consequences of such a policy are clear to everybody – instability for the region and the world .

christian wulff and his turkish counterpart abdullah gul together laid the foundation stone for a new german-turkish university in istanbul .
the project will combine the strength of both of the two countries systems of higher education , president wulff said . around 5,000 students are to begin studies at the university next year .
german universities are to provide professors and teachers and the courses are to be taught mainly in german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff visited the blue mosque in istanbul at the close of his visit , wulff described the five days as " extremely positive . "
" i have felt at every stage the trust felt towards germany , " he said on friday .
he said key issues had been discussed openly , and there had been agreement on all the essential political questions .
turkey , he said , was on its way to becoming a successful economy .
religion and integration topping the agenda wulff 's visit was the first by a german president to turkey in more than a decade , and came at a time of heightened tension in germany itself over the place of its ethnic minorities , of which turks form the largest group .
wulff also became the first german head of state to address the turkish parliament .
in his speech on tuesday , the president explicitly addressed the problem of the integration of turkish immigrants in german .
" our fellow citizens of turkish origin are welcome in our country , and belong to our country , " he said .
" as their president , i urge every immigrant to actively integrate in german society . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff was the first german president to adress the turkish parliament germany has around four million muslims among its population of 82 million , with 2.5 million turks forming the largest ethnic minority .
wulff also pushed for more freedom of religion for christians within turkey , taking part in a church service in the southern city of tartus , said to be the birthplace of paul the apostle .
on friday morning , the german president met with bartholomew i , the istanbul-based greek orthodox patriarch of constantinople .
he later visited the blue mosque and the hagia sophia , formerly a christian church .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 22.10.2010 as new powers emerge , political realism drives global agenda großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil , russia , india and china are pursuing their national interests as they gain in power the us and the eu campaigned for a common world order based on liberal values such as democracy and human rights .
but as the balance of power shifts toward developing countries , national interests are trumping values . during the 1990s , the advanced democracies of north america and western europe emerged as the powerbrokers of global politics .
russia shrank from the world stage as it slid into chaos after the collapse of the soviet union .
and the large developing countries - such as brazil , india and china - remained preoccupied with their own internal reforms .
as a consequence , the united states and the european union began to construct a world order based on liberal vales . they promoted a doctrine of free trade , democracy and human rights .
those nations that accepted - or at least did not challenge -these " international norms " were integrated into a growing network of economic globalization .
this network was governed by institutions such as the world trade organization , the international monetary fund and the world bank . meanwhile , leaders who actively undermined the liberal rules of the game - such as slobodan milosevic and saddam hussein - faced crippling sanctions and devastating airstrikes .
integration and confrontation became two sides of the same coin .
but in the new millennium a more diverse group of countries is sharing world power , which has made it difficult to form a consensus around a common global agenda .
as brazil , russia , india and china - often referred to as the brics - confidently pursue their own national interests , the liberal international order is buckling .
political paralysis in the west nearly a decade ago , developed and developing nations agreed in doha , qatar to a round of multilateral negotiations that would reduce poverty through trade liberalization .
the goal was to eliminate economic barriers that prevented poorer countries from sharing in the benefits of globalization .
although political leaders in the us and eu had traditionally championed free trade , they now found it politically difficult to turn the doha round into a final settlement .
the business community felt they were not getting enough , while labor unions believed an agreement would outsource more jobs to the developing world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the doha round failed , sparking criticism of the wto in the developing world meanwhile , the brics - which once opposed liberalization as an instrument of imperialism - now championed free trade .
the failure of state socialism and protectionism had pushed brazil , russia , india and china toward a model of export-led growth that depended on an open global economy .
" there 's an irony here , " jagdish bhagwati , an expert on international trade with the council on foreign relations and a professor at columbia university in new york , told deutsche welle .
" if you look at what leaders are doing - obama is probably the worst but sarkozy comes pretty close - the leadership itself seems to be hamstrung and paralyzed in an inability to celebrate the openness of markets . "
as the brics profited from openness , a growing number of voices in the us and eu began to view trade as a zero-sum game .
as a result , the doha round collapsed .
" it just means that we are not pushing forward , " bhagwati said .
" the real question during a time of recession is not moving backwards into additional protectionism . "
emerging powers take initiative in response to the doha round 's collapse and the onset of the economic crisis , the brics began to strengthen their relations among one another .
yet political differences between these countries have prevented them from forging a true alliance .
the democratic nations of india , brazil as well as south africa have established their own dialogue .
in turn , the autocratic regimes of russia and china have separately signed a series of agreements deepening what they call a " strategic partnership of cooperation . "
however , these nations do find common ground in their skepticism of the us and the eu 's international agenda .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and the eu have often spread their values in the developing world through force the us and the eu made human rights and democracy a central part of their foreign policies , jointly applying military force to spread these liberal norms in the balkans and afghanistan .
and the us unilaterally imposed these norms in iraq .
in contrast , the brics emphasize national sovereignty and non-intervention as a means to avoid unnecessary confrontation as they further their economic development . " there is a strong old north-south mindset in the world and that ties to a set of neutral countries in opposition to western imperialism , " thomas carothers , an expert on democracy and the rule of law with the carnegie endowment for international peace , told deutsche welle .
" as we move out of that mindset we could go in two directions , " carothers continued .
" they -lsb- brics -rsb- could begin to see the value of an international community based on norms ; or they could stick with the feeling of being pushed around by larger powers and have an emphasis on sovereignty . "
the return of realpolitik the us and the eu remain critically important in world politics , but their relative power is declining .
in response , they may be forced to make political compromises in order to coopt the new powers .
the global agenda rooted in democracy and human rights could give way to a more pragmatic approach .
finding common ground between emerging and established powers would mean focusing on economic interests instead of liberal norms .
" they -lsb- emerging powers -rsb- do n't choose their partners based on human rights or democracy , " daniel flemes , an expert on regional powers and the new world order with the german institute for global and area studies , told deutsche welle .
" their foreign policies are oriented toward their interests . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a club of great powers could emerge out of the g20 and it is difficult for the emerging powers to advance their interests within the current institutions - such as the imf and world bank - dominated by established powers , flemes said .
as a consequence , informal venues such as the g20 are becoming more important .
a club of great powers could emerge out of the g20 , and these great powers may then negotiate their interests among each other , he continued .
this development would indicate that realpolitik , the pragmatic emphasis on maintaining a stable balance of power , has trumped liberal norms in global politics .
but carothers believes that promoting these liberal norms is in fact rooted in pragmatism , since no country has become wealthy and industrialized without democratizing , and that powers like russia and china will ultimately have to go down that path toward democracy . " these international norms do reflect a more global approach to economy and society , " he said .

but as the balance of power shifts toward developing countries , national interests are trumping values . during the 1990s , the advanced democracies of north america and western europe emerged as the powerbrokers of global politics .
russia shrank from the world stage as it slid into chaos after the collapse of the soviet union .
and the large developing countries - such as brazil , india and china - remained preoccupied with their own internal reforms .
as a consequence , the united states and the european union began to construct a world order based on liberal vales . they promoted a doctrine of free trade , democracy and human rights .
those nations that accepted - or at least did not challenge -these " international norms " were integrated into a growing network of economic globalization .
this network was governed by institutions such as the world trade organization , the international monetary fund and the world bank . meanwhile , leaders who actively undermined the liberal rules of the game - such as slobodan milosevic and saddam hussein - faced crippling sanctions and devastating airstrikes .
integration and confrontation became two sides of the same coin .
but in the new millennium a more diverse group of countries is sharing world power , which has made it difficult to form a consensus around a common global agenda .
as brazil , russia , india and china - often referred to as the brics - confidently pursue their own national interests , the liberal international order is buckling .
political paralysis in the west nearly a decade ago , developed and developing nations agreed in doha , qatar to a round of multilateral negotiations that would reduce poverty through trade liberalization .
the goal was to eliminate economic barriers that prevented poorer countries from sharing in the benefits of globalization .
although political leaders in the us and eu had traditionally championed free trade , they now found it politically difficult to turn the doha round into a final settlement .
the business community felt they were not getting enough , while labor unions believed an agreement would outsource more jobs to the developing world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the doha round failed , sparking criticism of the wto in the developing world meanwhile , the brics - which once opposed liberalization as an instrument of imperialism - now championed free trade .
the failure of state socialism and protectionism had pushed brazil , russia , india and china toward a model of export-led growth that depended on an open global economy .
" there 's an irony here , " jagdish bhagwati , an expert on international trade with the council on foreign relations and a professor at columbia university in new york , told deutsche welle .
" if you look at what leaders are doing - obama is probably the worst but sarkozy comes pretty close - the leadership itself seems to be hamstrung and paralyzed in an inability to celebrate the openness of markets . "
as the brics profited from openness , a growing number of voices in the us and eu began to view trade as a zero-sum game .
as a result , the doha round collapsed .
" it just means that we are not pushing forward , " bhagwati said .
" the real question during a time of recession is not moving backwards into additional protectionism . "
emerging powers take initiative in response to the doha round 's collapse and the onset of the economic crisis , the brics began to strengthen their relations among one another .
yet political differences between these countries have prevented them from forging a true alliance .
the democratic nations of india , brazil as well as south africa have established their own dialogue .
in turn , the autocratic regimes of russia and china have separately signed a series of agreements deepening what they call a " strategic partnership of cooperation . "
however , these nations do find common ground in their skepticism of the us and the eu 's international agenda .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and the eu have often spread their values in the developing world through force the us and the eu made human rights and democracy a central part of their foreign policies , jointly applying military force to spread these liberal norms in the balkans and afghanistan .
and the us unilaterally imposed these norms in iraq .
in contrast , the brics emphasize national sovereignty and non-intervention as a means to avoid unnecessary confrontation as they further their economic development . " there is a strong old north-south mindset in the world and that ties to a set of neutral countries in opposition to western imperialism , " thomas carothers , an expert on democracy and the rule of law with the carnegie endowment for international peace , told deutsche welle .
" as we move out of that mindset we could go in two directions , " carothers continued .
" they -lsb- brics -rsb- could begin to see the value of an international community based on norms ; or they could stick with the feeling of being pushed around by larger powers and have an emphasis on sovereignty . "
the return of realpolitik the us and the eu remain critically important in world politics , but their relative power is declining .
in response , they may be forced to make political compromises in order to coopt the new powers .
the global agenda rooted in democracy and human rights could give way to a more pragmatic approach .
finding common ground between emerging and established powers would mean focusing on economic interests instead of liberal norms .
" they -lsb- emerging powers -rsb- do n't choose their partners based on human rights or democracy , " daniel flemes , an expert on regional powers and the new world order with the german institute for global and area studies , told deutsche welle .
" their foreign policies are oriented toward their interests . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a club of great powers could emerge out of the g20 and it is difficult for the emerging powers to advance their interests within the current institutions - such as the imf and world bank - dominated by established powers , flemes said .
as a consequence , informal venues such as the g20 are becoming more important .
a club of great powers could emerge out of the g20 , and these great powers may then negotiate their interests among each other , he continued .
this development would indicate that realpolitik , the pragmatic emphasis on maintaining a stable balance of power , has trumped liberal norms in global politics .
but carothers believes that promoting these liberal norms is in fact rooted in pragmatism , since no country has become wealthy and industrialized without democratizing , and that powers like russia and china will ultimately have to go down that path toward democracy . " these international norms do reflect a more global approach to economy and society , " he said .
" we have to be more confident that over time we will ultimately find that our interests lie in a more normative international community . " author : spencer kimball editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but as the balance of power shifts toward developing countries , national interests are trumping values . during the 1990s , the advanced democracies of north america and western europe emerged as the powerbrokers of global politics .
russia shrank from the world stage as it slid into chaos after the collapse of the soviet union .
and the large developing countries - such as brazil , india and china - remained preoccupied with their own internal reforms .
as a consequence , the united states and the european union began to construct a world order based on liberal vales . they promoted a doctrine of free trade , democracy and human rights .
those nations that accepted - or at least did not challenge -these " international norms " were integrated into a growing network of economic globalization .
this network was governed by institutions such as the world trade organization , the international monetary fund and the world bank . meanwhile , leaders who actively undermined the liberal rules of the game - such as slobodan milosevic and saddam hussein - faced crippling sanctions and devastating airstrikes .
integration and confrontation became two sides of the same coin .
but in the new millennium a more diverse group of countries is sharing world power , which has made it difficult to form a consensus around a common global agenda .
as brazil , russia , india and china - often referred to as the brics - confidently pursue their own national interests , the liberal international order is buckling .
political paralysis in the west nearly a decade ago , developed and developing nations agreed in doha , qatar to a round of multilateral negotiations that would reduce poverty through trade liberalization .
the goal was to eliminate economic barriers that prevented poorer countries from sharing in the benefits of globalization .
although political leaders in the us and eu had traditionally championed free trade , they now found it politically difficult to turn the doha round into a final settlement .
the business community felt they were not getting enough , while labor unions believed an agreement would outsource more jobs to the developing world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the doha round failed , sparking criticism of the wto in the developing world meanwhile , the brics - which once opposed liberalization as an instrument of imperialism - now championed free trade .
the failure of state socialism and protectionism had pushed brazil , russia , india and china toward a model of export-led growth that depended on an open global economy .
" there 's an irony here , " jagdish bhagwati , an expert on international trade with the council on foreign relations and a professor at columbia university in new york , told deutsche welle .
" if you look at what leaders are doing - obama is probably the worst but sarkozy comes pretty close - the leadership itself seems to be hamstrung and paralyzed in an inability to celebrate the openness of markets . "
as the brics profited from openness , a growing number of voices in the us and eu began to view trade as a zero-sum game .
as a result , the doha round collapsed .
" it just means that we are not pushing forward , " bhagwati said .
" the real question during a time of recession is not moving backwards into additional protectionism . "
emerging powers take initiative in response to the doha round 's collapse and the onset of the economic crisis , the brics began to strengthen their relations among one another .
yet political differences between these countries have prevented them from forging a true alliance .
the democratic nations of india , brazil as well as south africa have established their own dialogue .
in turn , the autocratic regimes of russia and china have separately signed a series of agreements deepening what they call a " strategic partnership of cooperation . "
however , these nations do find common ground in their skepticism of the us and the eu 's international agenda .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and the eu have often spread their values in the developing world through force the us and the eu made human rights and democracy a central part of their foreign policies , jointly applying military force to spread these liberal norms in the balkans and afghanistan .
and the us unilaterally imposed these norms in iraq .
in contrast , the brics emphasize national sovereignty and non-intervention as a means to avoid unnecessary confrontation as they further their economic development . " there is a strong old north-south mindset in the world and that ties to a set of neutral countries in opposition to western imperialism , " thomas carothers , an expert on democracy and the rule of law with the carnegie endowment for international peace , told deutsche welle .
" as we move out of that mindset we could go in two directions , " carothers continued .
" they -lsb- brics -rsb- could begin to see the value of an international community based on norms ; or they could stick with the feeling of being pushed around by larger powers and have an emphasis on sovereignty . "
the return of realpolitik the us and the eu remain critically important in world politics , but their relative power is declining .
in response , they may be forced to make political compromises in order to coopt the new powers .
the global agenda rooted in democracy and human rights could give way to a more pragmatic approach .
finding common ground between emerging and established powers would mean focusing on economic interests instead of liberal norms .
" they -lsb- emerging powers -rsb- do n't choose their partners based on human rights or democracy , " daniel flemes , an expert on regional powers and the new world order with the german institute for global and area studies , told deutsche welle .
" their foreign policies are oriented toward their interests . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a club of great powers could emerge out of the g20 and it is difficult for the emerging powers to advance their interests within the current institutions - such as the imf and world bank - dominated by established powers , flemes said .
as a consequence , informal venues such as the g20 are becoming more important .
a club of great powers could emerge out of the g20 , and these great powers may then negotiate their interests among each other , he continued .
this development would indicate that realpolitik , the pragmatic emphasis on maintaining a stable balance of power , has trumped liberal norms in global politics .
but carothers believes that promoting these liberal norms is in fact rooted in pragmatism , since no country has become wealthy and industrialized without democratizing , and that powers like russia and china will ultimately have to go down that path toward democracy . " these international norms do reflect a more global approach to economy and society , " he said .
" we have to be more confident that over time we will ultimately find that our interests lie in a more normative international community . " author : spencer kimball editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 22.10.2010 european online risk study shows many parents clueless , kids blasé großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children are online at an increasingly young age more than one in eight european children has been upset by online content , a new eu study on internet risks shows .
but the study also showed that most children had had no upsetting experiences with the internet at all . a large majority of those interviewed for the study eu kids online reported no negative experiences at all online , results of the european union study " risks and safety on the internet " showed .
but the study also showed that parents are frequently out of touch with their kids ' virtual lives .
the european union and london school of economics survey was presented thursday at the safer internet forum in luxembourg , and included interviews with thousands of kids across europe from ireland to turkey .
among its findings , the study showed that an average of 12 percent of european children had been bothered or upset by something they experienced online .
these included encountering pornography , sexual or bullying messages , or having their personal data revealed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , just eight percent of kids said they were bothered by an online event indeed , the study showed that 39 percent of those questioned had had encountered a " risky " behavior - such as communicating with new people not met face-to-face , or seeing user-generated content that is potentially harmful , such as hate , self-harm , or drug-taking content .
but only a portion of those asked said they had been upset or bothered by it .
in germany , the percentage of kids who said they were upset by an online experience was , at eight percent , near the lowest end of the scale .
only portugal -lrb- seven percent -rrb- and italy -lrb- six percent -rrb- were lower .
topping the percentages of those most bothered or upset were children in denmark -lrb- 26 percent -rrb- , estonia -lrb- 25 percent -rrb- and romania and sweden -lrb- 21 percent . -rrb-
discrepancy due to ' schoolyard monopoly ' uwe hasebrink , a professor at hamburg 's hans bredow institute for media research , led the german arm of the study .
in an interview with the hamburg abendblatt newspaper , he said that german children " are in less danger " of meeting harmful content because they use the internet " less frequently and with less variety " than kids in other countries .
but markus beckedahl , whose blog netzpolitik.org focuses on the intersection between the internet and german politics , said he found it hard to understand the response gap between countries like denmark and sweden , and germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say parents , not children , should be targets of information campaigns " the study said that countries with high internet usage have more problems , " beckedahl told deutsche welle . " but something like 99 percent of german kids have internet access , and i do n't think they have more more internet usage in denmark . "
one big difference could be the fact that a huge portion of the social-network market for kids and teens in germany takes place on german-only networks like " schuelervz " -lrb- " student directory , " -rrb- german schoolkids ' version of facebook .
" these platforms have a near monopoly on the schoolyard , " he added . " maybe that makes the difference - in germany , the kids are in closed communities , and in other countries they are just on the internet . "
the age factor other poll findings showed children were using the internet at increasingly young ages : an average of seven in sweden and eight in several other northern european countries .
interviewers , who spoke with 23,000 children between the ages of nine and 16 , found it was the youngest children who had the hardest time coping with disturbing material online .
in response to this finding , the study recommended targeting spending and advice at younger age groups to reduce risk and enhance the opportunities of the internet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : younger children had more trouble coping with upsetting experiences parents were frequently unaware of the risks to which their children had been exposed , the study showed .
for example , more than half of parents whose children said they had been bullied online , said they knew nothing of the situation .
moreover , some 41 percent of parents whose child had seen sexual images online said their child had n't , and 61 percent of parents whose children had met offline with an online contact , also said their child had n't .
beckedahl added that parents should ideally " be aware what their kids are doing , and they should talk to them about what kind of experiences they are having on the internet . "
the study also found that while the overwhelming majority of european kids in the study use the internet at home -lrb- 85 percent -rrb- , many children do have private time to use the internet .
48 percent use it in their bedroom , and 31 percent via a mobile phone or other handheld device .
in some countries , like the united kingdom , ireland and sweden , over one in five young people use the internet regularly on a handheld device .
supporting education - for educators beckedahl acknowledged that because of this separation between parents and when their children are online , and their lack of awareness of where their kids go online , it may make things difficult for the parents to keep up . " parents often lack literacy in the social networks their children are using , " he said .
" they have no clue what kind of experiences and user interaction their kids would have , and they do n't really know what can happen . " his suggestion : shifting germany 's ongoing campaigns for media literacy away from children , and toward parents and teachers .
" peer to peer education exists already - children figure out how these platforms work themselves , " he noted . " the problem is , their parents and teachers are n't able to teach them to behave correctly , and prevent risks . "
the study 's authors plan to publish official conclusions and recommendations in november .
but even in thier preliminary findings , they acknowledge that the harmful potential of the internet is counterbalanced - if not easily outweighed - by the medium 's benefits .
plus , they note that a majority of the kids polled said they had not had any harmful experiences with the internet at all .
for his part , beckedahl would like to see the german debate on internet usage lose its negative tone .
" our debate about the internet needs to become more positive , " he said . " it is one of the greatest tools we ever had .
but if we only talk about the risks , people will fear the internet . "

although political leaders in the us and eu had traditionally championed free trade , they now found it politically difficult to turn the doha round into a final settlement .
the business community felt they were not getting enough , while labor unions believed an agreement would outsource more jobs to the developing world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the doha round failed , sparking criticism of the wto in the developing world meanwhile , the brics - which once opposed liberalization as an instrument of imperialism - now championed free trade .
the failure of state socialism and protectionism had pushed brazil , russia , india and china toward a model of export-led growth that depended on an open global economy .
" there 's an irony here , " jagdish bhagwati , an expert on international trade with the council on foreign relations and a professor at columbia university in new york , told deutsche welle .
" if you look at what leaders are doing - obama is probably the worst but sarkozy comes pretty close - the leadership itself seems to be hamstrung and paralyzed in an inability to celebrate the openness of markets . "
as the brics profited from openness , a growing number of voices in the us and eu began to view trade as a zero-sum game .
as a result , the doha round collapsed .
" it just means that we are not pushing forward , " bhagwati said .
" the real question during a time of recession is not moving backwards into additional protectionism . "
emerging powers take initiative in response to the doha round 's collapse and the onset of the economic crisis , the brics began to strengthen their relations among one another .
yet political differences between these countries have prevented them from forging a true alliance .
the democratic nations of india , brazil as well as south africa have established their own dialogue .
in turn , the autocratic regimes of russia and china have separately signed a series of agreements deepening what they call a " strategic partnership of cooperation . "
however , these nations do find common ground in their skepticism of the us and the eu 's international agenda .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and the eu have often spread their values in the developing world through force the us and the eu made human rights and democracy a central part of their foreign policies , jointly applying military force to spread these liberal norms in the balkans and afghanistan .
and the us unilaterally imposed these norms in iraq .
in contrast , the brics emphasize national sovereignty and non-intervention as a means to avoid unnecessary confrontation as they further their economic development . " there is a strong old north-south mindset in the world and that ties to a set of neutral countries in opposition to western imperialism , " thomas carothers , an expert on democracy and the rule of law with the carnegie endowment for international peace , told deutsche welle .
" as we move out of that mindset we could go in two directions , " carothers continued .
" they -lsb- brics -rsb- could begin to see the value of an international community based on norms ; or they could stick with the feeling of being pushed around by larger powers and have an emphasis on sovereignty . "
the return of realpolitik the us and the eu remain critically important in world politics , but their relative power is declining .
in response , they may be forced to make political compromises in order to coopt the new powers .
the global agenda rooted in democracy and human rights could give way to a more pragmatic approach .
finding common ground between emerging and established powers would mean focusing on economic interests instead of liberal norms .
" they -lsb- emerging powers -rsb- do n't choose their partners based on human rights or democracy , " daniel flemes , an expert on regional powers and the new world order with the german institute for global and area studies , told deutsche welle .
" their foreign policies are oriented toward their interests . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a club of great powers could emerge out of the g20 and it is difficult for the emerging powers to advance their interests within the current institutions - such as the imf and world bank - dominated by established powers , flemes said .
as a consequence , informal venues such as the g20 are becoming more important .
a club of great powers could emerge out of the g20 , and these great powers may then negotiate their interests among each other , he continued .
this development would indicate that realpolitik , the pragmatic emphasis on maintaining a stable balance of power , has trumped liberal norms in global politics .
but carothers believes that promoting these liberal norms is in fact rooted in pragmatism , since no country has become wealthy and industrialized without democratizing , and that powers like russia and china will ultimately have to go down that path toward democracy . " these international norms do reflect a more global approach to economy and society , " he said .
" we have to be more confident that over time we will ultimately find that our interests lie in a more normative international community . " author : spencer kimball editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bayern needs points if they hope to free themselves of the rut that has them currently sitting in ninth place in the table .
" hamburg had the big chances , " said bayern captain philipp lahm , " so there are times when you have to be satisfied with one point . "
bayern have been deeply cut by a swathe of injuries this season and played without several key players friday , including mark van bommel , daniel van buyten and miroslav klose .
' better than nothing ' fourth-place hamburg could have used a win to gain ground on bayer leverkusen .
the two teams are currently even at 15 points with leverkusen ahead on goals , but leverkusen could widen the gap again on sunday with a win against mainz .
the match was relatively even , although hamburg did have better chances to score .
that included a very near-miss by jonathan pitroipa , who only had bayern keeper joerg butt to beat but bounced his shot off the right post .
" pitroipa should have scored , " hamburg coach armin veh said after the game .
" -lrb- but -rrb- at least we kept a clean sheet . "
" better one point against bayern than none , " added hamburg 's captain heiko westermann .

christian wulff and his turkish counterpart abdullah gul together laid the foundation stone for a new german-turkish university in istanbul .
the project will combine the strength of both of the two countries systems of higher education , president wulff said . around 5,000 students are to begin studies at the university next year .
german universities are to provide professors and teachers and the courses are to be taught mainly in german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff visited the blue mosque in istanbul at the close of his visit , wulff described the five days as " extremely positive . "
" i have felt at every stage the trust felt towards germany , " he said on friday .
he said key issues had been discussed openly , and there had been agreement on all the essential political questions .
turkey , he said , was on its way to becoming a successful economy .
religion and integration topping the agenda wulff 's visit was the first by a german president to turkey in more than a decade , and came at a time of heightened tension in germany itself over the place of its ethnic minorities , of which turks form the largest group .
wulff also became the first german head of state to address the turkish parliament .
in his speech on tuesday , the president explicitly addressed the problem of the integration of turkish immigrants in german .
" our fellow citizens of turkish origin are welcome in our country , and belong to our country , " he said .
" as their president , i urge every immigrant to actively integrate in german society . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff was the first german president to adress the turkish parliament germany has around four million muslims among its population of 82 million , with 2.5 million turks forming the largest ethnic minority .
wulff also pushed for more freedom of religion for christians within turkey , taking part in a church service in the southern city of tartus , said to be the birthplace of paul the apostle .
on friday morning , the german president met with bartholomew i , the istanbul-based greek orthodox patriarch of constantinople .
he later visited the blue mosque and the hagia sophia , formerly a christian church .

but in the wake of the global crisis , it 's germany that 's emerging with ease , which countries like the us can learn from . unemployment figures in germany are down to 1992 levels , and german exports are on the rise as if the global economic crisis had never happened .
in comparison , the economy in the united states is doing a lot worse : unemployment stands high at 9.6 percent , and growth rates are far from the positive figures that are coming out of germany .
and yet , there 's no secret recipe behind the success of the german economy , says thomas zielke , deputy delegate of the german economy in washington – it all comes down to exports , he told deutsche welle .
" it 's that great flexibility of companies , and the will to expand .
people are simply used to focusing on exports , " zielke said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shapiro says germany has been well prepared for the crisis that 's not necessarily the case in the us , he says , where companies are used to relying much more on their own domestic market .
in the united states , exports only make up 13 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , but the figure in germany is more than three times higher .
and while most of germany 's exports are going to other eu countries , the biggest growth rates are in exports to the rest of the world .
investing in exports if the domestic market crumbles in a time of recession , companies have little choice other than to invest in exports , robert shapiro , economic advisor to the us government , told deutsche welle .
" that has always been germany 's strength , " he said .
" the country has been very well prepared for that . "
there are other factors behind germany 's success in handling the crisis that shapiro and his colleagues have taken a closer look at .
one example is government action , such as subsidizing shortened working hours .

" you just have much more flexibility than on the us market .
here the gut reaction is always : when the sales go down , people have to be fired .
and when the demand is back , there 's a lack of workers . "
too much government involvement ?
but shapiro cautions against simply adapting that system to the us economy .
cultural differences are part of the problem – americans are traditionally opposed to their government getting involved in running businesses .
he also warned that despite the currently positive outlook there are still many risks for germany .
european monetary policy is too fragile , he says , as it has to balance between the interests of all the eu member states .
the danger of countries running bankrupt is still there .
greece for instance has not seen its situation improve as much as the rest of europe had hoped it would .
and other member states like ireland or spain are still struggling to avoid a crisis .
a moral price to pay shapiro and kirkegaard agree that germany 's exports to china are also not without a downside .
there 's a moral price to pay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us economy is struggling despite austerity measures " germany is rather careful in criticizing china because of course berlin does not want to put its exports at risk .
the us however are much more outspoken .
but that of course has an impact on us exports to china . "
and still , the us already seem to be readjusting their economic policy to follow more in the direction that germany is taking .
the obama government has recognized the importance of exports – the goal is to increase exports by five percent .
" the current administration has export at the top of its agenda , " thomas zielke says .
" obama has repeatedly said that he sees the future as being in manufacturing .
and he has put that directly in opposition to wall street and the financial crisis . "

the us however are much more outspoken .
but that of course has an impact on us exports to china . "
and still , the us already seem to be readjusting their economic policy to follow more in the direction that germany is taking .
the obama government has recognized the importance of exports – the goal is to increase exports by five percent .
" the current administration has export at the top of its agenda , " thomas zielke says .
" obama has repeatedly said that he sees the future as being in manufacturing .
and he has put that directly in opposition to wall street and the financial crisis . "

although they are only preliminary results , they clearly show who the winners and losers are .
ratbil shamel has this opinion piece : now the secret , which never was one , is out .
the wolesi jirga , afghanistan ’ s lower house , will continue to be run by the country ’ s warlords over the next five years .
former mujahedin leaders and their allies have won in almost all the constituencies .
even in kabul , a city which at the beginning of the 1990s was almost completely destroyed by the battles between the various mujahedin groupings , the picture is the same .
hardly anybody in afghanistan is surprised by the results .
many had said even before the elections took place that they did not have any faith in afghanistan 's supposedly ' independent ' election commission -lrb- iec -rrb- .
and the fact that certain sections of the afghan population still went to vote has another explanation - they wanted to show that they , at least , take democracy seriously .
they went to the polls because they wanted to tell the world : " we afghans reject war , the taliban and extremism " .
many afghans perhaps don ’ t really know what democracy means or how a parliament functions but one thing that they know for sure is that a peaceful struggle is better than war .
and the people in afghanistan have been experiencing war for over 30 years .
yet hardly anyone is deluded enough to think that his / her vote makes a difference .
despite three elections in the past nine years , their lives have not improved for the better .
on the contrary .
the taliban are getting stronger and stronger by the day , while the government is becoming weaker .
and they know that the new parliament will not change much .
the erstwhile leaders of the mujahedin will certainly not fight for democratic reforms in the future .
their goal is clear - to strengthen their own position of power in the country .
this power will increase the more the international community pulls out of afghanistan .
some observers believe it will become increasingly difficult for president hamid karzai to govern but the opposite will be true .
karzai has long been counting on the mujahedin card .
his two deputies were chosen out of these ranks last year , despite national and international criticism .
but the real losers of this election , far more than hamid karzai , are the small democratic groupings in afghanistan .
in the past nine years , they have not managed to unite over a few common goals .
instead , they have founded countless political parties that carry no weight in afghanistan ’ s power struggle .
they fielded hundreds of candidates this time but will have to wake up to the fact that they have lost , again .
a further loser in these elections is the international community , especially the west .
democracy , peace and well-being were promised to the people of afghanistan almost a decade ago .
but the taliban and former warlords continue to determine the lives of the afghans .
afghanistan can not be left to the taliban and the warlords again .
the consequences of such a policy are clear to everybody – instability for the region and the world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 22.10.2010 airbus chief says subsidy spat with boeing helps emerging rivals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus-boeing battle is good news for competitors the head of airbus has called the protracted row between his company and boeing over state subsidies " absurd , " saying the fight only benefits up-and-coming aircraft makers , who could pose a threat to the two giants . tom enders , the ceo of airbus , gave a candid assessment of the six-year battle between europe and the us , saying " both are guilty " of receiving subsidies that that contravene world trade organization rules and which the trade watchdog says distort competition . " let 's be honest about it , the simple truth is , in the aerospace or aeronautic business , none of us , none of the companies that play a role in it , has been growing without any government support , " enders told attendees of an aviation club lunch in london .
" so let 's accept reality . " in addition , the airbus chief said , the fight over subsidies could " accelerate the ascendancy " of aircraft manufacturers from countries such as china , russia and brazil , who are working on releasing new models that could pose direct threats to the current duopoly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ceo enders has been unusually frank about the wto battle " if we talk about china , if we talk about russia or others , does anyone in this room believe that they will step back and say : ' now we understand the wto rules , we will play exactly by the rules ' ? " he said .
" absolutely not , so this is why i call this an absurdity . " long quarrel europe 's airbus and chicago-based boeing , the globe 's first and second largest aircraft manufacturers , have been arguing their cases before the wto since 2004 .
the united states initiated wto dispute procedures then about subsidies to the european aircraft industry .
in response , the eu launched similar proceedings against the us . since then , the trans-atlantic dispute has become bogged down and a swift resolution does not appear to be on the horizon .
in a ruling at the end of june , the wto did fault europe over aid to airbus , saying the company has received subsidies in the form of loans from european governments at below market-rates and without maturity dates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus got a slap on the wrist in a wto ruling this summer however , airbus responded by saying the wto had thrown out several of the other charges brought by the us .
in a counter claim , airbus accused boeing of getting tax breaks from washington as well as money from nasa research funds and argues that much us defense research , funded by the pentagon , is of a dual technology nature and ends up being transferred over to the us civil aviation sector . it is likely that any resolution will only come after years of appeals by both sides . " it 's hard to see how it ends right now , " paul sheridan , an aviation analyst at london-based ascend worldwide , told deutsche welle .
" you could take the wto report about airbus and take boeing 's response and switch the names and it would probably look pretty similar .
they seem to be both accusing each other of the same thing . " new guys in town in the meantime , a group of new players is arriving on the scene , ready to release products that could go head to head with boeing and airbus ' headliners . one big worry in chicago and toulouse , airbus ' home base , is the commercial aircraft corporation of china ltd , or comac .
its 919 model , due to come on the market in 2016 , will directly compete with the airbus a320 and boeing 's 737 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's comac is making airbus and boeing nervous " airbus and boeing should be very worried about comac as a rival to their duopoly " sheridan said .
" comac is state-owned and once the chinese government demonstrates a willingness to do something they usually follow through with it . " other manufacturers , such as canada 's bombardier , brazil 's embraer or russia 's sukhoi are seeking to gain a foothold in the lucrative civil aviation market .
bombardier 's single-aisle plane is due to enter service in 2013 and will also pose a threat to the a320 and 737 . " airbus is saying to boeing that they need to resolve this whole issue , " zafar khan , an aviation expert at sg securities , told deutsche welle .
" while we 're squabbling , enders is saying , those other countries are all subsidizing their industries . " enders said there will probably be five or six commercial aircraft manufacturers in the next 10 years , which means the industry will be faced with new questions about consolidations , partnerships and mergers . subsides and the future subsidies , although disliked by the wto , are almost a given in the aviation industry , experts say .
that is partly due to the expense of producing the product , but also from the benefits governments see from having a successful aerospace player . " when it comes to the aerospace industry , everyone is looking for help from governments because these are major , major undertakings and governments clearly see them as strategically important businesses to have , " khan said . in a related development , negotiators from the european union and other countries , including the us , japan and brazil , are meeting in canada to talk about financing planes in each other 's home markets - and specifically , how much government assistance is allowed . the old rules saw an aviation deal dominated by the us and europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 22.10.2010 european online risk study shows many parents clueless , kids blasé großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children are online at an increasingly young age more than one in eight european children has been upset by online content , a new eu study on internet risks shows .
but the study also showed that most children had had no upsetting experiences with the internet at all . a large majority of those interviewed for the study eu kids online reported no negative experiences at all online , results of the european union study " risks and safety on the internet " showed .
but the study also showed that parents are frequently out of touch with their kids ' virtual lives .
the european union and london school of economics survey was presented thursday at the safer internet forum in luxembourg , and included interviews with thousands of kids across europe from ireland to turkey .
among its findings , the study showed that an average of 12 percent of european children had been bothered or upset by something they experienced online .
these included encountering pornography , sexual or bullying messages , or having their personal data revealed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , just eight percent of kids said they were bothered by an online event indeed , the study showed that 39 percent of those questioned had had encountered a " risky " behavior - such as communicating with new people not met face-to-face , or seeing user-generated content that is potentially harmful , such as hate , self-harm , or drug-taking content .
but only a portion of those asked said they had been upset or bothered by it .
in germany , the percentage of kids who said they were upset by an online experience was , at eight percent , near the lowest end of the scale .
only portugal -lrb- seven percent -rrb- and italy -lrb- six percent -rrb- were lower .
topping the percentages of those most bothered or upset were children in denmark -lrb- 26 percent -rrb- , estonia -lrb- 25 percent -rrb- and romania and sweden -lrb- 21 percent . -rrb-
discrepancy due to ' schoolyard monopoly ' uwe hasebrink , a professor at hamburg 's hans bredow institute for media research , led the german arm of the study .
in an interview with the hamburg abendblatt newspaper , he said that german children " are in less danger " of meeting harmful content because they use the internet " less frequently and with less variety " than kids in other countries .
but markus beckedahl , whose blog netzpolitik.org focuses on the intersection between the internet and german politics , said he found it hard to understand the response gap between countries like denmark and sweden , and germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say parents , not children , should be targets of information campaigns " the study said that countries with high internet usage have more problems , " beckedahl told deutsche welle . " but something like 99 percent of german kids have internet access , and i do n't think they have more more internet usage in denmark . "
one big difference could be the fact that a huge portion of the social-network market for kids and teens in germany takes place on german-only networks like " schuelervz " -lrb- " student directory , " -rrb- german schoolkids ' version of facebook .
" these platforms have a near monopoly on the schoolyard , " he added . " maybe that makes the difference - in germany , the kids are in closed communities , and in other countries they are just on the internet . "
the age factor other poll findings showed children were using the internet at increasingly young ages : an average of seven in sweden and eight in several other northern european countries .
interviewers , who spoke with 23,000 children between the ages of nine and 16 , found it was the youngest children who had the hardest time coping with disturbing material online .
in response to this finding , the study recommended targeting spending and advice at younger age groups to reduce risk and enhance the opportunities of the internet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : younger children had more trouble coping with upsetting experiences parents were frequently unaware of the risks to which their children had been exposed , the study showed .
for example , more than half of parents whose children said they had been bullied online , said they knew nothing of the situation .
moreover , some 41 percent of parents whose child had seen sexual images online said their child had n't , and 61 percent of parents whose children had met offline with an online contact , also said their child had n't .
beckedahl added that parents should ideally " be aware what their kids are doing , and they should talk to them about what kind of experiences they are having on the internet . "
the study also found that while the overwhelming majority of european kids in the study use the internet at home -lrb- 85 percent -rrb- , many children do have private time to use the internet .
48 percent use it in their bedroom , and 31 percent via a mobile phone or other handheld device .
in some countries , like the united kingdom , ireland and sweden , over one in five young people use the internet regularly on a handheld device .
supporting education - for educators beckedahl acknowledged that because of this separation between parents and when their children are online , and their lack of awareness of where their kids go online , it may make things difficult for the parents to keep up . " parents often lack literacy in the social networks their children are using , " he said .
" they have no clue what kind of experiences and user interaction their kids would have , and they do n't really know what can happen . " his suggestion : shifting germany 's ongoing campaigns for media literacy away from children , and toward parents and teachers .
" peer to peer education exists already - children figure out how these platforms work themselves , " he noted . " the problem is , their parents and teachers are n't able to teach them to behave correctly , and prevent risks . "
the study 's authors plan to publish official conclusions and recommendations in november .
but even in thier preliminary findings , they acknowledge that the harmful potential of the internet is counterbalanced - if not easily outweighed - by the medium 's benefits .
plus , they note that a majority of the kids polled said they had not had any harmful experiences with the internet at all .
for his part , beckedahl would like to see the german debate on internet usage lose its negative tone .
" our debate about the internet needs to become more positive , " he said . " it is one of the greatest tools we ever had .
but if we only talk about the risks , people will fear the internet . "

match day nine represents the start of the second quarter of the bundesliga season , which means we 've entered what is officially termed the “ run-up to christmas ” - both in footballing and commercial terms . you may not know it , but we 're on the home straight towards christmas . this means two important things - kicking a ball and spending more money - will suddenly be jostling for attention in the brains of germany 's professional footballers . that may prove too heavy a mental burden , so on-field concentration could easily slip .
but given the form of the dw predictors over the last two weeks -lrb- 10 points from a possible 54 -rrb- , one more random factor can probably only help .
friday , october 22 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friday 's north-south derby is a bundesliga classic hamburg-bayern as the team that stopped the juggernaut that was mainz last week with a 1-0 away win , hamburg might be confident they can take on a bigger team of reds in what is known as the north-south derby .
but they are facing a resurgent bayern munich , who are clearly growing in confidence after a dreadful start , and who will be galvanized by the return of their famous dusel -lrb- luck -rrb- in their win over cfr cluj in the champions league .
moreover , bayern coach louis van gaal has made this a do-or-die game for his team 's championship hopes .
“ we ca n't drop many more points .
we have to win in hamburg , ” he told reporters after the cluj game .
the dutchman is basically baiting fate , and call me a fool , but i think fate will bite - gomez to get a deflected winner in injury time .
bayern 2-1 saturday , october 23 frankfurt-schalke schalke will also have an extra spring in their stride this weekend after a successful excursion in the champions league .
they watched israeli champions hapoel fold against the onslaught by the royal blues ’ star signing raul .
the spanish veteran scored two - one more than he has scored all season in the bundesliga - and there are signs that felix magath 's carefully constructed and thoroughly oiled schalke machine is finally beginning to find its gears .
that said , frankfurt are on a run of three straight wins , and greek forward theofanis gekas is on fire just now - he became the joint top scorer in the league during last week 's 3-0 drubbing of kaiserslautern .
hard not to see both sides scoring .
draw 2-2 moenchengladbach-werder bremen unlike bayern and schalke , werder ’ s champions league match this week was not a rousing home win , but a tough 1-1 draw away to the dutch champions fc twente .
they have n't kept a clean sheet in the league since match day three , and they lost their first choice goalkeeper tim wiese to a knee injury in the aforementioned melee in the netherlands .
their second-choice goalkeeper is also out , so they are relying on 21-year-old sebastian mielitz between the sticks , a rookie with two bundesliga games and half of wednesday 's european match to his name .
it 's a godsend , then , that werder are facing the only team in the bundesliga with a worse defensive record .
moenchengladbach are shipping an average of nearly three goals a game at the moment , are toiling one point above the relegation zone , and are without eight first-team players for this match .
you 'd have to expect the likes of claudio pizarro , aaron hunt and hugo almeida to do some damage .
werder bremen 4-1 freiburg-kaiserslautern freiburg might have lost away to werder last week , but it was a defiant loss , and they were inches away from snatching a draw in the closing minutes at the weserstadion .
for no discernable reason , the modest team from the far south-western corner of the country is riding around in the top half of the table above the likes of bayern , werder and wolfsburg .
kaiserslautern , meanwhile , are coming to town on the back of four morale-sapping losses to frankfurt -lrb- 0-3 -rrb- , hamburg -lrb- 1-2 -rrb- , hanover -lrb- 0-1 -rrb- and the carnage of a trip to dortmund -lrb- 0-5 -rrb- .

draw 1-1 hanover-cologne bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's keeper is in a huff ... but that 's just one worry among many a blistering start to the season for hanover -lrb- 13 points from six games -rrb- came to a thudding end two games ago when they ran into st. pauli .
that 1-0 loss , coupled with the international break that followed , apparently sapped their momentum .
the club then crashed headlong into bayern and mario gomez last week - who scored a brilliant hat-trick .
but if hanover were looking for a confidence boosting opponent , they could hardly have asked for anyone better than cologne , to whom the word “ crisis ” has been attached for weeks .
the pram belonging to resident star lukas podolski is rapidly running out of rattles , and handbags were drawn when colombian keeper faryd mondragon swanned off to the us to play for colombia without permission .
cologne - second from bottom - are still waiting for their second win of the season , but it 's unlikely to come this weekend .
hanover 1-0 nuremberg-wolfsburg wolfsburg are an unpredictable bunch this time round .
their results chart looks like a stock market in a volatile boom-bust economy : three straight defeats were followed by three straight victories , and then last week 's thriller against leverkusen saw them do it all in microcosm - they gave up a 2-0 lead to lose 3-2 in the space of 10 minutes .
but despite this , it 's clear that new manager steve mcclaren is beginning to get his killer trio of edin dzeko , diego and grafite into a groove .
but modest nuremberg are not an easy team to crack , at least for a bottom half side .
but despite last week 's madness , the momentum seems to be with wolfsburg , and there should be more space between the teams than a single place .
wolfsburg 2-1 sunday , october 24 dortmund-hoffenheim the sunday matches all feature germany 's europa league representatives , who played thursday evening , but dortmund did not have to travel , so weariness should not be a factor for the league leaders .
this is good news , because this match should be a cracker .
it 's first against fourth , and dortmund are currently rampaging through the league like they used to back in the day , i.e. the mid-90s .
it 's a heartening sight for those who can remember when bayern had a proper rival , and they are up against - in theory - one of the most exciting new forces in german football in hoffenheim .
while they were undone last year by a thin squad , coach ralf rangnick ’ s men are looking a more robust force this time round .
but despite good results , their recent draw against struggling cologne shows how fallible they are .
dortmund 2-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like the good old days - dortmund on the rampage leverkusen-mainz this one should also be a great game , with second-placed mainz away to third-placed leverkusen .
mainz 's run of seven straight wins came to an abrupt halt last week against hamburg , so it will be interesting to see if the unfancied club can get the ball rolling again .
everyone is expecting this bunch of cheeky young jack-rabbits to finally wake up and realize it was all a big misunderstanding , and they should be hacking through years of mid-table obscurity like honest , decent folk .
so will they dare to dream ?
leverkusen , meanwhile , are exactly the kind of grizzled , seen-it-all veterans who will know how to sap the will of these idealistic young upstarts .
it 's a bit like morgan freeman and brad pitt in seven .
hopefully with a bit less torture .
leverkusen 2-1 stuttgart-st.pauli it would take some kind of devastating natural disaster for stuttgart 's season to get much worse , but last week 's 2-2 draw against schalke - orchestrated by nubile new manager jens keller - was a definite improvement .
coupled with that , their very handy 1-0 win over getafe in the europa league on thursday will have further boosted confidence .
when you have four points from eight games , i guess the only way is up .
they are facing a st. pauli side who may be all of twelve places above them , but have not exactly been the model of consistency in the last few match days .
but all things being equal , st. pauli did just record a very impressive 3-2 win over nuremberg , and will expect to beat stuttgart , even if it does take sheer will .

match day nine represents the start of the second quarter of the bundesliga season , which means we 've entered what is officially termed the “ run-up to christmas ” - both in footballing and commercial terms . you may not know it , but we 're on the home straight towards christmas . this means two important things - kicking a ball and spending more money - will suddenly be jostling for attention in the brains of germany 's professional footballers . that may prove too heavy a mental burden , so on-field concentration could easily slip .
but given the form of the dw predictors over the last two weeks -lrb- 10 points from a possible 54 -rrb- , one more random factor can probably only help .
friday , october 22 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friday 's north-south derby is a bundesliga classic hamburg-bayern as the team that stopped the juggernaut that was mainz last week with a 1-0 away win , hamburg might be confident they can take on a bigger team of reds in what is known as the north-south derby .
but they are facing a resurgent bayern munich , who are clearly growing in confidence after a dreadful start , and who will be galvanized by the return of their famous dusel -lrb- luck -rrb- in their win over cfr cluj in the champions league .
moreover , bayern coach louis van gaal has made this a do-or-die game for his team 's championship hopes .
“ we ca n't drop many more points .
we have to win in hamburg , ” he told reporters after the cluj game .
the dutchman is basically baiting fate , and call me a fool , but i think fate will bite - gomez to get a deflected winner in injury time .
bayern 2-1 saturday , october 23 frankfurt-schalke schalke will also have an extra spring in their stride this weekend after a successful excursion in the champions league .
they watched israeli champions hapoel fold against the onslaught by the royal blues ’ star signing raul .
the spanish veteran scored two - one more than he has scored all season in the bundesliga - and there are signs that felix magath 's carefully constructed and thoroughly oiled schalke machine is finally beginning to find its gears .
that said , frankfurt are on a run of three straight wins , and greek forward theofanis gekas is on fire just now - he became the joint top scorer in the league during last week 's 3-0 drubbing of kaiserslautern .
hard not to see both sides scoring .
draw 2-2 moenchengladbach-werder bremen unlike bayern and schalke , werder ’ s champions league match this week was not a rousing home win , but a tough 1-1 draw away to the dutch champions fc twente .
they have n't kept a clean sheet in the league since match day three , and they lost their first choice goalkeeper tim wiese to a knee injury in the aforementioned melee in the netherlands .
their second-choice goalkeeper is also out , so they are relying on 21-year-old sebastian mielitz between the sticks , a rookie with two bundesliga games and half of wednesday 's european match to his name .
it 's a godsend , then , that werder are facing the only team in the bundesliga with a worse defensive record .
moenchengladbach are shipping an average of nearly three goals a game at the moment , are toiling one point above the relegation zone , and are without eight first-team players for this match .
you 'd have to expect the likes of claudio pizarro , aaron hunt and hugo almeida to do some damage .
werder bremen 4-1 freiburg-kaiserslautern freiburg might have lost away to werder last week , but it was a defiant loss , and they were inches away from snatching a draw in the closing minutes at the weserstadion .
for no discernable reason , the modest team from the far south-western corner of the country is riding around in the top half of the table above the likes of bayern , werder and wolfsburg .
kaiserslautern , meanwhile , are coming to town on the back of four morale-sapping losses to frankfurt -lrb- 0-3 -rrb- , hamburg -lrb- 1-2 -rrb- , hanover -lrb- 0-1 -rrb- and the carnage of a trip to dortmund -lrb- 0-5 -rrb- .

unions have called for more strike action . the french senate has voted through president nicolas sarkozy 's unpopular reform of the country 's pension system , which would raise the minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 and the maximum age for a full pension from 65 to 67 .
the bill has already been passed by the national assembly , but still needs to be approved by a parliamentary committee , a process that is likely to be completed next wednesday .
" the day will come when former opponents will thank the president and the government ... for acting responsibly , " labor minister eric woerth said just before the upper house approved the bill by 177 votes to 153 .
ongoing strike action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nationwide strikes have left nearly a quarter of petrol stations dry earlier on friday , french authorities forced the end of a blockade of the grandpuits oil refinery near paris , as blockades and an 11-day strike at refineries left nearly a quarter of all gas stations dry .
the police moved in on the refinery near dawn after an emergency decree ordered the strikers back to work .
unions said three people were injured in the operation .
after a meeting with oil industry executives , prime minister francois fillon said it would take " several more days " for fuel supplies to return to normal .
the head of the body which represents the national petroleum industry said the industry was struggling to import fuel to make up for the lack of supply .
transport minister jean-louis borloo told reporters that about one in five gas stations had run out of fuel , down from more than a quarter on wednesday .
the government said it had no plans to start rationing fuel , but that it had ordered oil companies to pool their resources to ensure the country was supplied with gas , particularly for this weekend when national school vacations begin .
on thursday the country 's six main unions called for further nationwide marches to protest the reform and for a seventh and eighth day of protests for oct .
28 and nov .
6 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youths clashed with police at a protest in lyon sarkozy 's popularity at all-time low sarkozy , meanwhile , has accused trade union leaders of undermining france 's fragile economic recovery and vowed to take tough action against protestors who turn violent .
" by taking the french economy , businesses and daily life hostage , you will destroy jobs , " he said .
" we ca n't be the only country in the world where , when there 's a reform , a minority wants to block everyone else .
that 's not possible .
that 's not democracy . "
an opinion poll published by the bva institute and broadcast by canal plus television on friday found that most french voters support the strikes - 69 percent to 29 percent - but 52 percent oppose the blockage of refineries .
the french government insists that the reform is necessary to close a widening budget gap in national pension funds .
unions and political opponents say it unfairly penalizes workers for the mistakes of the global financial system .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 22.10.2010 poor weather creates small but tasty vintage of riesling wines großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wine prices may increase when 2010 's grapes hit the market the 2010 wine yield has suffered across europe after a rainy and cold summer .
but german winemakers hope a unique blend of sugar and acid will make this year 's vintage an exceptional flavor - even if there is less of it . german winemakers harvested about half of the amount of grapes they took out of vineyards last year making it one of the worst yields in decades , according to michael bluemling , a wine grower on the moselle river . " it 's always disappointing when you 're harvesting less fruit than expected , " he told deutsche welle . this october bluemling harvested just 5,000 liters per hectare , less than half of the maximum yield of 12,500 liters .
a cold snap in june stifled what winegrowers call the fruit set - the critical phase when the grapevine 's flowers are fertilized and start growing into grapes . a rainy august also dampened hopes for the 2010 vintage .
grapes - and germans - suffered through twice as much rain and a third less sunshine compared to an average august . the lack of sun kept the grapes from fully developing and all the moisture led the botrytis fungus , which gives the riesling grapes their sweet taste , to develop too quickly .
this destroyed some of the crop , further reducing the harvest . problems for local economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael bluemling was disappointed by the low harvest the low yield could hit the local economy hard . " wine is everything for this area , " bluemling said .
" the romans cultivated wine 2,000 years ago and since then the wine growing is very important for this region . " the state rhineland-palatinate , where bluemling works , produces 90 percent of germany 's export wines and 70 percent of the nation 's total wine production .
some 12,000 businesses in the state are relying on the harvest to produce wine . despite this year 's catastrophic harvest , bluemling said he remains optimistic about how the riesling growers will fare over the next year because of 2009 's bumper harvest . " the wineries still have some wine from the last years and so all the wineries in our region are going to survive the smaller vintage and we hope that the next vintage will be totally different , " bluemling said . but hans rainer schultz from the wine research center in giesenheim is n't so optimistic . " the lower yield is going to be very painful for many wine growers , because some of them only harvested about 50 percent of what they normally harvest , " schultz said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grape fungus developed more quickly in the wet weather and reduced crop yields overall predictions for the german wine harvest show a 23 percent drop on the average yield .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 22.10.2010 poor weather creates small but tasty vintage of riesling wines großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wine prices may increase when 2010 's grapes hit the market the 2010 wine yield has suffered across europe after a rainy and cold summer .
but german winemakers hope a unique blend of sugar and acid will make this year 's vintage an exceptional flavor - even if there is less of it . german winemakers harvested about half of the amount of grapes they took out of vineyards last year making it one of the worst yields in decades , according to michael bluemling , a wine grower on the moselle river . " it 's always disappointing when you 're harvesting less fruit than expected , " he told deutsche welle . this october bluemling harvested just 5,000 liters per hectare , less than half of the maximum yield of 12,500 liters .
a cold snap in june stifled what winegrowers call the fruit set - the critical phase when the grapevine 's flowers are fertilized and start growing into grapes . a rainy august also dampened hopes for the 2010 vintage .
grapes - and germans - suffered through twice as much rain and a third less sunshine compared to an average august . the lack of sun kept the grapes from fully developing and all the moisture led the botrytis fungus , which gives the riesling grapes their sweet taste , to develop too quickly .
this destroyed some of the crop , further reducing the harvest . problems for local economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael bluemling was disappointed by the low harvest the low yield could hit the local economy hard . " wine is everything for this area , " bluemling said .
" the romans cultivated wine 2,000 years ago and since then the wine growing is very important for this region . " the state rhineland-palatinate , where bluemling works , produces 90 percent of germany 's export wines and 70 percent of the nation 's total wine production .
some 12,000 businesses in the state are relying on the harvest to produce wine . despite this year 's catastrophic harvest , bluemling said he remains optimistic about how the riesling growers will fare over the next year because of 2009 's bumper harvest . " the wineries still have some wine from the last years and so all the wineries in our region are going to survive the smaller vintage and we hope that the next vintage will be totally different , " bluemling said . but hans rainer schultz from the wine research center in giesenheim is n't so optimistic . " the lower yield is going to be very painful for many wine growers , because some of them only harvested about 50 percent of what they normally harvest , " schultz said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grape fungus developed more quickly in the wet weather and reduced crop yields overall predictions for the german wine harvest show a 23 percent drop on the average yield .
schultz said german winegrowers were n't alone .
vineyards in austria and italy have seen their yields fall as well .
schultz said he think this lower yield will be reflected in wine prices . " within europe , the yield is going to be smaller , and i think on average the prices are going to increase , " he said . unusual taste regarding the taste of this year 's riesling wine , schutz is n't quite as glum .

bayern needs points if they hope to free themselves of the rut that has them currently sitting in ninth place in the table .
" hamburg had the big chances , " said bayern captain philipp lahm , " so there are times when you have to be satisfied with one point . "
bayern have been deeply cut by a swathe of injuries this season and played without several key players friday , including mark van bommel , daniel van buyten and miroslav klose .
' better than nothing ' fourth-place hamburg could have used a win to gain ground on bayer leverkusen .
the two teams are currently even at 15 points with leverkusen ahead on goals , but leverkusen could widen the gap again on sunday with a win against mainz .
the match was relatively even , although hamburg did have better chances to score .
that included a very near-miss by jonathan pitroipa , who only had bayern keeper joerg butt to beat but bounced his shot off the right post .
" pitroipa should have scored , " hamburg coach armin veh said after the game .
" -lrb- but -rrb- at least we kept a clean sheet . "
" better one point against bayern than none , " added hamburg 's captain heiko westermann .

the leader of the freedom party is facing charges of inciting racial hatred against muslims . dutch anti-islam politician geert wilders welcomed the decision by a dutch court to order a retrial with new judges , after he complained that the current judges were biased .
" this gives me a new chance of a new fair trial , " wilders told the reuters news agency .
" i 'm confident i can only be acquitted , because i have broken no law , but spoken the truth , " he insisted .
wilders ' lawyer had asked the court to replace the judges because of concern about their being biased , after they did not immediately approve a request to hear testimony from a witness the defense considered crucial to its case .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilders has caused outrage among muslims back to square one the amsterdam court ruled that the defense 's fear of bias was " understandable " , meaning the entire trial process will have to be repeated , although it was not clear when it would reopen .

the dutch politician 's anti-immigration freedom party was one of the big winners in june 's national elections and , while not part of the government , it has agreed to prop it up in crucial decisions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de oil industry -pipe- 22.10.2010 six months on , gulf of mexico could see new drilling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the moratorium lifted , companies can apply for new drill permits the us government lifted a moratorium on deepwater drilling in the gulf of mexico earlier this month .
now , six months after april 's massive oil spill , one company is planning to seek permits for new projects in the area . the gulf of mexico is seeing renewed interest as a drilling destination : on thursday , us oil giant chevron said it intended to apply for permission in the coming days to develop fresh projects there .
a spokesman for the company said it plans to invest $ 7.5 billion in a pair of new fields in waters off the coast of louisiana .
the move would make chevron among the first to seek permits for new drilling projects in the gulf of mexico , half a year after the deepwater horizon oil rig exploded on april 20 .
chevron could be among the first oil companies to exploit the end of a drilling moratorium , introduced by the obama administration in may when it faced public pressure for reacting to slowly to the environmental crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an explosion occurred on the deepwater horizon oil rig on april 20 competing pressures the drilling freeze applied to both new and current projects but was lifted on october 13 – several weeks before it was set to expire – amid pressure from oil companies and state governments concerned about productivity and jobs .
according to a government report , up to 12,000 jobs were lost due to the moratorium , a bitter pill to swallow as the country struggles with persistent high unemployment in a year of midterm elections .
us environmental advocacy groups have condemned the end of the moratorium , saying the risks of drilling remain too high .
six months after the deepwater horizon oil rig exploded – setting off the worst environmental disaster in us history and leaving 11 people dead – more than 16,000 specialists and volunteers are still working to cleanup the spill 's environmental effects .
british energy giant bp spent months trying to stop oil from leaking into the gulf – launching multiple failed " kill " operations to plug the blown-out wellhead .
they only succeeded in early august , when engineers filled the well with heavy drilling mud and cement , after millions of liters of oil had already leaked into the gulf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oil spill was the worst environmental disaster in us history rules and regulations oil and gas drilling projects are now subject to stricter regulations .
us interior secretary ken salazar said in a telephone press conference that they are meant to ensure safe energy generation .
" we are building the gold standard for offshore oil and gas regulation , " he said . in future , corporations will be required to prove that their oil rigs are equipped with working cut-off valves .
in addition , they must conform to specific construction standards .
oil rig workers will also be subject to special safety trainings .
regulators – who came in for heavy criticism for their coziness with the industry they were supposed to monitor – have been reformed .
the former minerals management service has been changed to the bureau of ocean energy management , and the agency has been subject to new ethics guidelines since late august .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de oil industry -pipe- 22.10.2010 six months on , gulf of mexico could see new drilling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the moratorium lifted , companies can apply for new drill permits the us government lifted a moratorium on deepwater drilling in the gulf of mexico earlier this month .
now , six months after april 's massive oil spill , one company is planning to seek permits for new projects in the area . the gulf of mexico is seeing renewed interest as a drilling destination : on thursday , us oil giant chevron said it intended to apply for permission in the coming days to develop fresh projects there .
a spokesman for the company said it plans to invest $ 7.5 billion in a pair of new fields in waters off the coast of louisiana .
the move would make chevron among the first to seek permits for new drilling projects in the gulf of mexico , half a year after the deepwater horizon oil rig exploded on april 20 .
chevron could be among the first oil companies to exploit the end of a drilling moratorium , introduced by the obama administration in may when it faced public pressure for reacting to slowly to the environmental crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an explosion occurred on the deepwater horizon oil rig on april 20 competing pressures the drilling freeze applied to both new and current projects but was lifted on october 13 – several weeks before it was set to expire – amid pressure from oil companies and state governments concerned about productivity and jobs .
according to a government report , up to 12,000 jobs were lost due to the moratorium , a bitter pill to swallow as the country struggles with persistent high unemployment in a year of midterm elections .
us environmental advocacy groups have condemned the end of the moratorium , saying the risks of drilling remain too high .
six months after the deepwater horizon oil rig exploded – setting off the worst environmental disaster in us history and leaving 11 people dead – more than 16,000 specialists and volunteers are still working to cleanup the spill 's environmental effects .
british energy giant bp spent months trying to stop oil from leaking into the gulf – launching multiple failed " kill " operations to plug the blown-out wellhead .
they only succeeded in early august , when engineers filled the well with heavy drilling mud and cement , after millions of liters of oil had already leaked into the gulf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oil spill was the worst environmental disaster in us history rules and regulations oil and gas drilling projects are now subject to stricter regulations .
us interior secretary ken salazar said in a telephone press conference that they are meant to ensure safe energy generation .
" we are building the gold standard for offshore oil and gas regulation , " he said . in future , corporations will be required to prove that their oil rigs are equipped with working cut-off valves .
in addition , they must conform to specific construction standards .
oil rig workers will also be subject to special safety trainings .
regulators – who came in for heavy criticism for their coziness with the industry they were supposed to monitor – have been reformed .
the former minerals management service has been changed to the bureau of ocean energy management , and the agency has been subject to new ethics guidelines since late august .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 22.10.2010 german economic boom a role model for other countries großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economy has recovered based on its exports the german economy used to be criticized for being overregulated and unflexible .
but in the wake of the global crisis , it 's germany that 's emerging with ease , which countries like the us can learn from . unemployment figures in germany are down to 1992 levels , and german exports are on the rise as if the global economic crisis had never happened .
in comparison , the economy in the united states is doing a lot worse : unemployment stands high at 9.6 percent , and growth rates are far from the positive figures that are coming out of germany .
and yet , there 's no secret recipe behind the success of the german economy , says thomas zielke , deputy delegate of the german economy in washington – it all comes down to exports , he told deutsche welle .
" it 's that great flexibility of companies , and the will to expand .
people are simply used to focusing on exports , " zielke said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shapiro says germany has been well prepared for the crisis that 's not necessarily the case in the us , he says , where companies are used to relying much more on their own domestic market .
in the united states , exports only make up 13 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , but the figure in germany is more than three times higher .
and while most of germany 's exports are going to other eu countries , the biggest growth rates are in exports to the rest of the world .
investing in exports if the domestic market crumbles in a time of recession , companies have little choice other than to invest in exports , robert shapiro , economic advisor to the us government , told deutsche welle .
" that has always been germany 's strength , " he said .
" the country has been very well prepared for that . "
there are other factors behind germany 's success in handling the crisis that shapiro and his colleagues have taken a closer look at .
one example is government action , such as subsidizing shortened working hours .
by covering part of the salaries of workers who are put on reduced hours , berlin has managed to avoid a situation where too many people had to be laid off during the recession .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a manufacturing-based economy can more easily focus on exports jacob kirkegaard of the peterson institute for international economics told deutsche welle that he felt a lot of respect for germany 's quick resurgence .
" germany has proven that it 's possible to handle a dramatic slump in sales and exports without mass firings , " he says .
" you just have much more flexibility than on the us market .
here the gut reaction is always : when the sales go down , people have to be fired .
and when the demand is back , there 's a lack of workers . "
too much government involvement ?
but shapiro cautions against simply adapting that system to the us economy .
cultural differences are part of the problem – americans are traditionally opposed to their government getting involved in running businesses .
he also warned that despite the currently positive outlook there are still many risks for germany .
european monetary policy is too fragile , he says , as it has to balance between the interests of all the eu member states .
the danger of countries running bankrupt is still there .
greece for instance has not seen its situation improve as much as the rest of europe had hoped it would .
and other member states like ireland or spain are still struggling to avoid a crisis .
a moral price to pay shapiro and kirkegaard agree that germany 's exports to china are also not without a downside .
there 's a moral price to pay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us economy is struggling despite austerity measures " germany is rather careful in criticizing china because of course berlin does not want to put its exports at risk .
the us however are much more outspoken .
but that of course has an impact on us exports to china . "
and still , the us already seem to be readjusting their economic policy to follow more in the direction that germany is taking .
the obama government has recognized the importance of exports – the goal is to increase exports by five percent .
" the current administration has export at the top of its agenda , " thomas zielke says .
" obama has repeatedly said that he sees the future as being in manufacturing .
and he has put that directly in opposition to wall street and the financial crisis . "

bayern needs points if they hope to free themselves of the rut that has them currently sitting in ninth place in the table .
" hamburg had the big chances , " said bayern captain philipp lahm , " so there are times when you have to be satisfied with one point . "
bayern have been deeply cut by a swathe of injuries this season and played without several key players friday , including mark van bommel , daniel van buyten and miroslav klose .
' better than nothing ' fourth-place hamburg could have used a win to gain ground on bayer leverkusen .
the two teams are currently even at 15 points with leverkusen ahead on goals , but leverkusen could widen the gap again on sunday with a win against mainz .
the match was relatively even , although hamburg did have better chances to score .
that included a very near-miss by jonathan pitroipa , who only had bayern keeper joerg butt to beat but bounced his shot off the right post .
" pitroipa should have scored , " hamburg coach armin veh said after the game .
" -lrb- but -rrb- at least we kept a clean sheet . "
" better one point against bayern than none , " added hamburg 's captain heiko westermann .

" we expect that within 10 days , the situation in terzigno can return to normal , " he told a news conference in rome after an emergency meeting .
the government 's plans to build a new dump in terzigno , which is located 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- southeast of naples in vesuvius national park , have for years met with fierce opposition by locals , who have repeatedly blocked access to the existing waste disposal site there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dump is located in vesuvius national park on thursday , police confronted around 2,000 demonstrators , who threw stones , marbles and firecrackers and used tree trunks to block access to the dump .
compensation offered berlusconi also announced he would release 14 million euros -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- to modernize the existing facility , which the protesters say is overflowing and causing health problems .
the problem has been a major issue for the italian government for several years , with berlusconi declaring a national disaster in 2008 .
the rubbish row has not escaped the european union 's notice either .
the european commission has taken legal action against italy to force the government to solve the crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi 's election pledge to solve the crisis has not materialized " the infringement procedures are ongoing , " spokesman joe hennon said on friday .
" italian authorities need to draw up a plan to manage rubbish in the region , " he added .
the european court of justice found earlier this year that italy had no adequate system for waste disposal in the naples region and said that the problem was a risk to human health and the environment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 22.10.2010 european online risk study shows many parents clueless , kids blasé großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children are online at an increasingly young age more than one in eight european children has been upset by online content , a new eu study on internet risks shows .
but the study also showed that most children had had no upsetting experiences with the internet at all . a large majority of those interviewed for the study eu kids online reported no negative experiences at all online , results of the european union study " risks and safety on the internet " showed .
but the study also showed that parents are frequently out of touch with their kids ' virtual lives .
the european union and london school of economics survey was presented thursday at the safer internet forum in luxembourg , and included interviews with thousands of kids across europe from ireland to turkey .
among its findings , the study showed that an average of 12 percent of european children had been bothered or upset by something they experienced online .
these included encountering pornography , sexual or bullying messages , or having their personal data revealed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , just eight percent of kids said they were bothered by an online event indeed , the study showed that 39 percent of those questioned had had encountered a " risky " behavior - such as communicating with new people not met face-to-face , or seeing user-generated content that is potentially harmful , such as hate , self-harm , or drug-taking content .
but only a portion of those asked said they had been upset or bothered by it .
in germany , the percentage of kids who said they were upset by an online experience was , at eight percent , near the lowest end of the scale .
only portugal -lrb- seven percent -rrb- and italy -lrb- six percent -rrb- were lower .
topping the percentages of those most bothered or upset were children in denmark -lrb- 26 percent -rrb- , estonia -lrb- 25 percent -rrb- and romania and sweden -lrb- 21 percent . -rrb-
discrepancy due to ' schoolyard monopoly ' uwe hasebrink , a professor at hamburg 's hans bredow institute for media research , led the german arm of the study .
in an interview with the hamburg abendblatt newspaper , he said that german children " are in less danger " of meeting harmful content because they use the internet " less frequently and with less variety " than kids in other countries .
but markus beckedahl , whose blog netzpolitik.org focuses on the intersection between the internet and german politics , said he found it hard to understand the response gap between countries like denmark and sweden , and germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say parents , not children , should be targets of information campaigns " the study said that countries with high internet usage have more problems , " beckedahl told deutsche welle . " but something like 99 percent of german kids have internet access , and i do n't think they have more more internet usage in denmark . "
one big difference could be the fact that a huge portion of the social-network market for kids and teens in germany takes place on german-only networks like " schuelervz " -lrb- " student directory , " -rrb- german schoolkids ' version of facebook .
" these platforms have a near monopoly on the schoolyard , " he added . " maybe that makes the difference - in germany , the kids are in closed communities , and in other countries they are just on the internet . "
the age factor other poll findings showed children were using the internet at increasingly young ages : an average of seven in sweden and eight in several other northern european countries .
interviewers , who spoke with 23,000 children between the ages of nine and 16 , found it was the youngest children who had the hardest time coping with disturbing material online .
in response to this finding , the study recommended targeting spending and advice at younger age groups to reduce risk and enhance the opportunities of the internet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : younger children had more trouble coping with upsetting experiences parents were frequently unaware of the risks to which their children had been exposed , the study showed .
for example , more than half of parents whose children said they had been bullied online , said they knew nothing of the situation .
moreover , some 41 percent of parents whose child had seen sexual images online said their child had n't , and 61 percent of parents whose children had met offline with an online contact , also said their child had n't .
beckedahl added that parents should ideally " be aware what their kids are doing , and they should talk to them about what kind of experiences they are having on the internet . "
the study also found that while the overwhelming majority of european kids in the study use the internet at home -lrb- 85 percent -rrb- , many children do have private time to use the internet .
48 percent use it in their bedroom , and 31 percent via a mobile phone or other handheld device .
in some countries , like the united kingdom , ireland and sweden , over one in five young people use the internet regularly on a handheld device .
supporting education - for educators beckedahl acknowledged that because of this separation between parents and when their children are online , and their lack of awareness of where their kids go online , it may make things difficult for the parents to keep up . " parents often lack literacy in the social networks their children are using , " he said .
" they have no clue what kind of experiences and user interaction their kids would have , and they do n't really know what can happen . " his suggestion : shifting germany 's ongoing campaigns for media literacy away from children , and toward parents and teachers .
" peer to peer education exists already - children figure out how these platforms work themselves , " he noted . " the problem is , their parents and teachers are n't able to teach them to behave correctly , and prevent risks . "
the study 's authors plan to publish official conclusions and recommendations in november .
but even in thier preliminary findings , they acknowledge that the harmful potential of the internet is counterbalanced - if not easily outweighed - by the medium 's benefits .
plus , they note that a majority of the kids polled said they had not had any harmful experiences with the internet at all .
for his part , beckedahl would like to see the german debate on internet usage lose its negative tone .
" our debate about the internet needs to become more positive , " he said . " it is one of the greatest tools we ever had .
but if we only talk about the risks , people will fear the internet . "

but the study also showed that most children had had no upsetting experiences with the internet at all . a large majority of those interviewed for the study eu kids online reported no negative experiences at all online , results of the european union study " risks and safety on the internet " showed .
but the study also showed that parents are frequently out of touch with their kids ' virtual lives .
the european union and london school of economics survey was presented thursday at the safer internet forum in luxembourg , and included interviews with thousands of kids across europe from ireland to turkey .
among its findings , the study showed that an average of 12 percent of european children had been bothered or upset by something they experienced online .
these included encountering pornography , sexual or bullying messages , or having their personal data revealed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , just eight percent of kids said they were bothered by an online event indeed , the study showed that 39 percent of those questioned had had encountered a " risky " behavior - such as communicating with new people not met face-to-face , or seeing user-generated content that is potentially harmful , such as hate , self-harm , or drug-taking content .
but only a portion of those asked said they had been upset or bothered by it .
in germany , the percentage of kids who said they were upset by an online experience was , at eight percent , near the lowest end of the scale .
only portugal -lrb- seven percent -rrb- and italy -lrb- six percent -rrb- were lower .
topping the percentages of those most bothered or upset were children in denmark -lrb- 26 percent -rrb- , estonia -lrb- 25 percent -rrb- and romania and sweden -lrb- 21 percent . -rrb-
discrepancy due to ' schoolyard monopoly ' uwe hasebrink , a professor at hamburg 's hans bredow institute for media research , led the german arm of the study .
in an interview with the hamburg abendblatt newspaper , he said that german children " are in less danger " of meeting harmful content because they use the internet " less frequently and with less variety " than kids in other countries .
but markus beckedahl , whose blog netzpolitik.org focuses on the intersection between the internet and german politics , said he found it hard to understand the response gap between countries like denmark and sweden , and germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say parents , not children , should be targets of information campaigns " the study said that countries with high internet usage have more problems , " beckedahl told deutsche welle . " but something like 99 percent of german kids have internet access , and i do n't think they have more more internet usage in denmark . "
one big difference could be the fact that a huge portion of the social-network market for kids and teens in germany takes place on german-only networks like " schuelervz " -lrb- " student directory , " -rrb- german schoolkids ' version of facebook .
" these platforms have a near monopoly on the schoolyard , " he added . " maybe that makes the difference - in germany , the kids are in closed communities , and in other countries they are just on the internet . "
the age factor other poll findings showed children were using the internet at increasingly young ages : an average of seven in sweden and eight in several other northern european countries .
interviewers , who spoke with 23,000 children between the ages of nine and 16 , found it was the youngest children who had the hardest time coping with disturbing material online .
in response to this finding , the study recommended targeting spending and advice at younger age groups to reduce risk and enhance the opportunities of the internet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : younger children had more trouble coping with upsetting experiences parents were frequently unaware of the risks to which their children had been exposed , the study showed .
for example , more than half of parents whose children said they had been bullied online , said they knew nothing of the situation .
moreover , some 41 percent of parents whose child had seen sexual images online said their child had n't , and 61 percent of parents whose children had met offline with an online contact , also said their child had n't .
beckedahl added that parents should ideally " be aware what their kids are doing , and they should talk to them about what kind of experiences they are having on the internet . "
the study also found that while the overwhelming majority of european kids in the study use the internet at home -lrb- 85 percent -rrb- , many children do have private time to use the internet .
48 percent use it in their bedroom , and 31 percent via a mobile phone or other handheld device .
in some countries , like the united kingdom , ireland and sweden , over one in five young people use the internet regularly on a handheld device .
supporting education - for educators beckedahl acknowledged that because of this separation between parents and when their children are online , and their lack of awareness of where their kids go online , it may make things difficult for the parents to keep up . " parents often lack literacy in the social networks their children are using , " he said .
" they have no clue what kind of experiences and user interaction their kids would have , and they do n't really know what can happen . " his suggestion : shifting germany 's ongoing campaigns for media literacy away from children , and toward parents and teachers .
" peer to peer education exists already - children figure out how these platforms work themselves , " he noted . " the problem is , their parents and teachers are n't able to teach them to behave correctly , and prevent risks . "
the study 's authors plan to publish official conclusions and recommendations in november .
but even in thier preliminary findings , they acknowledge that the harmful potential of the internet is counterbalanced - if not easily outweighed - by the medium 's benefits .
plus , they note that a majority of the kids polled said they had not had any harmful experiences with the internet at all .
for his part , beckedahl would like to see the german debate on internet usage lose its negative tone .
" our debate about the internet needs to become more positive , " he said . " it is one of the greatest tools we ever had .
but if we only talk about the risks , people will fear the internet . "

" we expect that within 10 days , the situation in terzigno can return to normal , " he told a news conference in rome after an emergency meeting .
the government 's plans to build a new dump in terzigno , which is located 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- southeast of naples in vesuvius national park , have for years met with fierce opposition by locals , who have repeatedly blocked access to the existing waste disposal site there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dump is located in vesuvius national park on thursday , police confronted around 2,000 demonstrators , who threw stones , marbles and firecrackers and used tree trunks to block access to the dump .
compensation offered berlusconi also announced he would release 14 million euros -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- to modernize the existing facility , which the protesters say is overflowing and causing health problems .
the problem has been a major issue for the italian government for several years , with berlusconi declaring a national disaster in 2008 .
the rubbish row has not escaped the european union 's notice either .
the european commission has taken legal action against italy to force the government to solve the crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi 's election pledge to solve the crisis has not materialized " the infringement procedures are ongoing , " spokesman joe hennon said on friday .
" italian authorities need to draw up a plan to manage rubbish in the region , " he added .
the european court of justice found earlier this year that italy had no adequate system for waste disposal in the naples region and said that the problem was a risk to human health and the environment .

dw-world.de eu court blames rome for rubbish crisis .

unions have called for more strike action . the french senate has voted through president nicolas sarkozy 's unpopular reform of the country 's pension system , which would raise the minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 and the maximum age for a full pension from 65 to 67 .
the bill has already been passed by the national assembly , but still needs to be approved by a parliamentary committee , a process that is likely to be completed next wednesday .
" the day will come when former opponents will thank the president and the government ... for acting responsibly , " labor minister eric woerth said just before the upper house approved the bill by 177 votes to 153 .
ongoing strike action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nationwide strikes have left nearly a quarter of petrol stations dry earlier on friday , french authorities forced the end of a blockade of the grandpuits oil refinery near paris , as blockades and an 11-day strike at refineries left nearly a quarter of all gas stations dry .
the police moved in on the refinery near dawn after an emergency decree ordered the strikers back to work .
unions said three people were injured in the operation .
after a meeting with oil industry executives , prime minister francois fillon said it would take " several more days " for fuel supplies to return to normal .
the head of the body which represents the national petroleum industry said the industry was struggling to import fuel to make up for the lack of supply .
transport minister jean-louis borloo told reporters that about one in five gas stations had run out of fuel , down from more than a quarter on wednesday .
the government said it had no plans to start rationing fuel , but that it had ordered oil companies to pool their resources to ensure the country was supplied with gas , particularly for this weekend when national school vacations begin .
on thursday the country 's six main unions called for further nationwide marches to protest the reform and for a seventh and eighth day of protests for oct .

" we ca n't be the only country in the world where , when there 's a reform , a minority wants to block everyone else .

an opinion poll published by the bva institute and broadcast by canal plus television on friday found that most french voters support the strikes - 69 percent to 29 percent - but 52 percent oppose the blockage of refineries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 22.10.2010 airbus chief says subsidy spat with boeing helps emerging rivals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus-boeing battle is good news for competitors the head of airbus has called the protracted row between his company and boeing over state subsidies " absurd , " saying the fight only benefits up-and-coming aircraft makers , who could pose a threat to the two giants . tom enders , the ceo of airbus , gave a candid assessment of the six-year battle between europe and the us , saying " both are guilty " of receiving subsidies that that contravene world trade organization rules and which the trade watchdog says distort competition . " let 's be honest about it , the simple truth is , in the aerospace or aeronautic business , none of us , none of the companies that play a role in it , has been growing without any government support , " enders told attendees of an aviation club lunch in london .
" so let 's accept reality . " in addition , the airbus chief said , the fight over subsidies could " accelerate the ascendancy " of aircraft manufacturers from countries such as china , russia and brazil , who are working on releasing new models that could pose direct threats to the current duopoly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ceo enders has been unusually frank about the wto battle " if we talk about china , if we talk about russia or others , does anyone in this room believe that they will step back and say : ' now we understand the wto rules , we will play exactly by the rules ' ? " he said .
" absolutely not , so this is why i call this an absurdity . " long quarrel europe 's airbus and chicago-based boeing , the globe 's first and second largest aircraft manufacturers , have been arguing their cases before the wto since 2004 .
the united states initiated wto dispute procedures then about subsidies to the european aircraft industry .
in response , the eu launched similar proceedings against the us . since then , the trans-atlantic dispute has become bogged down and a swift resolution does not appear to be on the horizon .
in a ruling at the end of june , the wto did fault europe over aid to airbus , saying the company has received subsidies in the form of loans from european governments at below market-rates and without maturity dates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus got a slap on the wrist in a wto ruling this summer however , airbus responded by saying the wto had thrown out several of the other charges brought by the us .
in a counter claim , airbus accused boeing of getting tax breaks from washington as well as money from nasa research funds and argues that much us defense research , funded by the pentagon , is of a dual technology nature and ends up being transferred over to the us civil aviation sector . it is likely that any resolution will only come after years of appeals by both sides . " it 's hard to see how it ends right now , " paul sheridan , an aviation analyst at london-based ascend worldwide , told deutsche welle .
" you could take the wto report about airbus and take boeing 's response and switch the names and it would probably look pretty similar .
they seem to be both accusing each other of the same thing . " new guys in town in the meantime , a group of new players is arriving on the scene , ready to release products that could go head to head with boeing and airbus ' headliners . one big worry in chicago and toulouse , airbus ' home base , is the commercial aircraft corporation of china ltd , or comac .
its 919 model , due to come on the market in 2016 , will directly compete with the airbus a320 and boeing 's 737 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's comac is making airbus and boeing nervous " airbus and boeing should be very worried about comac as a rival to their duopoly " sheridan said .
" comac is state-owned and once the chinese government demonstrates a willingness to do something they usually follow through with it . " other manufacturers , such as canada 's bombardier , brazil 's embraer or russia 's sukhoi are seeking to gain a foothold in the lucrative civil aviation market .
bombardier 's single-aisle plane is due to enter service in 2013 and will also pose a threat to the a320 and 737 . " airbus is saying to boeing that they need to resolve this whole issue , " zafar khan , an aviation expert at sg securities , told deutsche welle .
" while we 're squabbling , enders is saying , those other countries are all subsidizing their industries . " enders said there will probably be five or six commercial aircraft manufacturers in the next 10 years , which means the industry will be faced with new questions about consolidations , partnerships and mergers . subsides and the future subsidies , although disliked by the wto , are almost a given in the aviation industry , experts say .
that is partly due to the expense of producing the product , but also from the benefits governments see from having a successful aerospace player . " when it comes to the aerospace industry , everyone is looking for help from governments because these are major , major undertakings and governments clearly see them as strategically important businesses to have , " khan said . in a related development , negotiators from the european union and other countries , including the us , japan and brazil , are meeting in canada to talk about financing planes in each other 's home markets - and specifically , how much government assistance is allowed . the old rules saw an aviation deal dominated by the us and europe .

unions have called for more strike action . the french senate has voted through president nicolas sarkozy 's unpopular reform of the country 's pension system , which would raise the minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 and the maximum age for a full pension from 65 to 67 .
the bill has already been passed by the national assembly , but still needs to be approved by a parliamentary committee , a process that is likely to be completed next wednesday .
" the day will come when former opponents will thank the president and the government ... for acting responsibly , " labor minister eric woerth said just before the upper house approved the bill by 177 votes to 153 .

unions said three people were injured in the operation .
after a meeting with oil industry executives , prime minister francois fillon said it would take " several more days " for fuel supplies to return to normal .
the head of the body which represents the national petroleum industry said the industry was struggling to import fuel to make up for the lack of supply .
transport minister jean-louis borloo told reporters that about one in five gas stations had run out of fuel , down from more than a quarter on wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 22.10.2010 in match day nine , dw 's predictions head into the season 's second quarter großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's in store for dw 's picks on match day nine ?
match day nine represents the start of the second quarter of the bundesliga season , which means we 've entered what is officially termed the “ run-up to christmas ” - both in footballing and commercial terms . you may not know it , but we 're on the home straight towards christmas . this means two important things - kicking a ball and spending more money - will suddenly be jostling for attention in the brains of germany 's professional footballers . that may prove too heavy a mental burden , so on-field concentration could easily slip .
but given the form of the dw predictors over the last two weeks -lrb- 10 points from a possible 54 -rrb- , one more random factor can probably only help .
friday , october 22 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friday 's north-south derby is a bundesliga classic hamburg-bayern as the team that stopped the juggernaut that was mainz last week with a 1-0 away win , hamburg might be confident they can take on a bigger team of reds in what is known as the north-south derby .
but they are facing a resurgent bayern munich , who are clearly growing in confidence after a dreadful start , and who will be galvanized by the return of their famous dusel -lrb- luck -rrb- in their win over cfr cluj in the champions league .
moreover , bayern coach louis van gaal has made this a do-or-die game for his team 's championship hopes .
“ we ca n't drop many more points .
we have to win in hamburg , ” he told reporters after the cluj game .
the dutchman is basically baiting fate , and call me a fool , but i think fate will bite - gomez to get a deflected winner in injury time .
bayern 2-1 saturday , october 23 frankfurt-schalke schalke will also have an extra spring in their stride this weekend after a successful excursion in the champions league .
they watched israeli champions hapoel fold against the onslaught by the royal blues ’ star signing raul .
the spanish veteran scored two - one more than he has scored all season in the bundesliga - and there are signs that felix magath 's carefully constructed and thoroughly oiled schalke machine is finally beginning to find its gears .
that said , frankfurt are on a run of three straight wins , and greek forward theofanis gekas is on fire just now - he became the joint top scorer in the league during last week 's 3-0 drubbing of kaiserslautern .
hard not to see both sides scoring .
draw 2-2 moenchengladbach-werder bremen unlike bayern and schalke , werder ’ s champions league match this week was not a rousing home win , but a tough 1-1 draw away to the dutch champions fc twente .
they have n't kept a clean sheet in the league since match day three , and they lost their first choice goalkeeper tim wiese to a knee injury in the aforementioned melee in the netherlands .
their second-choice goalkeeper is also out , so they are relying on 21-year-old sebastian mielitz between the sticks , a rookie with two bundesliga games and half of wednesday 's european match to his name .
it 's a godsend , then , that werder are facing the only team in the bundesliga with a worse defensive record .
moenchengladbach are shipping an average of nearly three goals a game at the moment , are toiling one point above the relegation zone , and are without eight first-team players for this match .
you 'd have to expect the likes of claudio pizarro , aaron hunt and hugo almeida to do some damage .
werder bremen 4-1 freiburg-kaiserslautern freiburg might have lost away to werder last week , but it was a defiant loss , and they were inches away from snatching a draw in the closing minutes at the weserstadion .
for no discernable reason , the modest team from the far south-western corner of the country is riding around in the top half of the table above the likes of bayern , werder and wolfsburg .
kaiserslautern , meanwhile , are coming to town on the back of four morale-sapping losses to frankfurt -lrb- 0-3 -rrb- , hamburg -lrb- 1-2 -rrb- , hanover -lrb- 0-1 -rrb- and the carnage of a trip to dortmund -lrb- 0-5 -rrb- .
but freiburg are blinking nervously in the heady heights , and kaiserslautern could well figure their luck must be about to turn soon .
plus the last time they played a southern team they tonked bayern 2-0 .
draw 1-1 hanover-cologne bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's keeper is in a huff ... but that 's just one worry among many a blistering start to the season for hanover -lrb- 13 points from six games -rrb- came to a thudding end two games ago when they ran into st. pauli .
that 1-0 loss , coupled with the international break that followed , apparently sapped their momentum .
the club then crashed headlong into bayern and mario gomez last week - who scored a brilliant hat-trick .
but if hanover were looking for a confidence boosting opponent , they could hardly have asked for anyone better than cologne , to whom the word “ crisis ” has been attached for weeks .
the pram belonging to resident star lukas podolski is rapidly running out of rattles , and handbags were drawn when colombian keeper faryd mondragon swanned off to the us to play for colombia without permission .
cologne - second from bottom - are still waiting for their second win of the season , but it 's unlikely to come this weekend .
hanover 1-0 nuremberg-wolfsburg wolfsburg are an unpredictable bunch this time round .
their results chart looks like a stock market in a volatile boom-bust economy : three straight defeats were followed by three straight victories , and then last week 's thriller against leverkusen saw them do it all in microcosm - they gave up a 2-0 lead to lose 3-2 in the space of 10 minutes .
but despite this , it 's clear that new manager steve mcclaren is beginning to get his killer trio of edin dzeko , diego and grafite into a groove .
but modest nuremberg are not an easy team to crack , at least for a bottom half side .
but despite last week 's madness , the momentum seems to be with wolfsburg , and there should be more space between the teams than a single place .
wolfsburg 2-1 sunday , october 24 dortmund-hoffenheim the sunday matches all feature germany 's europa league representatives , who played thursday evening , but dortmund did not have to travel , so weariness should not be a factor for the league leaders .
this is good news , because this match should be a cracker .
it 's first against fourth , and dortmund are currently rampaging through the league like they used to back in the day , i.e. the mid-90s .
it 's a heartening sight for those who can remember when bayern had a proper rival , and they are up against - in theory - one of the most exciting new forces in german football in hoffenheim .
while they were undone last year by a thin squad , coach ralf rangnick ’ s men are looking a more robust force this time round .
but despite good results , their recent draw against struggling cologne shows how fallible they are .
dortmund 2-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like the good old days - dortmund on the rampage leverkusen-mainz this one should also be a great game , with second-placed mainz away to third-placed leverkusen .
mainz 's run of seven straight wins came to an abrupt halt last week against hamburg , so it will be interesting to see if the unfancied club can get the ball rolling again .
everyone is expecting this bunch of cheeky young jack-rabbits to finally wake up and realize it was all a big misunderstanding , and they should be hacking through years of mid-table obscurity like honest , decent folk .
so will they dare to dream ?
leverkusen , meanwhile , are exactly the kind of grizzled , seen-it-all veterans who will know how to sap the will of these idealistic young upstarts .
it 's a bit like morgan freeman and brad pitt in seven .
hopefully with a bit less torture .
leverkusen 2-1 stuttgart-st.pauli it would take some kind of devastating natural disaster for stuttgart 's season to get much worse , but last week 's 2-2 draw against schalke - orchestrated by nubile new manager jens keller - was a definite improvement .
coupled with that , their very handy 1-0 win over getafe in the europa league on thursday will have further boosted confidence .
when you have four points from eight games , i guess the only way is up .
they are facing a st. pauli side who may be all of twelve places above them , but have not exactly been the model of consistency in the last few match days .
but all things being equal , st. pauli did just record a very impressive 3-2 win over nuremberg , and will expect to beat stuttgart , even if it does take sheer will .

hard not to see both sides scoring .
draw 2-2 moenchengladbach-werder bremen unlike bayern and schalke , werder ’ s champions league match this week was not a rousing home win , but a tough 1-1 draw away to the dutch champions fc twente .
they have n't kept a clean sheet in the league since match day three , and they lost their first choice goalkeeper tim wiese to a knee injury in the aforementioned melee in the netherlands .
their second-choice goalkeeper is also out , so they are relying on 21-year-old sebastian mielitz between the sticks , a rookie with two bundesliga games and half of wednesday 's european match to his name .
it 's a godsend , then , that werder are facing the only team in the bundesliga with a worse defensive record .
moenchengladbach are shipping an average of nearly three goals a game at the moment , are toiling one point above the relegation zone , and are without eight first-team players for this match .
you 'd have to expect the likes of claudio pizarro , aaron hunt and hugo almeida to do some damage .
werder bremen 4-1 freiburg-kaiserslautern freiburg might have lost away to werder last week , but it was a defiant loss , and they were inches away from snatching a draw in the closing minutes at the weserstadion .
for no discernable reason , the modest team from the far south-western corner of the country is riding around in the top half of the table above the likes of bayern , werder and wolfsburg .
kaiserslautern , meanwhile , are coming to town on the back of four morale-sapping losses to frankfurt -lrb- 0-3 -rrb- , hamburg -lrb- 1-2 -rrb- , hanover -lrb- 0-1 -rrb- and the carnage of a trip to dortmund -lrb- 0-5 -rrb- .
but freiburg are blinking nervously in the heady heights , and kaiserslautern could well figure their luck must be about to turn soon .
plus the last time they played a southern team they tonked bayern 2-0 .
draw 1-1 hanover-cologne bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's keeper is in a huff ... but that 's just one worry among many a blistering start to the season for hanover -lrb- 13 points from six games -rrb- came to a thudding end two games ago when they ran into st. pauli .
that 1-0 loss , coupled with the international break that followed , apparently sapped their momentum .
the club then crashed headlong into bayern and mario gomez last week - who scored a brilliant hat-trick .
but if hanover were looking for a confidence boosting opponent , they could hardly have asked for anyone better than cologne , to whom the word “ crisis ” has been attached for weeks .
the pram belonging to resident star lukas podolski is rapidly running out of rattles , and handbags were drawn when colombian keeper faryd mondragon swanned off to the us to play for colombia without permission .
cologne - second from bottom - are still waiting for their second win of the season , but it 's unlikely to come this weekend .
hanover 1-0 nuremberg-wolfsburg wolfsburg are an unpredictable bunch this time round .
their results chart looks like a stock market in a volatile boom-bust economy : three straight defeats were followed by three straight victories , and then last week 's thriller against leverkusen saw them do it all in microcosm - they gave up a 2-0 lead to lose 3-2 in the space of 10 minutes .
but despite this , it 's clear that new manager steve mcclaren is beginning to get his killer trio of edin dzeko , diego and grafite into a groove .
but modest nuremberg are not an easy team to crack , at least for a bottom half side .
but despite last week 's madness , the momentum seems to be with wolfsburg , and there should be more space between the teams than a single place .
wolfsburg 2-1 sunday , october 24 dortmund-hoffenheim the sunday matches all feature germany 's europa league representatives , who played thursday evening , but dortmund did not have to travel , so weariness should not be a factor for the league leaders .
this is good news , because this match should be a cracker .
it 's first against fourth , and dortmund are currently rampaging through the league like they used to back in the day , i.e. the mid-90s .
it 's a heartening sight for those who can remember when bayern had a proper rival , and they are up against - in theory - one of the most exciting new forces in german football in hoffenheim .
while they were undone last year by a thin squad , coach ralf rangnick ’ s men are looking a more robust force this time round .
but despite good results , their recent draw against struggling cologne shows how fallible they are .
dortmund 2-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like the good old days - dortmund on the rampage leverkusen-mainz this one should also be a great game , with second-placed mainz away to third-placed leverkusen .
mainz 's run of seven straight wins came to an abrupt halt last week against hamburg , so it will be interesting to see if the unfancied club can get the ball rolling again .
everyone is expecting this bunch of cheeky young jack-rabbits to finally wake up and realize it was all a big misunderstanding , and they should be hacking through years of mid-table obscurity like honest , decent folk .
so will they dare to dream ?
leverkusen , meanwhile , are exactly the kind of grizzled , seen-it-all veterans who will know how to sap the will of these idealistic young upstarts .
it 's a bit like morgan freeman and brad pitt in seven .
hopefully with a bit less torture .
leverkusen 2-1 stuttgart-st.pauli it would take some kind of devastating natural disaster for stuttgart 's season to get much worse , but last week 's 2-2 draw against schalke - orchestrated by nubile new manager jens keller - was a definite improvement .
coupled with that , their very handy 1-0 win over getafe in the europa league on thursday will have further boosted confidence .
when you have four points from eight games , i guess the only way is up .
they are facing a st. pauli side who may be all of twelve places above them , but have not exactly been the model of consistency in the last few match days .
but all things being equal , st. pauli did just record a very impressive 3-2 win over nuremberg , and will expect to beat stuttgart , even if it does take sheer will .

match day nine represents the start of the second quarter of the bundesliga season , which means we 've entered what is officially termed the “ run-up to christmas ” - both in footballing and commercial terms . you may not know it , but we 're on the home straight towards christmas . this means two important things - kicking a ball and spending more money - will suddenly be jostling for attention in the brains of germany 's professional footballers . that may prove too heavy a mental burden , so on-field concentration could easily slip .
but given the form of the dw predictors over the last two weeks -lrb- 10 points from a possible 54 -rrb- , one more random factor can probably only help .
friday , october 22 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friday 's north-south derby is a bundesliga classic hamburg-bayern as the team that stopped the juggernaut that was mainz last week with a 1-0 away win , hamburg might be confident they can take on a bigger team of reds in what is known as the north-south derby .
but they are facing a resurgent bayern munich , who are clearly growing in confidence after a dreadful start , and who will be galvanized by the return of their famous dusel -lrb- luck -rrb- in their win over cfr cluj in the champions league .
moreover , bayern coach louis van gaal has made this a do-or-die game for his team 's championship hopes .
“ we ca n't drop many more points .
we have to win in hamburg , ” he told reporters after the cluj game .
the dutchman is basically baiting fate , and call me a fool , but i think fate will bite - gomez to get a deflected winner in injury time .
bayern 2-1 saturday , october 23 frankfurt-schalke schalke will also have an extra spring in their stride this weekend after a successful excursion in the champions league .
they watched israeli champions hapoel fold against the onslaught by the royal blues ’ star signing raul .

they are facing a st. pauli side who may be all of twelve places above them , but have not exactly been the model of consistency in the last few match days .

match day nine represents the start of the second quarter of the bundesliga season , which means we 've entered what is officially termed the “ run-up to christmas ” - both in footballing and commercial terms . you may not know it , but we 're on the home straight towards christmas . this means two important things - kicking a ball and spending more money - will suddenly be jostling for attention in the brains of germany 's professional footballers . that may prove too heavy a mental burden , so on-field concentration could easily slip .
but given the form of the dw predictors over the last two weeks -lrb- 10 points from a possible 54 -rrb- , one more random factor can probably only help .
friday , october 22 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friday 's north-south derby is a bundesliga classic hamburg-bayern as the team that stopped the juggernaut that was mainz last week with a 1-0 away win , hamburg might be confident they can take on a bigger team of reds in what is known as the north-south derby .
but they are facing a resurgent bayern munich , who are clearly growing in confidence after a dreadful start , and who will be galvanized by the return of their famous dusel -lrb- luck -rrb- in their win over cfr cluj in the champions league .
moreover , bayern coach louis van gaal has made this a do-or-die game for his team 's championship hopes .
“ we ca n't drop many more points .
we have to win in hamburg , ” he told reporters after the cluj game .
the dutchman is basically baiting fate , and call me a fool , but i think fate will bite - gomez to get a deflected winner in injury time .
bayern 2-1 saturday , october 23 frankfurt-schalke schalke will also have an extra spring in their stride this weekend after a successful excursion in the champions league .
they watched israeli champions hapoel fold against the onslaught by the royal blues ’ star signing raul .
the spanish veteran scored two - one more than he has scored all season in the bundesliga - and there are signs that felix magath 's carefully constructed and thoroughly oiled schalke machine is finally beginning to find its gears .
that said , frankfurt are on a run of three straight wins , and greek forward theofanis gekas is on fire just now - he became the joint top scorer in the league during last week 's 3-0 drubbing of kaiserslautern .
hard not to see both sides scoring .
draw 2-2 moenchengladbach-werder bremen unlike bayern and schalke , werder ’ s champions league match this week was not a rousing home win , but a tough 1-1 draw away to the dutch champions fc twente .
they have n't kept a clean sheet in the league since match day three , and they lost their first choice goalkeeper tim wiese to a knee injury in the aforementioned melee in the netherlands .
their second-choice goalkeeper is also out , so they are relying on 21-year-old sebastian mielitz between the sticks , a rookie with two bundesliga games and half of wednesday 's european match to his name .
it 's a godsend , then , that werder are facing the only team in the bundesliga with a worse defensive record .
moenchengladbach are shipping an average of nearly three goals a game at the moment , are toiling one point above the relegation zone , and are without eight first-team players for this match .
you 'd have to expect the likes of claudio pizarro , aaron hunt and hugo almeida to do some damage .
werder bremen 4-1 freiburg-kaiserslautern freiburg might have lost away to werder last week , but it was a defiant loss , and they were inches away from snatching a draw in the closing minutes at the weserstadion .
for no discernable reason , the modest team from the far south-western corner of the country is riding around in the top half of the table above the likes of bayern , werder and wolfsburg .
kaiserslautern , meanwhile , are coming to town on the back of four morale-sapping losses to frankfurt -lrb- 0-3 -rrb- , hamburg -lrb- 1-2 -rrb- , hanover -lrb- 0-1 -rrb- and the carnage of a trip to dortmund -lrb- 0-5 -rrb- .
but freiburg are blinking nervously in the heady heights , and kaiserslautern could well figure their luck must be about to turn soon .
plus the last time they played a southern team they tonked bayern 2-0 .
draw 1-1 hanover-cologne bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's keeper is in a huff ... but that 's just one worry among many a blistering start to the season for hanover -lrb- 13 points from six games -rrb- came to a thudding end two games ago when they ran into st. pauli .
that 1-0 loss , coupled with the international break that followed , apparently sapped their momentum .
the club then crashed headlong into bayern and mario gomez last week - who scored a brilliant hat-trick .
but if hanover were looking for a confidence boosting opponent , they could hardly have asked for anyone better than cologne , to whom the word “ crisis ” has been attached for weeks .
the pram belonging to resident star lukas podolski is rapidly running out of rattles , and handbags were drawn when colombian keeper faryd mondragon swanned off to the us to play for colombia without permission .
cologne - second from bottom - are still waiting for their second win of the season , but it 's unlikely to come this weekend .
hanover 1-0 nuremberg-wolfsburg wolfsburg are an unpredictable bunch this time round .
their results chart looks like a stock market in a volatile boom-bust economy : three straight defeats were followed by three straight victories , and then last week 's thriller against leverkusen saw them do it all in microcosm - they gave up a 2-0 lead to lose 3-2 in the space of 10 minutes .
but despite this , it 's clear that new manager steve mcclaren is beginning to get his killer trio of edin dzeko , diego and grafite into a groove .
but modest nuremberg are not an easy team to crack , at least for a bottom half side .
but despite last week 's madness , the momentum seems to be with wolfsburg , and there should be more space between the teams than a single place .
wolfsburg 2-1 sunday , october 24 dortmund-hoffenheim the sunday matches all feature germany 's europa league representatives , who played thursday evening , but dortmund did not have to travel , so weariness should not be a factor for the league leaders .
this is good news , because this match should be a cracker .
it 's first against fourth , and dortmund are currently rampaging through the league like they used to back in the day , i.e. the mid-90s .
it 's a heartening sight for those who can remember when bayern had a proper rival , and they are up against - in theory - one of the most exciting new forces in german football in hoffenheim .
while they were undone last year by a thin squad , coach ralf rangnick ’ s men are looking a more robust force this time round .
but despite good results , their recent draw against struggling cologne shows how fallible they are .
dortmund 2-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like the good old days - dortmund on the rampage leverkusen-mainz this one should also be a great game , with second-placed mainz away to third-placed leverkusen .
mainz 's run of seven straight wins came to an abrupt halt last week against hamburg , so it will be interesting to see if the unfancied club can get the ball rolling again .
everyone is expecting this bunch of cheeky young jack-rabbits to finally wake up and realize it was all a big misunderstanding , and they should be hacking through years of mid-table obscurity like honest , decent folk .
so will they dare to dream ?
leverkusen , meanwhile , are exactly the kind of grizzled , seen-it-all veterans who will know how to sap the will of these idealistic young upstarts .
it 's a bit like morgan freeman and brad pitt in seven .
hopefully with a bit less torture .
leverkusen 2-1 stuttgart-st.pauli it would take some kind of devastating natural disaster for stuttgart 's season to get much worse , but last week 's 2-2 draw against schalke - orchestrated by nubile new manager jens keller - was a definite improvement .

he advocated in a speech on thursday tougher eurozone regulations , including sanctions to punish high deficits . the european union will be put to the test unless it tightens the measures in its stability and growth pact , according to german foreign minister guido westerwelle .
westerwelle said in a keynote speech to the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- in berlin on thursday that he was worried about europe , " because we will lose the people 's support if we simply proceed with our agenda after this crisis . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy agreed to fight against automatically imposed sanctions in renewed criticism of an agreement between chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy to drop demands for automatic sanctions on countries that breach the eurozone 's deficit ceiling , westerwelle urged political cooperation across europe to toughen the growth and stability pact .
" it is crucial that sanctions are not subjected to political opportunism , " westerwelle said .
merkel 's decision seemed to take westerwelle and other members of the governing coalition by surprise , but she insisted on thursday that she and westerwelle were on the same page regarding the proposal .
" we are completely in agreement , " merkel said , " that we should get a clear mandate for devising treaty changes by early next year , so these can be implemented by individual states by 2013 . " previously , merkel had supported the idea of more automatic sanctions that would take politics out of the equation , and her change of tune is seen by some as caving in to pressure from france . ' more sanctions , please ' westerwelle also warned against isolationist politics within the eu 's 27 member nations , saying that another financial crisis could ruin the fruits of decades of european politics .
" that 's why it 's so important that we act consistently and decisively in the interest of europe 's inner cohesion , " he said .
" a hard euro ca n't tolerate soft rules . "
westerwelle referred to the 22 proceedings brought against eu member states for acute deficits in the past few years .
he said sanctions had not been applied in a single one of these cases .
the foreign minister called for a mechanism to place sanctions on countries with bulging deficits , including bigger eu states .
the eurozone , westerwelle said , needed such a system to be consistent and ensure impartiality .
" it makes a big practical difference if sanctions are passed by a two-thirds majority , or blocked by a two-thirds majority , " he said .
westerwelle also countered those who might express discouragement with the european common currency , stressing that re-nationalization was not an option in the wake of the greek debt crisis .

the organization hopes to get russia on board for a common security structure . german chancellor angela merkel and nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen have reiterated their support for a planned european anti-missile defense shield and have expressed hope that russia will drop its objections to the plan .
moscow has in the past been the major stumbling block for the missile defense shield .
russia sees the shield as being at least partly directed against its own military might whereas nato and washington say its sole purpose is to protect europe from possible attack by rogue states such as iran or north korea .
at the nato summit november , the western alliance is hoping to reach agreement on a new strategic plan aimed at giving nato a new focus two decades after the end of the cold war .
in a surprise move , russian president dmitry medvedev earlier this week agreed to attend next month 's talks in portugal .
he indicated moscow was open to dialogue about the shield .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev in talks with sarkozy and merkel agreed to attend the upcoming nato summit " the openness of russia towards discussion over the missile defense system is a good signal , " merkel told reporters in berlin on friday .
but she cautioned that cooperation with russia would be slow in the making .
euro-atlantic security rasmussen added the threat of north korean or iranian missiles would affect russian cities as well as central european ones .
" we simply can not afford becoming the hostage of such an attack , " the nato chief said , saying that only a common defense system - with the inclusion of russia - could provide for a " true euro-atlantic security architecture . "
" there is a broad scope of areas where we could develop a broad scope of practical cooperation with russia , " rasmussen said , pointing not only to missile defense but also to afghanistan and international counter-terrorism .
both merkel and rasmussen however dismissed the idea of russia becoming part of the northern atlantic treaty organization any time soon .
" things have developed well in the last year , but i do n't think we should ask too much of one another , " the german chancellor said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel cautioned that cooperation with russia would be slow in the making rasmussen pointed out that russia had made it clear that joining nato was not an option for moscow and that a strategic partnership was the only realistic option .
" i 've taken note of some statements from moscow that russia would never apply for nato membership , because it was able to take care of security matters on its own , " the nato chief said .
" so , let 's rather pursue what i consider a realistic future , namely a true strategic partnership between nato and russia . "
merkel backs french nuclear arsenal german chancellor merkel also touched on berlin 's shifting position on nuclear defense .
she said nato members should retain nuclear capabilities as long as other , potentially hostile , countries still had nuclear weapons .
previously , german foreign minister guido westerwelle had expressed hopes that the missile shield would allow for a nuclear powers to cut their arsenals .
germany and france had been at odds over the issue earlier this week when french president nicolas sarkozy blatantly dismissed the idea that france would accept any foreign intervention in its nuclear arms policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there still is need for nuclear deterrent , merkel said paris insists on keeping its own nuclear weapons .
merkel ’ s statements after the talks with rasmussen on friday seemed to be aimed directly at concerns of western nuclear powers such as france that the defense shield could pressure them into reducing their arsenals .
reducing nuclear weapons needed to be based on the principle of reciprocity , merkel said .
" as long as there are nuclear weapons in the world , we need to have these capabilities . "
germany itself does not have any nuclear weapons , but has us weapons stationed on its territory .
nato as an international forum on security rasmussen however called for a general broadening of nato 's role , making it more of a political organization as opposed to having a solely military agenda .
" nato has to become a forum for consultation on international security , " he said .
cooperation with other regions of the world ought to be fostered , he added .
countries like china , india and pakistan should work in close dialogue with nato .
such a " cooperative approach " was not intended to be directed against any third countries but would rather work along the lines of united nations policies , rasmussen said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there still is need for nuclear deterrent , merkel said paris insists on keeping its own nuclear weapons .
merkel ’ s statements after the talks with rasmussen on friday seemed to be aimed directly at concerns of western nuclear powers such as france that the defense shield could pressure them into reducing their arsenals .
reducing nuclear weapons needed to be based on the principle of reciprocity , merkel said .
" as long as there are nuclear weapons in the world , we need to have these capabilities . "
germany itself does not have any nuclear weapons , but has us weapons stationed on its territory .
nato as an international forum on security rasmussen however called for a general broadening of nato 's role , making it more of a political organization as opposed to having a solely military agenda .
" nato has to become a forum for consultation on international security , " he said .
cooperation with other regions of the world ought to be fostered , he added .
countries like china , india and pakistan should work in close dialogue with nato .
such a " cooperative approach " was not intended to be directed against any third countries but would rather work along the lines of united nations policies , rasmussen said .

he advocated in a speech on thursday tougher eurozone regulations , including sanctions to punish high deficits . the european union will be put to the test unless it tightens the measures in its stability and growth pact , according to german foreign minister guido westerwelle .
westerwelle said in a keynote speech to the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- in berlin on thursday that he was worried about europe , " because we will lose the people 's support if we simply proceed with our agenda after this crisis . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy agreed to fight against automatically imposed sanctions in renewed criticism of an agreement between chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy to drop demands for automatic sanctions on countries that breach the eurozone 's deficit ceiling , westerwelle urged political cooperation across europe to toughen the growth and stability pact .
" it is crucial that sanctions are not subjected to political opportunism , " westerwelle said .
merkel 's decision seemed to take westerwelle and other members of the governing coalition by surprise , but she insisted on thursday that she and westerwelle were on the same page regarding the proposal .
" we are completely in agreement , " merkel said , " that we should get a clear mandate for devising treaty changes by early next year , so these can be implemented by individual states by 2013 . " previously , merkel had supported the idea of more automatic sanctions that would take politics out of the equation , and her change of tune is seen by some as caving in to pressure from france . ' more sanctions , please ' westerwelle also warned against isolationist politics within the eu 's 27 member nations , saying that another financial crisis could ruin the fruits of decades of european politics .
" that 's why it 's so important that we act consistently and decisively in the interest of europe 's inner cohesion , " he said .
" a hard euro ca n't tolerate soft rules . "
westerwelle referred to the 22 proceedings brought against eu member states for acute deficits in the past few years .
he said sanctions had not been applied in a single one of these cases .
the foreign minister called for a mechanism to place sanctions on countries with bulging deficits , including bigger eu states .
the eurozone , westerwelle said , needed such a system to be consistent and ensure impartiality .
" it makes a big practical difference if sanctions are passed by a two-thirds majority , or blocked by a two-thirds majority , " he said .
westerwelle also countered those who might express discouragement with the european common currency , stressing that re-nationalization was not an option in the wake of the greek debt crisis .

although they are only preliminary results , they clearly show who the winners and losers are .
ratbil shamel has this opinion piece : now the secret , which never was one , is out .
the wolesi jirga , afghanistan ’ s lower house , will continue to be run by the country ’ s warlords over the next five years .
former mujahedin leaders and their allies have won in almost all the constituencies .
even in kabul , a city which at the beginning of the 1990s was almost completely destroyed by the battles between the various mujahedin groupings , the picture is the same .
hardly anybody in afghanistan is surprised by the results .
many had said even before the elections took place that they did not have any faith in afghanistan 's supposedly ' independent ' election commission -lrb- iec -rrb- .
and the fact that certain sections of the afghan population still went to vote has another explanation - they wanted to show that they , at least , take democracy seriously .
they went to the polls because they wanted to tell the world : " we afghans reject war , the taliban and extremism " .
many afghans perhaps don ’ t really know what democracy means or how a parliament functions but one thing that they know for sure is that a peaceful struggle is better than war .
and the people in afghanistan have been experiencing war for over 30 years .
yet hardly anyone is deluded enough to think that his / her vote makes a difference .
despite three elections in the past nine years , their lives have not improved for the better .
on the contrary .
the taliban are getting stronger and stronger by the day , while the government is becoming weaker .
and they know that the new parliament will not change much .
the erstwhile leaders of the mujahedin will certainly not fight for democratic reforms in the future .
their goal is clear - to strengthen their own position of power in the country .
this power will increase the more the international community pulls out of afghanistan .
some observers believe it will become increasingly difficult for president hamid karzai to govern but the opposite will be true .
karzai has long been counting on the mujahedin card .
his two deputies were chosen out of these ranks last year , despite national and international criticism .
but the real losers of this election , far more than hamid karzai , are the small democratic groupings in afghanistan .
in the past nine years , they have not managed to unite over a few common goals .
instead , they have founded countless political parties that carry no weight in afghanistan ’ s power struggle .
they fielded hundreds of candidates this time but will have to wake up to the fact that they have lost , again .
a further loser in these elections is the international community , especially the west .
democracy , peace and well-being were promised to the people of afghanistan almost a decade ago .
but the taliban and former warlords continue to determine the lives of the afghans .
afghanistan can not be left to the taliban and the warlords again .
the consequences of such a policy are clear to everybody – instability for the region and the world .

although they are only preliminary results , they clearly show who the winners and losers are .
ratbil shamel has this opinion piece : now the secret , which never was one , is out .
the wolesi jirga , afghanistan ’ s lower house , will continue to be run by the country ’ s warlords over the next five years .
former mujahedin leaders and their allies have won in almost all the constituencies .
even in kabul , a city which at the beginning of the 1990s was almost completely destroyed by the battles between the various mujahedin groupings , the picture is the same .
hardly anybody in afghanistan is surprised by the results .
many had said even before the elections took place that they did not have any faith in afghanistan 's supposedly ' independent ' election commission -lrb- iec -rrb- .
and the fact that certain sections of the afghan population still went to vote has another explanation - they wanted to show that they , at least , take democracy seriously .
they went to the polls because they wanted to tell the world : " we afghans reject war , the taliban and extremism " .
many afghans perhaps don ’ t really know what democracy means or how a parliament functions but one thing that they know for sure is that a peaceful struggle is better than war .
and the people in afghanistan have been experiencing war for over 30 years .
yet hardly anyone is deluded enough to think that his / her vote makes a difference .
despite three elections in the past nine years , their lives have not improved for the better .
on the contrary .
the taliban are getting stronger and stronger by the day , while the government is becoming weaker .
and they know that the new parliament will not change much .
the erstwhile leaders of the mujahedin will certainly not fight for democratic reforms in the future .
their goal is clear - to strengthen their own position of power in the country .
this power will increase the more the international community pulls out of afghanistan .
some observers believe it will become increasingly difficult for president hamid karzai to govern but the opposite will be true .
karzai has long been counting on the mujahedin card .
his two deputies were chosen out of these ranks last year , despite national and international criticism .
but the real losers of this election , far more than hamid karzai , are the small democratic groupings in afghanistan .
in the past nine years , they have not managed to unite over a few common goals .
instead , they have founded countless political parties that carry no weight in afghanistan ’ s power struggle .
they fielded hundreds of candidates this time but will have to wake up to the fact that they have lost , again .
a further loser in these elections is the international community , especially the west .
democracy , peace and well-being were promised to the people of afghanistan almost a decade ago .
but the taliban and former warlords continue to determine the lives of the afghans .
afghanistan can not be left to the taliban and the warlords again .
the consequences of such a policy are clear to everybody – instability for the region and the world .

he advocated in a speech on thursday tougher eurozone regulations , including sanctions to punish high deficits . the european union will be put to the test unless it tightens the measures in its stability and growth pact , according to german foreign minister guido westerwelle .
westerwelle said in a keynote speech to the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- in berlin on thursday that he was worried about europe , " because we will lose the people 's support if we simply proceed with our agenda after this crisis . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy agreed to fight against automatically imposed sanctions in renewed criticism of an agreement between chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy to drop demands for automatic sanctions on countries that breach the eurozone 's deficit ceiling , westerwelle urged political cooperation across europe to toughen the growth and stability pact .
" it is crucial that sanctions are not subjected to political opportunism , " westerwelle said .
merkel 's decision seemed to take westerwelle and other members of the governing coalition by surprise , but she insisted on thursday that she and westerwelle were on the same page regarding the proposal .
" we are completely in agreement , " merkel said , " that we should get a clear mandate for devising treaty changes by early next year , so these can be implemented by individual states by 2013 . " previously , merkel had supported the idea of more automatic sanctions that would take politics out of the equation , and her change of tune is seen by some as caving in to pressure from france . ' more sanctions , please ' westerwelle also warned against isolationist politics within the eu 's 27 member nations , saying that another financial crisis could ruin the fruits of decades of european politics .
" that 's why it 's so important that we act consistently and decisively in the interest of europe 's inner cohesion , " he said .
" a hard euro ca n't tolerate soft rules . "
westerwelle referred to the 22 proceedings brought against eu member states for acute deficits in the past few years .
he said sanctions had not been applied in a single one of these cases .
the foreign minister called for a mechanism to place sanctions on countries with bulging deficits , including bigger eu states .
the eurozone , westerwelle said , needed such a system to be consistent and ensure impartiality .
" it makes a big practical difference if sanctions are passed by a two-thirds majority , or blocked by a two-thirds majority , " he said .
westerwelle also countered those who might express discouragement with the european common currency , stressing that re-nationalization was not an option in the wake of the greek debt crisis .

he advocated in a speech on thursday tougher eurozone regulations , including sanctions to punish high deficits . the european union will be put to the test unless it tightens the measures in its stability and growth pact , according to german foreign minister guido westerwelle .
westerwelle said in a keynote speech to the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- in berlin on thursday that he was worried about europe , " because we will lose the people 's support if we simply proceed with our agenda after this crisis . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy agreed to fight against automatically imposed sanctions in renewed criticism of an agreement between chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy to drop demands for automatic sanctions on countries that breach the eurozone 's deficit ceiling , westerwelle urged political cooperation across europe to toughen the growth and stability pact .
" it is crucial that sanctions are not subjected to political opportunism , " westerwelle said .
merkel 's decision seemed to take westerwelle and other members of the governing coalition by surprise , but she insisted on thursday that she and westerwelle were on the same page regarding the proposal .
" we are completely in agreement , " merkel said , " that we should get a clear mandate for devising treaty changes by early next year , so these can be implemented by individual states by 2013 . " previously , merkel had supported the idea of more automatic sanctions that would take politics out of the equation , and her change of tune is seen by some as caving in to pressure from france . ' more sanctions , please ' westerwelle also warned against isolationist politics within the eu 's 27 member nations , saying that another financial crisis could ruin the fruits of decades of european politics .
" that 's why it 's so important that we act consistently and decisively in the interest of europe 's inner cohesion , " he said .
" a hard euro ca n't tolerate soft rules . "
westerwelle referred to the 22 proceedings brought against eu member states for acute deficits in the past few years .
he said sanctions had not been applied in a single one of these cases .
the foreign minister called for a mechanism to place sanctions on countries with bulging deficits , including bigger eu states .
the eurozone , westerwelle said , needed such a system to be consistent and ensure impartiality .
" it makes a big practical difference if sanctions are passed by a two-thirds majority , or blocked by a two-thirds majority , " he said .
westerwelle also countered those who might express discouragement with the european common currency , stressing that re-nationalization was not an option in the wake of the greek debt crisis .

but in the wake of the global crisis , it 's germany that 's emerging with ease , which countries like the us can learn from . unemployment figures in germany are down to 1992 levels , and german exports are on the rise as if the global economic crisis had never happened .
in comparison , the economy in the united states is doing a lot worse : unemployment stands high at 9.6 percent , and growth rates are far from the positive figures that are coming out of germany .
and yet , there 's no secret recipe behind the success of the german economy , says thomas zielke , deputy delegate of the german economy in washington – it all comes down to exports , he told deutsche welle .
" it 's that great flexibility of companies , and the will to expand .
people are simply used to focusing on exports , " zielke said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shapiro says germany has been well prepared for the crisis that 's not necessarily the case in the us , he says , where companies are used to relying much more on their own domestic market .
in the united states , exports only make up 13 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , but the figure in germany is more than three times higher .
and while most of germany 's exports are going to other eu countries , the biggest growth rates are in exports to the rest of the world .
investing in exports if the domestic market crumbles in a time of recession , companies have little choice other than to invest in exports , robert shapiro , economic advisor to the us government , told deutsche welle .
" that has always been germany 's strength , " he said .
" the country has been very well prepared for that . "
there are other factors behind germany 's success in handling the crisis that shapiro and his colleagues have taken a closer look at .
one example is government action , such as subsidizing shortened working hours .
by covering part of the salaries of workers who are put on reduced hours , berlin has managed to avoid a situation where too many people had to be laid off during the recession .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a manufacturing-based economy can more easily focus on exports jacob kirkegaard of the peterson institute for international economics told deutsche welle that he felt a lot of respect for germany 's quick resurgence .
" germany has proven that it 's possible to handle a dramatic slump in sales and exports without mass firings , " he says .
" you just have much more flexibility than on the us market .
here the gut reaction is always : when the sales go down , people have to be fired .
and when the demand is back , there 's a lack of workers . "
too much government involvement ?
but shapiro cautions against simply adapting that system to the us economy .
cultural differences are part of the problem – americans are traditionally opposed to their government getting involved in running businesses .
he also warned that despite the currently positive outlook there are still many risks for germany .
european monetary policy is too fragile , he says , as it has to balance between the interests of all the eu member states .
the danger of countries running bankrupt is still there .
greece for instance has not seen its situation improve as much as the rest of europe had hoped it would .
and other member states like ireland or spain are still struggling to avoid a crisis .
a moral price to pay shapiro and kirkegaard agree that germany 's exports to china are also not without a downside .
there 's a moral price to pay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us economy is struggling despite austerity measures " germany is rather careful in criticizing china because of course berlin does not want to put its exports at risk .
the us however are much more outspoken .
but that of course has an impact on us exports to china . "
and still , the us already seem to be readjusting their economic policy to follow more in the direction that germany is taking .
the obama government has recognized the importance of exports – the goal is to increase exports by five percent .
" the current administration has export at the top of its agenda , " thomas zielke says .
" obama has repeatedly said that he sees the future as being in manufacturing .
and he has put that directly in opposition to wall street and the financial crisis . "

" we expect that within 10 days , the situation in terzigno can return to normal , " he told a news conference in rome after an emergency meeting .
the government 's plans to build a new dump in terzigno , which is located 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- southeast of naples in vesuvius national park , have for years met with fierce opposition by locals , who have repeatedly blocked access to the existing waste disposal site there .

but bribery is widespread .
the electoral system still has many pitfalls and china has not been too eager to incorporate more democratic elements . since 1986 villagers in china have been allowed to vote every three years .
they can elect the party chief of their village .
but only 20 percent of such elections are competitive .
often there is only one candidate , in some cases simply chosen by the communist party .
in many cases such elections are manipulated with votes being bought .
prosecutors in the southern chinese province of hainan found that bribes have gone up in recent years .
candidates used to pay villagers the equivalent of 1.50 us dollar for their support at the ballot box .
today the price has gone up to 177 dollars .
money for votes in villages where there are substantial assets such as land for leasing and other business opportunities , candidates are most likely to buy votes , says joseph cheng , chair professor of political science at the city university of hong kong .
" some village entrepreneurs like to get the position of the village chief for reasons of prestige or for the purpose of building networks .
so they are willing to spend money to secure their electoral position , " he explains .
civil society reports of bribery and other abuse in democratic processes at grassroots level can be seen regularly in the official chinese media .
it helps to convey the impression that democracy is a flawed concept .
the lack of a civil society in china is also a reason why people do not develop a feeling for democratic procedures , experts say .
but china is developing quickly , according to thomas heberer from duisburg university .
call for democratic reforms " one can now plan one 's life as one likes and not be directed by the state or the party any more .
this is the moment when individual autonomy gains in strength .
this is a precondition for building citizens .
and citizens are a precondition for establishing a civil society , " says heberer .
recently voices have been calling for democratic reform within the communist party , a demand reiterated by premier wen jiabao .
but his remarks have not been echoed by other leaders .
and the statements have not been reported by official state media .
keeping control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grassroots elections were introduced in the late 1980s .
china 's leaders are not elected by the people china ’ s leadership wants to contain democratic developments within the country .
they don ’ t want to implement anything that may get out of control . village elections have not advanced to higher levels because at town and township level the leaders are from the party cadres .
but if they are elected by the people , this will be in direct contradiction to the basic principle that the party controls the cadres .
still , there is some hope .
china ’ s future leaders are better educated and have more exposure to the western world .
some experts think that china ’ s potential future president xi jinping might introduce more democratic reforms after coming to power .
however , his father was a high ranking party official who condemned the pro-democracy crackdown in tiananmen square .
so far , says joseph cheng , xi jinping has not given any indication that he may be a great reformer .

but only 20 percent of such elections are competitive .
often there is only one candidate , in some cases simply chosen by the communist party .
in many cases such elections are manipulated with votes being bought .
prosecutors in the southern chinese province of hainan found that bribes have gone up in recent years .
candidates used to pay villagers the equivalent of 1.50 us dollar for their support at the ballot box .
today the price has gone up to 177 dollars .
money for votes in villages where there are substantial assets such as land for leasing and other business opportunities , candidates are most likely to buy votes , says joseph cheng , chair professor of political science at the city university of hong kong .
" some village entrepreneurs like to get the position of the village chief for reasons of prestige or for the purpose of building networks .
so they are willing to spend money to secure their electoral position , " he explains .
civil society reports of bribery and other abuse in democratic processes at grassroots level can be seen regularly in the official chinese media .
it helps to convey the impression that democracy is a flawed concept .
the lack of a civil society in china is also a reason why people do not develop a feeling for democratic procedures , experts say .
but china is developing quickly , according to thomas heberer from duisburg university .
call for democratic reforms " one can now plan one 's life as one likes and not be directed by the state or the party any more .
this is the moment when individual autonomy gains in strength .
this is a precondition for building citizens .
and citizens are a precondition for establishing a civil society , " says heberer .
recently voices have been calling for democratic reform within the communist party , a demand reiterated by premier wen jiabao .
but his remarks have not been echoed by other leaders .
and the statements have not been reported by official state media .
keeping control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grassroots elections were introduced in the late 1980s .
china 's leaders are not elected by the people china ’ s leadership wants to contain democratic developments within the country .
they don ’ t want to implement anything that may get out of control . village elections have not advanced to higher levels because at town and township level the leaders are from the party cadres .
but if they are elected by the people , this will be in direct contradiction to the basic principle that the party controls the cadres .
still , there is some hope .
china ’ s future leaders are better educated and have more exposure to the western world .
some experts think that china ’ s potential future president xi jinping might introduce more democratic reforms after coming to power .
however , his father was a high ranking party official who condemned the pro-democracy crackdown in tiananmen square .
so far , says joseph cheng , xi jinping has not given any indication that he may be a great reformer .

after the first day of talks , both sides claimed their positions had been strengthened . veteran conservative politician heiner geissler , who is leading the mediation talks on the controversial rail project stuttgart 21 , said the first round was a good start for " an experiment in democracy , " calling the discussions fair and to the point .

palmer also called on mappus to clear the way for a referendum on the project .
while deutsche bahn argues that the new underground station will boost passenger numbers by two million , critics say the figures do not add up and costs are likely to escalate .

the leader of the freedom party is facing charges of inciting racial hatred against muslims . dutch anti-islam politician geert wilders welcomed the decision by a dutch court to order a retrial with new judges , after he complained that the current judges were biased .
" this gives me a new chance of a new fair trial , " wilders told the reuters news agency .
" i 'm confident i can only be acquitted , because i have broken no law , but spoken the truth , " he insisted .
wilders ' lawyer had asked the court to replace the judges because of concern about their being biased , after they did not immediately approve a request to hear testimony from a witness the defense considered crucial to its case .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilders has caused outrage among muslims back to square one the amsterdam court ruled that the defense 's fear of bias was " understandable " , meaning the entire trial process will have to be repeated , although it was not clear when it would reopen .
wilders has repeatedly equated islam and muslims with fascism and violence , and he also called for the koran to be banned in the netherlands .
the dutch politician 's anti-immigration freedom party was one of the big winners in june 's national elections and , while not part of the government , it has agreed to prop it up in crucial decisions .

but in the wake of the global crisis , it 's germany that 's emerging with ease , which countries like the us can learn from . unemployment figures in germany are down to 1992 levels , and german exports are on the rise as if the global economic crisis had never happened .
in comparison , the economy in the united states is doing a lot worse : unemployment stands high at 9.6 percent , and growth rates are far from the positive figures that are coming out of germany .
and yet , there 's no secret recipe behind the success of the german economy , says thomas zielke , deputy delegate of the german economy in washington – it all comes down to exports , he told deutsche welle .
" it 's that great flexibility of companies , and the will to expand .
people are simply used to focusing on exports , " zielke said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shapiro says germany has been well prepared for the crisis that 's not necessarily the case in the us , he says , where companies are used to relying much more on their own domestic market .
in the united states , exports only make up 13 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , but the figure in germany is more than three times higher .
and while most of germany 's exports are going to other eu countries , the biggest growth rates are in exports to the rest of the world .
investing in exports if the domestic market crumbles in a time of recession , companies have little choice other than to invest in exports , robert shapiro , economic advisor to the us government , told deutsche welle .
" that has always been germany 's strength , " he said .
" the country has been very well prepared for that . "
there are other factors behind germany 's success in handling the crisis that shapiro and his colleagues have taken a closer look at .
one example is government action , such as subsidizing shortened working hours .
by covering part of the salaries of workers who are put on reduced hours , berlin has managed to avoid a situation where too many people had to be laid off during the recession .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a manufacturing-based economy can more easily focus on exports jacob kirkegaard of the peterson institute for international economics told deutsche welle that he felt a lot of respect for germany 's quick resurgence .
" germany has proven that it 's possible to handle a dramatic slump in sales and exports without mass firings , " he says .
" you just have much more flexibility than on the us market .
here the gut reaction is always : when the sales go down , people have to be fired .
and when the demand is back , there 's a lack of workers . "
too much government involvement ?
but shapiro cautions against simply adapting that system to the us economy .
cultural differences are part of the problem – americans are traditionally opposed to their government getting involved in running businesses .
he also warned that despite the currently positive outlook there are still many risks for germany .
european monetary policy is too fragile , he says , as it has to balance between the interests of all the eu member states .
the danger of countries running bankrupt is still there .
greece for instance has not seen its situation improve as much as the rest of europe had hoped it would .
and other member states like ireland or spain are still struggling to avoid a crisis .
a moral price to pay shapiro and kirkegaard agree that germany 's exports to china are also not without a downside .
there 's a moral price to pay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us economy is struggling despite austerity measures " germany is rather careful in criticizing china because of course berlin does not want to put its exports at risk .

and still , the us already seem to be readjusting their economic policy to follow more in the direction that germany is taking .
the obama government has recognized the importance of exports – the goal is to increase exports by five percent .
" the current administration has export at the top of its agenda , " thomas zielke says .
" obama has repeatedly said that he sees the future as being in manufacturing .
and he has put that directly in opposition to wall street and the financial crisis . "

but in the wake of the global crisis , it 's germany that 's emerging with ease , which countries like the us can learn from . unemployment figures in germany are down to 1992 levels , and german exports are on the rise as if the global economic crisis had never happened .
in comparison , the economy in the united states is doing a lot worse : unemployment stands high at 9.6 percent , and growth rates are far from the positive figures that are coming out of germany .
and yet , there 's no secret recipe behind the success of the german economy , says thomas zielke , deputy delegate of the german economy in washington – it all comes down to exports , he told deutsche welle .
" it 's that great flexibility of companies , and the will to expand .
people are simply used to focusing on exports , " zielke said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shapiro says germany has been well prepared for the crisis that 's not necessarily the case in the us , he says , where companies are used to relying much more on their own domestic market .
in the united states , exports only make up 13 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , but the figure in germany is more than three times higher .
and while most of germany 's exports are going to other eu countries , the biggest growth rates are in exports to the rest of the world .
investing in exports if the domestic market crumbles in a time of recession , companies have little choice other than to invest in exports , robert shapiro , economic advisor to the us government , told deutsche welle .
" that has always been germany 's strength , " he said .
" the country has been very well prepared for that . "
there are other factors behind germany 's success in handling the crisis that shapiro and his colleagues have taken a closer look at .
one example is government action , such as subsidizing shortened working hours .
by covering part of the salaries of workers who are put on reduced hours , berlin has managed to avoid a situation where too many people had to be laid off during the recession .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a manufacturing-based economy can more easily focus on exports jacob kirkegaard of the peterson institute for international economics told deutsche welle that he felt a lot of respect for germany 's quick resurgence .
" germany has proven that it 's possible to handle a dramatic slump in sales and exports without mass firings , " he says .
" you just have much more flexibility than on the us market .
here the gut reaction is always : when the sales go down , people have to be fired .
and when the demand is back , there 's a lack of workers . "
too much government involvement ?
but shapiro cautions against simply adapting that system to the us economy .
cultural differences are part of the problem – americans are traditionally opposed to their government getting involved in running businesses .
he also warned that despite the currently positive outlook there are still many risks for germany .
european monetary policy is too fragile , he says , as it has to balance between the interests of all the eu member states .
the danger of countries running bankrupt is still there .
greece for instance has not seen its situation improve as much as the rest of europe had hoped it would .
and other member states like ireland or spain are still struggling to avoid a crisis .
a moral price to pay shapiro and kirkegaard agree that germany 's exports to china are also not without a downside .
there 's a moral price to pay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us economy is struggling despite austerity measures " germany is rather careful in criticizing china because of course berlin does not want to put its exports at risk .
the us however are much more outspoken .
but that of course has an impact on us exports to china . "
and still , the us already seem to be readjusting their economic policy to follow more in the direction that germany is taking .
the obama government has recognized the importance of exports – the goal is to increase exports by five percent .
" the current administration has export at the top of its agenda , " thomas zielke says .
" obama has repeatedly said that he sees the future as being in manufacturing .
and he has put that directly in opposition to wall street and the financial crisis . "
