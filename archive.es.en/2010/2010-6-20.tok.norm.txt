program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 20.06.2010 brazil survives group of death and advances to round of 16 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man of the match luis fabiano luis fabiano led the charge for a top-form brazil against the ivory coast in johannesburg on sunday night .
fabiano 's two goals propelled brazil to the win and into the knock-out round of the world cup . brazil 's 3-1 victory over the ivory coast in johannesburg on sunday night showed glimmers of why brazil is a perennial world cup favorite .
the brazilians appear to be finding their stride in the tournament , and in this game , luis fabiano was in the lead .
he scored two goals and helped propel brazil into the next round . fabiano 's first goal was orchestrated by passes from robinho and kaka .
fabiano found himself free to the side of the goal with only the keeper to beat .
boubacar barry was in good position for the ivory coast , but fabiano simply blasted the shot over the keeper 's head into the top of the net to score . fives minutes into the second half , fabiano displayed some brazilian flair for his second goal of the match .
he beat two defenders with light taps on the ball to send it over their heads , then controlled the pass to himself with his chest and fired away to score . however , television replays showed fabiano 's upper arm appeared to help him get the ball under control before he shot .
the ball also glanced off his hand at the start of the play . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elano and fabiano both have 2 goals in this world cup brazil rounded out its victory seven minutes later , as kaka sent a pass from near the end line back to midfielder elano , who surprised a sleeping ivorian defence and scored the easy goal . the ivory coast 's striker didier drogba pulled one back for his side in the 79th minute .
following a long , solo run , gervinho was caught by the brazilian defence and forced to pass away to yaya toure .
toure sent a perfect pass into the middle where drogba used a long header to put away the consolation goal . the final ten minutes of the game were quite physical , with several fouls being given and some heated words exchanged between players .
kaka was booked in the 88th minute for his second foul of the game and sent off the pitch .
the midfielder will miss brazil 's next match against portugal , which is merely a formality as the win against the ivory coast secures brazil 's place in the next round .
group f remains close for a few days at least , group f of the world cup was a nice , tidy four-way tie .
in the group 's first two matches , all four teams drew 1-1 with each other , giving them all one point and a goal differential of zero .
that deadlock was bound to be broken - paraguay took the initiative , beating slovakia 2-0 on sunday afternoon - but the group is still very tight as defending champs italy only managed a draw against group-underdogs new zealand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smeltz and the kiwis were more than happy with a draw against italy the all whites surprised italy by taking the lead in the 7th minute .
italian captain fabio cannavaro failed to clear a free kick , which left new zealand 's shane smeltz free to tap in the goal . the kiwi 's dreams of an upset win over the world cup title holders did n't last long , though .
italy was awarded a penalty kick in the 29th minute when daniele de rossi fell in a tussle with new zealand 's tommy smith in the box .
the ref showed smith a yellow card and pointed to the penalty spot .
vincenzo iaquinta took the kick to pull italy even with new zealand . although italy had the advantage for more or less the rest of the game , they failed to create scoring opportunities and are now level with new zealand on points in group f. paraguay takes the lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paraguay is in a good position at the top of the group by only managing a draw against new zealand , italy faces some pressure heading into their last group match against slovakia .
a win would secure a spot in the round of 16 , but a draw could leave them exposed to being bounced should new zealand continue to surprise and come up with a win or a high-scoring draw against paraguay . the south american team , however , looked strong in their 2-0 win against slovakia that sent them to the top of the group . enrique vera opened the scoring for paraguay in the 27th minute , taking a precise pass from lucas barrios and slipping a shot through two defenders and into the goal .
toward the end of the game , paraguay added its second goal for good measure as cristian riveros cleaned up a loose ball on the edge of the box and booted it past slovakian keeper jan mucha .
slovakia only had one shot on goal the entire game , and their best chance to score came in the 37th minute when defender kornel salata headed a corner over the goal .

villepin aims to capitalize on sarkozy 's current poor poll ratings .
sarkozy 's re-election has until now been regarded as a near-certainty , but a republique solidaire candidacy in the 2012 ballot could split the conservative vote .
launching the party speaking to a crowd of an estimated 3,000 supporters , villepin criticized " an ever-growing gap between words and acts , between what french people go through and what their leaders experience . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former prime minister was cleared of slander charges in january the former diplomat has been one of sarkozy 's strongest critics in the conservative camp .
he was prime minister under president jacques chirac and was known to have a tense relationship with sarkozy , who served as his interior minister .
villepin was a member of sarkozy 's ump party , but broke away after a bitter row . last year , villepin went on trial for allegedly taking part in a smear campaign to ruin sarkozy 's presidential bid , but was cleared of all charges .
splitting the vote polls show villepin would pick up no more than 7 or 8 percent of the vote in 2012 , but his personal approval ratings stand at 49 percent .
sarkozy 's rating has dropped in recent months to around 33 percent .
a presidential candidacy from villepin could split the right - at a time when the far-right in france is also challenging sarkozy .
marine le pen , vice president of the far right national front , said she was " very happy " about the prospect of villepin running in 2012 , as it could weaken sarkozy .
the head of the international monetary fund , dominique strauss-kahn , is also being touted as a candidate and is widely viewed as a favorite to head the socialist party ticket for 2012 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the heat is on : climate change and the media environmental journalists face political , physical threats worldwide global media forum tackles ' greatest challenge of the 21st century ' global media forum ends by urging people to learn to live with less a million trees and counting - german boy activist fights climate change media -pipe- 20.06.2010 journalists should not forget climate change , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : himalayan glaciers are melting slower than originally thought , but now media interest may be drying up a british study shows journalists are overlooking the issue of global warming in favor of more sensational stories , an issue that will be discussed at this year 's deutsche welle global media forum . it 's been a difficult few months for the intergovernmental panel on climate change , one of the foremost bodies charged with evaluating the risk climate change .
since the unearthing of an embarrassing error in the most recent ipcc report - the statement that the himalayan glaciers might be gone by 2035 - the hunt for further ipcc blunders has been on , drawing in scientists , bloggers and journalists from all over the world .
yet some experts argue that , the occasional scandal aside , climate change is a subject that receives relatively little media attention .
three years ago , dortmund university professor of journalism holger wormer described climate change as a " shooting star " topic for the media .
at the time , he and others in the scientific and journalistic communities had big ideas about the role the media could play in the struggle against global warming .
falling by the wayside bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental disasters could be drawing media attention away from climate change today , according to wormer , climate change is a topic that has fallen from editorial grace .
" we now have a lot of other things on our agenda , things that are developing and that have more impact than they did three years ago , for example the financial crisis , " he said .
" these things have pushed reporting on climate change into the background . "
wormer said that with other , more pressing environmental stories on the table - the gulf of mexico oil spill , or , in germany , recurring discussions over nuclear energy - the " slow and steady " threat of climate change has been pushed to the side and is now a topic that appears more often in the context of wider environmental or political coverage .
" i think we started a bit too late with serious reporting on the topic .
the reporting increased significantly only when there was more interest in climate change in the political agenda , " he said .
wormer 's concern appears to be backed up by the numbers .
last year , researchers from the university of liverpool in the uk released the results of an exhaustive study of climate change coverage in british newspapers .
they found that between 2000 and 2006 , the number of articles addressing climate change was modest : coverage peaked at around 100 articles per month .
" just to give you a comparison , the number of stories on health or crime were at about 400 to 500 stories per month the whole way through the period , " said neil gavin , a senior lecturer in politics at the university of liverpool and lead researcher of the study .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stories on emissions trading schemes are relegated to the business pages big topics still ' niche ' gavin , who has written and researched extensively on the relationship between climate change and the media , said even fewer journalists were attempting to tackle climate change-related topics like emissions trading schemes -lrb- etss -rrb- , the market-based approach to controlling pollution that provides big emitters with economic incentives to reduce polluting emissions , or peak oil , the point at which global petroleum discovery will peak , after which production will go into permanent decline .
when these terms do appear in newspapers , he said , they tend to be treated as niche topics , appearing in the business pages rather than in the news section of papers .
this has implications for accountability , he said .
in the european union , a major ets has been in place since 2005 and has already entered into its second phase , but gavin said his research recorded only around 20 mentions of the scheme between 2000 and 2006 .
" where is the accountability of the european union ?
what kind of corners -lsb- could be -rsb- being cut in phase two and three ? "
what 's more , the liverpool researchers found that in some newspapers , a significant amount of what little coverage appeared was focused on skeptical reporting .
" in the top-selling newspapers like the telegraph , daily mail , the sun and their sunday sister papers , 25 percent of the coverage ran along climate skeptic lines , " said gavin .
wormer said that despite recent revelations of mistakes in the ipcc reports , there is n't necessarily any reason for journalists to give more attention to climate skepticism .
" we should also be aware of the huge amount of pressure , the lobbying and the pr that goes into trying to -lsb- create -rsb- doubts over the science , " he said , citing the similar levels of pressure and skepticism in the last century over whether cigarettes posed a health hazard .
' keep it simple ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hedegaard says journalists can help by sticking to the facts connie hedegaard , the eu commissioner for climate action and the former danish minister for climate and energy , said the role journalists can play in helping to tackle climate change is a simple one .
" i think the media could help a lot by simply communicating the facts , " she said .
" and take care that when you have one or two errors in a huge report done by thousands of scientists not to communicate the message as if one or two errors would change the whole finding of the -lsb- report -rsb- .
i think it 's very important here to get the proportions right . "
hedegaard , herself a former television journalist , said while it would be wrong for the media to ignore climate skepticism altogether , it is also wrong to uncritically accept skepticism in the name of balance .
" the easiest thing in the world is to invite a guest who says that the planet is flat , and somebody who says , no , it 's round .
and the reporter 's job there is not just to hold the microphone and say , ' ok , a says it 's flat , the other one says it 's round , " ' she said .
" it is sometimes also -lsb- necessary -rsb- to be equipped to say something is factual , something is right and something is wrong ; " she said . " that is not being biased ; that 's just to help the listeners , the viewers and the readers to orient themselves in a jungle of information . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the heat is on : climate change and the media environmental journalists face political , physical threats worldwide global media forum tackles ' greatest challenge of the 21st century ' global media forum ends by urging people to learn to live with less a million trees and counting - german boy activist fights climate change media -pipe- 20.06.2010 journalists should not forget climate change , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : himalayan glaciers are melting slower than originally thought , but now media interest may be drying up a british study shows journalists are overlooking the issue of global warming in favor of more sensational stories , an issue that will be discussed at this year 's deutsche welle global media forum . it 's been a difficult few months for the intergovernmental panel on climate change , one of the foremost bodies charged with evaluating the risk climate change .
since the unearthing of an embarrassing error in the most recent ipcc report - the statement that the himalayan glaciers might be gone by 2035 - the hunt for further ipcc blunders has been on , drawing in scientists , bloggers and journalists from all over the world .
yet some experts argue that , the occasional scandal aside , climate change is a subject that receives relatively little media attention .
three years ago , dortmund university professor of journalism holger wormer described climate change as a " shooting star " topic for the media .
at the time , he and others in the scientific and journalistic communities had big ideas about the role the media could play in the struggle against global warming .
falling by the wayside bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental disasters could be drawing media attention away from climate change today , according to wormer , climate change is a topic that has fallen from editorial grace .
" we now have a lot of other things on our agenda , things that are developing and that have more impact than they did three years ago , for example the financial crisis , " he said .
" these things have pushed reporting on climate change into the background . "
wormer said that with other , more pressing environmental stories on the table - the gulf of mexico oil spill , or , in germany , recurring discussions over nuclear energy - the " slow and steady " threat of climate change has been pushed to the side and is now a topic that appears more often in the context of wider environmental or political coverage .
" i think we started a bit too late with serious reporting on the topic .
the reporting increased significantly only when there was more interest in climate change in the political agenda , " he said .
wormer 's concern appears to be backed up by the numbers .
last year , researchers from the university of liverpool in the uk released the results of an exhaustive study of climate change coverage in british newspapers .
they found that between 2000 and 2006 , the number of articles addressing climate change was modest : coverage peaked at around 100 articles per month .
" just to give you a comparison , the number of stories on health or crime were at about 400 to 500 stories per month the whole way through the period , " said neil gavin , a senior lecturer in politics at the university of liverpool and lead researcher of the study .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stories on emissions trading schemes are relegated to the business pages big topics still ' niche ' gavin , who has written and researched extensively on the relationship between climate change and the media , said even fewer journalists were attempting to tackle climate change-related topics like emissions trading schemes -lrb- etss -rrb- , the market-based approach to controlling pollution that provides big emitters with economic incentives to reduce polluting emissions , or peak oil , the point at which global petroleum discovery will peak , after which production will go into permanent decline .
when these terms do appear in newspapers , he said , they tend to be treated as niche topics , appearing in the business pages rather than in the news section of papers .
this has implications for accountability , he said .
in the european union , a major ets has been in place since 2005 and has already entered into its second phase , but gavin said his research recorded only around 20 mentions of the scheme between 2000 and 2006 .
" where is the accountability of the european union ?
what kind of corners -lsb- could be -rsb- being cut in phase two and three ? "
what 's more , the liverpool researchers found that in some newspapers , a significant amount of what little coverage appeared was focused on skeptical reporting .
" in the top-selling newspapers like the telegraph , daily mail , the sun and their sunday sister papers , 25 percent of the coverage ran along climate skeptic lines , " said gavin .
wormer said that despite recent revelations of mistakes in the ipcc reports , there is n't necessarily any reason for journalists to give more attention to climate skepticism .
" we should also be aware of the huge amount of pressure , the lobbying and the pr that goes into trying to -lsb- create -rsb- doubts over the science , " he said , citing the similar levels of pressure and skepticism in the last century over whether cigarettes posed a health hazard .
' keep it simple ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hedegaard says journalists can help by sticking to the facts connie hedegaard , the eu commissioner for climate action and the former danish minister for climate and energy , said the role journalists can play in helping to tackle climate change is a simple one .
" i think the media could help a lot by simply communicating the facts , " she said .
" and take care that when you have one or two errors in a huge report done by thousands of scientists not to communicate the message as if one or two errors would change the whole finding of the -lsb- report -rsb- .
i think it 's very important here to get the proportions right . "
hedegaard , herself a former television journalist , said while it would be wrong for the media to ignore climate skepticism altogether , it is also wrong to uncritically accept skepticism in the name of balance .
" the easiest thing in the world is to invite a guest who says that the planet is flat , and somebody who says , no , it 's round .
and the reporter 's job there is not just to hold the microphone and say , ' ok , a says it 's flat , the other one says it 's round , " ' she said .
" it is sometimes also -lsb- necessary -rsb- to be equipped to say something is factual , something is right and something is wrong ; " she said . " that is not being biased ; that 's just to help the listeners , the viewers and the readers to orient themselves in a jungle of information . "

former prime minister dominique de villepin has created a new center-right party called republique solidaire .
villepin aims to capitalize on sarkozy 's current poor poll ratings .
sarkozy 's re-election has until now been regarded as a near-certainty , but a republique solidaire candidacy in the 2012 ballot could split the conservative vote .
launching the party speaking to a crowd of an estimated 3,000 supporters , villepin criticized " an ever-growing gap between words and acts , between what french people go through and what their leaders experience . "

villepin was a member of sarkozy 's ump party , but broke away after a bitter row . last year , villepin went on trial for allegedly taking part in a smear campaign to ruin sarkozy 's presidential bid , but was cleared of all charges .
splitting the vote polls show villepin would pick up no more than 7 or 8 percent of the vote in 2012 , but his personal approval ratings stand at 49 percent .
sarkozy 's rating has dropped in recent months to around 33 percent .
a presidential candidacy from villepin could split the right - at a time when the far-right in france is also challenging sarkozy .
marine le pen , vice president of the far right national front , said she was " very happy " about the prospect of villepin running in 2012 , as it could weaken sarkozy .
the head of the international monetary fund , dominique strauss-kahn , is also being touted as a candidate and is widely viewed as a favorite to head the socialist party ticket for 2012 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 20.06.2010 sarkozy rival villepin launches new french political party großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : villepin and sarkozy were in government together under former president jacques chirac former french prime minister dominique de villepin has officially launched a new center-right political party , aimed at unseating president nicolas sarkozy in 2012 . one of nicolas sarkozy 's fiercest critics has set up a new political party in france , aiming to challenge and unseat the current president .
former prime minister dominique de villepin has created a new center-right party called republique solidaire .
villepin aims to capitalize on sarkozy 's current poor poll ratings .
sarkozy 's re-election has until now been regarded as a near-certainty , but a republique solidaire candidacy in the 2012 ballot could split the conservative vote .
launching the party speaking to a crowd of an estimated 3,000 supporters , villepin criticized " an ever-growing gap between words and acts , between what french people go through and what their leaders experience . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former prime minister was cleared of slander charges in january the former diplomat has been one of sarkozy 's strongest critics in the conservative camp .
he was prime minister under president jacques chirac and was known to have a tense relationship with sarkozy , who served as his interior minister .
villepin was a member of sarkozy 's ump party , but broke away after a bitter row . last year , villepin went on trial for allegedly taking part in a smear campaign to ruin sarkozy 's presidential bid , but was cleared of all charges .
splitting the vote polls show villepin would pick up no more than 7 or 8 percent of the vote in 2012 , but his personal approval ratings stand at 49 percent .
sarkozy 's rating has dropped in recent months to around 33 percent .
a presidential candidacy from villepin could split the right - at a time when the far-right in france is also challenging sarkozy .
marine le pen , vice president of the far right national front , said she was " very happy " about the prospect of villepin running in 2012 , as it could weaken sarkozy .
the head of the international monetary fund , dominique strauss-kahn , is also being touted as a candidate and is widely viewed as a favorite to head the socialist party ticket for 2012 .

"
niebel had planned to inspect a german-financed sewage plant in the hamas-controlled area and meet representatives of the united nations relief and works agency for palestine refugees .
" i had hoped that this could have been a clear political signal for an opening and for transparency , " niebel said in a separate interview on public german broadcaster zdf .
" sometimes the israeli government does not make it easy for its friends to explain why it behaves in the way it does . "

islamist group hamas took power in gaza in 2007 , after which israel imposed a blockade on the small but densely populated coastal region .
israel said this week that it was easing a land blockade of the gaza strip after a storm of international criticism following its raid on an aid flotilla bound for the hamas-run palestinian territory killed nine activists .
israel faced intensified international calls to relax or lift its gaza embargo .

" the israeli government is damaging the credibility of its new politics , " gernot erler , deputy head of the social democratic party 's parliamentary group told newspaper waz .
he added that he could n't see how the denial to visit the gaza strip fit with the government 's decision to ease the gaza blockade . " five to twelve " referring to the loosening of the blockade that the israeli government recently announced , niebel said , " if the israeli government expects support for its new gaza strategy , it must first of all ensure more transparency and for a new partnership . "
he said the blockade , which is aimed at preventing hamas members in the gaza strip from obtaining weapons and materials to build rockets which are fired over the border into israel , was not a sign of strength .
rather , he said , it was , " proof of unspoken fear . "
niebel urged the israeli government not to let the clock run out on the remaining opportunity for peace talks .
" it is five to twelve for israel , " he said .
israel defends decision israeli foreign ministry spokesman yigal palmor said the move was part of israel 's long-standing policy on gaza .

"
niebel had planned to inspect a german-financed sewage plant in the hamas-controlled area and meet representatives of the united nations relief and works agency for palestine refugees .
" i had hoped that this could have been a clear political signal for an opening and for transparency , " niebel said in a separate interview on public german broadcaster zdf .
" sometimes the israeli government does not make it easy for its friends to explain why it behaves in the way it does . "

islamist group hamas took power in gaza in 2007 , after which israel imposed a blockade on the small but densely populated coastal region .
israel said this week that it was easing a land blockade of the gaza strip after a storm of international criticism following its raid on an aid flotilla bound for the hamas-run palestinian territory killed nine activists .
israel faced intensified international calls to relax or lift its gaza embargo .
ruprecht polenz , a member of parliament of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party and chairman of the foreign affairs committee told newspaper tagesspiegel there was no " political reason " for israel 's decision . " the israeli government is damaging the credibility of its new politics , " gernot erler , deputy head of the social democratic party 's parliamentary group told newspaper waz .
he added that he could n't see how the denial to visit the gaza strip fit with the government 's decision to ease the gaza blockade . " five to twelve " referring to the loosening of the blockade that the israeli government recently announced , niebel said , " if the israeli government expects support for its new gaza strategy , it must first of all ensure more transparency and for a new partnership . "
he said the blockade , which is aimed at preventing hamas members in the gaza strip from obtaining weapons and materials to build rockets which are fired over the border into israel , was not a sign of strength .
rather , he said , it was , " proof of unspoken fear . "
niebel urged the israeli government not to let the clock run out on the remaining opportunity for peace talks .
" it is five to twelve for israel , " he said .
israel defends decision israeli foreign ministry spokesman yigal palmor said the move was part of israel 's long-standing policy on gaza .
" we do not allow senior politicians into gaza because hamas will manipulate such visits to gain legitimacy , " said palmor on sunday , niebel met with palestinian president mahmud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad and attended a ceremony marking the start of construction on a water purification plant in nablus in the west bank .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the heat is on : climate change and the media environmental journalists face political , physical threats worldwide global media forum tackles ' greatest challenge of the 21st century ' global media forum ends by urging people to learn to live with less a million trees and counting - german boy activist fights climate change media -pipe- 20.06.2010 journalists should not forget climate change , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : himalayan glaciers are melting slower than originally thought , but now media interest may be drying up a british study shows journalists are overlooking the issue of global warming in favor of more sensational stories , an issue that will be discussed at this year 's deutsche welle global media forum . it 's been a difficult few months for the intergovernmental panel on climate change , one of the foremost bodies charged with evaluating the risk climate change .
since the unearthing of an embarrassing error in the most recent ipcc report - the statement that the himalayan glaciers might be gone by 2035 - the hunt for further ipcc blunders has been on , drawing in scientists , bloggers and journalists from all over the world .
yet some experts argue that , the occasional scandal aside , climate change is a subject that receives relatively little media attention .
three years ago , dortmund university professor of journalism holger wormer described climate change as a " shooting star " topic for the media .
at the time , he and others in the scientific and journalistic communities had big ideas about the role the media could play in the struggle against global warming .
falling by the wayside bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental disasters could be drawing media attention away from climate change today , according to wormer , climate change is a topic that has fallen from editorial grace .
" we now have a lot of other things on our agenda , things that are developing and that have more impact than they did three years ago , for example the financial crisis , " he said .
" these things have pushed reporting on climate change into the background . "
wormer said that with other , more pressing environmental stories on the table - the gulf of mexico oil spill , or , in germany , recurring discussions over nuclear energy - the " slow and steady " threat of climate change has been pushed to the side and is now a topic that appears more often in the context of wider environmental or political coverage .
" i think we started a bit too late with serious reporting on the topic .
the reporting increased significantly only when there was more interest in climate change in the political agenda , " he said .
wormer 's concern appears to be backed up by the numbers .
last year , researchers from the university of liverpool in the uk released the results of an exhaustive study of climate change coverage in british newspapers .
they found that between 2000 and 2006 , the number of articles addressing climate change was modest : coverage peaked at around 100 articles per month .
" just to give you a comparison , the number of stories on health or crime were at about 400 to 500 stories per month the whole way through the period , " said neil gavin , a senior lecturer in politics at the university of liverpool and lead researcher of the study .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stories on emissions trading schemes are relegated to the business pages big topics still ' niche ' gavin , who has written and researched extensively on the relationship between climate change and the media , said even fewer journalists were attempting to tackle climate change-related topics like emissions trading schemes -lrb- etss -rrb- , the market-based approach to controlling pollution that provides big emitters with economic incentives to reduce polluting emissions , or peak oil , the point at which global petroleum discovery will peak , after which production will go into permanent decline .
when these terms do appear in newspapers , he said , they tend to be treated as niche topics , appearing in the business pages rather than in the news section of papers .
this has implications for accountability , he said .
in the european union , a major ets has been in place since 2005 and has already entered into its second phase , but gavin said his research recorded only around 20 mentions of the scheme between 2000 and 2006 .
" where is the accountability of the european union ?
what kind of corners -lsb- could be -rsb- being cut in phase two and three ? "
what 's more , the liverpool researchers found that in some newspapers , a significant amount of what little coverage appeared was focused on skeptical reporting .
" in the top-selling newspapers like the telegraph , daily mail , the sun and their sunday sister papers , 25 percent of the coverage ran along climate skeptic lines , " said gavin .
wormer said that despite recent revelations of mistakes in the ipcc reports , there is n't necessarily any reason for journalists to give more attention to climate skepticism .
" we should also be aware of the huge amount of pressure , the lobbying and the pr that goes into trying to -lsb- create -rsb- doubts over the science , " he said , citing the similar levels of pressure and skepticism in the last century over whether cigarettes posed a health hazard .
' keep it simple ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hedegaard says journalists can help by sticking to the facts connie hedegaard , the eu commissioner for climate action and the former danish minister for climate and energy , said the role journalists can play in helping to tackle climate change is a simple one .
" i think the media could help a lot by simply communicating the facts , " she said .
" and take care that when you have one or two errors in a huge report done by thousands of scientists not to communicate the message as if one or two errors would change the whole finding of the -lsb- report -rsb- .
i think it 's very important here to get the proportions right . "
hedegaard , herself a former television journalist , said while it would be wrong for the media to ignore climate skepticism altogether , it is also wrong to uncritically accept skepticism in the name of balance .
" the easiest thing in the world is to invite a guest who says that the planet is flat , and somebody who says , no , it 's round .
and the reporter 's job there is not just to hold the microphone and say , ' ok , a says it 's flat , the other one says it 's round , " ' she said .
" it is sometimes also -lsb- necessary -rsb- to be equipped to say something is factual , something is right and something is wrong ; " she said . " that is not being biased ; that 's just to help the listeners , the viewers and the readers to orient themselves in a jungle of information . "

anelka was booted after cursing out coach raymond domenech , and it was domenech who was left to meet the press to explain . the wheels are continuing to fall off in the french world cup camp in south africa .
on sunday , the squad pulled out from its scheduled training session in protest against striker nicolas anelka 's expulsion .
a day earlier , the french football federation -lrb- fff -rrb- announced that anelka had been booted off the team for comments he made to the team 's coach during france 's 2-0 loss to mexico . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there wo n't be any more action for anelka in this world cup the french players were unanimously against the fff 's decision to remove anelka , claiming that the dispute between the player and coach raymond domenech had been made in the privacy of the locker room and should have never reached the press .
" we regret the incident at half-time of the france versus mexico match , " the teams ' players said in a statement , " but we regret even more the divulging of an event which was only the squad 's business and was part and parcel of the life of a top-level team . " the statement was read out loud to the media by coach raymond domenech and followed a near-scuffle on the training pitch between team captain patrice evra and robert duverne , a fitness coach on the team .
duverne had reportedly insisted that the players go ahead with the practice . the players ' decision to call off their practice also caused the team 's director , jean-louis valentin , to resign in disgust . picked up by the press according to media reports , anelka crudely insulted domenech coming off the pitch at halftime in france 's group game against mexico .
domenech had reportedly criticized anelka 's performance on pitch .

fabiano 's two goals propelled brazil to the win and into the knock-out round of the world cup . brazil 's 3-1 victory over the ivory coast in johannesburg on sunday night showed glimmers of why brazil is a perennial world cup favorite .
the brazilians appear to be finding their stride in the tournament , and in this game , luis fabiano was in the lead .
he scored two goals and helped propel brazil into the next round . fabiano 's first goal was orchestrated by passes from robinho and kaka .
fabiano found himself free to the side of the goal with only the keeper to beat .
boubacar barry was in good position for the ivory coast , but fabiano simply blasted the shot over the keeper 's head into the top of the net to score . fives minutes into the second half , fabiano displayed some brazilian flair for his second goal of the match .
he beat two defenders with light taps on the ball to send it over their heads , then controlled the pass to himself with his chest and fired away to score . however , television replays showed fabiano 's upper arm appeared to help him get the ball under control before he shot .
the ball also glanced off his hand at the start of the play . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elano and fabiano both have 2 goals in this world cup brazil rounded out its victory seven minutes later , as kaka sent a pass from near the end line back to midfielder elano , who surprised a sleeping ivorian defence and scored the easy goal . the ivory coast 's striker didier drogba pulled one back for his side in the 79th minute .
following a long , solo run , gervinho was caught by the brazilian defence and forced to pass away to yaya toure .
toure sent a perfect pass into the middle where drogba used a long header to put away the consolation goal . the final ten minutes of the game were quite physical , with several fouls being given and some heated words exchanged between players .
kaka was booked in the 88th minute for his second foul of the game and sent off the pitch .
the midfielder will miss brazil 's next match against portugal , which is merely a formality as the win against the ivory coast secures brazil 's place in the next round .
group f remains close for a few days at least , group f of the world cup was a nice , tidy four-way tie .
in the group 's first two matches , all four teams drew 1-1 with each other , giving them all one point and a goal differential of zero .
that deadlock was bound to be broken - paraguay took the initiative , beating slovakia 2-0 on sunday afternoon - but the group is still very tight as defending champs italy only managed a draw against group-underdogs new zealand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smeltz and the kiwis were more than happy with a draw against italy the all whites surprised italy by taking the lead in the 7th minute .
italian captain fabio cannavaro failed to clear a free kick , which left new zealand 's shane smeltz free to tap in the goal . the kiwi 's dreams of an upset win over the world cup title holders did n't last long , though .
italy was awarded a penalty kick in the 29th minute when daniele de rossi fell in a tussle with new zealand 's tommy smith in the box .
the ref showed smith a yellow card and pointed to the penalty spot .
vincenzo iaquinta took the kick to pull italy even with new zealand . although italy had the advantage for more or less the rest of the game , they failed to create scoring opportunities and are now level with new zealand on points in group f. paraguay takes the lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paraguay is in a good position at the top of the group by only managing a draw against new zealand , italy faces some pressure heading into their last group match against slovakia .
a win would secure a spot in the round of 16 , but a draw could leave them exposed to being bounced should new zealand continue to surprise and come up with a win or a high-scoring draw against paraguay . the south american team , however , looked strong in their 2-0 win against slovakia that sent them to the top of the group . enrique vera opened the scoring for paraguay in the 27th minute , taking a precise pass from lucas barrios and slipping a shot through two defenders and into the goal .
toward the end of the game , paraguay added its second goal for good measure as cristian riveros cleaned up a loose ball on the edge of the box and booted it past slovakian keeper jan mucha .
slovakia only had one shot on goal the entire game , and their best chance to score came in the 37th minute when defender kornel salata headed a corner over the goal .

former prime minister dominique de villepin has created a new center-right party called republique solidaire .
villepin aims to capitalize on sarkozy 's current poor poll ratings .
sarkozy 's re-election has until now been regarded as a near-certainty , but a republique solidaire candidacy in the 2012 ballot could split the conservative vote .
launching the party speaking to a crowd of an estimated 3,000 supporters , villepin criticized " an ever-growing gap between words and acts , between what french people go through and what their leaders experience . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former prime minister was cleared of slander charges in january the former diplomat has been one of sarkozy 's strongest critics in the conservative camp .
he was prime minister under president jacques chirac and was known to have a tense relationship with sarkozy , who served as his interior minister .
villepin was a member of sarkozy 's ump party , but broke away after a bitter row . last year , villepin went on trial for allegedly taking part in a smear campaign to ruin sarkozy 's presidential bid , but was cleared of all charges .
splitting the vote polls show villepin would pick up no more than 7 or 8 percent of the vote in 2012 , but his personal approval ratings stand at 49 percent .
sarkozy 's rating has dropped in recent months to around 33 percent .
a presidential candidacy from villepin could split the right - at a time when the far-right in france is also challenging sarkozy .
marine le pen , vice president of the far right national front , said she was " very happy " about the prospect of villepin running in 2012 , as it could weaken sarkozy .
the head of the international monetary fund , dominique strauss-kahn , is also being touted as a candidate and is widely viewed as a favorite to head the socialist party ticket for 2012 .

villepin aims to capitalize on sarkozy 's current poor poll ratings .
sarkozy 's re-election has until now been regarded as a near-certainty , but a republique solidaire candidacy in the 2012 ballot could split the conservative vote .
launching the party speaking to a crowd of an estimated 3,000 supporters , villepin criticized " an ever-growing gap between words and acts , between what french people go through and what their leaders experience . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former prime minister was cleared of slander charges in january the former diplomat has been one of sarkozy 's strongest critics in the conservative camp .
he was prime minister under president jacques chirac and was known to have a tense relationship with sarkozy , who served as his interior minister .
villepin was a member of sarkozy 's ump party , but broke away after a bitter row . last year , villepin went on trial for allegedly taking part in a smear campaign to ruin sarkozy 's presidential bid , but was cleared of all charges .
splitting the vote polls show villepin would pick up no more than 7 or 8 percent of the vote in 2012 , but his personal approval ratings stand at 49 percent .
sarkozy 's rating has dropped in recent months to around 33 percent .
a presidential candidacy from villepin could split the right - at a time when the far-right in france is also challenging sarkozy .
marine le pen , vice president of the far right national front , said she was " very happy " about the prospect of villepin running in 2012 , as it could weaken sarkozy .
the head of the international monetary fund , dominique strauss-kahn , is also being touted as a candidate and is widely viewed as a favorite to head the socialist party ticket for 2012 .

fabiano 's two goals propelled brazil to the win and into the knock-out round of the world cup . brazil 's 3-1 victory over the ivory coast in johannesburg on sunday night showed glimmers of why brazil is a perennial world cup favorite .
the brazilians appear to be finding their stride in the tournament , and in this game , luis fabiano was in the lead .
he scored two goals and helped propel brazil into the next round . fabiano 's first goal was orchestrated by passes from robinho and kaka .
fabiano found himself free to the side of the goal with only the keeper to beat .
boubacar barry was in good position for the ivory coast , but fabiano simply blasted the shot over the keeper 's head into the top of the net to score . fives minutes into the second half , fabiano displayed some brazilian flair for his second goal of the match .
he beat two defenders with light taps on the ball to send it over their heads , then controlled the pass to himself with his chest and fired away to score . however , television replays showed fabiano 's upper arm appeared to help him get the ball under control before he shot .
the ball also glanced off his hand at the start of the play . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elano and fabiano both have 2 goals in this world cup brazil rounded out its victory seven minutes later , as kaka sent a pass from near the end line back to midfielder elano , who surprised a sleeping ivorian defence and scored the easy goal . the ivory coast 's striker didier drogba pulled one back for his side in the 79th minute .
following a long , solo run , gervinho was caught by the brazilian defence and forced to pass away to yaya toure .
toure sent a perfect pass into the middle where drogba used a long header to put away the consolation goal . the final ten minutes of the game were quite physical , with several fouls being given and some heated words exchanged between players .
kaka was booked in the 88th minute for his second foul of the game and sent off the pitch .
the midfielder will miss brazil 's next match against portugal , which is merely a formality as the win against the ivory coast secures brazil 's place in the next round .
group f remains close for a few days at least , group f of the world cup was a nice , tidy four-way tie .
in the group 's first two matches , all four teams drew 1-1 with each other , giving them all one point and a goal differential of zero .
that deadlock was bound to be broken - paraguay took the initiative , beating slovakia 2-0 on sunday afternoon - but the group is still very tight as defending champs italy only managed a draw against group-underdogs new zealand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smeltz and the kiwis were more than happy with a draw against italy the all whites surprised italy by taking the lead in the 7th minute .
italian captain fabio cannavaro failed to clear a free kick , which left new zealand 's shane smeltz free to tap in the goal . the kiwi 's dreams of an upset win over the world cup title holders did n't last long , though .
italy was awarded a penalty kick in the 29th minute when daniele de rossi fell in a tussle with new zealand 's tommy smith in the box .
the ref showed smith a yellow card and pointed to the penalty spot .
vincenzo iaquinta took the kick to pull italy even with new zealand . although italy had the advantage for more or less the rest of the game , they failed to create scoring opportunities and are now level with new zealand on points in group f. paraguay takes the lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paraguay is in a good position at the top of the group by only managing a draw against new zealand , italy faces some pressure heading into their last group match against slovakia .
a win would secure a spot in the round of 16 , but a draw could leave them exposed to being bounced should new zealand continue to surprise and come up with a win or a high-scoring draw against paraguay . the south american team , however , looked strong in their 2-0 win against slovakia that sent them to the top of the group . enrique vera opened the scoring for paraguay in the 27th minute , taking a precise pass from lucas barrios and slipping a shot through two defenders and into the goal .
toward the end of the game , paraguay added its second goal for good measure as cristian riveros cleaned up a loose ball on the edge of the box and booted it past slovakian keeper jan mucha .
slovakia only had one shot on goal the entire game , and their best chance to score came in the 37th minute when defender kornel salata headed a corner over the goal .

the ball also glanced off his hand at the start of the play . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elano and fabiano both have 2 goals in this world cup brazil rounded out its victory seven minutes later , as kaka sent a pass from near the end line back to midfielder elano , who surprised a sleeping ivorian defence and scored the easy goal . the ivory coast 's striker didier drogba pulled one back for his side in the 79th minute .
following a long , solo run , gervinho was caught by the brazilian defence and forced to pass away to yaya toure .
toure sent a perfect pass into the middle where drogba used a long header to put away the consolation goal . the final ten minutes of the game were quite physical , with several fouls being given and some heated words exchanged between players .
kaka was booked in the 88th minute for his second foul of the game and sent off the pitch .
the midfielder will miss brazil 's next match against portugal , which is merely a formality as the win against the ivory coast secures brazil 's place in the next round .
group f remains close for a few days at least , group f of the world cup was a nice , tidy four-way tie .
in the group 's first two matches , all four teams drew 1-1 with each other , giving them all one point and a goal differential of zero .
that deadlock was bound to be broken - paraguay took the initiative , beating slovakia 2-0 on sunday afternoon - but the group is still very tight as defending champs italy only managed a draw against group-underdogs new zealand .

italy was awarded a penalty kick in the 29th minute when daniele de rossi fell in a tussle with new zealand 's tommy smith in the box .
the ref showed smith a yellow card and pointed to the penalty spot .

toward the end of the game , paraguay added its second goal for good measure as cristian riveros cleaned up a loose ball on the edge of the box and booted it past slovakian keeper jan mucha .
slovakia only had one shot on goal the entire game , and their best chance to score came in the 37th minute when defender kornel salata headed a corner over the goal .

the ball also glanced off his hand at the start of the play . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elano and fabiano both have 2 goals in this world cup brazil rounded out its victory seven minutes later , as kaka sent a pass from near the end line back to midfielder elano , who surprised a sleeping ivorian defence and scored the easy goal . the ivory coast 's striker didier drogba pulled one back for his side in the 79th minute .
following a long , solo run , gervinho was caught by the brazilian defence and forced to pass away to yaya toure .
toure sent a perfect pass into the middle where drogba used a long header to put away the consolation goal . the final ten minutes of the game were quite physical , with several fouls being given and some heated words exchanged between players .
kaka was booked in the 88th minute for his second foul of the game and sent off the pitch .
the midfielder will miss brazil 's next match against portugal , which is merely a formality as the win against the ivory coast secures brazil 's place in the next round .
group f remains close for a few days at least , group f of the world cup was a nice , tidy four-way tie .
in the group 's first two matches , all four teams drew 1-1 with each other , giving them all one point and a goal differential of zero .
that deadlock was bound to be broken - paraguay took the initiative , beating slovakia 2-0 on sunday afternoon - but the group is still very tight as defending champs italy only managed a draw against group-underdogs new zealand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smeltz and the kiwis were more than happy with a draw against italy the all whites surprised italy by taking the lead in the 7th minute .
italian captain fabio cannavaro failed to clear a free kick , which left new zealand 's shane smeltz free to tap in the goal . the kiwi 's dreams of an upset win over the world cup title holders did n't last long , though .
italy was awarded a penalty kick in the 29th minute when daniele de rossi fell in a tussle with new zealand 's tommy smith in the box .
the ref showed smith a yellow card and pointed to the penalty spot .
vincenzo iaquinta took the kick to pull italy even with new zealand . although italy had the advantage for more or less the rest of the game , they failed to create scoring opportunities and are now level with new zealand on points in group f. paraguay takes the lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paraguay is in a good position at the top of the group by only managing a draw against new zealand , italy faces some pressure heading into their last group match against slovakia .
a win would secure a spot in the round of 16 , but a draw could leave them exposed to being bounced should new zealand continue to surprise and come up with a win or a high-scoring draw against paraguay . the south american team , however , looked strong in their 2-0 win against slovakia that sent them to the top of the group . enrique vera opened the scoring for paraguay in the 27th minute , taking a precise pass from lucas barrios and slipping a shot through two defenders and into the goal .
toward the end of the game , paraguay added its second goal for good measure as cristian riveros cleaned up a loose ball on the edge of the box and booted it past slovakian keeper jan mucha .
slovakia only had one shot on goal the entire game , and their best chance to score came in the 37th minute when defender kornel salata headed a corner over the goal .

former prime minister dominique de villepin has created a new center-right party called republique solidaire .
villepin aims to capitalize on sarkozy 's current poor poll ratings .
sarkozy 's re-election has until now been regarded as a near-certainty , but a republique solidaire candidacy in the 2012 ballot could split the conservative vote .
launching the party speaking to a crowd of an estimated 3,000 supporters , villepin criticized " an ever-growing gap between words and acts , between what french people go through and what their leaders experience . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former prime minister was cleared of slander charges in january the former diplomat has been one of sarkozy 's strongest critics in the conservative camp .
he was prime minister under president jacques chirac and was known to have a tense relationship with sarkozy , who served as his interior minister .
villepin was a member of sarkozy 's ump party , but broke away after a bitter row . last year , villepin went on trial for allegedly taking part in a smear campaign to ruin sarkozy 's presidential bid , but was cleared of all charges .
splitting the vote polls show villepin would pick up no more than 7 or 8 percent of the vote in 2012 , but his personal approval ratings stand at 49 percent .
sarkozy 's rating has dropped in recent months to around 33 percent .
a presidential candidacy from villepin could split the right - at a time when the far-right in france is also challenging sarkozy .
marine le pen , vice president of the far right national front , said she was " very happy " about the prospect of villepin running in 2012 , as it could weaken sarkozy .
the head of the international monetary fund , dominique strauss-kahn , is also being touted as a candidate and is widely viewed as a favorite to head the socialist party ticket for 2012 .

fabiano 's two goals propelled brazil to the win and into the knock-out round of the world cup . brazil 's 3-1 victory over the ivory coast in johannesburg on sunday night showed glimmers of why brazil is a perennial world cup favorite .
the brazilians appear to be finding their stride in the tournament , and in this game , luis fabiano was in the lead .
he scored two goals and helped propel brazil into the next round . fabiano 's first goal was orchestrated by passes from robinho and kaka .

anelka was booted after cursing out coach raymond domenech , and it was domenech who was left to meet the press to explain . the wheels are continuing to fall off in the french world cup camp in south africa .
on sunday , the squad pulled out from its scheduled training session in protest against striker nicolas anelka 's expulsion .
a day earlier , the french football federation -lrb- fff -rrb- announced that anelka had been booted off the team for comments he made to the team 's coach during france 's 2-0 loss to mexico . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there wo n't be any more action for anelka in this world cup the french players were unanimously against the fff 's decision to remove anelka , claiming that the dispute between the player and coach raymond domenech had been made in the privacy of the locker room and should have never reached the press .
" we regret the incident at half-time of the france versus mexico match , " the teams ' players said in a statement , " but we regret even more the divulging of an event which was only the squad 's business and was part and parcel of the life of a top-level team . " the statement was read out loud to the media by coach raymond domenech and followed a near-scuffle on the training pitch between team captain patrice evra and robert duverne , a fitness coach on the team .
duverne had reportedly insisted that the players go ahead with the practice . the players ' decision to call off their practice also caused the team 's director , jean-louis valentin , to resign in disgust . picked up by the press according to media reports , anelka crudely insulted domenech coming off the pitch at halftime in france 's group game against mexico .
domenech had reportedly criticized anelka 's performance on pitch .
anelka was subbed for the second half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anelka was not quoted warmly by l 'equipe french sports newspaper l 'equipe printed anelka 's alleged comments on the front page of saturday 's edition .
the chelsea forward denied cursing at domenech as suggested by l 'equipe but did admit to a ' heated conversation ' with his coach .
on saturday , anelka was asked by fff president jean-pierre escalettes to issue a public apology for his remarks .
when anelka refused , the decision was made to send him home .
support from teammates french captain patrice evra had sympathy for his departed teammate , saying anelka was n't the problem on the french squad .
" the problem is the traitor among us who told the press what was said , " eyra said .
" there 's somebody in our group that wants to harm the france team . "
bayern munich star franck ribery appeared in tears live on french television as he discussed anelka 's expulsion and problems with the french team , appealing to the french people to forgive the team for their poor showing so far in the world cup .
france go into their final group game against south africa with their backs up against the wall .
they opened the tournament with a lackluster 0-0 draw against uruguay , and after thursday 's loss to mexico , have only a glimmer of hope of advancing to the knock-out stage .
france must win its game against south africa on tuesday and hope that the game between uruguay and mexico does n't end in a draw .
even then , france would only advance if it had a superior goal difference to that game 's loser .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the heat is on : climate change and the media environmental journalists face political , physical threats worldwide global media forum tackles ' greatest challenge of the 21st century ' global media forum ends by urging people to learn to live with less a million trees and counting - german boy activist fights climate change media -pipe- 20.06.2010 journalists should not forget climate change , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : himalayan glaciers are melting slower than originally thought , but now media interest may be drying up a british study shows journalists are overlooking the issue of global warming in favor of more sensational stories , an issue that will be discussed at this year 's deutsche welle global media forum . it 's been a difficult few months for the intergovernmental panel on climate change , one of the foremost bodies charged with evaluating the risk climate change .
since the unearthing of an embarrassing error in the most recent ipcc report - the statement that the himalayan glaciers might be gone by 2035 - the hunt for further ipcc blunders has been on , drawing in scientists , bloggers and journalists from all over the world .
yet some experts argue that , the occasional scandal aside , climate change is a subject that receives relatively little media attention .
three years ago , dortmund university professor of journalism holger wormer described climate change as a " shooting star " topic for the media .
at the time , he and others in the scientific and journalistic communities had big ideas about the role the media could play in the struggle against global warming .
falling by the wayside bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental disasters could be drawing media attention away from climate change today , according to wormer , climate change is a topic that has fallen from editorial grace .
" we now have a lot of other things on our agenda , things that are developing and that have more impact than they did three years ago , for example the financial crisis , " he said .
" these things have pushed reporting on climate change into the background . "
wormer said that with other , more pressing environmental stories on the table - the gulf of mexico oil spill , or , in germany , recurring discussions over nuclear energy - the " slow and steady " threat of climate change has been pushed to the side and is now a topic that appears more often in the context of wider environmental or political coverage .
" i think we started a bit too late with serious reporting on the topic .
the reporting increased significantly only when there was more interest in climate change in the political agenda , " he said .
wormer 's concern appears to be backed up by the numbers .
last year , researchers from the university of liverpool in the uk released the results of an exhaustive study of climate change coverage in british newspapers .
they found that between 2000 and 2006 , the number of articles addressing climate change was modest : coverage peaked at around 100 articles per month .
" just to give you a comparison , the number of stories on health or crime were at about 400 to 500 stories per month the whole way through the period , " said neil gavin , a senior lecturer in politics at the university of liverpool and lead researcher of the study .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stories on emissions trading schemes are relegated to the business pages big topics still ' niche ' gavin , who has written and researched extensively on the relationship between climate change and the media , said even fewer journalists were attempting to tackle climate change-related topics like emissions trading schemes -lrb- etss -rrb- , the market-based approach to controlling pollution that provides big emitters with economic incentives to reduce polluting emissions , or peak oil , the point at which global petroleum discovery will peak , after which production will go into permanent decline .
when these terms do appear in newspapers , he said , they tend to be treated as niche topics , appearing in the business pages rather than in the news section of papers .
this has implications for accountability , he said .
in the european union , a major ets has been in place since 2005 and has already entered into its second phase , but gavin said his research recorded only around 20 mentions of the scheme between 2000 and 2006 .
" where is the accountability of the european union ?
what kind of corners -lsb- could be -rsb- being cut in phase two and three ? "
what 's more , the liverpool researchers found that in some newspapers , a significant amount of what little coverage appeared was focused on skeptical reporting .
" in the top-selling newspapers like the telegraph , daily mail , the sun and their sunday sister papers , 25 percent of the coverage ran along climate skeptic lines , " said gavin .
wormer said that despite recent revelations of mistakes in the ipcc reports , there is n't necessarily any reason for journalists to give more attention to climate skepticism .
" we should also be aware of the huge amount of pressure , the lobbying and the pr that goes into trying to -lsb- create -rsb- doubts over the science , " he said , citing the similar levels of pressure and skepticism in the last century over whether cigarettes posed a health hazard .
' keep it simple ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hedegaard says journalists can help by sticking to the facts connie hedegaard , the eu commissioner for climate action and the former danish minister for climate and energy , said the role journalists can play in helping to tackle climate change is a simple one .
" i think the media could help a lot by simply communicating the facts , " she said .
" and take care that when you have one or two errors in a huge report done by thousands of scientists not to communicate the message as if one or two errors would change the whole finding of the -lsb- report -rsb- .
i think it 's very important here to get the proportions right . "
hedegaard , herself a former television journalist , said while it would be wrong for the media to ignore climate skepticism altogether , it is also wrong to uncritically accept skepticism in the name of balance .
" the easiest thing in the world is to invite a guest who says that the planet is flat , and somebody who says , no , it 's round .
and the reporter 's job there is not just to hold the microphone and say , ' ok , a says it 's flat , the other one says it 's round , " ' she said .
" it is sometimes also -lsb- necessary -rsb- to be equipped to say something is factual , something is right and something is wrong ; " she said . " that is not being biased ; that 's just to help the listeners , the viewers and the readers to orient themselves in a jungle of information . "

since the unearthing of an embarrassing error in the most recent ipcc report - the statement that the himalayan glaciers might be gone by 2035 - the hunt for further ipcc blunders has been on , drawing in scientists , bloggers and journalists from all over the world .
yet some experts argue that , the occasional scandal aside , climate change is a subject that receives relatively little media attention .
three years ago , dortmund university professor of journalism holger wormer described climate change as a " shooting star " topic for the media .
at the time , he and others in the scientific and journalistic communities had big ideas about the role the media could play in the struggle against global warming .
falling by the wayside bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental disasters could be drawing media attention away from climate change today , according to wormer , climate change is a topic that has fallen from editorial grace .
" we now have a lot of other things on our agenda , things that are developing and that have more impact than they did three years ago , for example the financial crisis , " he said .
" these things have pushed reporting on climate change into the background . "
wormer said that with other , more pressing environmental stories on the table - the gulf of mexico oil spill , or , in germany , recurring discussions over nuclear energy - the " slow and steady " threat of climate change has been pushed to the side and is now a topic that appears more often in the context of wider environmental or political coverage .
" i think we started a bit too late with serious reporting on the topic .
the reporting increased significantly only when there was more interest in climate change in the political agenda , " he said .
wormer 's concern appears to be backed up by the numbers .
last year , researchers from the university of liverpool in the uk released the results of an exhaustive study of climate change coverage in british newspapers .
they found that between 2000 and 2006 , the number of articles addressing climate change was modest : coverage peaked at around 100 articles per month .
" just to give you a comparison , the number of stories on health or crime were at about 400 to 500 stories per month the whole way through the period , " said neil gavin , a senior lecturer in politics at the university of liverpool and lead researcher of the study .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stories on emissions trading schemes are relegated to the business pages big topics still ' niche ' gavin , who has written and researched extensively on the relationship between climate change and the media , said even fewer journalists were attempting to tackle climate change-related topics like emissions trading schemes -lrb- etss -rrb- , the market-based approach to controlling pollution that provides big emitters with economic incentives to reduce polluting emissions , or peak oil , the point at which global petroleum discovery will peak , after which production will go into permanent decline .
when these terms do appear in newspapers , he said , they tend to be treated as niche topics , appearing in the business pages rather than in the news section of papers .
this has implications for accountability , he said .
in the european union , a major ets has been in place since 2005 and has already entered into its second phase , but gavin said his research recorded only around 20 mentions of the scheme between 2000 and 2006 .
" where is the accountability of the european union ?
what kind of corners -lsb- could be -rsb- being cut in phase two and three ? "
what 's more , the liverpool researchers found that in some newspapers , a significant amount of what little coverage appeared was focused on skeptical reporting .
" in the top-selling newspapers like the telegraph , daily mail , the sun and their sunday sister papers , 25 percent of the coverage ran along climate skeptic lines , " said gavin .
wormer said that despite recent revelations of mistakes in the ipcc reports , there is n't necessarily any reason for journalists to give more attention to climate skepticism .
" we should also be aware of the huge amount of pressure , the lobbying and the pr that goes into trying to -lsb- create -rsb- doubts over the science , " he said , citing the similar levels of pressure and skepticism in the last century over whether cigarettes posed a health hazard .
' keep it simple ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hedegaard says journalists can help by sticking to the facts connie hedegaard , the eu commissioner for climate action and the former danish minister for climate and energy , said the role journalists can play in helping to tackle climate change is a simple one .
" i think the media could help a lot by simply communicating the facts , " she said .
" and take care that when you have one or two errors in a huge report done by thousands of scientists not to communicate the message as if one or two errors would change the whole finding of the -lsb- report -rsb- .
i think it 's very important here to get the proportions right . "
hedegaard , herself a former television journalist , said while it would be wrong for the media to ignore climate skepticism altogether , it is also wrong to uncritically accept skepticism in the name of balance .
" the easiest thing in the world is to invite a guest who says that the planet is flat , and somebody who says , no , it 's round .
and the reporter 's job there is not just to hold the microphone and say , ' ok , a says it 's flat , the other one says it 's round , " ' she said .

anelka was booted after cursing out coach raymond domenech , and it was domenech who was left to meet the press to explain . the wheels are continuing to fall off in the french world cup camp in south africa .
on sunday , the squad pulled out from its scheduled training session in protest against striker nicolas anelka 's expulsion .
a day earlier , the french football federation -lrb- fff -rrb- announced that anelka had been booted off the team for comments he made to the team 's coach during france 's 2-0 loss to mexico . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there wo n't be any more action for anelka in this world cup the french players were unanimously against the fff 's decision to remove anelka , claiming that the dispute between the player and coach raymond domenech had been made in the privacy of the locker room and should have never reached the press .
" we regret the incident at half-time of the france versus mexico match , " the teams ' players said in a statement , " but we regret even more the divulging of an event which was only the squad 's business and was part and parcel of the life of a top-level team . " the statement was read out loud to the media by coach raymond domenech and followed a near-scuffle on the training pitch between team captain patrice evra and robert duverne , a fitness coach on the team .
duverne had reportedly insisted that the players go ahead with the practice . the players ' decision to call off their practice also caused the team 's director , jean-louis valentin , to resign in disgust . picked up by the press according to media reports , anelka crudely insulted domenech coming off the pitch at halftime in france 's group game against mexico .
domenech had reportedly criticized anelka 's performance on pitch .
anelka was subbed for the second half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anelka was not quoted warmly by l 'equipe french sports newspaper l 'equipe printed anelka 's alleged comments on the front page of saturday 's edition .
the chelsea forward denied cursing at domenech as suggested by l 'equipe but did admit to a ' heated conversation ' with his coach .
on saturday , anelka was asked by fff president jean-pierre escalettes to issue a public apology for his remarks .
when anelka refused , the decision was made to send him home .
support from teammates french captain patrice evra had sympathy for his departed teammate , saying anelka was n't the problem on the french squad .
" the problem is the traitor among us who told the press what was said , " eyra said .
" there 's somebody in our group that wants to harm the france team . "
bayern munich star franck ribery appeared in tears live on french television as he discussed anelka 's expulsion and problems with the french team , appealing to the french people to forgive the team for their poor showing so far in the world cup .
france go into their final group game against south africa with their backs up against the wall .
they opened the tournament with a lackluster 0-0 draw against uruguay , and after thursday 's loss to mexico , have only a glimmer of hope of advancing to the knock-out stage .
france must win its game against south africa on tuesday and hope that the game between uruguay and mexico does n't end in a draw .
even then , france would only advance if it had a superior goal difference to that game 's loser .

"
niebel had planned to inspect a german-financed sewage plant in the hamas-controlled area and meet representatives of the united nations relief and works agency for palestine refugees .
" i had hoped that this could have been a clear political signal for an opening and for transparency , " niebel said in a separate interview on public german broadcaster zdf .
" sometimes the israeli government does not make it easy for its friends to explain why it behaves in the way it does . "

islamist group hamas took power in gaza in 2007 , after which israel imposed a blockade on the small but densely populated coastal region .
israel said this week that it was easing a land blockade of the gaza strip after a storm of international criticism following its raid on an aid flotilla bound for the hamas-run palestinian territory killed nine activists .
israel faced intensified international calls to relax or lift its gaza embargo .
ruprecht polenz , a member of parliament of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party and chairman of the foreign affairs committee told newspaper tagesspiegel there was no " political reason " for israel 's decision . " the israeli government is damaging the credibility of its new politics , " gernot erler , deputy head of the social democratic party 's parliamentary group told newspaper waz .
he added that he could n't see how the denial to visit the gaza strip fit with the government 's decision to ease the gaza blockade . " five to twelve " referring to the loosening of the blockade that the israeli government recently announced , niebel said , " if the israeli government expects support for its new gaza strategy , it must first of all ensure more transparency and for a new partnership . "
he said the blockade , which is aimed at preventing hamas members in the gaza strip from obtaining weapons and materials to build rockets which are fired over the border into israel , was not a sign of strength .
rather , he said , it was , " proof of unspoken fear . "
niebel urged the israeli government not to let the clock run out on the remaining opportunity for peace talks .
" it is five to twelve for israel , " he said .
israel defends decision israeli foreign ministry spokesman yigal palmor said the move was part of israel 's long-standing policy on gaza .

"
niebel had planned to inspect a german-financed sewage plant in the hamas-controlled area and meet representatives of the united nations relief and works agency for palestine refugees .
" i had hoped that this could have been a clear political signal for an opening and for transparency , " niebel said in a separate interview on public german broadcaster zdf .
" sometimes the israeli government does not make it easy for its friends to explain why it behaves in the way it does . "
german politicians criticize decision german foreign minister guido westerwelle said he regretted israel 's decision , adding that the german government continued to support an end to the israel 's blockade of gaza .

islamist group hamas took power in gaza in 2007 , after which israel imposed a blockade on the small but densely populated coastal region .
israel said this week that it was easing a land blockade of the gaza strip after a storm of international criticism following its raid on an aid flotilla bound for the hamas-run palestinian territory killed nine activists .
israel faced intensified international calls to relax or lift its gaza embargo .

former prime minister dominique de villepin has created a new center-right party called republique solidaire .
villepin aims to capitalize on sarkozy 's current poor poll ratings .
sarkozy 's re-election has until now been regarded as a near-certainty , but a republique solidaire candidacy in the 2012 ballot could split the conservative vote .
launching the party speaking to a crowd of an estimated 3,000 supporters , villepin criticized " an ever-growing gap between words and acts , between what french people go through and what their leaders experience . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former prime minister was cleared of slander charges in january the former diplomat has been one of sarkozy 's strongest critics in the conservative camp .
he was prime minister under president jacques chirac and was known to have a tense relationship with sarkozy , who served as his interior minister .
villepin was a member of sarkozy 's ump party , but broke away after a bitter row . last year , villepin went on trial for allegedly taking part in a smear campaign to ruin sarkozy 's presidential bid , but was cleared of all charges .
splitting the vote polls show villepin would pick up no more than 7 or 8 percent of the vote in 2012 , but his personal approval ratings stand at 49 percent .
sarkozy 's rating has dropped in recent months to around 33 percent .
a presidential candidacy from villepin could split the right - at a time when the far-right in france is also challenging sarkozy .
marine le pen , vice president of the far right national front , said she was " very happy " about the prospect of villepin running in 2012 , as it could weaken sarkozy .
the head of the international monetary fund , dominique strauss-kahn , is also being touted as a candidate and is widely viewed as a favorite to head the socialist party ticket for 2012 .

since the unearthing of an embarrassing error in the most recent ipcc report - the statement that the himalayan glaciers might be gone by 2035 - the hunt for further ipcc blunders has been on , drawing in scientists , bloggers and journalists from all over the world .
yet some experts argue that , the occasional scandal aside , climate change is a subject that receives relatively little media attention .
three years ago , dortmund university professor of journalism holger wormer described climate change as a " shooting star " topic for the media .
at the time , he and others in the scientific and journalistic communities had big ideas about the role the media could play in the struggle against global warming .
falling by the wayside bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental disasters could be drawing media attention away from climate change today , according to wormer , climate change is a topic that has fallen from editorial grace .
" we now have a lot of other things on our agenda , things that are developing and that have more impact than they did three years ago , for example the financial crisis , " he said .
" these things have pushed reporting on climate change into the background . "
wormer said that with other , more pressing environmental stories on the table - the gulf of mexico oil spill , or , in germany , recurring discussions over nuclear energy - the " slow and steady " threat of climate change has been pushed to the side and is now a topic that appears more often in the context of wider environmental or political coverage .
" i think we started a bit too late with serious reporting on the topic .
the reporting increased significantly only when there was more interest in climate change in the political agenda , " he said .
wormer 's concern appears to be backed up by the numbers .
last year , researchers from the university of liverpool in the uk released the results of an exhaustive study of climate change coverage in british newspapers .
they found that between 2000 and 2006 , the number of articles addressing climate change was modest : coverage peaked at around 100 articles per month .
" just to give you a comparison , the number of stories on health or crime were at about 400 to 500 stories per month the whole way through the period , " said neil gavin , a senior lecturer in politics at the university of liverpool and lead researcher of the study .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stories on emissions trading schemes are relegated to the business pages big topics still ' niche ' gavin , who has written and researched extensively on the relationship between climate change and the media , said even fewer journalists were attempting to tackle climate change-related topics like emissions trading schemes -lrb- etss -rrb- , the market-based approach to controlling pollution that provides big emitters with economic incentives to reduce polluting emissions , or peak oil , the point at which global petroleum discovery will peak , after which production will go into permanent decline .
when these terms do appear in newspapers , he said , they tend to be treated as niche topics , appearing in the business pages rather than in the news section of papers .
this has implications for accountability , he said .
in the european union , a major ets has been in place since 2005 and has already entered into its second phase , but gavin said his research recorded only around 20 mentions of the scheme between 2000 and 2006 .
" where is the accountability of the european union ?
what kind of corners -lsb- could be -rsb- being cut in phase two and three ? "
what 's more , the liverpool researchers found that in some newspapers , a significant amount of what little coverage appeared was focused on skeptical reporting .
" in the top-selling newspapers like the telegraph , daily mail , the sun and their sunday sister papers , 25 percent of the coverage ran along climate skeptic lines , " said gavin .
wormer said that despite recent revelations of mistakes in the ipcc reports , there is n't necessarily any reason for journalists to give more attention to climate skepticism .
" we should also be aware of the huge amount of pressure , the lobbying and the pr that goes into trying to -lsb- create -rsb- doubts over the science , " he said , citing the similar levels of pressure and skepticism in the last century over whether cigarettes posed a health hazard .
' keep it simple ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hedegaard says journalists can help by sticking to the facts connie hedegaard , the eu commissioner for climate action and the former danish minister for climate and energy , said the role journalists can play in helping to tackle climate change is a simple one .
" i think the media could help a lot by simply communicating the facts , " she said .
" and take care that when you have one or two errors in a huge report done by thousands of scientists not to communicate the message as if one or two errors would change the whole finding of the -lsb- report -rsb- .
i think it 's very important here to get the proportions right . "
hedegaard , herself a former television journalist , said while it would be wrong for the media to ignore climate skepticism altogether , it is also wrong to uncritically accept skepticism in the name of balance .
" the easiest thing in the world is to invite a guest who says that the planet is flat , and somebody who says , no , it 's round .
and the reporter 's job there is not just to hold the microphone and say , ' ok , a says it 's flat , the other one says it 's round , " ' she said .
" it is sometimes also -lsb- necessary -rsb- to be equipped to say something is factual , something is right and something is wrong ; " she said . " that is not being biased ; that 's just to help the listeners , the viewers and the readers to orient themselves in a jungle of information . "

anelka was booted after cursing out coach raymond domenech , and it was domenech who was left to meet the press to explain . the wheels are continuing to fall off in the french world cup camp in south africa .
on sunday , the squad pulled out from its scheduled training session in protest against striker nicolas anelka 's expulsion .
a day earlier , the french football federation -lrb- fff -rrb- announced that anelka had been booted off the team for comments he made to the team 's coach during france 's 2-0 loss to mexico . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there wo n't be any more action for anelka in this world cup the french players were unanimously against the fff 's decision to remove anelka , claiming that the dispute between the player and coach raymond domenech had been made in the privacy of the locker room and should have never reached the press .
" we regret the incident at half-time of the france versus mexico match , " the teams ' players said in a statement , " but we regret even more the divulging of an event which was only the squad 's business and was part and parcel of the life of a top-level team . " the statement was read out loud to the media by coach raymond domenech and followed a near-scuffle on the training pitch between team captain patrice evra and robert duverne , a fitness coach on the team .
duverne had reportedly insisted that the players go ahead with the practice . the players ' decision to call off their practice also caused the team 's director , jean-louis valentin , to resign in disgust . picked up by the press according to media reports , anelka crudely insulted domenech coming off the pitch at halftime in france 's group game against mexico .
domenech had reportedly criticized anelka 's performance on pitch .
anelka was subbed for the second half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anelka was not quoted warmly by l 'equipe french sports newspaper l 'equipe printed anelka 's alleged comments on the front page of saturday 's edition .
the chelsea forward denied cursing at domenech as suggested by l 'equipe but did admit to a ' heated conversation ' with his coach .
on saturday , anelka was asked by fff president jean-pierre escalettes to issue a public apology for his remarks .
when anelka refused , the decision was made to send him home .
support from teammates french captain patrice evra had sympathy for his departed teammate , saying anelka was n't the problem on the french squad .
" the problem is the traitor among us who told the press what was said , " eyra said .
" there 's somebody in our group that wants to harm the france team . "
bayern munich star franck ribery appeared in tears live on french television as he discussed anelka 's expulsion and problems with the french team , appealing to the french people to forgive the team for their poor showing so far in the world cup .
france go into their final group game against south africa with their backs up against the wall .
they opened the tournament with a lackluster 0-0 draw against uruguay , and after thursday 's loss to mexico , have only a glimmer of hope of advancing to the knock-out stage .
france must win its game against south africa on tuesday and hope that the game between uruguay and mexico does n't end in a draw .
even then , france would only advance if it had a superior goal difference to that game 's loser .

hedegaard , herself a former television journalist , said while it would be wrong for the media to ignore climate skepticism altogether , it is also wrong to uncritically accept skepticism in the name of balance .

clashes between the two sides have escalated sharply . after a series of air raids targeting by turkish fighter jets on rebel hideouts of the kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- in northern iraq , the group has threatened to launch attack on cities across turkey . " we will take our operations to all turkish cities if the government continues its attacks against us , " pkk spokesman ahmed denis told afp news agency on saturday . " turkey wants to take us towards war , " he said .
" she is not sincere in dealing with the kurdish issue and does n't want to deal with this issue peacefully . " turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has vowed that the threats would have no effect on his country 's determination to fight the pkk . " our fight will continue until the terrorist organization has been annihilated , " said erdogan . according to turkey 's military headquarters , the pkk militants touched off the fighting with an attack on an army unit near the southeastern border with iraq .
the pkk claimed responsibility for the early morning raid on a military post near the city of semdinli , which killed eight turkish soldiers .
twelve rebels were killed and a further 14 injured in the clash . in response , the turkish air force " struck targets identified in the northern region of iraq , " a statement on the military 's website said . two turkish soldiers were also killed after stepping on a landmine in hakkari . at sunday 's funeral services for the turkish soldiers , erdogan said the rebels would never win and that they would " drown in their own blood . " end of ceasefire the turkish military warned on friday that the pkk could intensify its operations over the summer , when warmer weather brings out more pkk guerrillas from the mountains of northern iraq .
several thousand rebels are based there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish kurds demonstrate in support of kurdish rebels in october 2009 the pkk said this month that they had scrapped a year-old unilateral ceasefire and resumed attacks against turkish forces because of military operations against pkk targets in northern iraq .
the ceasefire started as the turkish government worked on plans to boost kurdish rights under a reform package designed to end the conflict .
however , the reform process has faltered .
the rebel group has been branded as terrorists by turkey , the united states and the european union .
they say they want greater rights and autonomy for turkey 's estimated 12 to 15 million kurds .
the pkk also demand an ethnic homeland for kurds in turkey 's southeast .
more than 40,000 people have been killed in the insurgency against the turkish state since the pkk campaign was launched in 1984 .

since the unearthing of an embarrassing error in the most recent ipcc report - the statement that the himalayan glaciers might be gone by 2035 - the hunt for further ipcc blunders has been on , drawing in scientists , bloggers and journalists from all over the world .
yet some experts argue that , the occasional scandal aside , climate change is a subject that receives relatively little media attention .
three years ago , dortmund university professor of journalism holger wormer described climate change as a " shooting star " topic for the media .
at the time , he and others in the scientific and journalistic communities had big ideas about the role the media could play in the struggle against global warming .
falling by the wayside bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental disasters could be drawing media attention away from climate change today , according to wormer , climate change is a topic that has fallen from editorial grace .
" we now have a lot of other things on our agenda , things that are developing and that have more impact than they did three years ago , for example the financial crisis , " he said .
" these things have pushed reporting on climate change into the background . "
wormer said that with other , more pressing environmental stories on the table - the gulf of mexico oil spill , or , in germany , recurring discussions over nuclear energy - the " slow and steady " threat of climate change has been pushed to the side and is now a topic that appears more often in the context of wider environmental or political coverage .
" i think we started a bit too late with serious reporting on the topic .
the reporting increased significantly only when there was more interest in climate change in the political agenda , " he said .
wormer 's concern appears to be backed up by the numbers .
last year , researchers from the university of liverpool in the uk released the results of an exhaustive study of climate change coverage in british newspapers .
they found that between 2000 and 2006 , the number of articles addressing climate change was modest : coverage peaked at around 100 articles per month .
" just to give you a comparison , the number of stories on health or crime were at about 400 to 500 stories per month the whole way through the period , " said neil gavin , a senior lecturer in politics at the university of liverpool and lead researcher of the study .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stories on emissions trading schemes are relegated to the business pages big topics still ' niche ' gavin , who has written and researched extensively on the relationship between climate change and the media , said even fewer journalists were attempting to tackle climate change-related topics like emissions trading schemes -lrb- etss -rrb- , the market-based approach to controlling pollution that provides big emitters with economic incentives to reduce polluting emissions , or peak oil , the point at which global petroleum discovery will peak , after which production will go into permanent decline .
when these terms do appear in newspapers , he said , they tend to be treated as niche topics , appearing in the business pages rather than in the news section of papers .
this has implications for accountability , he said .
in the european union , a major ets has been in place since 2005 and has already entered into its second phase , but gavin said his research recorded only around 20 mentions of the scheme between 2000 and 2006 .
" where is the accountability of the european union ?
what kind of corners -lsb- could be -rsb- being cut in phase two and three ? "
what 's more , the liverpool researchers found that in some newspapers , a significant amount of what little coverage appeared was focused on skeptical reporting .
" in the top-selling newspapers like the telegraph , daily mail , the sun and their sunday sister papers , 25 percent of the coverage ran along climate skeptic lines , " said gavin .
wormer said that despite recent revelations of mistakes in the ipcc reports , there is n't necessarily any reason for journalists to give more attention to climate skepticism .

former prime minister dominique de villepin has created a new center-right party called republique solidaire .
villepin aims to capitalize on sarkozy 's current poor poll ratings .
sarkozy 's re-election has until now been regarded as a near-certainty , but a republique solidaire candidacy in the 2012 ballot could split the conservative vote .

former prime minister dominique de villepin has created a new center-right party called republique solidaire .
villepin aims to capitalize on sarkozy 's current poor poll ratings .
sarkozy 's re-election has until now been regarded as a near-certainty , but a republique solidaire candidacy in the 2012 ballot could split the conservative vote .
launching the party speaking to a crowd of an estimated 3,000 supporters , villepin criticized " an ever-growing gap between words and acts , between what french people go through and what their leaders experience . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former prime minister was cleared of slander charges in january the former diplomat has been one of sarkozy 's strongest critics in the conservative camp .
he was prime minister under president jacques chirac and was known to have a tense relationship with sarkozy , who served as his interior minister .
villepin was a member of sarkozy 's ump party , but broke away after a bitter row . last year , villepin went on trial for allegedly taking part in a smear campaign to ruin sarkozy 's presidential bid , but was cleared of all charges .
splitting the vote polls show villepin would pick up no more than 7 or 8 percent of the vote in 2012 , but his personal approval ratings stand at 49 percent .
sarkozy 's rating has dropped in recent months to around 33 percent .
a presidential candidacy from villepin could split the right - at a time when the far-right in france is also challenging sarkozy .
marine le pen , vice president of the far right national front , said she was " very happy " about the prospect of villepin running in 2012 , as it could weaken sarkozy .
the head of the international monetary fund , dominique strauss-kahn , is also being touted as a candidate and is widely viewed as a favorite to head the socialist party ticket for 2012 .

fabiano 's two goals propelled brazil to the win and into the knock-out round of the world cup . brazil 's 3-1 victory over the ivory coast in johannesburg on sunday night showed glimmers of why brazil is a perennial world cup favorite .
the brazilians appear to be finding their stride in the tournament , and in this game , luis fabiano was in the lead .
he scored two goals and helped propel brazil into the next round . fabiano 's first goal was orchestrated by passes from robinho and kaka .
fabiano found himself free to the side of the goal with only the keeper to beat .
boubacar barry was in good position for the ivory coast , but fabiano simply blasted the shot over the keeper 's head into the top of the net to score . fives minutes into the second half , fabiano displayed some brazilian flair for his second goal of the match .
he beat two defenders with light taps on the ball to send it over their heads , then controlled the pass to himself with his chest and fired away to score . however , television replays showed fabiano 's upper arm appeared to help him get the ball under control before he shot .
the ball also glanced off his hand at the start of the play . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elano and fabiano both have 2 goals in this world cup brazil rounded out its victory seven minutes later , as kaka sent a pass from near the end line back to midfielder elano , who surprised a sleeping ivorian defence and scored the easy goal . the ivory coast 's striker didier drogba pulled one back for his side in the 79th minute .
following a long , solo run , gervinho was caught by the brazilian defence and forced to pass away to yaya toure .
toure sent a perfect pass into the middle where drogba used a long header to put away the consolation goal . the final ten minutes of the game were quite physical , with several fouls being given and some heated words exchanged between players .
kaka was booked in the 88th minute for his second foul of the game and sent off the pitch .
the midfielder will miss brazil 's next match against portugal , which is merely a formality as the win against the ivory coast secures brazil 's place in the next round .
group f remains close for a few days at least , group f of the world cup was a nice , tidy four-way tie .
in the group 's first two matches , all four teams drew 1-1 with each other , giving them all one point and a goal differential of zero .
that deadlock was bound to be broken - paraguay took the initiative , beating slovakia 2-0 on sunday afternoon - but the group is still very tight as defending champs italy only managed a draw against group-underdogs new zealand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smeltz and the kiwis were more than happy with a draw against italy the all whites surprised italy by taking the lead in the 7th minute .
italian captain fabio cannavaro failed to clear a free kick , which left new zealand 's shane smeltz free to tap in the goal . the kiwi 's dreams of an upset win over the world cup title holders did n't last long , though .
italy was awarded a penalty kick in the 29th minute when daniele de rossi fell in a tussle with new zealand 's tommy smith in the box .
the ref showed smith a yellow card and pointed to the penalty spot .
vincenzo iaquinta took the kick to pull italy even with new zealand . although italy had the advantage for more or less the rest of the game , they failed to create scoring opportunities and are now level with new zealand on points in group f. paraguay takes the lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paraguay is in a good position at the top of the group by only managing a draw against new zealand , italy faces some pressure heading into their last group match against slovakia .
a win would secure a spot in the round of 16 , but a draw could leave them exposed to being bounced should new zealand continue to surprise and come up with a win or a high-scoring draw against paraguay . the south american team , however , looked strong in their 2-0 win against slovakia that sent them to the top of the group . enrique vera opened the scoring for paraguay in the 27th minute , taking a precise pass from lucas barrios and slipping a shot through two defenders and into the goal .
toward the end of the game , paraguay added its second goal for good measure as cristian riveros cleaned up a loose ball on the edge of the box and booted it past slovakian keeper jan mucha .
slovakia only had one shot on goal the entire game , and their best chance to score came in the 37th minute when defender kornel salata headed a corner over the goal .

fabiano 's two goals propelled brazil to the win and into the knock-out round of the world cup . brazil 's 3-1 victory over the ivory coast in johannesburg on sunday night showed glimmers of why brazil is a perennial world cup favorite .
the brazilians appear to be finding their stride in the tournament , and in this game , luis fabiano was in the lead .
he scored two goals and helped propel brazil into the next round . fabiano 's first goal was orchestrated by passes from robinho and kaka .
fabiano found himself free to the side of the goal with only the keeper to beat .
boubacar barry was in good position for the ivory coast , but fabiano simply blasted the shot over the keeper 's head into the top of the net to score . fives minutes into the second half , fabiano displayed some brazilian flair for his second goal of the match .
he beat two defenders with light taps on the ball to send it over their heads , then controlled the pass to himself with his chest and fired away to score . however , television replays showed fabiano 's upper arm appeared to help him get the ball under control before he shot .
the ball also glanced off his hand at the start of the play . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elano and fabiano both have 2 goals in this world cup brazil rounded out its victory seven minutes later , as kaka sent a pass from near the end line back to midfielder elano , who surprised a sleeping ivorian defence and scored the easy goal . the ivory coast 's striker didier drogba pulled one back for his side in the 79th minute .
following a long , solo run , gervinho was caught by the brazilian defence and forced to pass away to yaya toure .
toure sent a perfect pass into the middle where drogba used a long header to put away the consolation goal . the final ten minutes of the game were quite physical , with several fouls being given and some heated words exchanged between players .
kaka was booked in the 88th minute for his second foul of the game and sent off the pitch .
the midfielder will miss brazil 's next match against portugal , which is merely a formality as the win against the ivory coast secures brazil 's place in the next round .
group f remains close for a few days at least , group f of the world cup was a nice , tidy four-way tie .
in the group 's first two matches , all four teams drew 1-1 with each other , giving them all one point and a goal differential of zero .
that deadlock was bound to be broken - paraguay took the initiative , beating slovakia 2-0 on sunday afternoon - but the group is still very tight as defending champs italy only managed a draw against group-underdogs new zealand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smeltz and the kiwis were more than happy with a draw against italy the all whites surprised italy by taking the lead in the 7th minute .
italian captain fabio cannavaro failed to clear a free kick , which left new zealand 's shane smeltz free to tap in the goal . the kiwi 's dreams of an upset win over the world cup title holders did n't last long , though .
italy was awarded a penalty kick in the 29th minute when daniele de rossi fell in a tussle with new zealand 's tommy smith in the box .
the ref showed smith a yellow card and pointed to the penalty spot .

since the unearthing of an embarrassing error in the most recent ipcc report - the statement that the himalayan glaciers might be gone by 2035 - the hunt for further ipcc blunders has been on , drawing in scientists , bloggers and journalists from all over the world .
yet some experts argue that , the occasional scandal aside , climate change is a subject that receives relatively little media attention .
three years ago , dortmund university professor of journalism holger wormer described climate change as a " shooting star " topic for the media .
at the time , he and others in the scientific and journalistic communities had big ideas about the role the media could play in the struggle against global warming .
falling by the wayside bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental disasters could be drawing media attention away from climate change today , according to wormer , climate change is a topic that has fallen from editorial grace .
" we now have a lot of other things on our agenda , things that are developing and that have more impact than they did three years ago , for example the financial crisis , " he said .
" these things have pushed reporting on climate change into the background . "
wormer said that with other , more pressing environmental stories on the table - the gulf of mexico oil spill , or , in germany , recurring discussions over nuclear energy - the " slow and steady " threat of climate change has been pushed to the side and is now a topic that appears more often in the context of wider environmental or political coverage .
" i think we started a bit too late with serious reporting on the topic .
the reporting increased significantly only when there was more interest in climate change in the political agenda , " he said .
wormer 's concern appears to be backed up by the numbers .
last year , researchers from the university of liverpool in the uk released the results of an exhaustive study of climate change coverage in british newspapers .
they found that between 2000 and 2006 , the number of articles addressing climate change was modest : coverage peaked at around 100 articles per month .
" just to give you a comparison , the number of stories on health or crime were at about 400 to 500 stories per month the whole way through the period , " said neil gavin , a senior lecturer in politics at the university of liverpool and lead researcher of the study .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stories on emissions trading schemes are relegated to the business pages big topics still ' niche ' gavin , who has written and researched extensively on the relationship between climate change and the media , said even fewer journalists were attempting to tackle climate change-related topics like emissions trading schemes -lrb- etss -rrb- , the market-based approach to controlling pollution that provides big emitters with economic incentives to reduce polluting emissions , or peak oil , the point at which global petroleum discovery will peak , after which production will go into permanent decline .
when these terms do appear in newspapers , he said , they tend to be treated as niche topics , appearing in the business pages rather than in the news section of papers .
this has implications for accountability , he said .
in the european union , a major ets has been in place since 2005 and has already entered into its second phase , but gavin said his research recorded only around 20 mentions of the scheme between 2000 and 2006 .
" where is the accountability of the european union ?
what kind of corners -lsb- could be -rsb- being cut in phase two and three ? "
what 's more , the liverpool researchers found that in some newspapers , a significant amount of what little coverage appeared was focused on skeptical reporting .
" in the top-selling newspapers like the telegraph , daily mail , the sun and their sunday sister papers , 25 percent of the coverage ran along climate skeptic lines , " said gavin .
wormer said that despite recent revelations of mistakes in the ipcc reports , there is n't necessarily any reason for journalists to give more attention to climate skepticism .
" we should also be aware of the huge amount of pressure , the lobbying and the pr that goes into trying to -lsb- create -rsb- doubts over the science , " he said , citing the similar levels of pressure and skepticism in the last century over whether cigarettes posed a health hazard .
' keep it simple ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hedegaard says journalists can help by sticking to the facts connie hedegaard , the eu commissioner for climate action and the former danish minister for climate and energy , said the role journalists can play in helping to tackle climate change is a simple one .
" i think the media could help a lot by simply communicating the facts , " she said .
" and take care that when you have one or two errors in a huge report done by thousands of scientists not to communicate the message as if one or two errors would change the whole finding of the -lsb- report -rsb- .
i think it 's very important here to get the proportions right . "
hedegaard , herself a former television journalist , said while it would be wrong for the media to ignore climate skepticism altogether , it is also wrong to uncritically accept skepticism in the name of balance .
" the easiest thing in the world is to invite a guest who says that the planet is flat , and somebody who says , no , it 's round .
and the reporter 's job there is not just to hold the microphone and say , ' ok , a says it 's flat , the other one says it 's round , " ' she said .
" it is sometimes also -lsb- necessary -rsb- to be equipped to say something is factual , something is right and something is wrong ; " she said . " that is not being biased ; that 's just to help the listeners , the viewers and the readers to orient themselves in a jungle of information . "

clashes between the two sides have escalated sharply . after a series of air raids targeting by turkish fighter jets on rebel hideouts of the kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- in northern iraq , the group has threatened to launch attack on cities across turkey . " we will take our operations to all turkish cities if the government continues its attacks against us , " pkk spokesman ahmed denis told afp news agency on saturday . " turkey wants to take us towards war , " he said .
" she is not sincere in dealing with the kurdish issue and does n't want to deal with this issue peacefully . " turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has vowed that the threats would have no effect on his country 's determination to fight the pkk . " our fight will continue until the terrorist organization has been annihilated , " said erdogan . according to turkey 's military headquarters , the pkk militants touched off the fighting with an attack on an army unit near the southeastern border with iraq .
the pkk claimed responsibility for the early morning raid on a military post near the city of semdinli , which killed eight turkish soldiers .
twelve rebels were killed and a further 14 injured in the clash . in response , the turkish air force " struck targets identified in the northern region of iraq , " a statement on the military 's website said . two turkish soldiers were also killed after stepping on a landmine in hakkari . at sunday 's funeral services for the turkish soldiers , erdogan said the rebels would never win and that they would " drown in their own blood . " end of ceasefire the turkish military warned on friday that the pkk could intensify its operations over the summer , when warmer weather brings out more pkk guerrillas from the mountains of northern iraq .
several thousand rebels are based there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish kurds demonstrate in support of kurdish rebels in october 2009 the pkk said this month that they had scrapped a year-old unilateral ceasefire and resumed attacks against turkish forces because of military operations against pkk targets in northern iraq .
the ceasefire started as the turkish government worked on plans to boost kurdish rights under a reform package designed to end the conflict .
however , the reform process has faltered .
the rebel group has been branded as terrorists by turkey , the united states and the european union .
they say they want greater rights and autonomy for turkey 's estimated 12 to 15 million kurds .
the pkk also demand an ethnic homeland for kurds in turkey 's southeast .
more than 40,000 people have been killed in the insurgency against the turkish state since the pkk campaign was launched in 1984 .

since the unearthing of an embarrassing error in the most recent ipcc report - the statement that the himalayan glaciers might be gone by 2035 - the hunt for further ipcc blunders has been on , drawing in scientists , bloggers and journalists from all over the world .
yet some experts argue that , the occasional scandal aside , climate change is a subject that receives relatively little media attention .
three years ago , dortmund university professor of journalism holger wormer described climate change as a " shooting star " topic for the media .
at the time , he and others in the scientific and journalistic communities had big ideas about the role the media could play in the struggle against global warming .
falling by the wayside bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental disasters could be drawing media attention away from climate change today , according to wormer , climate change is a topic that has fallen from editorial grace .
" we now have a lot of other things on our agenda , things that are developing and that have more impact than they did three years ago , for example the financial crisis , " he said .
" these things have pushed reporting on climate change into the background . "
wormer said that with other , more pressing environmental stories on the table - the gulf of mexico oil spill , or , in germany , recurring discussions over nuclear energy - the " slow and steady " threat of climate change has been pushed to the side and is now a topic that appears more often in the context of wider environmental or political coverage .
" i think we started a bit too late with serious reporting on the topic .
the reporting increased significantly only when there was more interest in climate change in the political agenda , " he said .
wormer 's concern appears to be backed up by the numbers .
last year , researchers from the university of liverpool in the uk released the results of an exhaustive study of climate change coverage in british newspapers .
they found that between 2000 and 2006 , the number of articles addressing climate change was modest : coverage peaked at around 100 articles per month .
" just to give you a comparison , the number of stories on health or crime were at about 400 to 500 stories per month the whole way through the period , " said neil gavin , a senior lecturer in politics at the university of liverpool and lead researcher of the study .

since the unearthing of an embarrassing error in the most recent ipcc report - the statement that the himalayan glaciers might be gone by 2035 - the hunt for further ipcc blunders has been on , drawing in scientists , bloggers and journalists from all over the world .
yet some experts argue that , the occasional scandal aside , climate change is a subject that receives relatively little media attention .
three years ago , dortmund university professor of journalism holger wormer described climate change as a " shooting star " topic for the media .
at the time , he and others in the scientific and journalistic communities had big ideas about the role the media could play in the struggle against global warming .
falling by the wayside bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental disasters could be drawing media attention away from climate change today , according to wormer , climate change is a topic that has fallen from editorial grace .
" we now have a lot of other things on our agenda , things that are developing and that have more impact than they did three years ago , for example the financial crisis , " he said .
" these things have pushed reporting on climate change into the background . "
wormer said that with other , more pressing environmental stories on the table - the gulf of mexico oil spill , or , in germany , recurring discussions over nuclear energy - the " slow and steady " threat of climate change has been pushed to the side and is now a topic that appears more often in the context of wider environmental or political coverage .
" i think we started a bit too late with serious reporting on the topic .
the reporting increased significantly only when there was more interest in climate change in the political agenda , " he said .
wormer 's concern appears to be backed up by the numbers .
last year , researchers from the university of liverpool in the uk released the results of an exhaustive study of climate change coverage in british newspapers .
they found that between 2000 and 2006 , the number of articles addressing climate change was modest : coverage peaked at around 100 articles per month .
" just to give you a comparison , the number of stories on health or crime were at about 400 to 500 stories per month the whole way through the period , " said neil gavin , a senior lecturer in politics at the university of liverpool and lead researcher of the study .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stories on emissions trading schemes are relegated to the business pages big topics still ' niche ' gavin , who has written and researched extensively on the relationship between climate change and the media , said even fewer journalists were attempting to tackle climate change-related topics like emissions trading schemes -lrb- etss -rrb- , the market-based approach to controlling pollution that provides big emitters with economic incentives to reduce polluting emissions , or peak oil , the point at which global petroleum discovery will peak , after which production will go into permanent decline .
when these terms do appear in newspapers , he said , they tend to be treated as niche topics , appearing in the business pages rather than in the news section of papers .
this has implications for accountability , he said .
in the european union , a major ets has been in place since 2005 and has already entered into its second phase , but gavin said his research recorded only around 20 mentions of the scheme between 2000 and 2006 .
" where is the accountability of the european union ?
what kind of corners -lsb- could be -rsb- being cut in phase two and three ? "
what 's more , the liverpool researchers found that in some newspapers , a significant amount of what little coverage appeared was focused on skeptical reporting .
" in the top-selling newspapers like the telegraph , daily mail , the sun and their sunday sister papers , 25 percent of the coverage ran along climate skeptic lines , " said gavin .
wormer said that despite recent revelations of mistakes in the ipcc reports , there is n't necessarily any reason for journalists to give more attention to climate skepticism .
" we should also be aware of the huge amount of pressure , the lobbying and the pr that goes into trying to -lsb- create -rsb- doubts over the science , " he said , citing the similar levels of pressure and skepticism in the last century over whether cigarettes posed a health hazard .
' keep it simple ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hedegaard says journalists can help by sticking to the facts connie hedegaard , the eu commissioner for climate action and the former danish minister for climate and energy , said the role journalists can play in helping to tackle climate change is a simple one .
" i think the media could help a lot by simply communicating the facts , " she said .
" and take care that when you have one or two errors in a huge report done by thousands of scientists not to communicate the message as if one or two errors would change the whole finding of the -lsb- report -rsb- .
i think it 's very important here to get the proportions right . "
hedegaard , herself a former television journalist , said while it would be wrong for the media to ignore climate skepticism altogether , it is also wrong to uncritically accept skepticism in the name of balance .
" the easiest thing in the world is to invite a guest who says that the planet is flat , and somebody who says , no , it 's round .
and the reporter 's job there is not just to hold the microphone and say , ' ok , a says it 's flat , the other one says it 's round , " ' she said .
" it is sometimes also -lsb- necessary -rsb- to be equipped to say something is factual , something is right and something is wrong ; " she said . " that is not being biased ; that 's just to help the listeners , the viewers and the readers to orient themselves in a jungle of information . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stories on emissions trading schemes are relegated to the business pages big topics still ' niche ' gavin , who has written and researched extensively on the relationship between climate change and the media , said even fewer journalists were attempting to tackle climate change-related topics like emissions trading schemes -lrb- etss -rrb- , the market-based approach to controlling pollution that provides big emitters with economic incentives to reduce polluting emissions , or peak oil , the point at which global petroleum discovery will peak , after which production will go into permanent decline .
when these terms do appear in newspapers , he said , they tend to be treated as niche topics , appearing in the business pages rather than in the news section of papers .
this has implications for accountability , he said .
in the european union , a major ets has been in place since 2005 and has already entered into its second phase , but gavin said his research recorded only around 20 mentions of the scheme between 2000 and 2006 .
" where is the accountability of the european union ?
what kind of corners -lsb- could be -rsb- being cut in phase two and three ? "
what 's more , the liverpool researchers found that in some newspapers , a significant amount of what little coverage appeared was focused on skeptical reporting .
" in the top-selling newspapers like the telegraph , daily mail , the sun and their sunday sister papers , 25 percent of the coverage ran along climate skeptic lines , " said gavin .
wormer said that despite recent revelations of mistakes in the ipcc reports , there is n't necessarily any reason for journalists to give more attention to climate skepticism .
" we should also be aware of the huge amount of pressure , the lobbying and the pr that goes into trying to -lsb- create -rsb- doubts over the science , " he said , citing the similar levels of pressure and skepticism in the last century over whether cigarettes posed a health hazard .
' keep it simple ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hedegaard says journalists can help by sticking to the facts connie hedegaard , the eu commissioner for climate action and the former danish minister for climate and energy , said the role journalists can play in helping to tackle climate change is a simple one .
" i think the media could help a lot by simply communicating the facts , " she said .
" and take care that when you have one or two errors in a huge report done by thousands of scientists not to communicate the message as if one or two errors would change the whole finding of the -lsb- report -rsb- .
i think it 's very important here to get the proportions right . "
hedegaard , herself a former television journalist , said while it would be wrong for the media to ignore climate skepticism altogether , it is also wrong to uncritically accept skepticism in the name of balance .
" the easiest thing in the world is to invite a guest who says that the planet is flat , and somebody who says , no , it 's round .
and the reporter 's job there is not just to hold the microphone and say , ' ok , a says it 's flat , the other one says it 's round , " ' she said .
" it is sometimes also -lsb- necessary -rsb- to be equipped to say something is factual , something is right and something is wrong ; " she said . " that is not being biased ; that 's just to help the listeners , the viewers and the readers to orient themselves in a jungle of information . "

since the unearthing of an embarrassing error in the most recent ipcc report - the statement that the himalayan glaciers might be gone by 2035 - the hunt for further ipcc blunders has been on , drawing in scientists , bloggers and journalists from all over the world .
yet some experts argue that , the occasional scandal aside , climate change is a subject that receives relatively little media attention .
three years ago , dortmund university professor of journalism holger wormer described climate change as a " shooting star " topic for the media .
at the time , he and others in the scientific and journalistic communities had big ideas about the role the media could play in the struggle against global warming .
falling by the wayside bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental disasters could be drawing media attention away from climate change today , according to wormer , climate change is a topic that has fallen from editorial grace .
" we now have a lot of other things on our agenda , things that are developing and that have more impact than they did three years ago , for example the financial crisis , " he said .
" these things have pushed reporting on climate change into the background . "
wormer said that with other , more pressing environmental stories on the table - the gulf of mexico oil spill , or , in germany , recurring discussions over nuclear energy - the " slow and steady " threat of climate change has been pushed to the side and is now a topic that appears more often in the context of wider environmental or political coverage .
" i think we started a bit too late with serious reporting on the topic .
the reporting increased significantly only when there was more interest in climate change in the political agenda , " he said .
wormer 's concern appears to be backed up by the numbers .
last year , researchers from the university of liverpool in the uk released the results of an exhaustive study of climate change coverage in british newspapers .
they found that between 2000 and 2006 , the number of articles addressing climate change was modest : coverage peaked at around 100 articles per month .
" just to give you a comparison , the number of stories on health or crime were at about 400 to 500 stories per month the whole way through the period , " said neil gavin , a senior lecturer in politics at the university of liverpool and lead researcher of the study .

"
niebel had planned to inspect a german-financed sewage plant in the hamas-controlled area and meet representatives of the united nations relief and works agency for palestine refugees .
" i had hoped that this could have been a clear political signal for an opening and for transparency , " niebel said in a separate interview on public german broadcaster zdf .
" sometimes the israeli government does not make it easy for its friends to explain why it behaves in the way it does . "
german politicians criticize decision german foreign minister guido westerwelle said he regretted israel 's decision , adding that the german government continued to support an end to the israel 's blockade of gaza .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebel had planned to inspect a german-financed sewage plant " this is not only the stance of germany but also the stance of our partners in the european union , " westerwelle said .
islamist group hamas took power in gaza in 2007 , after which israel imposed a blockade on the small but densely populated coastal region .
israel said this week that it was easing a land blockade of the gaza strip after a storm of international criticism following its raid on an aid flotilla bound for the hamas-run palestinian territory killed nine activists .

"
niebel had planned to inspect a german-financed sewage plant in the hamas-controlled area and meet representatives of the united nations relief and works agency for palestine refugees .
" i had hoped that this could have been a clear political signal for an opening and for transparency , " niebel said in a separate interview on public german broadcaster zdf .
" sometimes the israeli government does not make it easy for its friends to explain why it behaves in the way it does . "
german politicians criticize decision german foreign minister guido westerwelle said he regretted israel 's decision , adding that the german government continued to support an end to the israel 's blockade of gaza .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebel had planned to inspect a german-financed sewage plant " this is not only the stance of germany but also the stance of our partners in the european union , " westerwelle said .
islamist group hamas took power in gaza in 2007 , after which israel imposed a blockade on the small but densely populated coastal region .
israel said this week that it was easing a land blockade of the gaza strip after a storm of international criticism following its raid on an aid flotilla bound for the hamas-run palestinian territory killed nine activists .
israel faced intensified international calls to relax or lift its gaza embargo .
ruprecht polenz , a member of parliament of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party and chairman of the foreign affairs committee told newspaper tagesspiegel there was no " political reason " for israel 's decision .

former prime minister dominique de villepin has created a new center-right party called republique solidaire .
villepin aims to capitalize on sarkozy 's current poor poll ratings .
sarkozy 's re-election has until now been regarded as a near-certainty , but a republique solidaire candidacy in the 2012 ballot could split the conservative vote .
launching the party speaking to a crowd of an estimated 3,000 supporters , villepin criticized " an ever-growing gap between words and acts , between what french people go through and what their leaders experience . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former prime minister was cleared of slander charges in january the former diplomat has been one of sarkozy 's strongest critics in the conservative camp .
he was prime minister under president jacques chirac and was known to have a tense relationship with sarkozy , who served as his interior minister .
villepin was a member of sarkozy 's ump party , but broke away after a bitter row . last year , villepin went on trial for allegedly taking part in a smear campaign to ruin sarkozy 's presidential bid , but was cleared of all charges .
splitting the vote polls show villepin would pick up no more than 7 or 8 percent of the vote in 2012 , but his personal approval ratings stand at 49 percent .
sarkozy 's rating has dropped in recent months to around 33 percent .
a presidential candidacy from villepin could split the right - at a time when the far-right in france is also challenging sarkozy .
marine le pen , vice president of the far right national front , said she was " very happy " about the prospect of villepin running in 2012 , as it could weaken sarkozy .
the head of the international monetary fund , dominique strauss-kahn , is also being touted as a candidate and is widely viewed as a favorite to head the socialist party ticket for 2012 .

former prime minister dominique de villepin has created a new center-right party called republique solidaire .
villepin aims to capitalize on sarkozy 's current poor poll ratings .
sarkozy 's re-election has until now been regarded as a near-certainty , but a republique solidaire candidacy in the 2012 ballot could split the conservative vote .
launching the party speaking to a crowd of an estimated 3,000 supporters , villepin criticized " an ever-growing gap between words and acts , between what french people go through and what their leaders experience . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former prime minister was cleared of slander charges in january the former diplomat has been one of sarkozy 's strongest critics in the conservative camp .
he was prime minister under president jacques chirac and was known to have a tense relationship with sarkozy , who served as his interior minister .
villepin was a member of sarkozy 's ump party , but broke away after a bitter row . last year , villepin went on trial for allegedly taking part in a smear campaign to ruin sarkozy 's presidential bid , but was cleared of all charges .
splitting the vote polls show villepin would pick up no more than 7 or 8 percent of the vote in 2012 , but his personal approval ratings stand at 49 percent .
sarkozy 's rating has dropped in recent months to around 33 percent .
a presidential candidacy from villepin could split the right - at a time when the far-right in france is also challenging sarkozy .
marine le pen , vice president of the far right national front , said she was " very happy " about the prospect of villepin running in 2012 , as it could weaken sarkozy .
the head of the international monetary fund , dominique strauss-kahn , is also being touted as a candidate and is widely viewed as a favorite to head the socialist party ticket for 2012 .

clashes between the two sides have escalated sharply . after a series of air raids targeting by turkish fighter jets on rebel hideouts of the kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- in northern iraq , the group has threatened to launch attack on cities across turkey . " we will take our operations to all turkish cities if the government continues its attacks against us , " pkk spokesman ahmed denis told afp news agency on saturday . " turkey wants to take us towards war , " he said .
" she is not sincere in dealing with the kurdish issue and does n't want to deal with this issue peacefully . " turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has vowed that the threats would have no effect on his country 's determination to fight the pkk . " our fight will continue until the terrorist organization has been annihilated , " said erdogan . according to turkey 's military headquarters , the pkk militants touched off the fighting with an attack on an army unit near the southeastern border with iraq .
the pkk claimed responsibility for the early morning raid on a military post near the city of semdinli , which killed eight turkish soldiers .
twelve rebels were killed and a further 14 injured in the clash . in response , the turkish air force " struck targets identified in the northern region of iraq , " a statement on the military 's website said . two turkish soldiers were also killed after stepping on a landmine in hakkari . at sunday 's funeral services for the turkish soldiers , erdogan said the rebels would never win and that they would " drown in their own blood . " end of ceasefire the turkish military warned on friday that the pkk could intensify its operations over the summer , when warmer weather brings out more pkk guerrillas from the mountains of northern iraq .
several thousand rebels are based there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish kurds demonstrate in support of kurdish rebels in october 2009 the pkk said this month that they had scrapped a year-old unilateral ceasefire and resumed attacks against turkish forces because of military operations against pkk targets in northern iraq .
the ceasefire started as the turkish government worked on plans to boost kurdish rights under a reform package designed to end the conflict .
however , the reform process has faltered .
the rebel group has been branded as terrorists by turkey , the united states and the european union .
they say they want greater rights and autonomy for turkey 's estimated 12 to 15 million kurds .
the pkk also demand an ethnic homeland for kurds in turkey 's southeast .
more than 40,000 people have been killed in the insurgency against the turkish state since the pkk campaign was launched in 1984 .

fabiano 's two goals propelled brazil to the win and into the knock-out round of the world cup . brazil 's 3-1 victory over the ivory coast in johannesburg on sunday night showed glimmers of why brazil is a perennial world cup favorite .
the brazilians appear to be finding their stride in the tournament , and in this game , luis fabiano was in the lead .
he scored two goals and helped propel brazil into the next round . fabiano 's first goal was orchestrated by passes from robinho and kaka .
fabiano found himself free to the side of the goal with only the keeper to beat .
boubacar barry was in good position for the ivory coast , but fabiano simply blasted the shot over the keeper 's head into the top of the net to score . fives minutes into the second half , fabiano displayed some brazilian flair for his second goal of the match .
he beat two defenders with light taps on the ball to send it over their heads , then controlled the pass to himself with his chest and fired away to score . however , television replays showed fabiano 's upper arm appeared to help him get the ball under control before he shot .
the ball also glanced off his hand at the start of the play . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elano and fabiano both have 2 goals in this world cup brazil rounded out its victory seven minutes later , as kaka sent a pass from near the end line back to midfielder elano , who surprised a sleeping ivorian defence and scored the easy goal . the ivory coast 's striker didier drogba pulled one back for his side in the 79th minute .
following a long , solo run , gervinho was caught by the brazilian defence and forced to pass away to yaya toure .
toure sent a perfect pass into the middle where drogba used a long header to put away the consolation goal . the final ten minutes of the game were quite physical , with several fouls being given and some heated words exchanged between players .
kaka was booked in the 88th minute for his second foul of the game and sent off the pitch .
the midfielder will miss brazil 's next match against portugal , which is merely a formality as the win against the ivory coast secures brazil 's place in the next round .
group f remains close for a few days at least , group f of the world cup was a nice , tidy four-way tie .
in the group 's first two matches , all four teams drew 1-1 with each other , giving them all one point and a goal differential of zero .
that deadlock was bound to be broken - paraguay took the initiative , beating slovakia 2-0 on sunday afternoon - but the group is still very tight as defending champs italy only managed a draw against group-underdogs new zealand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smeltz and the kiwis were more than happy with a draw against italy the all whites surprised italy by taking the lead in the 7th minute .
italian captain fabio cannavaro failed to clear a free kick , which left new zealand 's shane smeltz free to tap in the goal . the kiwi 's dreams of an upset win over the world cup title holders did n't last long , though .
italy was awarded a penalty kick in the 29th minute when daniele de rossi fell in a tussle with new zealand 's tommy smith in the box .
the ref showed smith a yellow card and pointed to the penalty spot .
vincenzo iaquinta took the kick to pull italy even with new zealand . although italy had the advantage for more or less the rest of the game , they failed to create scoring opportunities and are now level with new zealand on points in group f. paraguay takes the lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paraguay is in a good position at the top of the group by only managing a draw against new zealand , italy faces some pressure heading into their last group match against slovakia .
a win would secure a spot in the round of 16 , but a draw could leave them exposed to being bounced should new zealand continue to surprise and come up with a win or a high-scoring draw against paraguay . the south american team , however , looked strong in their 2-0 win against slovakia that sent them to the top of the group . enrique vera opened the scoring for paraguay in the 27th minute , taking a precise pass from lucas barrios and slipping a shot through two defenders and into the goal .
toward the end of the game , paraguay added its second goal for good measure as cristian riveros cleaned up a loose ball on the edge of the box and booted it past slovakian keeper jan mucha .
slovakia only had one shot on goal the entire game , and their best chance to score came in the 37th minute when defender kornel salata headed a corner over the goal .

fabiano 's two goals propelled brazil to the win and into the knock-out round of the world cup . brazil 's 3-1 victory over the ivory coast in johannesburg on sunday night showed glimmers of why brazil is a perennial world cup favorite .
the brazilians appear to be finding their stride in the tournament , and in this game , luis fabiano was in the lead .
he scored two goals and helped propel brazil into the next round . fabiano 's first goal was orchestrated by passes from robinho and kaka .
fabiano found himself free to the side of the goal with only the keeper to beat .
boubacar barry was in good position for the ivory coast , but fabiano simply blasted the shot over the keeper 's head into the top of the net to score . fives minutes into the second half , fabiano displayed some brazilian flair for his second goal of the match .
he beat two defenders with light taps on the ball to send it over their heads , then controlled the pass to himself with his chest and fired away to score . however , television replays showed fabiano 's upper arm appeared to help him get the ball under control before he shot .
the ball also glanced off his hand at the start of the play . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elano and fabiano both have 2 goals in this world cup brazil rounded out its victory seven minutes later , as kaka sent a pass from near the end line back to midfielder elano , who surprised a sleeping ivorian defence and scored the easy goal . the ivory coast 's striker didier drogba pulled one back for his side in the 79th minute .
following a long , solo run , gervinho was caught by the brazilian defence and forced to pass away to yaya toure .
toure sent a perfect pass into the middle where drogba used a long header to put away the consolation goal . the final ten minutes of the game were quite physical , with several fouls being given and some heated words exchanged between players .
kaka was booked in the 88th minute for his second foul of the game and sent off the pitch .
the midfielder will miss brazil 's next match against portugal , which is merely a formality as the win against the ivory coast secures brazil 's place in the next round .
group f remains close for a few days at least , group f of the world cup was a nice , tidy four-way tie .
in the group 's first two matches , all four teams drew 1-1 with each other , giving them all one point and a goal differential of zero .
that deadlock was bound to be broken - paraguay took the initiative , beating slovakia 2-0 on sunday afternoon - but the group is still very tight as defending champs italy only managed a draw against group-underdogs new zealand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smeltz and the kiwis were more than happy with a draw against italy the all whites surprised italy by taking the lead in the 7th minute .
italian captain fabio cannavaro failed to clear a free kick , which left new zealand 's shane smeltz free to tap in the goal . the kiwi 's dreams of an upset win over the world cup title holders did n't last long , though .
italy was awarded a penalty kick in the 29th minute when daniele de rossi fell in a tussle with new zealand 's tommy smith in the box .
the ref showed smith a yellow card and pointed to the penalty spot .
vincenzo iaquinta took the kick to pull italy even with new zealand . although italy had the advantage for more or less the rest of the game , they failed to create scoring opportunities and are now level with new zealand on points in group f. paraguay takes the lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paraguay is in a good position at the top of the group by only managing a draw against new zealand , italy faces some pressure heading into their last group match against slovakia .

since the unearthing of an embarrassing error in the most recent ipcc report - the statement that the himalayan glaciers might be gone by 2035 - the hunt for further ipcc blunders has been on , drawing in scientists , bloggers and journalists from all over the world .
yet some experts argue that , the occasional scandal aside , climate change is a subject that receives relatively little media attention .
three years ago , dortmund university professor of journalism holger wormer described climate change as a " shooting star " topic for the media .
at the time , he and others in the scientific and journalistic communities had big ideas about the role the media could play in the struggle against global warming .
falling by the wayside bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental disasters could be drawing media attention away from climate change today , according to wormer , climate change is a topic that has fallen from editorial grace .
" we now have a lot of other things on our agenda , things that are developing and that have more impact than they did three years ago , for example the financial crisis , " he said .
" these things have pushed reporting on climate change into the background . "
wormer said that with other , more pressing environmental stories on the table - the gulf of mexico oil spill , or , in germany , recurring discussions over nuclear energy - the " slow and steady " threat of climate change has been pushed to the side and is now a topic that appears more often in the context of wider environmental or political coverage .
" i think we started a bit too late with serious reporting on the topic .
the reporting increased significantly only when there was more interest in climate change in the political agenda , " he said .
wormer 's concern appears to be backed up by the numbers .
last year , researchers from the university of liverpool in the uk released the results of an exhaustive study of climate change coverage in british newspapers .
they found that between 2000 and 2006 , the number of articles addressing climate change was modest : coverage peaked at around 100 articles per month .
" just to give you a comparison , the number of stories on health or crime were at about 400 to 500 stories per month the whole way through the period , " said neil gavin , a senior lecturer in politics at the university of liverpool and lead researcher of the study .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stories on emissions trading schemes are relegated to the business pages big topics still ' niche ' gavin , who has written and researched extensively on the relationship between climate change and the media , said even fewer journalists were attempting to tackle climate change-related topics like emissions trading schemes -lrb- etss -rrb- , the market-based approach to controlling pollution that provides big emitters with economic incentives to reduce polluting emissions , or peak oil , the point at which global petroleum discovery will peak , after which production will go into permanent decline .
when these terms do appear in newspapers , he said , they tend to be treated as niche topics , appearing in the business pages rather than in the news section of papers .
this has implications for accountability , he said .
in the european union , a major ets has been in place since 2005 and has already entered into its second phase , but gavin said his research recorded only around 20 mentions of the scheme between 2000 and 2006 .
" where is the accountability of the european union ?
what kind of corners -lsb- could be -rsb- being cut in phase two and three ? "
what 's more , the liverpool researchers found that in some newspapers , a significant amount of what little coverage appeared was focused on skeptical reporting .
" in the top-selling newspapers like the telegraph , daily mail , the sun and their sunday sister papers , 25 percent of the coverage ran along climate skeptic lines , " said gavin .
wormer said that despite recent revelations of mistakes in the ipcc reports , there is n't necessarily any reason for journalists to give more attention to climate skepticism .
" we should also be aware of the huge amount of pressure , the lobbying and the pr that goes into trying to -lsb- create -rsb- doubts over the science , " he said , citing the similar levels of pressure and skepticism in the last century over whether cigarettes posed a health hazard .
' keep it simple ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hedegaard says journalists can help by sticking to the facts connie hedegaard , the eu commissioner for climate action and the former danish minister for climate and energy , said the role journalists can play in helping to tackle climate change is a simple one .
" i think the media could help a lot by simply communicating the facts , " she said .
" and take care that when you have one or two errors in a huge report done by thousands of scientists not to communicate the message as if one or two errors would change the whole finding of the -lsb- report -rsb- .
i think it 's very important here to get the proportions right . "
hedegaard , herself a former television journalist , said while it would be wrong for the media to ignore climate skepticism altogether , it is also wrong to uncritically accept skepticism in the name of balance .
" the easiest thing in the world is to invite a guest who says that the planet is flat , and somebody who says , no , it 's round .
and the reporter 's job there is not just to hold the microphone and say , ' ok , a says it 's flat , the other one says it 's round , " ' she said .
" it is sometimes also -lsb- necessary -rsb- to be equipped to say something is factual , something is right and something is wrong ; " she said . " that is not being biased ; that 's just to help the listeners , the viewers and the readers to orient themselves in a jungle of information . "

the ball also glanced off his hand at the start of the play . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elano and fabiano both have 2 goals in this world cup brazil rounded out its victory seven minutes later , as kaka sent a pass from near the end line back to midfielder elano , who surprised a sleeping ivorian defence and scored the easy goal . the ivory coast 's striker didier drogba pulled one back for his side in the 79th minute .
following a long , solo run , gervinho was caught by the brazilian defence and forced to pass away to yaya toure .
toure sent a perfect pass into the middle where drogba used a long header to put away the consolation goal . the final ten minutes of the game were quite physical , with several fouls being given and some heated words exchanged between players .
kaka was booked in the 88th minute for his second foul of the game and sent off the pitch .
the midfielder will miss brazil 's next match against portugal , which is merely a formality as the win against the ivory coast secures brazil 's place in the next round .
group f remains close for a few days at least , group f of the world cup was a nice , tidy four-way tie .
in the group 's first two matches , all four teams drew 1-1 with each other , giving them all one point and a goal differential of zero .
that deadlock was bound to be broken - paraguay took the initiative , beating slovakia 2-0 on sunday afternoon - but the group is still very tight as defending champs italy only managed a draw against group-underdogs new zealand .

italy was awarded a penalty kick in the 29th minute when daniele de rossi fell in a tussle with new zealand 's tommy smith in the box .
the ref showed smith a yellow card and pointed to the penalty spot .

a win would secure a spot in the round of 16 , but a draw could leave them exposed to being bounced should new zealand continue to surprise and come up with a win or a high-scoring draw against paraguay . the south american team , however , looked strong in their 2-0 win against slovakia that sent them to the top of the group . enrique vera opened the scoring for paraguay in the 27th minute , taking a precise pass from lucas barrios and slipping a shot through two defenders and into the goal .
toward the end of the game , paraguay added its second goal for good measure as cristian riveros cleaned up a loose ball on the edge of the box and booted it past slovakian keeper jan mucha .
slovakia only had one shot on goal the entire game , and their best chance to score came in the 37th minute when defender kornel salata headed a corner over the goal .

clashes between the two sides have escalated sharply . after a series of air raids targeting by turkish fighter jets on rebel hideouts of the kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- in northern iraq , the group has threatened to launch attack on cities across turkey . " we will take our operations to all turkish cities if the government continues its attacks against us , " pkk spokesman ahmed denis told afp news agency on saturday . " turkey wants to take us towards war , " he said .
" she is not sincere in dealing with the kurdish issue and does n't want to deal with this issue peacefully . " turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has vowed that the threats would have no effect on his country 's determination to fight the pkk . " our fight will continue until the terrorist organization has been annihilated , " said erdogan . according to turkey 's military headquarters , the pkk militants touched off the fighting with an attack on an army unit near the southeastern border with iraq .
the pkk claimed responsibility for the early morning raid on a military post near the city of semdinli , which killed eight turkish soldiers .
twelve rebels were killed and a further 14 injured in the clash . in response , the turkish air force " struck targets identified in the northern region of iraq , " a statement on the military 's website said . two turkish soldiers were also killed after stepping on a landmine in hakkari . at sunday 's funeral services for the turkish soldiers , erdogan said the rebels would never win and that they would " drown in their own blood . " end of ceasefire the turkish military warned on friday that the pkk could intensify its operations over the summer , when warmer weather brings out more pkk guerrillas from the mountains of northern iraq .
several thousand rebels are based there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish kurds demonstrate in support of kurdish rebels in october 2009 the pkk said this month that they had scrapped a year-old unilateral ceasefire and resumed attacks against turkish forces because of military operations against pkk targets in northern iraq .
the ceasefire started as the turkish government worked on plans to boost kurdish rights under a reform package designed to end the conflict .
however , the reform process has faltered .
the rebel group has been branded as terrorists by turkey , the united states and the european union .
they say they want greater rights and autonomy for turkey 's estimated 12 to 15 million kurds .
the pkk also demand an ethnic homeland for kurds in turkey 's southeast .
more than 40,000 people have been killed in the insurgency against the turkish state since the pkk campaign was launched in 1984 .

fabiano 's two goals propelled brazil to the win and into the knock-out round of the world cup . brazil 's 3-1 victory over the ivory coast in johannesburg on sunday night showed glimmers of why brazil is a perennial world cup favorite .
the brazilians appear to be finding their stride in the tournament , and in this game , luis fabiano was in the lead .
he scored two goals and helped propel brazil into the next round . fabiano 's first goal was orchestrated by passes from robinho and kaka .
fabiano found himself free to the side of the goal with only the keeper to beat .
boubacar barry was in good position for the ivory coast , but fabiano simply blasted the shot over the keeper 's head into the top of the net to score . fives minutes into the second half , fabiano displayed some brazilian flair for his second goal of the match .
he beat two defenders with light taps on the ball to send it over their heads , then controlled the pass to himself with his chest and fired away to score . however , television replays showed fabiano 's upper arm appeared to help him get the ball under control before he shot .
the ball also glanced off his hand at the start of the play . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elano and fabiano both have 2 goals in this world cup brazil rounded out its victory seven minutes later , as kaka sent a pass from near the end line back to midfielder elano , who surprised a sleeping ivorian defence and scored the easy goal . the ivory coast 's striker didier drogba pulled one back for his side in the 79th minute .
following a long , solo run , gervinho was caught by the brazilian defence and forced to pass away to yaya toure .
toure sent a perfect pass into the middle where drogba used a long header to put away the consolation goal . the final ten minutes of the game were quite physical , with several fouls being given and some heated words exchanged between players .
kaka was booked in the 88th minute for his second foul of the game and sent off the pitch .
the midfielder will miss brazil 's next match against portugal , which is merely a formality as the win against the ivory coast secures brazil 's place in the next round .
group f remains close for a few days at least , group f of the world cup was a nice , tidy four-way tie .
in the group 's first two matches , all four teams drew 1-1 with each other , giving them all one point and a goal differential of zero .
that deadlock was bound to be broken - paraguay took the initiative , beating slovakia 2-0 on sunday afternoon - but the group is still very tight as defending champs italy only managed a draw against group-underdogs new zealand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smeltz and the kiwis were more than happy with a draw against italy the all whites surprised italy by taking the lead in the 7th minute .
italian captain fabio cannavaro failed to clear a free kick , which left new zealand 's shane smeltz free to tap in the goal . the kiwi 's dreams of an upset win over the world cup title holders did n't last long , though .
italy was awarded a penalty kick in the 29th minute when daniele de rossi fell in a tussle with new zealand 's tommy smith in the box .
the ref showed smith a yellow card and pointed to the penalty spot .
vincenzo iaquinta took the kick to pull italy even with new zealand . although italy had the advantage for more or less the rest of the game , they failed to create scoring opportunities and are now level with new zealand on points in group f. paraguay takes the lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paraguay is in a good position at the top of the group by only managing a draw against new zealand , italy faces some pressure heading into their last group match against slovakia .
a win would secure a spot in the round of 16 , but a draw could leave them exposed to being bounced should new zealand continue to surprise and come up with a win or a high-scoring draw against paraguay . the south american team , however , looked strong in their 2-0 win against slovakia that sent them to the top of the group . enrique vera opened the scoring for paraguay in the 27th minute , taking a precise pass from lucas barrios and slipping a shot through two defenders and into the goal .
toward the end of the game , paraguay added its second goal for good measure as cristian riveros cleaned up a loose ball on the edge of the box and booted it past slovakian keeper jan mucha .
slovakia only had one shot on goal the entire game , and their best chance to score came in the 37th minute when defender kornel salata headed a corner over the goal .

former prime minister dominique de villepin has created a new center-right party called republique solidaire .
villepin aims to capitalize on sarkozy 's current poor poll ratings .
sarkozy 's re-election has until now been regarded as a near-certainty , but a republique solidaire candidacy in the 2012 ballot could split the conservative vote .
launching the party speaking to a crowd of an estimated 3,000 supporters , villepin criticized " an ever-growing gap between words and acts , between what french people go through and what their leaders experience . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former prime minister was cleared of slander charges in january the former diplomat has been one of sarkozy 's strongest critics in the conservative camp .
he was prime minister under president jacques chirac and was known to have a tense relationship with sarkozy , who served as his interior minister .
villepin was a member of sarkozy 's ump party , but broke away after a bitter row . last year , villepin went on trial for allegedly taking part in a smear campaign to ruin sarkozy 's presidential bid , but was cleared of all charges .
splitting the vote polls show villepin would pick up no more than 7 or 8 percent of the vote in 2012 , but his personal approval ratings stand at 49 percent .
sarkozy 's rating has dropped in recent months to around 33 percent .
a presidential candidacy from villepin could split the right - at a time when the far-right in france is also challenging sarkozy .
marine le pen , vice president of the far right national front , said she was " very happy " about the prospect of villepin running in 2012 , as it could weaken sarkozy .
the head of the international monetary fund , dominique strauss-kahn , is also being touted as a candidate and is widely viewed as a favorite to head the socialist party ticket for 2012 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the heat is on : climate change and the media environmental journalists face political , physical threats worldwide global media forum tackles ' greatest challenge of the 21st century ' global media forum ends by urging people to learn to live with less a million trees and counting - german boy activist fights climate change media -pipe- 20.06.2010 journalists should not forget climate change , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : himalayan glaciers are melting slower than originally thought , but now media interest may be drying up a british study shows journalists are overlooking the issue of global warming in favor of more sensational stories , an issue that will be discussed at this year 's deutsche welle global media forum . it 's been a difficult few months for the intergovernmental panel on climate change , one of the foremost bodies charged with evaluating the risk climate change .
since the unearthing of an embarrassing error in the most recent ipcc report - the statement that the himalayan glaciers might be gone by 2035 - the hunt for further ipcc blunders has been on , drawing in scientists , bloggers and journalists from all over the world .
yet some experts argue that , the occasional scandal aside , climate change is a subject that receives relatively little media attention .
three years ago , dortmund university professor of journalism holger wormer described climate change as a " shooting star " topic for the media .
at the time , he and others in the scientific and journalistic communities had big ideas about the role the media could play in the struggle against global warming .
falling by the wayside bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental disasters could be drawing media attention away from climate change today , according to wormer , climate change is a topic that has fallen from editorial grace .
" we now have a lot of other things on our agenda , things that are developing and that have more impact than they did three years ago , for example the financial crisis , " he said .
" these things have pushed reporting on climate change into the background . "
wormer said that with other , more pressing environmental stories on the table - the gulf of mexico oil spill , or , in germany , recurring discussions over nuclear energy - the " slow and steady " threat of climate change has been pushed to the side and is now a topic that appears more often in the context of wider environmental or political coverage .
" i think we started a bit too late with serious reporting on the topic .
the reporting increased significantly only when there was more interest in climate change in the political agenda , " he said .
wormer 's concern appears to be backed up by the numbers .
last year , researchers from the university of liverpool in the uk released the results of an exhaustive study of climate change coverage in british newspapers .

what 's more , the liverpool researchers found that in some newspapers , a significant amount of what little coverage appeared was focused on skeptical reporting .

hedegaard , herself a former television journalist , said while it would be wrong for the media to ignore climate skepticism altogether , it is also wrong to uncritically accept skepticism in the name of balance .

since the unearthing of an embarrassing error in the most recent ipcc report - the statement that the himalayan glaciers might be gone by 2035 - the hunt for further ipcc blunders has been on , drawing in scientists , bloggers and journalists from all over the world .
yet some experts argue that , the occasional scandal aside , climate change is a subject that receives relatively little media attention .
three years ago , dortmund university professor of journalism holger wormer described climate change as a " shooting star " topic for the media .
at the time , he and others in the scientific and journalistic communities had big ideas about the role the media could play in the struggle against global warming .
falling by the wayside bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental disasters could be drawing media attention away from climate change today , according to wormer , climate change is a topic that has fallen from editorial grace .
" we now have a lot of other things on our agenda , things that are developing and that have more impact than they did three years ago , for example the financial crisis , " he said .
" these things have pushed reporting on climate change into the background . "
wormer said that with other , more pressing environmental stories on the table - the gulf of mexico oil spill , or , in germany , recurring discussions over nuclear energy - the " slow and steady " threat of climate change has been pushed to the side and is now a topic that appears more often in the context of wider environmental or political coverage .
" i think we started a bit too late with serious reporting on the topic .
the reporting increased significantly only when there was more interest in climate change in the political agenda , " he said .
wormer 's concern appears to be backed up by the numbers .
last year , researchers from the university of liverpool in the uk released the results of an exhaustive study of climate change coverage in british newspapers .
they found that between 2000 and 2006 , the number of articles addressing climate change was modest : coverage peaked at around 100 articles per month .

since the unearthing of an embarrassing error in the most recent ipcc report - the statement that the himalayan glaciers might be gone by 2035 - the hunt for further ipcc blunders has been on , drawing in scientists , bloggers and journalists from all over the world .
yet some experts argue that , the occasional scandal aside , climate change is a subject that receives relatively little media attention .
three years ago , dortmund university professor of journalism holger wormer described climate change as a " shooting star " topic for the media .
at the time , he and others in the scientific and journalistic communities had big ideas about the role the media could play in the struggle against global warming .
falling by the wayside bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental disasters could be drawing media attention away from climate change today , according to wormer , climate change is a topic that has fallen from editorial grace .
" we now have a lot of other things on our agenda , things that are developing and that have more impact than they did three years ago , for example the financial crisis , " he said .
" these things have pushed reporting on climate change into the background . "
wormer said that with other , more pressing environmental stories on the table - the gulf of mexico oil spill , or , in germany , recurring discussions over nuclear energy - the " slow and steady " threat of climate change has been pushed to the side and is now a topic that appears more often in the context of wider environmental or political coverage .
" i think we started a bit too late with serious reporting on the topic .
the reporting increased significantly only when there was more interest in climate change in the political agenda , " he said .
wormer 's concern appears to be backed up by the numbers .
last year , researchers from the university of liverpool in the uk released the results of an exhaustive study of climate change coverage in british newspapers .
they found that between 2000 and 2006 , the number of articles addressing climate change was modest : coverage peaked at around 100 articles per month .
" just to give you a comparison , the number of stories on health or crime were at about 400 to 500 stories per month the whole way through the period , " said neil gavin , a senior lecturer in politics at the university of liverpool and lead researcher of the study .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stories on emissions trading schemes are relegated to the business pages big topics still ' niche ' gavin , who has written and researched extensively on the relationship between climate change and the media , said even fewer journalists were attempting to tackle climate change-related topics like emissions trading schemes -lrb- etss -rrb- , the market-based approach to controlling pollution that provides big emitters with economic incentives to reduce polluting emissions , or peak oil , the point at which global petroleum discovery will peak , after which production will go into permanent decline .
when these terms do appear in newspapers , he said , they tend to be treated as niche topics , appearing in the business pages rather than in the news section of papers .
this has implications for accountability , he said .
in the european union , a major ets has been in place since 2005 and has already entered into its second phase , but gavin said his research recorded only around 20 mentions of the scheme between 2000 and 2006 .
" where is the accountability of the european union ?
what kind of corners -lsb- could be -rsb- being cut in phase two and three ? "
what 's more , the liverpool researchers found that in some newspapers , a significant amount of what little coverage appeared was focused on skeptical reporting .
" in the top-selling newspapers like the telegraph , daily mail , the sun and their sunday sister papers , 25 percent of the coverage ran along climate skeptic lines , " said gavin .
wormer said that despite recent revelations of mistakes in the ipcc reports , there is n't necessarily any reason for journalists to give more attention to climate skepticism .
" we should also be aware of the huge amount of pressure , the lobbying and the pr that goes into trying to -lsb- create -rsb- doubts over the science , " he said , citing the similar levels of pressure and skepticism in the last century over whether cigarettes posed a health hazard .
' keep it simple ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hedegaard says journalists can help by sticking to the facts connie hedegaard , the eu commissioner for climate action and the former danish minister for climate and energy , said the role journalists can play in helping to tackle climate change is a simple one .
" i think the media could help a lot by simply communicating the facts , " she said .
" and take care that when you have one or two errors in a huge report done by thousands of scientists not to communicate the message as if one or two errors would change the whole finding of the -lsb- report -rsb- .
i think it 's very important here to get the proportions right . "
hedegaard , herself a former television journalist , said while it would be wrong for the media to ignore climate skepticism altogether , it is also wrong to uncritically accept skepticism in the name of balance .
" the easiest thing in the world is to invite a guest who says that the planet is flat , and somebody who says , no , it 's round .
and the reporter 's job there is not just to hold the microphone and say , ' ok , a says it 's flat , the other one says it 's round , " ' she said .
" it is sometimes also -lsb- necessary -rsb- to be equipped to say something is factual , something is right and something is wrong ; " she said . " that is not being biased ; that 's just to help the listeners , the viewers and the readers to orient themselves in a jungle of information . "

anelka was booted after cursing out coach raymond domenech , and it was domenech who was left to meet the press to explain . the wheels are continuing to fall off in the french world cup camp in south africa .
on sunday , the squad pulled out from its scheduled training session in protest against striker nicolas anelka 's expulsion .
a day earlier , the french football federation -lrb- fff -rrb- announced that anelka had been booted off the team for comments he made to the team 's coach during france 's 2-0 loss to mexico . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there wo n't be any more action for anelka in this world cup the french players were unanimously against the fff 's decision to remove anelka , claiming that the dispute between the player and coach raymond domenech had been made in the privacy of the locker room and should have never reached the press .
" we regret the incident at half-time of the france versus mexico match , " the teams ' players said in a statement , " but we regret even more the divulging of an event which was only the squad 's business and was part and parcel of the life of a top-level team . " the statement was read out loud to the media by coach raymond domenech and followed a near-scuffle on the training pitch between team captain patrice evra and robert duverne , a fitness coach on the team .
duverne had reportedly insisted that the players go ahead with the practice . the players ' decision to call off their practice also caused the team 's director , jean-louis valentin , to resign in disgust . picked up by the press according to media reports , anelka crudely insulted domenech coming off the pitch at halftime in france 's group game against mexico .

the chelsea forward denied cursing at domenech as suggested by l 'equipe but did admit to a ' heated conversation ' with his coach .
on saturday , anelka was asked by fff president jean-pierre escalettes to issue a public apology for his remarks .
when anelka refused , the decision was made to send him home .
support from teammates french captain patrice evra had sympathy for his departed teammate , saying anelka was n't the problem on the french squad .

" there 's somebody in our group that wants to harm the france team . "
bayern munich star franck ribery appeared in tears live on french television as he discussed anelka 's expulsion and problems with the french team , appealing to the french people to forgive the team for their poor showing so far in the world cup .

on sunday , the squad pulled out from its scheduled training session in protest against striker nicolas anelka 's expulsion .
a day earlier , the french football federation -lrb- fff -rrb- announced that anelka had been booted off the team for comments he made to the team 's coach during france 's 2-0 loss to mexico . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there wo n't be any more action for anelka in this world cup the french players were unanimously against the fff 's decision to remove anelka , claiming that the dispute between the player and coach raymond domenech had been made in the privacy of the locker room and should have never reached the press .
" we regret the incident at half-time of the france versus mexico match , " the teams ' players said in a statement , " but we regret even more the divulging of an event which was only the squad 's business and was part and parcel of the life of a top-level team . " the statement was read out loud to the media by coach raymond domenech and followed a near-scuffle on the training pitch between team captain patrice evra and robert duverne , a fitness coach on the team .
duverne had reportedly insisted that the players go ahead with the practice . the players ' decision to call off their practice also caused the team 's director , jean-louis valentin , to resign in disgust . picked up by the press according to media reports , anelka crudely insulted domenech coming off the pitch at halftime in france 's group game against mexico .
domenech had reportedly criticized anelka 's performance on pitch .
anelka was subbed for the second half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anelka was not quoted warmly by l 'equipe french sports newspaper l 'equipe printed anelka 's alleged comments on the front page of saturday 's edition .
the chelsea forward denied cursing at domenech as suggested by l 'equipe but did admit to a ' heated conversation ' with his coach .
on saturday , anelka was asked by fff president jean-pierre escalettes to issue a public apology for his remarks .
when anelka refused , the decision was made to send him home .
support from teammates french captain patrice evra had sympathy for his departed teammate , saying anelka was n't the problem on the french squad .
" the problem is the traitor among us who told the press what was said , " eyra said .
" there 's somebody in our group that wants to harm the france team . "
bayern munich star franck ribery appeared in tears live on french television as he discussed anelka 's expulsion and problems with the french team , appealing to the french people to forgive the team for their poor showing so far in the world cup .
france go into their final group game against south africa with their backs up against the wall .
they opened the tournament with a lackluster 0-0 draw against uruguay , and after thursday 's loss to mexico , have only a glimmer of hope of advancing to the knock-out stage .
france must win its game against south africa on tuesday and hope that the game between uruguay and mexico does n't end in a draw .
even then , france would only advance if it had a superior goal difference to that game 's loser .

"
niebel had planned to inspect a german-financed sewage plant in the hamas-controlled area and meet representatives of the united nations relief and works agency for palestine refugees .
" i had hoped that this could have been a clear political signal for an opening and for transparency , " niebel said in a separate interview on public german broadcaster zdf .
" sometimes the israeli government does not make it easy for its friends to explain why it behaves in the way it does . "
german politicians criticize decision german foreign minister guido westerwelle said he regretted israel 's decision , adding that the german government continued to support an end to the israel 's blockade of gaza .

islamist group hamas took power in gaza in 2007 , after which israel imposed a blockade on the small but densely populated coastal region .
israel said this week that it was easing a land blockade of the gaza strip after a storm of international criticism following its raid on an aid flotilla bound for the hamas-run palestinian territory killed nine activists .
israel faced intensified international calls to relax or lift its gaza embargo .
ruprecht polenz , a member of parliament of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party and chairman of the foreign affairs committee told newspaper tagesspiegel there was no " political reason " for israel 's decision . " the israeli government is damaging the credibility of its new politics , " gernot erler , deputy head of the social democratic party 's parliamentary group told newspaper waz .
he added that he could n't see how the denial to visit the gaza strip fit with the government 's decision to ease the gaza blockade . " five to twelve " referring to the loosening of the blockade that the israeli government recently announced , niebel said , " if the israeli government expects support for its new gaza strategy , it must first of all ensure more transparency and for a new partnership . "
he said the blockade , which is aimed at preventing hamas members in the gaza strip from obtaining weapons and materials to build rockets which are fired over the border into israel , was not a sign of strength .
rather , he said , it was , " proof of unspoken fear . "
niebel urged the israeli government not to let the clock run out on the remaining opportunity for peace talks .
" it is five to twelve for israel , " he said .
israel defends decision israeli foreign ministry spokesman yigal palmor said the move was part of israel 's long-standing policy on gaza .
" we do not allow senior politicians into gaza because hamas will manipulate such visits to gain legitimacy , " said palmor on sunday , niebel met with palestinian president mahmud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad and attended a ceremony marking the start of construction on a water purification plant in nablus in the west bank .

niebel had planned to inspect a german-financed sewage plant in the hamas-controlled area and meet representatives of the united nations relief and works agency for palestine refugees .
" i had hoped that this could have been a clear political signal for an opening and for transparency , " niebel said in a separate interview on public german broadcaster zdf .

islamist group hamas took power in gaza in 2007 , after which israel imposed a blockade on the small but densely populated coastal region .
israel said this week that it was easing a land blockade of the gaza strip after a storm of international criticism following its raid on an aid flotilla bound for the hamas-run palestinian territory killed nine activists .
israel faced intensified international calls to relax or lift its gaza embargo .
ruprecht polenz , a member of parliament of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party and chairman of the foreign affairs committee told newspaper tagesspiegel there was no " political reason " for israel 's decision . " the israeli government is damaging the credibility of its new politics , " gernot erler , deputy head of the social democratic party 's parliamentary group told newspaper waz .
he added that he could n't see how the denial to visit the gaza strip fit with the government 's decision to ease the gaza blockade . " five to twelve " referring to the loosening of the blockade that the israeli government recently announced , niebel said , " if the israeli government expects support for its new gaza strategy , it must first of all ensure more transparency and for a new partnership . "
he said the blockade , which is aimed at preventing hamas members in the gaza strip from obtaining weapons and materials to build rockets which are fired over the border into israel , was not a sign of strength .
rather , he said , it was , " proof of unspoken fear . "
niebel urged the israeli government not to let the clock run out on the remaining opportunity for peace talks .
" it is five to twelve for israel , " he said .
israel defends decision israeli foreign ministry spokesman yigal palmor said the move was part of israel 's long-standing policy on gaza .
" we do not allow senior politicians into gaza because hamas will manipulate such visits to gain legitimacy , " said palmor on sunday , niebel met with palestinian president mahmud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad and attended a ceremony marking the start of construction on a water purification plant in nablus in the west bank .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the heat is on : climate change and the media environmental journalists face political , physical threats worldwide global media forum tackles ' greatest challenge of the 21st century ' global media forum ends by urging people to learn to live with less a million trees and counting - german boy activist fights climate change media -pipe- 20.06.2010 journalists should not forget climate change , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : himalayan glaciers are melting slower than originally thought , but now media interest may be drying up a british study shows journalists are overlooking the issue of global warming in favor of more sensational stories , an issue that will be discussed at this year 's deutsche welle global media forum . it 's been a difficult few months for the intergovernmental panel on climate change , one of the foremost bodies charged with evaluating the risk climate change .
since the unearthing of an embarrassing error in the most recent ipcc report - the statement that the himalayan glaciers might be gone by 2035 - the hunt for further ipcc blunders has been on , drawing in scientists , bloggers and journalists from all over the world .
yet some experts argue that , the occasional scandal aside , climate change is a subject that receives relatively little media attention .
three years ago , dortmund university professor of journalism holger wormer described climate change as a " shooting star " topic for the media .
at the time , he and others in the scientific and journalistic communities had big ideas about the role the media could play in the struggle against global warming .
falling by the wayside bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental disasters could be drawing media attention away from climate change today , according to wormer , climate change is a topic that has fallen from editorial grace .
" we now have a lot of other things on our agenda , things that are developing and that have more impact than they did three years ago , for example the financial crisis , " he said .
" these things have pushed reporting on climate change into the background . "
wormer said that with other , more pressing environmental stories on the table - the gulf of mexico oil spill , or , in germany , recurring discussions over nuclear energy - the " slow and steady " threat of climate change has been pushed to the side and is now a topic that appears more often in the context of wider environmental or political coverage .
" i think we started a bit too late with serious reporting on the topic .
the reporting increased significantly only when there was more interest in climate change in the political agenda , " he said .
wormer 's concern appears to be backed up by the numbers .
last year , researchers from the university of liverpool in the uk released the results of an exhaustive study of climate change coverage in british newspapers .
they found that between 2000 and 2006 , the number of articles addressing climate change was modest : coverage peaked at around 100 articles per month .
" just to give you a comparison , the number of stories on health or crime were at about 400 to 500 stories per month the whole way through the period , " said neil gavin , a senior lecturer in politics at the university of liverpool and lead researcher of the study .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stories on emissions trading schemes are relegated to the business pages big topics still ' niche ' gavin , who has written and researched extensively on the relationship between climate change and the media , said even fewer journalists were attempting to tackle climate change-related topics like emissions trading schemes -lrb- etss -rrb- , the market-based approach to controlling pollution that provides big emitters with economic incentives to reduce polluting emissions , or peak oil , the point at which global petroleum discovery will peak , after which production will go into permanent decline .
when these terms do appear in newspapers , he said , they tend to be treated as niche topics , appearing in the business pages rather than in the news section of papers .
this has implications for accountability , he said .
in the european union , a major ets has been in place since 2005 and has already entered into its second phase , but gavin said his research recorded only around 20 mentions of the scheme between 2000 and 2006 .
" where is the accountability of the european union ?
what kind of corners -lsb- could be -rsb- being cut in phase two and three ? "
what 's more , the liverpool researchers found that in some newspapers , a significant amount of what little coverage appeared was focused on skeptical reporting .
" in the top-selling newspapers like the telegraph , daily mail , the sun and their sunday sister papers , 25 percent of the coverage ran along climate skeptic lines , " said gavin .
wormer said that despite recent revelations of mistakes in the ipcc reports , there is n't necessarily any reason for journalists to give more attention to climate skepticism .
" we should also be aware of the huge amount of pressure , the lobbying and the pr that goes into trying to -lsb- create -rsb- doubts over the science , " he said , citing the similar levels of pressure and skepticism in the last century over whether cigarettes posed a health hazard .
' keep it simple ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hedegaard says journalists can help by sticking to the facts connie hedegaard , the eu commissioner for climate action and the former danish minister for climate and energy , said the role journalists can play in helping to tackle climate change is a simple one .
" i think the media could help a lot by simply communicating the facts , " she said .
" and take care that when you have one or two errors in a huge report done by thousands of scientists not to communicate the message as if one or two errors would change the whole finding of the -lsb- report -rsb- .
i think it 's very important here to get the proportions right . "
hedegaard , herself a former television journalist , said while it would be wrong for the media to ignore climate skepticism altogether , it is also wrong to uncritically accept skepticism in the name of balance .
" the easiest thing in the world is to invite a guest who says that the planet is flat , and somebody who says , no , it 's round .
and the reporter 's job there is not just to hold the microphone and say , ' ok , a says it 's flat , the other one says it 's round , " ' she said .
" it is sometimes also -lsb- necessary -rsb- to be equipped to say something is factual , something is right and something is wrong ; " she said . " that is not being biased ; that 's just to help the listeners , the viewers and the readers to orient themselves in a jungle of information . "

islamist group hamas took power in gaza in 2007 , after which israel imposed a blockade on the small but densely populated coastal region .
israel said this week that it was easing a land blockade of the gaza strip after a storm of international criticism following its raid on an aid flotilla bound for the hamas-run palestinian territory killed nine activists .
israel faced intensified international calls to relax or lift its gaza embargo .
ruprecht polenz , a member of parliament of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party and chairman of the foreign affairs committee told newspaper tagesspiegel there was no " political reason " for israel 's decision . " the israeli government is damaging the credibility of its new politics , " gernot erler , deputy head of the social democratic party 's parliamentary group told newspaper waz .
he added that he could n't see how the denial to visit the gaza strip fit with the government 's decision to ease the gaza blockade . " five to twelve " referring to the loosening of the blockade that the israeli government recently announced , niebel said , " if the israeli government expects support for its new gaza strategy , it must first of all ensure more transparency and for a new partnership . "
he said the blockade , which is aimed at preventing hamas members in the gaza strip from obtaining weapons and materials to build rockets which are fired over the border into israel , was not a sign of strength .
rather , he said , it was , " proof of unspoken fear . "
niebel urged the israeli government not to let the clock run out on the remaining opportunity for peace talks .
" it is five to twelve for israel , " he said .
israel defends decision israeli foreign ministry spokesman yigal palmor said the move was part of israel 's long-standing policy on gaza .

"
niebel had planned to inspect a german-financed sewage plant in the hamas-controlled area and meet representatives of the united nations relief and works agency for palestine refugees .
" i had hoped that this could have been a clear political signal for an opening and for transparency , " niebel said in a separate interview on public german broadcaster zdf .
" sometimes the israeli government does not make it easy for its friends to explain why it behaves in the way it does . "
german politicians criticize decision german foreign minister guido westerwelle said he regretted israel 's decision , adding that the german government continued to support an end to the israel 's blockade of gaza .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebel had planned to inspect a german-financed sewage plant " this is not only the stance of germany but also the stance of our partners in the european union , " westerwelle said .
islamist group hamas took power in gaza in 2007 , after which israel imposed a blockade on the small but densely populated coastal region .
israel said this week that it was easing a land blockade of the gaza strip after a storm of international criticism following its raid on an aid flotilla bound for the hamas-run palestinian territory killed nine activists .
israel faced intensified international calls to relax or lift its gaza embargo .
ruprecht polenz , a member of parliament of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party and chairman of the foreign affairs committee told newspaper tagesspiegel there was no " political reason " for israel 's decision . " the israeli government is damaging the credibility of its new politics , " gernot erler , deputy head of the social democratic party 's parliamentary group told newspaper waz .
he added that he could n't see how the denial to visit the gaza strip fit with the government 's decision to ease the gaza blockade . " five to twelve " referring to the loosening of the blockade that the israeli government recently announced , niebel said , " if the israeli government expects support for its new gaza strategy , it must first of all ensure more transparency and for a new partnership . "
he said the blockade , which is aimed at preventing hamas members in the gaza strip from obtaining weapons and materials to build rockets which are fired over the border into israel , was not a sign of strength .
rather , he said , it was , " proof of unspoken fear . "
niebel urged the israeli government not to let the clock run out on the remaining opportunity for peace talks .
" it is five to twelve for israel , " he said .
israel defends decision israeli foreign ministry spokesman yigal palmor said the move was part of israel 's long-standing policy on gaza .
" we do not allow senior politicians into gaza because hamas will manipulate such visits to gain legitimacy , " said palmor on sunday , niebel met with palestinian president mahmud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad and attended a ceremony marking the start of construction on a water purification plant in nablus in the west bank .
reports say the german government has promised 42.5 million euros for development cooperation in the palestinian territories in 2010 . niebel is to meet israeli officials in jerusalem on monday and tuesday . author : matt zuvela -lrb- afp / dpa -rrb- editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

since the unearthing of an embarrassing error in the most recent ipcc report - the statement that the himalayan glaciers might be gone by 2035 - the hunt for further ipcc blunders has been on , drawing in scientists , bloggers and journalists from all over the world .
yet some experts argue that , the occasional scandal aside , climate change is a subject that receives relatively little media attention .
three years ago , dortmund university professor of journalism holger wormer described climate change as a " shooting star " topic for the media .
at the time , he and others in the scientific and journalistic communities had big ideas about the role the media could play in the struggle against global warming .
falling by the wayside bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental disasters could be drawing media attention away from climate change today , according to wormer , climate change is a topic that has fallen from editorial grace .
" we now have a lot of other things on our agenda , things that are developing and that have more impact than they did three years ago , for example the financial crisis , " he said .
" these things have pushed reporting on climate change into the background . "
wormer said that with other , more pressing environmental stories on the table - the gulf of mexico oil spill , or , in germany , recurring discussions over nuclear energy - the " slow and steady " threat of climate change has been pushed to the side and is now a topic that appears more often in the context of wider environmental or political coverage .
" i think we started a bit too late with serious reporting on the topic .
the reporting increased significantly only when there was more interest in climate change in the political agenda , " he said .
wormer 's concern appears to be backed up by the numbers .
last year , researchers from the university of liverpool in the uk released the results of an exhaustive study of climate change coverage in british newspapers .
they found that between 2000 and 2006 , the number of articles addressing climate change was modest : coverage peaked at around 100 articles per month .
" just to give you a comparison , the number of stories on health or crime were at about 400 to 500 stories per month the whole way through the period , " said neil gavin , a senior lecturer in politics at the university of liverpool and lead researcher of the study .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stories on emissions trading schemes are relegated to the business pages big topics still ' niche ' gavin , who has written and researched extensively on the relationship between climate change and the media , said even fewer journalists were attempting to tackle climate change-related topics like emissions trading schemes -lrb- etss -rrb- , the market-based approach to controlling pollution that provides big emitters with economic incentives to reduce polluting emissions , or peak oil , the point at which global petroleum discovery will peak , after which production will go into permanent decline .
when these terms do appear in newspapers , he said , they tend to be treated as niche topics , appearing in the business pages rather than in the news section of papers .
this has implications for accountability , he said .
in the european union , a major ets has been in place since 2005 and has already entered into its second phase , but gavin said his research recorded only around 20 mentions of the scheme between 2000 and 2006 .
" where is the accountability of the european union ?
what kind of corners -lsb- could be -rsb- being cut in phase two and three ? "
what 's more , the liverpool researchers found that in some newspapers , a significant amount of what little coverage appeared was focused on skeptical reporting .
" in the top-selling newspapers like the telegraph , daily mail , the sun and their sunday sister papers , 25 percent of the coverage ran along climate skeptic lines , " said gavin .
wormer said that despite recent revelations of mistakes in the ipcc reports , there is n't necessarily any reason for journalists to give more attention to climate skepticism .
" we should also be aware of the huge amount of pressure , the lobbying and the pr that goes into trying to -lsb- create -rsb- doubts over the science , " he said , citing the similar levels of pressure and skepticism in the last century over whether cigarettes posed a health hazard .
' keep it simple ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hedegaard says journalists can help by sticking to the facts connie hedegaard , the eu commissioner for climate action and the former danish minister for climate and energy , said the role journalists can play in helping to tackle climate change is a simple one .
" i think the media could help a lot by simply communicating the facts , " she said .
" and take care that when you have one or two errors in a huge report done by thousands of scientists not to communicate the message as if one or two errors would change the whole finding of the -lsb- report -rsb- .
i think it 's very important here to get the proportions right . "
hedegaard , herself a former television journalist , said while it would be wrong for the media to ignore climate skepticism altogether , it is also wrong to uncritically accept skepticism in the name of balance .
" the easiest thing in the world is to invite a guest who says that the planet is flat , and somebody who says , no , it 's round .
and the reporter 's job there is not just to hold the microphone and say , ' ok , a says it 's flat , the other one says it 's round , " ' she said .
" it is sometimes also -lsb- necessary -rsb- to be equipped to say something is factual , something is right and something is wrong ; " she said . " that is not being biased ; that 's just to help the listeners , the viewers and the readers to orient themselves in a jungle of information . "

since the unearthing of an embarrassing error in the most recent ipcc report - the statement that the himalayan glaciers might be gone by 2035 - the hunt for further ipcc blunders has been on , drawing in scientists , bloggers and journalists from all over the world .
yet some experts argue that , the occasional scandal aside , climate change is a subject that receives relatively little media attention .
three years ago , dortmund university professor of journalism holger wormer described climate change as a " shooting star " topic for the media .
at the time , he and others in the scientific and journalistic communities had big ideas about the role the media could play in the struggle against global warming .

anelka was booted after cursing out coach raymond domenech , and it was domenech who was left to meet the press to explain . the wheels are continuing to fall off in the french world cup camp in south africa .
on sunday , the squad pulled out from its scheduled training session in protest against striker nicolas anelka 's expulsion .
a day earlier , the french football federation -lrb- fff -rrb- announced that anelka had been booted off the team for comments he made to the team 's coach during france 's 2-0 loss to mexico . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there wo n't be any more action for anelka in this world cup the french players were unanimously against the fff 's decision to remove anelka , claiming that the dispute between the player and coach raymond domenech had been made in the privacy of the locker room and should have never reached the press .
" we regret the incident at half-time of the france versus mexico match , " the teams ' players said in a statement , " but we regret even more the divulging of an event which was only the squad 's business and was part and parcel of the life of a top-level team . " the statement was read out loud to the media by coach raymond domenech and followed a near-scuffle on the training pitch between team captain patrice evra and robert duverne , a fitness coach on the team .
duverne had reportedly insisted that the players go ahead with the practice . the players ' decision to call off their practice also caused the team 's director , jean-louis valentin , to resign in disgust . picked up by the press according to media reports , anelka crudely insulted domenech coming off the pitch at halftime in france 's group game against mexico .
domenech had reportedly criticized anelka 's performance on pitch .
anelka was subbed for the second half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anelka was not quoted warmly by l 'equipe french sports newspaper l 'equipe printed anelka 's alleged comments on the front page of saturday 's edition .
the chelsea forward denied cursing at domenech as suggested by l 'equipe but did admit to a ' heated conversation ' with his coach .
on saturday , anelka was asked by fff president jean-pierre escalettes to issue a public apology for his remarks .
when anelka refused , the decision was made to send him home .
support from teammates french captain patrice evra had sympathy for his departed teammate , saying anelka was n't the problem on the french squad .
" the problem is the traitor among us who told the press what was said , " eyra said .
" there 's somebody in our group that wants to harm the france team . "
bayern munich star franck ribery appeared in tears live on french television as he discussed anelka 's expulsion and problems with the french team , appealing to the french people to forgive the team for their poor showing so far in the world cup .
france go into their final group game against south africa with their backs up against the wall .
they opened the tournament with a lackluster 0-0 draw against uruguay , and after thursday 's loss to mexico , have only a glimmer of hope of advancing to the knock-out stage .
france must win its game against south africa on tuesday and hope that the game between uruguay and mexico does n't end in a draw .
even then , france would only advance if it had a superior goal difference to that game 's loser .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the heat is on : climate change and the media environmental journalists face political , physical threats worldwide global media forum tackles ' greatest challenge of the 21st century ' global media forum ends by urging people to learn to live with less a million trees and counting - german boy activist fights climate change media -pipe- 20.06.2010 journalists should not forget climate change , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : himalayan glaciers are melting slower than originally thought , but now media interest may be drying up a british study shows journalists are overlooking the issue of global warming in favor of more sensational stories , an issue that will be discussed at this year 's deutsche welle global media forum . it 's been a difficult few months for the intergovernmental panel on climate change , one of the foremost bodies charged with evaluating the risk climate change .
since the unearthing of an embarrassing error in the most recent ipcc report - the statement that the himalayan glaciers might be gone by 2035 - the hunt for further ipcc blunders has been on , drawing in scientists , bloggers and journalists from all over the world .
yet some experts argue that , the occasional scandal aside , climate change is a subject that receives relatively little media attention .
three years ago , dortmund university professor of journalism holger wormer described climate change as a " shooting star " topic for the media .
at the time , he and others in the scientific and journalistic communities had big ideas about the role the media could play in the struggle against global warming .
falling by the wayside bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental disasters could be drawing media attention away from climate change today , according to wormer , climate change is a topic that has fallen from editorial grace .
" we now have a lot of other things on our agenda , things that are developing and that have more impact than they did three years ago , for example the financial crisis , " he said .
" these things have pushed reporting on climate change into the background . "
wormer said that with other , more pressing environmental stories on the table - the gulf of mexico oil spill , or , in germany , recurring discussions over nuclear energy - the " slow and steady " threat of climate change has been pushed to the side and is now a topic that appears more often in the context of wider environmental or political coverage .
" i think we started a bit too late with serious reporting on the topic .
the reporting increased significantly only when there was more interest in climate change in the political agenda , " he said .
wormer 's concern appears to be backed up by the numbers .
last year , researchers from the university of liverpool in the uk released the results of an exhaustive study of climate change coverage in british newspapers .
they found that between 2000 and 2006 , the number of articles addressing climate change was modest : coverage peaked at around 100 articles per month .
" just to give you a comparison , the number of stories on health or crime were at about 400 to 500 stories per month the whole way through the period , " said neil gavin , a senior lecturer in politics at the university of liverpool and lead researcher of the study .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stories on emissions trading schemes are relegated to the business pages big topics still ' niche ' gavin , who has written and researched extensively on the relationship between climate change and the media , said even fewer journalists were attempting to tackle climate change-related topics like emissions trading schemes -lrb- etss -rrb- , the market-based approach to controlling pollution that provides big emitters with economic incentives to reduce polluting emissions , or peak oil , the point at which global petroleum discovery will peak , after which production will go into permanent decline .
when these terms do appear in newspapers , he said , they tend to be treated as niche topics , appearing in the business pages rather than in the news section of papers .
this has implications for accountability , he said .
in the european union , a major ets has been in place since 2005 and has already entered into its second phase , but gavin said his research recorded only around 20 mentions of the scheme between 2000 and 2006 .
" where is the accountability of the european union ?
what kind of corners -lsb- could be -rsb- being cut in phase two and three ? "
what 's more , the liverpool researchers found that in some newspapers , a significant amount of what little coverage appeared was focused on skeptical reporting .
" in the top-selling newspapers like the telegraph , daily mail , the sun and their sunday sister papers , 25 percent of the coverage ran along climate skeptic lines , " said gavin .
wormer said that despite recent revelations of mistakes in the ipcc reports , there is n't necessarily any reason for journalists to give more attention to climate skepticism .
" we should also be aware of the huge amount of pressure , the lobbying and the pr that goes into trying to -lsb- create -rsb- doubts over the science , " he said , citing the similar levels of pressure and skepticism in the last century over whether cigarettes posed a health hazard .
' keep it simple ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hedegaard says journalists can help by sticking to the facts connie hedegaard , the eu commissioner for climate action and the former danish minister for climate and energy , said the role journalists can play in helping to tackle climate change is a simple one .
" i think the media could help a lot by simply communicating the facts , " she said .
" and take care that when you have one or two errors in a huge report done by thousands of scientists not to communicate the message as if one or two errors would change the whole finding of the -lsb- report -rsb- .
i think it 's very important here to get the proportions right . "
hedegaard , herself a former television journalist , said while it would be wrong for the media to ignore climate skepticism altogether , it is also wrong to uncritically accept skepticism in the name of balance .
" the easiest thing in the world is to invite a guest who says that the planet is flat , and somebody who says , no , it 's round .
and the reporter 's job there is not just to hold the microphone and say , ' ok , a says it 's flat , the other one says it 's round , " ' she said .
" it is sometimes also -lsb- necessary -rsb- to be equipped to say something is factual , something is right and something is wrong ; " she said . " that is not being biased ; that 's just to help the listeners , the viewers and the readers to orient themselves in a jungle of information . "

a day earlier , the french football federation -lrb- fff -rrb- announced that anelka had been booted off the team for comments he made to the team 's coach during france 's 2-0 loss to mexico . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there wo n't be any more action for anelka in this world cup the french players were unanimously against the fff 's decision to remove anelka , claiming that the dispute between the player and coach raymond domenech had been made in the privacy of the locker room and should have never reached the press .
" we regret the incident at half-time of the france versus mexico match , " the teams ' players said in a statement , " but we regret even more the divulging of an event which was only the squad 's business and was part and parcel of the life of a top-level team . " the statement was read out loud to the media by coach raymond domenech and followed a near-scuffle on the training pitch between team captain patrice evra and robert duverne , a fitness coach on the team .
duverne had reportedly insisted that the players go ahead with the practice . the players ' decision to call off their practice also caused the team 's director , jean-louis valentin , to resign in disgust . picked up by the press according to media reports , anelka crudely insulted domenech coming off the pitch at halftime in france 's group game against mexico .

the chelsea forward denied cursing at domenech as suggested by l 'equipe but did admit to a ' heated conversation ' with his coach .
on saturday , anelka was asked by fff president jean-pierre escalettes to issue a public apology for his remarks .
when anelka refused , the decision was made to send him home .
support from teammates french captain patrice evra had sympathy for his departed teammate , saying anelka was n't the problem on the french squad .

bayern munich star franck ribery appeared in tears live on french television as he discussed anelka 's expulsion and problems with the french team , appealing to the french people to forgive the team for their poor showing so far in the world cup .
france go into their final group game against south africa with their backs up against the wall .
they opened the tournament with a lackluster 0-0 draw against uruguay , and after thursday 's loss to mexico , have only a glimmer of hope of advancing to the knock-out stage .
france must win its game against south africa on tuesday and hope that the game between uruguay and mexico does n't end in a draw .
even then , france would only advance if it had a superior goal difference to that game 's loser .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the heat is on : climate change and the media environmental journalists face political , physical threats worldwide global media forum tackles ' greatest challenge of the 21st century ' global media forum ends by urging people to learn to live with less a million trees and counting - german boy activist fights climate change media -pipe- 20.06.2010 journalists should not forget climate change , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : himalayan glaciers are melting slower than originally thought , but now media interest may be drying up a british study shows journalists are overlooking the issue of global warming in favor of more sensational stories , an issue that will be discussed at this year 's deutsche welle global media forum . it 's been a difficult few months for the intergovernmental panel on climate change , one of the foremost bodies charged with evaluating the risk climate change .
since the unearthing of an embarrassing error in the most recent ipcc report - the statement that the himalayan glaciers might be gone by 2035 - the hunt for further ipcc blunders has been on , drawing in scientists , bloggers and journalists from all over the world .
yet some experts argue that , the occasional scandal aside , climate change is a subject that receives relatively little media attention .
three years ago , dortmund university professor of journalism holger wormer described climate change as a " shooting star " topic for the media .
at the time , he and others in the scientific and journalistic communities had big ideas about the role the media could play in the struggle against global warming .
falling by the wayside bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental disasters could be drawing media attention away from climate change today , according to wormer , climate change is a topic that has fallen from editorial grace .
" we now have a lot of other things on our agenda , things that are developing and that have more impact than they did three years ago , for example the financial crisis , " he said .
" these things have pushed reporting on climate change into the background . "
wormer said that with other , more pressing environmental stories on the table - the gulf of mexico oil spill , or , in germany , recurring discussions over nuclear energy - the " slow and steady " threat of climate change has been pushed to the side and is now a topic that appears more often in the context of wider environmental or political coverage .
" i think we started a bit too late with serious reporting on the topic .
the reporting increased significantly only when there was more interest in climate change in the political agenda , " he said .
wormer 's concern appears to be backed up by the numbers .
last year , researchers from the university of liverpool in the uk released the results of an exhaustive study of climate change coverage in british newspapers .
they found that between 2000 and 2006 , the number of articles addressing climate change was modest : coverage peaked at around 100 articles per month .
" just to give you a comparison , the number of stories on health or crime were at about 400 to 500 stories per month the whole way through the period , " said neil gavin , a senior lecturer in politics at the university of liverpool and lead researcher of the study .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stories on emissions trading schemes are relegated to the business pages big topics still ' niche ' gavin , who has written and researched extensively on the relationship between climate change and the media , said even fewer journalists were attempting to tackle climate change-related topics like emissions trading schemes -lrb- etss -rrb- , the market-based approach to controlling pollution that provides big emitters with economic incentives to reduce polluting emissions , or peak oil , the point at which global petroleum discovery will peak , after which production will go into permanent decline .
when these terms do appear in newspapers , he said , they tend to be treated as niche topics , appearing in the business pages rather than in the news section of papers .
this has implications for accountability , he said .
in the european union , a major ets has been in place since 2005 and has already entered into its second phase , but gavin said his research recorded only around 20 mentions of the scheme between 2000 and 2006 .
" where is the accountability of the european union ?
what kind of corners -lsb- could be -rsb- being cut in phase two and three ? "
what 's more , the liverpool researchers found that in some newspapers , a significant amount of what little coverage appeared was focused on skeptical reporting .
" in the top-selling newspapers like the telegraph , daily mail , the sun and their sunday sister papers , 25 percent of the coverage ran along climate skeptic lines , " said gavin .
wormer said that despite recent revelations of mistakes in the ipcc reports , there is n't necessarily any reason for journalists to give more attention to climate skepticism .
" we should also be aware of the huge amount of pressure , the lobbying and the pr that goes into trying to -lsb- create -rsb- doubts over the science , " he said , citing the similar levels of pressure and skepticism in the last century over whether cigarettes posed a health hazard .
' keep it simple ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hedegaard says journalists can help by sticking to the facts connie hedegaard , the eu commissioner for climate action and the former danish minister for climate and energy , said the role journalists can play in helping to tackle climate change is a simple one .
" i think the media could help a lot by simply communicating the facts , " she said .
" and take care that when you have one or two errors in a huge report done by thousands of scientists not to communicate the message as if one or two errors would change the whole finding of the -lsb- report -rsb- .
i think it 's very important here to get the proportions right . "
hedegaard , herself a former television journalist , said while it would be wrong for the media to ignore climate skepticism altogether , it is also wrong to uncritically accept skepticism in the name of balance .
" the easiest thing in the world is to invite a guest who says that the planet is flat , and somebody who says , no , it 's round .
and the reporter 's job there is not just to hold the microphone and say , ' ok , a says it 's flat , the other one says it 's round , " ' she said .
" it is sometimes also -lsb- necessary -rsb- to be equipped to say something is factual , something is right and something is wrong ; " she said . " that is not being biased ; that 's just to help the listeners , the viewers and the readers to orient themselves in a jungle of information . "

wormer 's concern appears to be backed up by the numbers .
last year , researchers from the university of liverpool in the uk released the results of an exhaustive study of climate change coverage in british newspapers .
they found that between 2000 and 2006 , the number of articles addressing climate change was modest : coverage peaked at around 100 articles per month .
" just to give you a comparison , the number of stories on health or crime were at about 400 to 500 stories per month the whole way through the period , " said neil gavin , a senior lecturer in politics at the university of liverpool and lead researcher of the study .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stories on emissions trading schemes are relegated to the business pages big topics still ' niche ' gavin , who has written and researched extensively on the relationship between climate change and the media , said even fewer journalists were attempting to tackle climate change-related topics like emissions trading schemes -lrb- etss -rrb- , the market-based approach to controlling pollution that provides big emitters with economic incentives to reduce polluting emissions , or peak oil , the point at which global petroleum discovery will peak , after which production will go into permanent decline .
when these terms do appear in newspapers , he said , they tend to be treated as niche topics , appearing in the business pages rather than in the news section of papers .
this has implications for accountability , he said .
in the european union , a major ets has been in place since 2005 and has already entered into its second phase , but gavin said his research recorded only around 20 mentions of the scheme between 2000 and 2006 .
" where is the accountability of the european union ?
what kind of corners -lsb- could be -rsb- being cut in phase two and three ? "
what 's more , the liverpool researchers found that in some newspapers , a significant amount of what little coverage appeared was focused on skeptical reporting .
" in the top-selling newspapers like the telegraph , daily mail , the sun and their sunday sister papers , 25 percent of the coverage ran along climate skeptic lines , " said gavin .
wormer said that despite recent revelations of mistakes in the ipcc reports , there is n't necessarily any reason for journalists to give more attention to climate skepticism .
" we should also be aware of the huge amount of pressure , the lobbying and the pr that goes into trying to -lsb- create -rsb- doubts over the science , " he said , citing the similar levels of pressure and skepticism in the last century over whether cigarettes posed a health hazard .
' keep it simple ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hedegaard says journalists can help by sticking to the facts connie hedegaard , the eu commissioner for climate action and the former danish minister for climate and energy , said the role journalists can play in helping to tackle climate change is a simple one .

hedegaard , herself a former television journalist , said while it would be wrong for the media to ignore climate skepticism altogether , it is also wrong to uncritically accept skepticism in the name of balance .

wormer said that with other , more pressing environmental stories on the table - the gulf of mexico oil spill , or , in germany , recurring discussions over nuclear energy - the " slow and steady " threat of climate change has been pushed to the side and is now a topic that appears more often in the context of wider environmental or political coverage .

"
niebel had planned to inspect a german-financed sewage plant in the hamas-controlled area and meet representatives of the united nations relief and works agency for palestine refugees .
" i had hoped that this could have been a clear political signal for an opening and for transparency , " niebel said in a separate interview on public german broadcaster zdf .
" sometimes the israeli government does not make it easy for its friends to explain why it behaves in the way it does . "
german politicians criticize decision german foreign minister guido westerwelle said he regretted israel 's decision , adding that the german government continued to support an end to the israel 's blockade of gaza .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebel had planned to inspect a german-financed sewage plant " this is not only the stance of germany but also the stance of our partners in the european union , " westerwelle said .
islamist group hamas took power in gaza in 2007 , after which israel imposed a blockade on the small but densely populated coastal region .
israel said this week that it was easing a land blockade of the gaza strip after a storm of international criticism following its raid on an aid flotilla bound for the hamas-run palestinian territory killed nine activists .
israel faced intensified international calls to relax or lift its gaza embargo .
ruprecht polenz , a member of parliament of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party and chairman of the foreign affairs committee told newspaper tagesspiegel there was no " political reason " for israel 's decision . " the israeli government is damaging the credibility of its new politics , " gernot erler , deputy head of the social democratic party 's parliamentary group told newspaper waz .
he added that he could n't see how the denial to visit the gaza strip fit with the government 's decision to ease the gaza blockade . " five to twelve " referring to the loosening of the blockade that the israeli government recently announced , niebel said , " if the israeli government expects support for its new gaza strategy , it must first of all ensure more transparency and for a new partnership . "
he said the blockade , which is aimed at preventing hamas members in the gaza strip from obtaining weapons and materials to build rockets which are fired over the border into israel , was not a sign of strength .
rather , he said , it was , " proof of unspoken fear . "
niebel urged the israeli government not to let the clock run out on the remaining opportunity for peace talks .
" it is five to twelve for israel , " he said .
israel defends decision israeli foreign ministry spokesman yigal palmor said the move was part of israel 's long-standing policy on gaza .
" we do not allow senior politicians into gaza because hamas will manipulate such visits to gain legitimacy , " said palmor on sunday , niebel met with palestinian president mahmud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad and attended a ceremony marking the start of construction on a water purification plant in nablus in the west bank .
reports say the german government has promised 42.5 million euros for development cooperation in the palestinian territories in 2010 . niebel is to meet israeli officials in jerusalem on monday and tuesday . author : matt zuvela -lrb- afp / dpa -rrb- editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

former prime minister dominique de villepin has created a new center-right party called republique solidaire .
villepin aims to capitalize on sarkozy 's current poor poll ratings .
sarkozy 's re-election has until now been regarded as a near-certainty , but a republique solidaire candidacy in the 2012 ballot could split the conservative vote .
launching the party speaking to a crowd of an estimated 3,000 supporters , villepin criticized " an ever-growing gap between words and acts , between what french people go through and what their leaders experience . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former prime minister was cleared of slander charges in january the former diplomat has been one of sarkozy 's strongest critics in the conservative camp .
he was prime minister under president jacques chirac and was known to have a tense relationship with sarkozy , who served as his interior minister .
villepin was a member of sarkozy 's ump party , but broke away after a bitter row . last year , villepin went on trial for allegedly taking part in a smear campaign to ruin sarkozy 's presidential bid , but was cleared of all charges .
splitting the vote polls show villepin would pick up no more than 7 or 8 percent of the vote in 2012 , but his personal approval ratings stand at 49 percent .
sarkozy 's rating has dropped in recent months to around 33 percent .
a presidential candidacy from villepin could split the right - at a time when the far-right in france is also challenging sarkozy .
marine le pen , vice president of the far right national front , said she was " very happy " about the prospect of villepin running in 2012 , as it could weaken sarkozy .
the head of the international monetary fund , dominique strauss-kahn , is also being touted as a candidate and is widely viewed as a favorite to head the socialist party ticket for 2012 .

former prime minister dominique de villepin has created a new center-right party called republique solidaire .
villepin aims to capitalize on sarkozy 's current poor poll ratings .
sarkozy 's re-election has until now been regarded as a near-certainty , but a republique solidaire candidacy in the 2012 ballot could split the conservative vote .
launching the party speaking to a crowd of an estimated 3,000 supporters , villepin criticized " an ever-growing gap between words and acts , between what french people go through and what their leaders experience . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former prime minister was cleared of slander charges in january the former diplomat has been one of sarkozy 's strongest critics in the conservative camp .
he was prime minister under president jacques chirac and was known to have a tense relationship with sarkozy , who served as his interior minister .
villepin was a member of sarkozy 's ump party , but broke away after a bitter row . last year , villepin went on trial for allegedly taking part in a smear campaign to ruin sarkozy 's presidential bid , but was cleared of all charges .
splitting the vote polls show villepin would pick up no more than 7 or 8 percent of the vote in 2012 , but his personal approval ratings stand at 49 percent .
sarkozy 's rating has dropped in recent months to around 33 percent .
a presidential candidacy from villepin could split the right - at a time when the far-right in france is also challenging sarkozy .
marine le pen , vice president of the far right national front , said she was " very happy " about the prospect of villepin running in 2012 , as it could weaken sarkozy .
the head of the international monetary fund , dominique strauss-kahn , is also being touted as a candidate and is widely viewed as a favorite to head the socialist party ticket for 2012 .

"
niebel had planned to inspect a german-financed sewage plant in the hamas-controlled area and meet representatives of the united nations relief and works agency for palestine refugees .
" i had hoped that this could have been a clear political signal for an opening and for transparency , " niebel said in a separate interview on public german broadcaster zdf .
" sometimes the israeli government does not make it easy for its friends to explain why it behaves in the way it does . "
german politicians criticize decision german foreign minister guido westerwelle said he regretted israel 's decision , adding that the german government continued to support an end to the israel 's blockade of gaza .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebel had planned to inspect a german-financed sewage plant " this is not only the stance of germany but also the stance of our partners in the european union , " westerwelle said .
islamist group hamas took power in gaza in 2007 , after which israel imposed a blockade on the small but densely populated coastal region .
israel said this week that it was easing a land blockade of the gaza strip after a storm of international criticism following its raid on an aid flotilla bound for the hamas-run palestinian territory killed nine activists .
israel faced intensified international calls to relax or lift its gaza embargo .
ruprecht polenz , a member of parliament of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party and chairman of the foreign affairs committee told newspaper tagesspiegel there was no " political reason " for israel 's decision . " the israeli government is damaging the credibility of its new politics , " gernot erler , deputy head of the social democratic party 's parliamentary group told newspaper waz .
he added that he could n't see how the denial to visit the gaza strip fit with the government 's decision to ease the gaza blockade . " five to twelve " referring to the loosening of the blockade that the israeli government recently announced , niebel said , " if the israeli government expects support for its new gaza strategy , it must first of all ensure more transparency and for a new partnership . "
he said the blockade , which is aimed at preventing hamas members in the gaza strip from obtaining weapons and materials to build rockets which are fired over the border into israel , was not a sign of strength .
rather , he said , it was , " proof of unspoken fear . "
niebel urged the israeli government not to let the clock run out on the remaining opportunity for peace talks .
" it is five to twelve for israel , " he said .
israel defends decision israeli foreign ministry spokesman yigal palmor said the move was part of israel 's long-standing policy on gaza .
" we do not allow senior politicians into gaza because hamas will manipulate such visits to gain legitimacy , " said palmor on sunday , niebel met with palestinian president mahmud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad and attended a ceremony marking the start of construction on a water purification plant in nablus in the west bank .

fabiano 's two goals propelled brazil to the win and into the knock-out round of the world cup . brazil 's 3-1 victory over the ivory coast in johannesburg on sunday night showed glimmers of why brazil is a perennial world cup favorite .
the brazilians appear to be finding their stride in the tournament , and in this game , luis fabiano was in the lead .
he scored two goals and helped propel brazil into the next round . fabiano 's first goal was orchestrated by passes from robinho and kaka .
fabiano found himself free to the side of the goal with only the keeper to beat .
boubacar barry was in good position for the ivory coast , but fabiano simply blasted the shot over the keeper 's head into the top of the net to score . fives minutes into the second half , fabiano displayed some brazilian flair for his second goal of the match .
he beat two defenders with light taps on the ball to send it over their heads , then controlled the pass to himself with his chest and fired away to score . however , television replays showed fabiano 's upper arm appeared to help him get the ball under control before he shot .
the ball also glanced off his hand at the start of the play . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elano and fabiano both have 2 goals in this world cup brazil rounded out its victory seven minutes later , as kaka sent a pass from near the end line back to midfielder elano , who surprised a sleeping ivorian defence and scored the easy goal . the ivory coast 's striker didier drogba pulled one back for his side in the 79th minute .
following a long , solo run , gervinho was caught by the brazilian defence and forced to pass away to yaya toure .
toure sent a perfect pass into the middle where drogba used a long header to put away the consolation goal . the final ten minutes of the game were quite physical , with several fouls being given and some heated words exchanged between players .
kaka was booked in the 88th minute for his second foul of the game and sent off the pitch .
the midfielder will miss brazil 's next match against portugal , which is merely a formality as the win against the ivory coast secures brazil 's place in the next round .
group f remains close for a few days at least , group f of the world cup was a nice , tidy four-way tie .
in the group 's first two matches , all four teams drew 1-1 with each other , giving them all one point and a goal differential of zero .
that deadlock was bound to be broken - paraguay took the initiative , beating slovakia 2-0 on sunday afternoon - but the group is still very tight as defending champs italy only managed a draw against group-underdogs new zealand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smeltz and the kiwis were more than happy with a draw against italy the all whites surprised italy by taking the lead in the 7th minute .
italian captain fabio cannavaro failed to clear a free kick , which left new zealand 's shane smeltz free to tap in the goal . the kiwi 's dreams of an upset win over the world cup title holders did n't last long , though .
italy was awarded a penalty kick in the 29th minute when daniele de rossi fell in a tussle with new zealand 's tommy smith in the box .
the ref showed smith a yellow card and pointed to the penalty spot .
vincenzo iaquinta took the kick to pull italy even with new zealand . although italy had the advantage for more or less the rest of the game , they failed to create scoring opportunities and are now level with new zealand on points in group f. paraguay takes the lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paraguay is in a good position at the top of the group by only managing a draw against new zealand , italy faces some pressure heading into their last group match against slovakia .
a win would secure a spot in the round of 16 , but a draw could leave them exposed to being bounced should new zealand continue to surprise and come up with a win or a high-scoring draw against paraguay . the south american team , however , looked strong in their 2-0 win against slovakia that sent them to the top of the group . enrique vera opened the scoring for paraguay in the 27th minute , taking a precise pass from lucas barrios and slipping a shot through two defenders and into the goal .
toward the end of the game , paraguay added its second goal for good measure as cristian riveros cleaned up a loose ball on the edge of the box and booted it past slovakian keeper jan mucha .
slovakia only had one shot on goal the entire game , and their best chance to score came in the 37th minute when defender kornel salata headed a corner over the goal .

islamist group hamas took power in gaza in 2007 , after which israel imposed a blockade on the small but densely populated coastal region .
israel said this week that it was easing a land blockade of the gaza strip after a storm of international criticism following its raid on an aid flotilla bound for the hamas-run palestinian territory killed nine activists .
israel faced intensified international calls to relax or lift its gaza embargo .
ruprecht polenz , a member of parliament of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party and chairman of the foreign affairs committee told newspaper tagesspiegel there was no " political reason " for israel 's decision . " the israeli government is damaging the credibility of its new politics , " gernot erler , deputy head of the social democratic party 's parliamentary group told newspaper waz .
he added that he could n't see how the denial to visit the gaza strip fit with the government 's decision to ease the gaza blockade . " five to twelve " referring to the loosening of the blockade that the israeli government recently announced , niebel said , " if the israeli government expects support for its new gaza strategy , it must first of all ensure more transparency and for a new partnership . "
he said the blockade , which is aimed at preventing hamas members in the gaza strip from obtaining weapons and materials to build rockets which are fired over the border into israel , was not a sign of strength .
rather , he said , it was , " proof of unspoken fear . "
niebel urged the israeli government not to let the clock run out on the remaining opportunity for peace talks .
" it is five to twelve for israel , " he said .
israel defends decision israeli foreign ministry spokesman yigal palmor said the move was part of israel 's long-standing policy on gaza .
" we do not allow senior politicians into gaza because hamas will manipulate such visits to gain legitimacy , " said palmor on sunday , niebel met with palestinian president mahmud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad and attended a ceremony marking the start of construction on a water purification plant in nablus in the west bank .
reports say the german government has promised 42.5 million euros for development cooperation in the palestinian territories in 2010 . niebel is to meet israeli officials in jerusalem on monday and tuesday . author : matt zuvela -lrb- afp / dpa -rrb- editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fabiano 's two goals propelled brazil to the win and into the knock-out round of the world cup . brazil 's 3-1 victory over the ivory coast in johannesburg on sunday night showed glimmers of why brazil is a perennial world cup favorite .
the brazilians appear to be finding their stride in the tournament , and in this game , luis fabiano was in the lead .
he scored two goals and helped propel brazil into the next round . fabiano 's first goal was orchestrated by passes from robinho and kaka .
fabiano found himself free to the side of the goal with only the keeper to beat .
boubacar barry was in good position for the ivory coast , but fabiano simply blasted the shot over the keeper 's head into the top of the net to score . fives minutes into the second half , fabiano displayed some brazilian flair for his second goal of the match .
he beat two defenders with light taps on the ball to send it over their heads , then controlled the pass to himself with his chest and fired away to score . however , television replays showed fabiano 's upper arm appeared to help him get the ball under control before he shot .
the ball also glanced off his hand at the start of the play . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elano and fabiano both have 2 goals in this world cup brazil rounded out its victory seven minutes later , as kaka sent a pass from near the end line back to midfielder elano , who surprised a sleeping ivorian defence and scored the easy goal . the ivory coast 's striker didier drogba pulled one back for his side in the 79th minute .
following a long , solo run , gervinho was caught by the brazilian defence and forced to pass away to yaya toure .
toure sent a perfect pass into the middle where drogba used a long header to put away the consolation goal . the final ten minutes of the game were quite physical , with several fouls being given and some heated words exchanged between players .
kaka was booked in the 88th minute for his second foul of the game and sent off the pitch .
the midfielder will miss brazil 's next match against portugal , which is merely a formality as the win against the ivory coast secures brazil 's place in the next round .
group f remains close for a few days at least , group f of the world cup was a nice , tidy four-way tie .
in the group 's first two matches , all four teams drew 1-1 with each other , giving them all one point and a goal differential of zero .
that deadlock was bound to be broken - paraguay took the initiative , beating slovakia 2-0 on sunday afternoon - but the group is still very tight as defending champs italy only managed a draw against group-underdogs new zealand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smeltz and the kiwis were more than happy with a draw against italy the all whites surprised italy by taking the lead in the 7th minute .
italian captain fabio cannavaro failed to clear a free kick , which left new zealand 's shane smeltz free to tap in the goal . the kiwi 's dreams of an upset win over the world cup title holders did n't last long , though .
italy was awarded a penalty kick in the 29th minute when daniele de rossi fell in a tussle with new zealand 's tommy smith in the box .
the ref showed smith a yellow card and pointed to the penalty spot .
vincenzo iaquinta took the kick to pull italy even with new zealand . although italy had the advantage for more or less the rest of the game , they failed to create scoring opportunities and are now level with new zealand on points in group f. paraguay takes the lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paraguay is in a good position at the top of the group by only managing a draw against new zealand , italy faces some pressure heading into their last group match against slovakia .
a win would secure a spot in the round of 16 , but a draw could leave them exposed to being bounced should new zealand continue to surprise and come up with a win or a high-scoring draw against paraguay . the south american team , however , looked strong in their 2-0 win against slovakia that sent them to the top of the group . enrique vera opened the scoring for paraguay in the 27th minute , taking a precise pass from lucas barrios and slipping a shot through two defenders and into the goal .
toward the end of the game , paraguay added its second goal for good measure as cristian riveros cleaned up a loose ball on the edge of the box and booted it past slovakian keeper jan mucha .
slovakia only had one shot on goal the entire game , and their best chance to score came in the 37th minute when defender kornel salata headed a corner over the goal .

niebel had planned to inspect a german-financed sewage plant in the hamas-controlled area and meet representatives of the united nations relief and works agency for palestine refugees .

former prime minister dominique de villepin has created a new center-right party called republique solidaire .
villepin aims to capitalize on sarkozy 's current poor poll ratings .
sarkozy 's re-election has until now been regarded as a near-certainty , but a republique solidaire candidacy in the 2012 ballot could split the conservative vote .
launching the party speaking to a crowd of an estimated 3,000 supporters , villepin criticized " an ever-growing gap between words and acts , between what french people go through and what their leaders experience . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former prime minister was cleared of slander charges in january the former diplomat has been one of sarkozy 's strongest critics in the conservative camp .
he was prime minister under president jacques chirac and was known to have a tense relationship with sarkozy , who served as his interior minister .
villepin was a member of sarkozy 's ump party , but broke away after a bitter row . last year , villepin went on trial for allegedly taking part in a smear campaign to ruin sarkozy 's presidential bid , but was cleared of all charges .
splitting the vote polls show villepin would pick up no more than 7 or 8 percent of the vote in 2012 , but his personal approval ratings stand at 49 percent .
sarkozy 's rating has dropped in recent months to around 33 percent .
a presidential candidacy from villepin could split the right - at a time when the far-right in france is also challenging sarkozy .
marine le pen , vice president of the far right national front , said she was " very happy " about the prospect of villepin running in 2012 , as it could weaken sarkozy .
the head of the international monetary fund , dominique strauss-kahn , is also being touted as a candidate and is widely viewed as a favorite to head the socialist party ticket for 2012 .

"
niebel had planned to inspect a german-financed sewage plant in the hamas-controlled area and meet representatives of the united nations relief and works agency for palestine refugees .
" i had hoped that this could have been a clear political signal for an opening and for transparency , " niebel said in a separate interview on public german broadcaster zdf .
" sometimes the israeli government does not make it easy for its friends to explain why it behaves in the way it does . "

islamist group hamas took power in gaza in 2007 , after which israel imposed a blockade on the small but densely populated coastal region .
israel said this week that it was easing a land blockade of the gaza strip after a storm of international criticism following its raid on an aid flotilla bound for the hamas-run palestinian territory killed nine activists .
israel faced intensified international calls to relax or lift its gaza embargo .
ruprecht polenz , a member of parliament of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party and chairman of the foreign affairs committee told newspaper tagesspiegel there was no " political reason " for israel 's decision . " the israeli government is damaging the credibility of its new politics , " gernot erler , deputy head of the social democratic party 's parliamentary group told newspaper waz .
he added that he could n't see how the denial to visit the gaza strip fit with the government 's decision to ease the gaza blockade . " five to twelve " referring to the loosening of the blockade that the israeli government recently announced , niebel said , " if the israeli government expects support for its new gaza strategy , it must first of all ensure more transparency and for a new partnership . "
he said the blockade , which is aimed at preventing hamas members in the gaza strip from obtaining weapons and materials to build rockets which are fired over the border into israel , was not a sign of strength .
rather , he said , it was , " proof of unspoken fear . "
niebel urged the israeli government not to let the clock run out on the remaining opportunity for peace talks .
" it is five to twelve for israel , " he said .
israel defends decision israeli foreign ministry spokesman yigal palmor said the move was part of israel 's long-standing policy on gaza .
" we do not allow senior politicians into gaza because hamas will manipulate such visits to gain legitimacy , " said palmor on sunday , niebel met with palestinian president mahmud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad and attended a ceremony marking the start of construction on a water purification plant in nablus in the west bank .

former prime minister dominique de villepin has created a new center-right party called republique solidaire .
villepin aims to capitalize on sarkozy 's current poor poll ratings .
sarkozy 's re-election has until now been regarded as a near-certainty , but a republique solidaire candidacy in the 2012 ballot could split the conservative vote .
launching the party speaking to a crowd of an estimated 3,000 supporters , villepin criticized " an ever-growing gap between words and acts , between what french people go through and what their leaders experience . "

he was prime minister under president jacques chirac and was known to have a tense relationship with sarkozy , who served as his interior minister .
villepin was a member of sarkozy 's ump party , but broke away after a bitter row . last year , villepin went on trial for allegedly taking part in a smear campaign to ruin sarkozy 's presidential bid , but was cleared of all charges .
splitting the vote polls show villepin would pick up no more than 7 or 8 percent of the vote in 2012 , but his personal approval ratings stand at 49 percent .
sarkozy 's rating has dropped in recent months to around 33 percent .
a presidential candidacy from villepin could split the right - at a time when the far-right in france is also challenging sarkozy .
marine le pen , vice president of the far right national front , said she was " very happy " about the prospect of villepin running in 2012 , as it could weaken sarkozy .
the head of the international monetary fund , dominique strauss-kahn , is also being touted as a candidate and is widely viewed as a favorite to head the socialist party ticket for 2012 .

former prime minister dominique de villepin has created a new center-right party called republique solidaire .
villepin aims to capitalize on sarkozy 's current poor poll ratings .
sarkozy 's re-election has until now been regarded as a near-certainty , but a republique solidaire candidacy in the 2012 ballot could split the conservative vote .
launching the party speaking to a crowd of an estimated 3,000 supporters , villepin criticized " an ever-growing gap between words and acts , between what french people go through and what their leaders experience . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former prime minister was cleared of slander charges in january the former diplomat has been one of sarkozy 's strongest critics in the conservative camp .

villepin was a member of sarkozy 's ump party , but broke away after a bitter row . last year , villepin went on trial for allegedly taking part in a smear campaign to ruin sarkozy 's presidential bid , but was cleared of all charges .
splitting the vote polls show villepin would pick up no more than 7 or 8 percent of the vote in 2012 , but his personal approval ratings stand at 49 percent .

"
niebel had planned to inspect a german-financed sewage plant in the hamas-controlled area and meet representatives of the united nations relief and works agency for palestine refugees .
" i had hoped that this could have been a clear political signal for an opening and for transparency , " niebel said in a separate interview on public german broadcaster zdf .
" sometimes the israeli government does not make it easy for its friends to explain why it behaves in the way it does . "
german politicians criticize decision german foreign minister guido westerwelle said he regretted israel 's decision , adding that the german government continued to support an end to the israel 's blockade of gaza .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebel had planned to inspect a german-financed sewage plant " this is not only the stance of germany but also the stance of our partners in the european union , " westerwelle said .
islamist group hamas took power in gaza in 2007 , after which israel imposed a blockade on the small but densely populated coastal region .
israel said this week that it was easing a land blockade of the gaza strip after a storm of international criticism following its raid on an aid flotilla bound for the hamas-run palestinian territory killed nine activists .
israel faced intensified international calls to relax or lift its gaza embargo .
ruprecht polenz , a member of parliament of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party and chairman of the foreign affairs committee told newspaper tagesspiegel there was no " political reason " for israel 's decision . " the israeli government is damaging the credibility of its new politics , " gernot erler , deputy head of the social democratic party 's parliamentary group told newspaper waz .
he added that he could n't see how the denial to visit the gaza strip fit with the government 's decision to ease the gaza blockade . " five to twelve " referring to the loosening of the blockade that the israeli government recently announced , niebel said , " if the israeli government expects support for its new gaza strategy , it must first of all ensure more transparency and for a new partnership . "
he said the blockade , which is aimed at preventing hamas members in the gaza strip from obtaining weapons and materials to build rockets which are fired over the border into israel , was not a sign of strength .
rather , he said , it was , " proof of unspoken fear . "
niebel urged the israeli government not to let the clock run out on the remaining opportunity for peace talks .
" it is five to twelve for israel , " he said .
israel defends decision israeli foreign ministry spokesman yigal palmor said the move was part of israel 's long-standing policy on gaza .
" we do not allow senior politicians into gaza because hamas will manipulate such visits to gain legitimacy , " said palmor on sunday , niebel met with palestinian president mahmud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad and attended a ceremony marking the start of construction on a water purification plant in nablus in the west bank .

the festivities included a colorful parade through the heart of the city . hundreds of thousands of people marched and danced through the streets of berlin on saturday , taking part in the annual christopher street day and this year 's theme , ' normal is different . '
more than 50 floats traveled through the streets of the capital , ending at the brandenburg gate .
berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit , who is openly gay , said that homosexuals are still fighting for equality .
" there is still today daily attacks and discrimination against homosexuals , " wowereit told the german news agency dpa .
as soccer fever grabs germany , the world cup theme found its way into the parade , with participants on the german football association float handing out pink cards , instead of football 's red and yellow cards .
the 32nd annual gay pride event in berlin commemorates the start of the gay rights movement in new york 's greenwich village in 1969 .
on june 28 of that year , customers at the stonewall inn on new york 's christopher street - who were mostly drag queens and young prostitutes - rebelled against a police raid .

fabiano 's two goals propelled brazil to the win and into the knock-out round of the world cup . brazil 's 3-1 victory over the ivory coast in johannesburg on sunday night showed glimmers of why brazil is a perennial world cup favorite .
the brazilians appear to be finding their stride in the tournament , and in this game , luis fabiano was in the lead .
he scored two goals and helped propel brazil into the next round . fabiano 's first goal was orchestrated by passes from robinho and kaka .
fabiano found himself free to the side of the goal with only the keeper to beat .
boubacar barry was in good position for the ivory coast , but fabiano simply blasted the shot over the keeper 's head into the top of the net to score . fives minutes into the second half , fabiano displayed some brazilian flair for his second goal of the match .
he beat two defenders with light taps on the ball to send it over their heads , then controlled the pass to himself with his chest and fired away to score . however , television replays showed fabiano 's upper arm appeared to help him get the ball under control before he shot .
the ball also glanced off his hand at the start of the play . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elano and fabiano both have 2 goals in this world cup brazil rounded out its victory seven minutes later , as kaka sent a pass from near the end line back to midfielder elano , who surprised a sleeping ivorian defence and scored the easy goal . the ivory coast 's striker didier drogba pulled one back for his side in the 79th minute .
following a long , solo run , gervinho was caught by the brazilian defence and forced to pass away to yaya toure .
toure sent a perfect pass into the middle where drogba used a long header to put away the consolation goal . the final ten minutes of the game were quite physical , with several fouls being given and some heated words exchanged between players .
kaka was booked in the 88th minute for his second foul of the game and sent off the pitch .
the midfielder will miss brazil 's next match against portugal , which is merely a formality as the win against the ivory coast secures brazil 's place in the next round .
group f remains close for a few days at least , group f of the world cup was a nice , tidy four-way tie .
in the group 's first two matches , all four teams drew 1-1 with each other , giving them all one point and a goal differential of zero .
that deadlock was bound to be broken - paraguay took the initiative , beating slovakia 2-0 on sunday afternoon - but the group is still very tight as defending champs italy only managed a draw against group-underdogs new zealand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smeltz and the kiwis were more than happy with a draw against italy the all whites surprised italy by taking the lead in the 7th minute .
italian captain fabio cannavaro failed to clear a free kick , which left new zealand 's shane smeltz free to tap in the goal . the kiwi 's dreams of an upset win over the world cup title holders did n't last long , though .
italy was awarded a penalty kick in the 29th minute when daniele de rossi fell in a tussle with new zealand 's tommy smith in the box .
the ref showed smith a yellow card and pointed to the penalty spot .
vincenzo iaquinta took the kick to pull italy even with new zealand . although italy had the advantage for more or less the rest of the game , they failed to create scoring opportunities and are now level with new zealand on points in group f. paraguay takes the lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paraguay is in a good position at the top of the group by only managing a draw against new zealand , italy faces some pressure heading into their last group match against slovakia .
a win would secure a spot in the round of 16 , but a draw could leave them exposed to being bounced should new zealand continue to surprise and come up with a win or a high-scoring draw against paraguay . the south american team , however , looked strong in their 2-0 win against slovakia that sent them to the top of the group . enrique vera opened the scoring for paraguay in the 27th minute , taking a precise pass from lucas barrios and slipping a shot through two defenders and into the goal .
toward the end of the game , paraguay added its second goal for good measure as cristian riveros cleaned up a loose ball on the edge of the box and booted it past slovakian keeper jan mucha .
slovakia only had one shot on goal the entire game , and their best chance to score came in the 37th minute when defender kornel salata headed a corner over the goal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 20.06.2010 brazil survives group of death and advances to round of 16 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man of the match luis fabiano luis fabiano led the charge for a top-form brazil against the ivory coast in johannesburg on sunday night .
fabiano 's two goals propelled brazil to the win and into the knock-out round of the world cup . brazil 's 3-1 victory over the ivory coast in johannesburg on sunday night showed glimmers of why brazil is a perennial world cup favorite .
the brazilians appear to be finding their stride in the tournament , and in this game , luis fabiano was in the lead .
he scored two goals and helped propel brazil into the next round . fabiano 's first goal was orchestrated by passes from robinho and kaka .
fabiano found himself free to the side of the goal with only the keeper to beat .
boubacar barry was in good position for the ivory coast , but fabiano simply blasted the shot over the keeper 's head into the top of the net to score . fives minutes into the second half , fabiano displayed some brazilian flair for his second goal of the match .
he beat two defenders with light taps on the ball to send it over their heads , then controlled the pass to himself with his chest and fired away to score . however , television replays showed fabiano 's upper arm appeared to help him get the ball under control before he shot .
the ball also glanced off his hand at the start of the play . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elano and fabiano both have 2 goals in this world cup brazil rounded out its victory seven minutes later , as kaka sent a pass from near the end line back to midfielder elano , who surprised a sleeping ivorian defence and scored the easy goal . the ivory coast 's striker didier drogba pulled one back for his side in the 79th minute .
following a long , solo run , gervinho was caught by the brazilian defence and forced to pass away to yaya toure .
toure sent a perfect pass into the middle where drogba used a long header to put away the consolation goal . the final ten minutes of the game were quite physical , with several fouls being given and some heated words exchanged between players .
kaka was booked in the 88th minute for his second foul of the game and sent off the pitch .
the midfielder will miss brazil 's next match against portugal , which is merely a formality as the win against the ivory coast secures brazil 's place in the next round .
group f remains close for a few days at least , group f of the world cup was a nice , tidy four-way tie .
in the group 's first two matches , all four teams drew 1-1 with each other , giving them all one point and a goal differential of zero .
that deadlock was bound to be broken - paraguay took the initiative , beating slovakia 2-0 on sunday afternoon - but the group is still very tight as defending champs italy only managed a draw against group-underdogs new zealand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smeltz and the kiwis were more than happy with a draw against italy the all whites surprised italy by taking the lead in the 7th minute .
italian captain fabio cannavaro failed to clear a free kick , which left new zealand 's shane smeltz free to tap in the goal . the kiwi 's dreams of an upset win over the world cup title holders did n't last long , though .
italy was awarded a penalty kick in the 29th minute when daniele de rossi fell in a tussle with new zealand 's tommy smith in the box .
the ref showed smith a yellow card and pointed to the penalty spot .
vincenzo iaquinta took the kick to pull italy even with new zealand . although italy had the advantage for more or less the rest of the game , they failed to create scoring opportunities and are now level with new zealand on points in group f. paraguay takes the lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paraguay is in a good position at the top of the group by only managing a draw against new zealand , italy faces some pressure heading into their last group match against slovakia .
a win would secure a spot in the round of 16 , but a draw could leave them exposed to being bounced should new zealand continue to surprise and come up with a win or a high-scoring draw against paraguay . the south american team , however , looked strong in their 2-0 win against slovakia that sent them to the top of the group . enrique vera opened the scoring for paraguay in the 27th minute , taking a precise pass from lucas barrios and slipping a shot through two defenders and into the goal .
toward the end of the game , paraguay added its second goal for good measure as cristian riveros cleaned up a loose ball on the edge of the box and booted it past slovakian keeper jan mucha .
slovakia only had one shot on goal the entire game , and their best chance to score came in the 37th minute when defender kornel salata headed a corner over the goal .

the festivities included a colorful parade through the heart of the city . hundreds of thousands of people marched and danced through the streets of berlin on saturday , taking part in the annual christopher street day and this year 's theme , ' normal is different . '
more than 50 floats traveled through the streets of the capital , ending at the brandenburg gate .
berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit , who is openly gay , said that homosexuals are still fighting for equality .
" there is still today daily attacks and discrimination against homosexuals , " wowereit told the german news agency dpa .
as soccer fever grabs germany , the world cup theme found its way into the parade , with participants on the german football association float handing out pink cards , instead of football 's red and yellow cards .
the 32nd annual gay pride event in berlin commemorates the start of the gay rights movement in new york 's greenwich village in 1969 .
on june 28 of that year , customers at the stonewall inn on new york 's christopher street - who were mostly drag queens and young prostitutes - rebelled against a police raid .

anelka was booted after cursing out coach raymond domenech , and it was domenech who was left to meet the press to explain . the wheels are continuing to fall off in the french world cup camp in south africa .
on sunday , the squad pulled out from its scheduled training session in protest against striker nicolas anelka 's expulsion .
a day earlier , the french football federation -lrb- fff -rrb- announced that anelka had been booted off the team for comments he made to the team 's coach during france 's 2-0 loss to mexico . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there wo n't be any more action for anelka in this world cup the french players were unanimously against the fff 's decision to remove anelka , claiming that the dispute between the player and coach raymond domenech had been made in the privacy of the locker room and should have never reached the press .
" we regret the incident at half-time of the france versus mexico match , " the teams ' players said in a statement , " but we regret even more the divulging of an event which was only the squad 's business and was part and parcel of the life of a top-level team . " the statement was read out loud to the media by coach raymond domenech and followed a near-scuffle on the training pitch between team captain patrice evra and robert duverne , a fitness coach on the team .
duverne had reportedly insisted that the players go ahead with the practice . the players ' decision to call off their practice also caused the team 's director , jean-louis valentin , to resign in disgust . picked up by the press according to media reports , anelka crudely insulted domenech coming off the pitch at halftime in france 's group game against mexico .
domenech had reportedly criticized anelka 's performance on pitch .
anelka was subbed for the second half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anelka was not quoted warmly by l 'equipe french sports newspaper l 'equipe printed anelka 's alleged comments on the front page of saturday 's edition .
the chelsea forward denied cursing at domenech as suggested by l 'equipe but did admit to a ' heated conversation ' with his coach .
on saturday , anelka was asked by fff president jean-pierre escalettes to issue a public apology for his remarks .
when anelka refused , the decision was made to send him home .
support from teammates french captain patrice evra had sympathy for his departed teammate , saying anelka was n't the problem on the french squad .
" the problem is the traitor among us who told the press what was said , " eyra said .
" there 's somebody in our group that wants to harm the france team . "
bayern munich star franck ribery appeared in tears live on french television as he discussed anelka 's expulsion and problems with the french team , appealing to the french people to forgive the team for their poor showing so far in the world cup .
france go into their final group game against south africa with their backs up against the wall .
they opened the tournament with a lackluster 0-0 draw against uruguay , and after thursday 's loss to mexico , have only a glimmer of hope of advancing to the knock-out stage .
france must win its game against south africa on tuesday and hope that the game between uruguay and mexico does n't end in a draw .
even then , france would only advance if it had a superior goal difference to that game 's loser .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the heat is on : climate change and the media environmental journalists face political , physical threats worldwide global media forum tackles ' greatest challenge of the 21st century ' global media forum ends by urging people to learn to live with less a million trees and counting - german boy activist fights climate change media -pipe- 20.06.2010 journalists should not forget climate change , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : himalayan glaciers are melting slower than originally thought , but now media interest may be drying up a british study shows journalists are overlooking the issue of global warming in favor of more sensational stories , an issue that will be discussed at this year 's deutsche welle global media forum . it 's been a difficult few months for the intergovernmental panel on climate change , one of the foremost bodies charged with evaluating the risk climate change .
since the unearthing of an embarrassing error in the most recent ipcc report - the statement that the himalayan glaciers might be gone by 2035 - the hunt for further ipcc blunders has been on , drawing in scientists , bloggers and journalists from all over the world .
yet some experts argue that , the occasional scandal aside , climate change is a subject that receives relatively little media attention .
three years ago , dortmund university professor of journalism holger wormer described climate change as a " shooting star " topic for the media .
at the time , he and others in the scientific and journalistic communities had big ideas about the role the media could play in the struggle against global warming .
falling by the wayside bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental disasters could be drawing media attention away from climate change today , according to wormer , climate change is a topic that has fallen from editorial grace .
" we now have a lot of other things on our agenda , things that are developing and that have more impact than they did three years ago , for example the financial crisis , " he said .
" these things have pushed reporting on climate change into the background . "
wormer said that with other , more pressing environmental stories on the table - the gulf of mexico oil spill , or , in germany , recurring discussions over nuclear energy - the " slow and steady " threat of climate change has been pushed to the side and is now a topic that appears more often in the context of wider environmental or political coverage .
" i think we started a bit too late with serious reporting on the topic .
the reporting increased significantly only when there was more interest in climate change in the political agenda , " he said .
wormer 's concern appears to be backed up by the numbers .
last year , researchers from the university of liverpool in the uk released the results of an exhaustive study of climate change coverage in british newspapers .
they found that between 2000 and 2006 , the number of articles addressing climate change was modest : coverage peaked at around 100 articles per month .
" just to give you a comparison , the number of stories on health or crime were at about 400 to 500 stories per month the whole way through the period , " said neil gavin , a senior lecturer in politics at the university of liverpool and lead researcher of the study .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stories on emissions trading schemes are relegated to the business pages big topics still ' niche ' gavin , who has written and researched extensively on the relationship between climate change and the media , said even fewer journalists were attempting to tackle climate change-related topics like emissions trading schemes -lrb- etss -rrb- , the market-based approach to controlling pollution that provides big emitters with economic incentives to reduce polluting emissions , or peak oil , the point at which global petroleum discovery will peak , after which production will go into permanent decline .
when these terms do appear in newspapers , he said , they tend to be treated as niche topics , appearing in the business pages rather than in the news section of papers .
this has implications for accountability , he said .
in the european union , a major ets has been in place since 2005 and has already entered into its second phase , but gavin said his research recorded only around 20 mentions of the scheme between 2000 and 2006 .
" where is the accountability of the european union ?
what kind of corners -lsb- could be -rsb- being cut in phase two and three ? "
what 's more , the liverpool researchers found that in some newspapers , a significant amount of what little coverage appeared was focused on skeptical reporting .
" in the top-selling newspapers like the telegraph , daily mail , the sun and their sunday sister papers , 25 percent of the coverage ran along climate skeptic lines , " said gavin .
wormer said that despite recent revelations of mistakes in the ipcc reports , there is n't necessarily any reason for journalists to give more attention to climate skepticism .
" we should also be aware of the huge amount of pressure , the lobbying and the pr that goes into trying to -lsb- create -rsb- doubts over the science , " he said , citing the similar levels of pressure and skepticism in the last century over whether cigarettes posed a health hazard .
' keep it simple ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hedegaard says journalists can help by sticking to the facts connie hedegaard , the eu commissioner for climate action and the former danish minister for climate and energy , said the role journalists can play in helping to tackle climate change is a simple one .
" i think the media could help a lot by simply communicating the facts , " she said .
" and take care that when you have one or two errors in a huge report done by thousands of scientists not to communicate the message as if one or two errors would change the whole finding of the -lsb- report -rsb- .
i think it 's very important here to get the proportions right . "
hedegaard , herself a former television journalist , said while it would be wrong for the media to ignore climate skepticism altogether , it is also wrong to uncritically accept skepticism in the name of balance .
" the easiest thing in the world is to invite a guest who says that the planet is flat , and somebody who says , no , it 's round .
and the reporter 's job there is not just to hold the microphone and say , ' ok , a says it 's flat , the other one says it 's round , " ' she said .
" it is sometimes also -lsb- necessary -rsb- to be equipped to say something is factual , something is right and something is wrong ; " she said . " that is not being biased ; that 's just to help the listeners , the viewers and the readers to orient themselves in a jungle of information . "

fabiano 's two goals propelled brazil to the win and into the knock-out round of the world cup . brazil 's 3-1 victory over the ivory coast in johannesburg on sunday night showed glimmers of why brazil is a perennial world cup favorite .
the brazilians appear to be finding their stride in the tournament , and in this game , luis fabiano was in the lead .
he scored two goals and helped propel brazil into the next round . fabiano 's first goal was orchestrated by passes from robinho and kaka .
fabiano found himself free to the side of the goal with only the keeper to beat .
boubacar barry was in good position for the ivory coast , but fabiano simply blasted the shot over the keeper 's head into the top of the net to score . fives minutes into the second half , fabiano displayed some brazilian flair for his second goal of the match .
he beat two defenders with light taps on the ball to send it over their heads , then controlled the pass to himself with his chest and fired away to score . however , television replays showed fabiano 's upper arm appeared to help him get the ball under control before he shot .
the ball also glanced off his hand at the start of the play . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elano and fabiano both have 2 goals in this world cup brazil rounded out its victory seven minutes later , as kaka sent a pass from near the end line back to midfielder elano , who surprised a sleeping ivorian defence and scored the easy goal . the ivory coast 's striker didier drogba pulled one back for his side in the 79th minute .
following a long , solo run , gervinho was caught by the brazilian defence and forced to pass away to yaya toure .
toure sent a perfect pass into the middle where drogba used a long header to put away the consolation goal . the final ten minutes of the game were quite physical , with several fouls being given and some heated words exchanged between players .
kaka was booked in the 88th minute for his second foul of the game and sent off the pitch .
the midfielder will miss brazil 's next match against portugal , which is merely a formality as the win against the ivory coast secures brazil 's place in the next round .
group f remains close for a few days at least , group f of the world cup was a nice , tidy four-way tie .
in the group 's first two matches , all four teams drew 1-1 with each other , giving them all one point and a goal differential of zero .
that deadlock was bound to be broken - paraguay took the initiative , beating slovakia 2-0 on sunday afternoon - but the group is still very tight as defending champs italy only managed a draw against group-underdogs new zealand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smeltz and the kiwis were more than happy with a draw against italy the all whites surprised italy by taking the lead in the 7th minute .
italian captain fabio cannavaro failed to clear a free kick , which left new zealand 's shane smeltz free to tap in the goal . the kiwi 's dreams of an upset win over the world cup title holders did n't last long , though .
italy was awarded a penalty kick in the 29th minute when daniele de rossi fell in a tussle with new zealand 's tommy smith in the box .
the ref showed smith a yellow card and pointed to the penalty spot .
vincenzo iaquinta took the kick to pull italy even with new zealand . although italy had the advantage for more or less the rest of the game , they failed to create scoring opportunities and are now level with new zealand on points in group f. paraguay takes the lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paraguay is in a good position at the top of the group by only managing a draw against new zealand , italy faces some pressure heading into their last group match against slovakia .
a win would secure a spot in the round of 16 , but a draw could leave them exposed to being bounced should new zealand continue to surprise and come up with a win or a high-scoring draw against paraguay . the south american team , however , looked strong in their 2-0 win against slovakia that sent them to the top of the group . enrique vera opened the scoring for paraguay in the 27th minute , taking a precise pass from lucas barrios and slipping a shot through two defenders and into the goal .
toward the end of the game , paraguay added its second goal for good measure as cristian riveros cleaned up a loose ball on the edge of the box and booted it past slovakian keeper jan mucha .
slovakia only had one shot on goal the entire game , and their best chance to score came in the 37th minute when defender kornel salata headed a corner over the goal .

anelka was booted after cursing out coach raymond domenech , and it was domenech who was left to meet the press to explain . the wheels are continuing to fall off in the french world cup camp in south africa .
on sunday , the squad pulled out from its scheduled training session in protest against striker nicolas anelka 's expulsion .
a day earlier , the french football federation -lrb- fff -rrb- announced that anelka had been booted off the team for comments he made to the team 's coach during france 's 2-0 loss to mexico . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there wo n't be any more action for anelka in this world cup the french players were unanimously against the fff 's decision to remove anelka , claiming that the dispute between the player and coach raymond domenech had been made in the privacy of the locker room and should have never reached the press .
" we regret the incident at half-time of the france versus mexico match , " the teams ' players said in a statement , " but we regret even more the divulging of an event which was only the squad 's business and was part and parcel of the life of a top-level team . " the statement was read out loud to the media by coach raymond domenech and followed a near-scuffle on the training pitch between team captain patrice evra and robert duverne , a fitness coach on the team .
duverne had reportedly insisted that the players go ahead with the practice . the players ' decision to call off their practice also caused the team 's director , jean-louis valentin , to resign in disgust . picked up by the press according to media reports , anelka crudely insulted domenech coming off the pitch at halftime in france 's group game against mexico .
domenech had reportedly criticized anelka 's performance on pitch .
anelka was subbed for the second half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anelka was not quoted warmly by l 'equipe french sports newspaper l 'equipe printed anelka 's alleged comments on the front page of saturday 's edition .
the chelsea forward denied cursing at domenech as suggested by l 'equipe but did admit to a ' heated conversation ' with his coach .
on saturday , anelka was asked by fff president jean-pierre escalettes to issue a public apology for his remarks .
when anelka refused , the decision was made to send him home .
support from teammates french captain patrice evra had sympathy for his departed teammate , saying anelka was n't the problem on the french squad .
" the problem is the traitor among us who told the press what was said , " eyra said .
" there 's somebody in our group that wants to harm the france team . "
bayern munich star franck ribery appeared in tears live on french television as he discussed anelka 's expulsion and problems with the french team , appealing to the french people to forgive the team for their poor showing so far in the world cup .
france go into their final group game against south africa with their backs up against the wall .
they opened the tournament with a lackluster 0-0 draw against uruguay , and after thursday 's loss to mexico , have only a glimmer of hope of advancing to the knock-out stage .
france must win its game against south africa on tuesday and hope that the game between uruguay and mexico does n't end in a draw .
even then , france would only advance if it had a superior goal difference to that game 's loser .

since the unearthing of an embarrassing error in the most recent ipcc report - the statement that the himalayan glaciers might be gone by 2035 - the hunt for further ipcc blunders has been on , drawing in scientists , bloggers and journalists from all over the world .
yet some experts argue that , the occasional scandal aside , climate change is a subject that receives relatively little media attention .
three years ago , dortmund university professor of journalism holger wormer described climate change as a " shooting star " topic for the media .
at the time , he and others in the scientific and journalistic communities had big ideas about the role the media could play in the struggle against global warming .
falling by the wayside bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental disasters could be drawing media attention away from climate change today , according to wormer , climate change is a topic that has fallen from editorial grace .
" we now have a lot of other things on our agenda , things that are developing and that have more impact than they did three years ago , for example the financial crisis , " he said .
" these things have pushed reporting on climate change into the background . "
wormer said that with other , more pressing environmental stories on the table - the gulf of mexico oil spill , or , in germany , recurring discussions over nuclear energy - the " slow and steady " threat of climate change has been pushed to the side and is now a topic that appears more often in the context of wider environmental or political coverage .
" i think we started a bit too late with serious reporting on the topic .
the reporting increased significantly only when there was more interest in climate change in the political agenda , " he said .
wormer 's concern appears to be backed up by the numbers .
last year , researchers from the university of liverpool in the uk released the results of an exhaustive study of climate change coverage in british newspapers .
they found that between 2000 and 2006 , the number of articles addressing climate change was modest : coverage peaked at around 100 articles per month .
" just to give you a comparison , the number of stories on health or crime were at about 400 to 500 stories per month the whole way through the period , " said neil gavin , a senior lecturer in politics at the university of liverpool and lead researcher of the study .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stories on emissions trading schemes are relegated to the business pages big topics still ' niche ' gavin , who has written and researched extensively on the relationship between climate change and the media , said even fewer journalists were attempting to tackle climate change-related topics like emissions trading schemes -lrb- etss -rrb- , the market-based approach to controlling pollution that provides big emitters with economic incentives to reduce polluting emissions , or peak oil , the point at which global petroleum discovery will peak , after which production will go into permanent decline .
when these terms do appear in newspapers , he said , they tend to be treated as niche topics , appearing in the business pages rather than in the news section of papers .
this has implications for accountability , he said .
in the european union , a major ets has been in place since 2005 and has already entered into its second phase , but gavin said his research recorded only around 20 mentions of the scheme between 2000 and 2006 .
" where is the accountability of the european union ?
what kind of corners -lsb- could be -rsb- being cut in phase two and three ? "
what 's more , the liverpool researchers found that in some newspapers , a significant amount of what little coverage appeared was focused on skeptical reporting .
" in the top-selling newspapers like the telegraph , daily mail , the sun and their sunday sister papers , 25 percent of the coverage ran along climate skeptic lines , " said gavin .
wormer said that despite recent revelations of mistakes in the ipcc reports , there is n't necessarily any reason for journalists to give more attention to climate skepticism .
" we should also be aware of the huge amount of pressure , the lobbying and the pr that goes into trying to -lsb- create -rsb- doubts over the science , " he said , citing the similar levels of pressure and skepticism in the last century over whether cigarettes posed a health hazard .
' keep it simple ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hedegaard says journalists can help by sticking to the facts connie hedegaard , the eu commissioner for climate action and the former danish minister for climate and energy , said the role journalists can play in helping to tackle climate change is a simple one .
" i think the media could help a lot by simply communicating the facts , " she said .
" and take care that when you have one or two errors in a huge report done by thousands of scientists not to communicate the message as if one or two errors would change the whole finding of the -lsb- report -rsb- .
i think it 's very important here to get the proportions right . "
hedegaard , herself a former television journalist , said while it would be wrong for the media to ignore climate skepticism altogether , it is also wrong to uncritically accept skepticism in the name of balance .
" the easiest thing in the world is to invite a guest who says that the planet is flat , and somebody who says , no , it 's round .
and the reporter 's job there is not just to hold the microphone and say , ' ok , a says it 's flat , the other one says it 's round , " ' she said .
" it is sometimes also -lsb- necessary -rsb- to be equipped to say something is factual , something is right and something is wrong ; " she said . " that is not being biased ; that 's just to help the listeners , the viewers and the readers to orient themselves in a jungle of information . "

but what is jundullah , what does it want - and who is behind it ?
it was founded in 2002 to defend the baluchi minority in the poor , remote and lawless region of south-east iran .
its leader , abdolmalek rigi , denies the group has either foreign links or a separatist agenda .
in an interview in october 2008 , he said the group - also known as the people 's resistance movement - was not interested in trying to break away from iran .
it simply wanted the state to respect the human rights , culture and faith of the baluchis .
nation without a state the baluchis in iran - and their brethren across the border in pakistan - see themselves , rather like the kurds , as a nation without a state .
but in predominantly shia iran , the issue is complicated by the fact that they are sunni muslim .
this has led them to claim sectarian persecution - and the iranian authorities to accuse them of being in league with foreigners .
the list of powers alleged to be supporting them is a long one .
it includes the united states , britain , pakistan and saudi arabia - and militant groups such as the taliban and al-qaeda .
during the bush administration , there were allegations - for example , by the investigative journalist seymour hersh - that the cia was supporting iran 's baluchi , kurdish and arab minorities to undermine the islamic republic .
if there was such a policy , it is not clear if the obama administration has scrapped it .
it was quick to condemn sunday 's attack as an " act of terrorism " .
an al-qaeda link ?
the iranians also suspect covert support for jundullah is coming from pakistan 's powerful intelligence service , the isi .
but the two states have in the past co-operated in suppressing baluchi nationalism - and also have important economic ties - so it seems unlikely pakistan would want to antagonise its powerful neighbour .
as for the saudis , given their resentment of iran 's newly enhanced role in the middle east , it is not impossible some quiet assistance is going to sunni groups like jundullah .
less plausible is a link to al-qaeda .
although jundullah has recently adopted the jihadi tactic of suicide bombings , it seems more accurate to characterise it is a nationalist group with local grievances than part of bin laden 's global jihad .
