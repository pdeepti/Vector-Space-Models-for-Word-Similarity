the german company had advised shareholders to reject the initial offer as undervalued . spain 's acs has revised its offer for hochtief , raising an earlier bid that germany 's biggest construction company advised shareholders to reject .
now hochtief says it is open to talks with its spanish rival .
the spanish concern has been stalking hochtief since september .
two weeks ago it made an official takeover bid that put the german group in a defensive crouch .
on wednesday , acs raised its share-swap offer to exchange nine acs shares for every five hochtief shares .
its previous bid offered a ratio of eight to five .
hochtief categorically rejected the acs bid made on december 1 , saying it did not make sense from either a financial or strategic standpoint .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a state-backed investment company from qatar bought a 9.1 percent stake the initial takeover bid was worth around 2.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- .
the new offer is 12.5 percent higher .
it values each hochtief share at 63.80 euros , which is two percent below the market price . defensive moves hochtief ceo herbert luetkestratkoetter had described that first bid as " decidedly unfriendly , " but on wednesday he said his company was prepared to enter fresh talks with the spanish group .
up to this point , luetkestratkoetter has sought to ward off the takeover attempt , appealing to regulators for protection and entering into a capital-raising deal with qatar , in an attempt to dilute acs ' stake in hochtief .
that move make it harder for the spaniards to get above the 30 percent threshold necessary to further hochtief stocks on the open market .
acs currently owns a 27.2 percent stake in hochtief and has said its goal is a 50 percent controlling share .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief employees protest a hostile takeover by acs , fearing job losses acs has said it is not interested in breaking up hochtief and that it plans to keep the company 's headquarters in the city of essen .
but acs i under no legal obligation to refrain from cuts should it gain control of the concern .
hochtief 's works council warned that a takeover could mean job losses , most of which would be felt in germany .
the company employs around 11,000 people .
union leaders say any change of ownership would put up to 15,000 jobs at supplying firm on the line as well .

" we all share the same objective : to ensure a stable europe and currency , " german chancellor angela merkel said describing the future euro crisis umbrella a " big piece of solidarity between the states that share the euro . "
greek prime minister george papandreou , whose country was the first to need a multi-billion euro bailout from brussels , said all eu members had to stand together now .
" the challenge today is not what we as member states or nations are doing to shore up our individual economy , the challenge is a collective one now , " he said .
as if to underscore the urgency of the matter , the european central bank on thursday announced it has decided to double its capital base by the end of the year to cope with increased credit risk and market volatility .
divergent opinions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has argued against euro bonds but while there may be a collective resolve to protect the eurozone , there is no consensus on the way forward : differences exist between member states , between parties and between european institutions .
this recently prompted european commission president jose manuel barroso to call on the european parliament to demonstrate - above all - unity .
" what we do not need is a beauty pageant of heads of state and government , " he said , " a cacophony of different scenarios and proclamations without an outcome . "
however , statements made by members of the european parliament on the issue have pointed to anything but unity .
belgian politician guy verhofstadt , who leads the liberal faction in the european parliament , attempted to pin down what he believed was the central problem of the monetary union .
" nowhere in the world is there a currency that is not supported by a government , an economic strategy and a bond market , " he said , going on to call for common euro bonds , termed e-bonds , as well as more mutual coordination on european economic and budgetary policy .
however , the government of germany , europe 's largest economy , rejects this idea - and is n't alone on this issue .
two sides to every coin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso called for unity on the euro bonds debate martin schulz , the head of the socialists in the european parliament , bemoans what he calls a crisis of confidence in europe , in which governments only reveal economic truths piecemeal , whether they concern the greek debt crisis or a financial rescue fund .
" it 's a heavy jolt to the trust in governments when the tell the public that all is well and that everything is under control one minute , and then suddenly , overnight , come out and say we need countless billions in aid , " he said .
but while schulz calls for solidarity with debt-laden countries like greece and ireland , conservatives are arguing for the exact opposite .
belgian politician derk jan eppink harkened back to statements by the flemish separatist bart de wever , who names the flemish transfer of public funds to the relatively poor walloons as the chief cause for discontent among the flemish .
eppink believes his divided country can act as a warning to europe : " we have turned a relationship based on partnership -lsb- between walloons and flemish -rsb- into one based on transfer -lsb- from one side to the other -rsb- .
" if europe continues to proceed in the same way , in a few years the eu will find itself in the same position as belgium : a community based on transfers , whose political basis is crumbling . "
but in the debate about how best to stabilize the eurozone , one thing is clear : no matter what course of action is chosen , it will be expensive , for everyone involved .

despite a good start , the germans could only manage a draw against their rivals for second place in the group , sevilla . bundesliga leaders borussia dortmund 's hopes of progress in the europa league were dashed on wednesday night when a vital breakthrough goal proved elusive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things looked good at first , with an early dortmund goal from kagawa in their soccer clash with sevilla , dortmund needed a win if they were to seize second place in group j from the spaniards .
japanese striker shinji kagawa gave dortmund an early lead after four minutes after he picked up the ball from a loose clearance by sevilla defender julian escude .

" we all share the same objective : to ensure a stable europe and currency , " german chancellor angela merkel said describing the future euro crisis umbrella a " big piece of solidarity between the states that share the euro . "
greek prime minister george papandreou , whose country was the first to need a multi-billion euro bailout from brussels , said all eu members had to stand together now .
" the challenge today is not what we as member states or nations are doing to shore up our individual economy , the challenge is a collective one now , " he said .
as if to underscore the urgency of the matter , the european central bank on thursday announced it has decided to double its capital base by the end of the year to cope with increased credit risk and market volatility .
divergent opinions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has argued against euro bonds but while there may be a collective resolve to protect the eurozone , there is no consensus on the way forward : differences exist between member states , between parties and between european institutions .
this recently prompted european commission president jose manuel barroso to call on the european parliament to demonstrate - above all - unity .
" what we do not need is a beauty pageant of heads of state and government , " he said , " a cacophony of different scenarios and proclamations without an outcome . "
however , statements made by members of the european parliament on the issue have pointed to anything but unity .
belgian politician guy verhofstadt , who leads the liberal faction in the european parliament , attempted to pin down what he believed was the central problem of the monetary union .
" nowhere in the world is there a currency that is not supported by a government , an economic strategy and a bond market , " he said , going on to call for common euro bonds , termed e-bonds , as well as more mutual coordination on european economic and budgetary policy .
however , the government of germany , europe 's largest economy , rejects this idea - and is n't alone on this issue .
two sides to every coin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso called for unity on the euro bonds debate martin schulz , the head of the socialists in the european parliament , bemoans what he calls a crisis of confidence in europe , in which governments only reveal economic truths piecemeal , whether they concern the greek debt crisis or a financial rescue fund .
" it 's a heavy jolt to the trust in governments when the tell the public that all is well and that everything is under control one minute , and then suddenly , overnight , come out and say we need countless billions in aid , " he said .
but while schulz calls for solidarity with debt-laden countries like greece and ireland , conservatives are arguing for the exact opposite .
belgian politician derk jan eppink harkened back to statements by the flemish separatist bart de wever , who names the flemish transfer of public funds to the relatively poor walloons as the chief cause for discontent among the flemish .
eppink believes his divided country can act as a warning to europe : " we have turned a relationship based on partnership -lsb- between walloons and flemish -rsb- into one based on transfer -lsb- from one side to the other -rsb- .
" if europe continues to proceed in the same way , in a few years the eu will find itself in the same position as belgium : a community based on transfers , whose political basis is crumbling . "
but in the debate about how best to stabilize the eurozone , one thing is clear : no matter what course of action is chosen , it will be expensive , for everyone involved .

despite threats from anti-nuclear protesters , there have only been minor delays . the nuclear-waste transport from a research center in southern france is heading towards a storage facility in lubmin in northern germany with only minor hold-ups .
unlike previous trains carrying nuclear waste , the transport has had a relatively easy journey through france and western germany , although it was interrupted briefly by anti-nuclear demonstrators .
the shipment is scheduled to arrive at its destination on thursday .
the train is carrying four containers with around 2,500 spent fuel rods , that are originally from a research facility in the southwestern german city of karlsruhe that went offline in 1991 , and the research vessel otto hahn , which has n't been used since 1979 .
potential for disruption the last few kilometers could be the most challenging for the transport , as protesters gathered outside lubmin on thursday morning , prepared to stage sit-in protests on the tracks .
greenpeace activists managed to unfurl a banner reading " stop transports to lubmin " from a bridge over the rail track near the train 's final destination .
around 200 demonstrators camped for a few hours overnight at three sites outside lubmin , with activists planning to move towards the railway tracks in the course of the morning .
the train began its journey on tuesday evening in the southern french region of aix-en-provence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police searched the tracks before the train passed the transport has made a number of scheduled stops , to allow for staff changes .
shortly before midnight on wednesday the train was held up by anti-nuclear demonstrators near the town of erfurt , but only for a couple of minutes .
around 20 protesters had managed to get close to the tracks .
in the early hours of the morning the train was held up again , apparently because of a technical problem .
easier than gorleben so far this latest transport of nuclear waste has met with noticeably less resistance than a similar shipment five weeks ago , which was travelling from france to another storage facility near the northern german town of gorleben .
that transport was met with massive protests , with tens of thousands of nuclear-energy opponents physically preventing the passage of the train .
around 20,000 police officers were deployed in the operation , and that train was delayed by around 24 hours .
police believe that the freezing december temperatures and heavy snowfall across much of germany have kept protesters away this time round .
a few dozen detemined protesters have tried to disrupt the passage , but the scale of the demonstrations have been much smaller than five weeks ago .

" it 's a heavy jolt to the trust in governments when the tell the public that all is well and that everything is under control one minute , and then suddenly , overnight , come out and say we need countless billions in aid , " he said .
but while schulz calls for solidarity with debt-laden countries like greece and ireland , conservatives are arguing for the exact opposite .
belgian politician derk jan eppink harkened back to statements by the flemish separatist bart de wever , who names the flemish transfer of public funds to the relatively poor walloons as the chief cause for discontent among the flemish .
eppink believes his divided country can act as a warning to europe : " we have turned a relationship based on partnership -lsb- between walloons and flemish -rsb- into one based on transfer -lsb- from one side to the other -rsb- .
" if europe continues to proceed in the same way , in a few years the eu will find itself in the same position as belgium : a community based on transfers , whose political basis is crumbling . "
but in the debate about how best to stabilize the eurozone , one thing is clear : no matter what course of action is chosen , it will be expensive , for everyone involved .

all german troops should be out of the country by the end of 2014 . foreign minister guido westerwelle has announced that german troops will start withdrawing from afghanistan in a year 's time .
" at the end of 2011 we 'll be able to start reducing our bundeswehr deployment in afghanistan , " westerwelle told the lower house of parliament , the bundestag on thursday .
the minister went further than a progress report on germany 's mission in afghanistan , which said the withdrawal might not begin until the start of 2012 .
westerwelle also told the bundestag that the mission in afghanistan was about defending germany 's security .
" that is why this deployment is the right thing to do .
but it must not go on without end , and that is also the right thing , " he said .
report shows work needs doing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle said the afghan mission could not go on indefinitely the statement was based on the 108-page progress report issued earlier this week in which berlin assessed what had been achieved in the nine years since it first sent soldiers to afghanistan to prevent the taliban from returning to power .
the government is seeking a fresh authorization from parliament in january for the deployment , which has a limit of about 5,000 personnel .
the commitment to start reducing the overall number in late 2011 is aimed at winning over public skepticism in germany about the mission .
as far as the current situation in afghanistan is concerned , westerwelle said there was " light , but there are still too many shadows . "
he said , however , that there was reason to believe that the international community would reach its goals in afghanistan .
according to the progress report , there has to be a longer-term military and civil engagement in afghanistan on the part of international forces .
gernot erler of the opposition social democrats praised the timing of the report .
he said that members of the bundestag " definitely " needed better information in order to make the difficult decision in january .

he cited the danger of corruption in the north of the country .

zu guttenberg added there were no concrete plans for the withdrawal of the bundeswehr in the north of afghanistan .
by contrast , his cabinet colleague guido westerwelle was more specific on thursday .
he told the bundestag that deployments in the north of afghanistan would be among the first regions to be handed over to afghan command in the first half of 2011 .
nato decided in lisbon last month to end the military mission in afghanistan by the end of 2014 , if the security situation allows for it .
westerwelle confirmed that he expected that there would be no more german troops in afghanistan beyond 2014 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de kosovo -pipe- 16.12.2010 kosovo report casts dark shadow over leader 's wartime past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thaci was a leader in the kosovo liberation army the council of europe is gearing up thursday to endorse a new report by its special rapporteur accusing leaders of the tiny balkan nation of kosovo of serious human rights violations after the 1998-99 kosovo war . the council of europe shone a bright light on the young republic of kosovo this week , with a damning report accusing its leadership of having been at the helm of criminal acts after the country 's war of independence from serbia in the late 1990s .
the report , compiled by special council rapporteur dick marty , implicates incumbent prime minister hashim thaci and other former members of the kosovo liberation army -lrb- kla -rrb- in organ and drug trafficking during and after the kosovo war .
it argues that thaci was a mafia-style boss who helped set up and run some of these networks .
it also links former kla leaders with organized crime groups in kosovo and in neighboring albania , and says they were implicit in assassinations and beatings .
the council of europe is an independent organization with 47 member states that works alongside the european union .
it has a particular emphasis on european integration , human rights and democratic development .
naturally , the kosovo government has denied the allegations , threatening legal and political action in response .
tainted leadership ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many thousands were killed in the kosovo war focus in the matter has now shifted to how the marty report might affect thaci 's leadership of the small nation , and the status of its fragile independence .
foreign affairs expert dusan reljic of the german institute for international and security affairs says this is not the first time these kinds of accusations have been leveled against kosovo leaders like prime minister thaci .
" the current wisdom was that a lot of the leading politicians in kosovo and in the region were part of the problem , " reljic told deutsche welle .
" so in the case of prime minister thaci , again and again there have been not only rumors , but accusations in the public , also in some confidential reports to certain governments … in which he was linked to organized crime and also with this terrible case of harvesting human organs . "
many kosovo observers say the report is n't likely to affect the tiny country 's hopes of eventually joining the european union , which is decades away if at all .
but reljic says that if dick marty 's report is endorsed by the council of europe it could greatly complicate kosovo 's relations with the western nations that underpin its independence .
" after this uproar in the international media , it will certainly be more difficult to maintain … that mr. thaci contributes to stability in the region , " reljic said .
" but whether western powers will drop him will very much depend on their analysis of the situation and whether they see other political actors , political leaders in kosovo who could take over in the government . "
secretive past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo declared independence from serbia in early 2008 lawrence marzouk , who is based in pristina as kosovo editor for the balkan investigative reporting network , said neither the kosovo government , opposition groups nor civil society have scrambled to address the contents of the report , which , he said , are sensitive matters for most kosovo albanians .
" it 's that it remains an incredibly taboo issue that people do n't want to talk about , mainly because of this status that the kosovo liberation army obviously has in kosovo , as freedom fighters , as liberators , " he told deutsche welle .
" there is still an enormous amount of respect for these people who fought to free kosovo . "
marzouk adds that investigators faced an uphill battle to force a rethink of the kla 's actions during the war .
" the line from the kla has always been that they fought a clean war , and that there was no wrong-doing , and that 's a line that most people take publically . "
dick marty 's 27-page report will be presented to the council of europe 's legal affairs committee on thursday for adoption .
if it is endorsed , it will then be up for debate at the next parliamentary assembly in january .
kosovo 's eu justice mission , meanwhile , has already announced it would examine the allegations .
such momentum could heap more pressure on hashim thaci and the kosovo government , and perhaps force a rethink of the country 's wartime past .

the german company had advised shareholders to reject the initial offer as undervalued . spain 's acs has revised its offer for hochtief , raising an earlier bid that germany 's biggest construction company advised shareholders to reject .
now hochtief says it is open to talks with its spanish rival .
the spanish concern has been stalking hochtief since september .
two weeks ago it made an official takeover bid that put the german group in a defensive crouch .
on wednesday , acs raised its share-swap offer to exchange nine acs shares for every five hochtief shares .
its previous bid offered a ratio of eight to five .
hochtief categorically rejected the acs bid made on december 1 , saying it did not make sense from either a financial or strategic standpoint .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a state-backed investment company from qatar bought a 9.1 percent stake the initial takeover bid was worth around 2.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- .
the new offer is 12.5 percent higher .
it values each hochtief share at 63.80 euros , which is two percent below the market price . defensive moves hochtief ceo herbert luetkestratkoetter had described that first bid as " decidedly unfriendly , " but on wednesday he said his company was prepared to enter fresh talks with the spanish group .
up to this point , luetkestratkoetter has sought to ward off the takeover attempt , appealing to regulators for protection and entering into a capital-raising deal with qatar , in an attempt to dilute acs ' stake in hochtief .
that move make it harder for the spaniards to get above the 30 percent threshold necessary to further hochtief stocks on the open market .
acs currently owns a 27.2 percent stake in hochtief and has said its goal is a 50 percent controlling share .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief employees protest a hostile takeover by acs , fearing job losses acs has said it is not interested in breaking up hochtief and that it plans to keep the company 's headquarters in the city of essen .
but acs i under no legal obligation to refrain from cuts should it gain control of the concern .
hochtief 's works council warned that a takeover could mean job losses , most of which would be felt in germany .
the company employs around 11,000 people .
union leaders say any change of ownership would put up to 15,000 jobs at supplying firm on the line as well .

now , scientists in germany have proven that there are also similarities on the level of gene expression . what do a fish and a mouse have in common ?
not much , most people would say .
yet , if you look at them at a certain stage in their embryonic development , you can hardly distinguish the two .
but this is hardly a new idea - the founder of embryology karl ernst von baer observed this in the 19th century .
" it 's a question scientists have tried to explain ever since these similarities were first observed " , said pavel tomancak , a researcher at the max planck institute of molecular cell biology and genetics in dresden , in an interview with deutsche welle .
in a new paper published last week in the journal nature , scientists in germany have proven that embryos from different species do n't just look the same - there are striking parallels between individual development and the development of a species on the level of gene expression , too .
21st century science confirms 19th century hunch german biologist ernst haeckel in 1866 took it a step further by postulating that at some point human embryos look like the embroys of fish species , he noticed , and since fish were seen as an evolutionary more primitive animal form than humans he proposed that they must all have the same ancestral features of some 600 million years ago .
his theory : the development of an organism mirrors the evolutionary development of the species , or as evolutionary biologists put it : " ontogeny recapitulating phylogeny . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : different fruit fly species are strikingly similar also on the level of gene expression the findings were of a mere qualitative nature , of course : the scientists in the 19th century were drawing their conclusions from what they saw .
in the 20th century , this qualitiative method was largely abandoned , most scientists stopped looking at the morphology and tried to find quantitative proof for their theories .
the second half of the 20th century were an important time for molecular science , with remarkable progress being made in the field of gene and dna analysis .
scientists were able to look at embryos before their phylotypic stage , which is the middle of the embryonic development .
the " waist " of the hourglass they noticed that there were differences before and after the phylotypic stage and came up with what came to be known as the " hourglass model . "
species-specific differences predominate before and after the phylotypic stage , so the phylotypic stage represents the " waist " of the hourglass .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advances in molecular science meant darwin 's theory could be checked quantitatively the question as to how this extensive morphological similarity - the " waist of the hourglass " - arises is one that preoccupied pavel tomancak and his colleagues from the max-planck-institute in dresden .
in a process of one and a half years his team collected samples of embryos of six fruit fly species , and measured gene expression across the genome at different times of embroygenesis .
the analysis took another year .
what they found was that there was a very strong pattern .
" we knew we 'd discovered something very early on " , lead scientist pavel tomancak told deutsche welle .
tomancak 's team found that not only in morphology but also in the expression pattern of the genes , the similarities between embryos of different species in one animal phylum are greatest during the phylotypic stage .
before and after this phase , the differences between the species are greater .
" darwin had a point " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naturalists like carl ernst von baer were the forefathers of the " hourglass theory " but the question remained : which model could be applied to prove that they were right ?
the pattern was so strong that it could n't be random , tomancak observed .
" we found that natural selection constrains genes most strongly during the phylotypic stage " , he told deutsche welle .
the results show that the similarity between different animal species in the middle of their embryonic development is shaped by selection .
their discoveries throw new light on an age-old biological conundrum : that of the link between ontogeny and phylogeny .
" our discovery confirms the earlier anatomical studies and broadens our understanding of how development and evolution are linked at molecular level " , said alex t. kalinka , a researcher from the dresden group , in an interview with the journal , nature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at a certain stage , human embryos look just like fish embryos in a different study , researchers at the max-planck-institute for evolutionary biology in ploen demonstrated with zebrafish that the phylogenetically oldest genes are active during the phylotypic stage and that , before and after this stage , the most active genes are those that arose later in evolutionary history .
the scientists also found something else : in adult zebrafish progressively older genes are also activated with the increasing age of the animals .
they found the same to be true in fruit flies and threadworms .
as a follow-up the researchers in dresden are thinking about manipulating genes at the phylotypic stage to see what happens .
while fossils allow scientists to look at what species looked like when they were living on our planet .
" our findings are like a time machine , we can look at what the genome was like 600 million years ago , " tomancak said .

us president barack obama presented a review of the situation one year since the us launched a new strategy . us president barack obama on thursday said nato troops in afghanistan were making good progress in their fight against taliban insurgents , but cautioned that " gains are still fragile and reversible . "
obama presented a review of the progress made since washington outlined a new strategy one year ago , when obama had ordered 30,000 more troops to afghanistan .
the revised strategy also stepped up civilian efforts to strengthen the local government in kabul .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamid karzai did not always live up to us expectations " it continues to be a very difficult endeavor .
but i can report that , thanks to the extraordinary service of our troops and civilians on the ground , we are on track to achieve our goals . "
currently there are around 90,000 us soldiers stationed in the country as part of the nato contingent , as well as another 23,000 under washington 's immediate command .
al qaeda remains the enemy the main goal of the operation was not to cover the entire country or rebuild it , but to crack down on the al qaeda network hiding in afghanistan , obama said .
in that respect , he added , substantial progress had been made .
" al qaeda is hunkered down .
it will take time to ultimately defeat al qaeda and it remains a ruthless and resilient enemy bent on attacking our country .
but make no mistake we 're going to remain relentless in disrupting and dismantling that terrorist organization . "
the report outlined major gains that had been made in clearing the taliban from the kandahar and helmand provinces while at the same time improving the capability of the afghan army and security forces .
nato forces plan to hand over security responsibility to kabul in 2014 in order to subsequently take on a training and advisory role .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato troops hope to hand over to afghan forces in 2014 close ties to kabul and islamabad the us president called upon the afghan government to implement more transparency and announced a new american-afghan partnership deal in the coming year .
this seems to indicate a move away from the recent harsh criticism of president hamid karzai for his government 's inefficiency in backing nato efforts to defeat the taliban .
obama also stressed the importance of washington 's close cooperation with pakistan in addressing the growing problem of islamist insurgents seeking refuge in mountains along the afghan-pakistani border .
" nevertheless , progress has not come fast enough , so we will continue to insist to pakistani leaders that terrorist safe havens within their borders must be dealt with .
we 'll speed up our investment in civilian institutions and projects that improve the lives of pakistanis , " obama said .
improving relations with islamabad is seen as key in the new strategy deny .
the us congress last year approved a $ 7.5 billion-package -lrb- 5.7 billion euros -rrb- to support aid to the frontline country .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things looked good at first , with an early dortmund goal from kagawa in their soccer clash with sevilla , dortmund needed a win if they were to seize second place in group j from the spaniards .
japanese striker shinji kagawa gave dortmund an early lead after four minutes after he picked up the ball from a loose clearance by sevilla defender julian escude .
kagawa then directed the ball precisely past goalkeeper andres palop , giving his side a dream start .
things went rapidly downhill after 31 minutes and consistent pressure from sevilla culminated in a goal for ndri romaric following an error in defense from dortmund 's lukasz piszcek .
two minutes later , sevilla went ahead with a glancing header by frederic kanoute - at the end of a cross from midfielder diego perotti .
dortmund 's hopes were raised after half time when a corner from nuri sahin found neven subotic , who headed past palop to bring the scores level .
efforts fail to pay off despite efforts from dortmund to pull ahead , chances were few and far-between and sevilla held onto the draw .
the result meant sevilla progress to the final 32 of the competition with 10 points - two behind leaders paris st. germain .

all german troops should be out of the country by the end of 2014 . foreign minister guido westerwelle has announced that german troops will start withdrawing from afghanistan in a year 's time .
" at the end of 2011 we 'll be able to start reducing our bundeswehr deployment in afghanistan , " westerwelle told the lower house of parliament , the bundestag on thursday .
the minister went further than a progress report on germany 's mission in afghanistan , which said the withdrawal might not begin until the start of 2012 .
westerwelle also told the bundestag that the mission in afghanistan was about defending germany 's security .
" that is why this deployment is the right thing to do .
but it must not go on without end , and that is also the right thing , " he said .
report shows work needs doing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle said the afghan mission could not go on indefinitely the statement was based on the 108-page progress report issued earlier this week in which berlin assessed what had been achieved in the nine years since it first sent soldiers to afghanistan to prevent the taliban from returning to power .
the government is seeking a fresh authorization from parliament in january for the deployment , which has a limit of about 5,000 personnel .
the commitment to start reducing the overall number in late 2011 is aimed at winning over public skepticism in germany about the mission .
as far as the current situation in afghanistan is concerned , westerwelle said there was " light , but there are still too many shadows . "
he said , however , that there was reason to believe that the international community would reach its goals in afghanistan .
according to the progress report , there has to be a longer-term military and civil engagement in afghanistan on the part of international forces .
gernot erler of the opposition social democrats praised the timing of the report .
he said that members of the bundestag " definitely " needed better information in order to make the difficult decision in january .
however , erler criticized the fact that the report did not contain a critical assessment of german activities in afghanistan .
he cited the danger of corruption in the north of the country .
defense minister more vague about timing in comparison to westerwelle , the german defense minister , karl-theodor zu guttenberg , has been reluctant to name a date for the withdrawal of german troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zu guttenberg visited soldiers in afghanistan earlier this week " i 'm not the kind of person who says ' next year we 're going to withdraw soldiers here or there , " ' zu guttenberg told the german news website spiegel online on monday .
" that would be irresponsible . "
zu guttenberg added there were no concrete plans for the withdrawal of the bundeswehr in the north of afghanistan .
by contrast , his cabinet colleague guido westerwelle was more specific on thursday .
he told the bundestag that deployments in the north of afghanistan would be among the first regions to be handed over to afghan command in the first half of 2011 .
nato decided in lisbon last month to end the military mission in afghanistan by the end of 2014 , if the security situation allows for it .
westerwelle confirmed that he expected that there would be no more german troops in afghanistan beyond 2014 .

but there 's another side to the coin .
wages in germany have stagnated , and the crisis is not entirely to blame . while the german economy is experiencing near record growth in the wake of the global economic crisis in sharp contrast to other european countries , there is a darker side to the country 's economic development - wage stagnation .
while in most other industrialized countries wages over the past 10 years have risen by 25 percent on average , wages in germany have fallen .
from 2000 to 2009 , real incomes among german workers fell by 4.5 percent , according to numbers adjusted for inflation and released by the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- on wednesday .
even though wages in other countries over the past few years have increased , the economic crisis has had a drastic slowing effect .
while , workers around the world saw wage increases of 2.8 percent in 2006 and 2007 , that growth slowed to around 1.5 percent in 2008 and 2009 .
according to the ilo , the bill for the global financial crisis has been paid by workers , particularly when considering the number of unemployed .
compared to 2007 , the number of jobless worldwide rose last year by about 30 million to 207 million .
the price of growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany , europe 's ' economic locomotive , ' is going full steam , but wages are n't keeping up none of the world 's leading industrialized countries is better positioned competitively than germany .
europe 's economic locomotive has charged out of financial meltdown , thanks in large part to its more flexible labor market .
one example of the flexibility is state-subsidized " short-time " work , known in german as kurzarbeit .
under this plan , companies do not fire employees during times of crisis , but shorten their hours and pay instead .
therefore employees become less of a load on companies ' accounts but do n't end up in the unemployment line .
their salaries are partially paid by their companies , and then topped off by the federal labor agency .
the plan helped keep germany 's unemployment rate under control during the peak of the financial crisis , and has received praise from the ilo .
through " intelligent labor market instruments " and " positive dialog with social partners , " employment rates remained fairly stable and wages fell only slightly , the organization said .
the short-time work rules were a " good investment " that prevented layoffs and helped support domestic demand .
bildunterschrift : less security but that flexible labor market also saw the number of people with permanent contracts fall in recent years – even before the crisis .
more people are working in so-called mini-jobs and other temporary arrangements .
the wages paid by such jobs are often not enough for workers to live on .
these kinds of developments , together with agreements between unions and employers on small or moderate wage increases have contributed to the phenomenon of wage stagnation in germany over the last decade .
while the development has made german firms more competitive , it has not strengthened consumer demand and wage levels have become decoupled from increases in productivity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions are beginning to ask for wage increases after years of moderating their demands wage gap in other countries , such as south korea , the us and japan , wages are no longer tied to growth in productivity , according to the ilo .
while company and investment profits have grown , worker income has sunk .
the ilo demanded that rises in productivity be accompanied by wage increases and that more should be done to slow the trend toward low-wage work .
but a new dynamic is slowly being seen in wage structures , brought about largely by germany 's economic boom .
unions have begun demanding higher wages .
in the public-service sector , the demand is for a three-percent increase ; the ig bce industrial union is calling for a 6 percent increase for employees in the chemical sector ; and workers at telecommunications giant deutsche telekom want a 6.5 percent raise . the powerful ig metal union says it plans to increase its demands when it enters important wage negotiations in the spring of 2012 .

us president barack obama presented a review of the situation one year since the us launched a new strategy . us president barack obama on thursday said nato troops in afghanistan were making good progress in their fight against taliban insurgents , but cautioned that " gains are still fragile and reversible . "
obama presented a review of the progress made since washington outlined a new strategy one year ago , when obama had ordered 30,000 more troops to afghanistan .
the revised strategy also stepped up civilian efforts to strengthen the local government in kabul .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamid karzai did not always live up to us expectations " it continues to be a very difficult endeavor .
but i can report that , thanks to the extraordinary service of our troops and civilians on the ground , we are on track to achieve our goals . "
currently there are around 90,000 us soldiers stationed in the country as part of the nato contingent , as well as another 23,000 under washington 's immediate command .
al qaeda remains the enemy the main goal of the operation was not to cover the entire country or rebuild it , but to crack down on the al qaeda network hiding in afghanistan , obama said .
in that respect , he added , substantial progress had been made .
" al qaeda is hunkered down .
it will take time to ultimately defeat al qaeda and it remains a ruthless and resilient enemy bent on attacking our country .
but make no mistake we 're going to remain relentless in disrupting and dismantling that terrorist organization . "
the report outlined major gains that had been made in clearing the taliban from the kandahar and helmand provinces while at the same time improving the capability of the afghan army and security forces .
nato forces plan to hand over security responsibility to kabul in 2014 in order to subsequently take on a training and advisory role .

this seems to indicate a move away from the recent harsh criticism of president hamid karzai for his government 's inefficiency in backing nato efforts to defeat the taliban .
obama also stressed the importance of washington 's close cooperation with pakistan in addressing the growing problem of islamist insurgents seeking refuge in mountains along the afghan-pakistani border .
" nevertheless , progress has not come fast enough , so we will continue to insist to pakistani leaders that terrorist safe havens within their borders must be dealt with .

all german troops should be out of the country by the end of 2014 . foreign minister guido westerwelle has announced that german troops will start withdrawing from afghanistan in a year 's time .
" at the end of 2011 we 'll be able to start reducing our bundeswehr deployment in afghanistan , " westerwelle told the lower house of parliament , the bundestag on thursday .
the minister went further than a progress report on germany 's mission in afghanistan , which said the withdrawal might not begin until the start of 2012 .
westerwelle also told the bundestag that the mission in afghanistan was about defending germany 's security .
" that is why this deployment is the right thing to do .
but it must not go on without end , and that is also the right thing , " he said .
report shows work needs doing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle said the afghan mission could not go on indefinitely the statement was based on the 108-page progress report issued earlier this week in which berlin assessed what had been achieved in the nine years since it first sent soldiers to afghanistan to prevent the taliban from returning to power .
the government is seeking a fresh authorization from parliament in january for the deployment , which has a limit of about 5,000 personnel .
the commitment to start reducing the overall number in late 2011 is aimed at winning over public skepticism in germany about the mission .
as far as the current situation in afghanistan is concerned , westerwelle said there was " light , but there are still too many shadows . "
he said , however , that there was reason to believe that the international community would reach its goals in afghanistan .
according to the progress report , there has to be a longer-term military and civil engagement in afghanistan on the part of international forces .
gernot erler of the opposition social democrats praised the timing of the report .
he said that members of the bundestag " definitely " needed better information in order to make the difficult decision in january .
however , erler criticized the fact that the report did not contain a critical assessment of german activities in afghanistan .
he cited the danger of corruption in the north of the country .
defense minister more vague about timing in comparison to westerwelle , the german defense minister , karl-theodor zu guttenberg , has been reluctant to name a date for the withdrawal of german troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zu guttenberg visited soldiers in afghanistan earlier this week " i 'm not the kind of person who says ' next year we 're going to withdraw soldiers here or there , " ' zu guttenberg told the german news website spiegel online on monday .
" that would be irresponsible . "
zu guttenberg added there were no concrete plans for the withdrawal of the bundeswehr in the north of afghanistan .
by contrast , his cabinet colleague guido westerwelle was more specific on thursday .
he told the bundestag that deployments in the north of afghanistan would be among the first regions to be handed over to afghan command in the first half of 2011 .
nato decided in lisbon last month to end the military mission in afghanistan by the end of 2014 , if the security situation allows for it .
westerwelle confirmed that he expected that there would be no more german troops in afghanistan beyond 2014 .

the price of growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany , europe 's ' economic locomotive , ' is going full steam , but wages are n't keeping up none of the world 's leading industrialized countries is better positioned competitively than germany .
europe 's economic locomotive has charged out of financial meltdown , thanks in large part to its more flexible labor market .
one example of the flexibility is state-subsidized " short-time " work , known in german as kurzarbeit .
under this plan , companies do not fire employees during times of crisis , but shorten their hours and pay instead .
therefore employees become less of a load on companies ' accounts but do n't end up in the unemployment line .
their salaries are partially paid by their companies , and then topped off by the federal labor agency .
the plan helped keep germany 's unemployment rate under control during the peak of the financial crisis , and has received praise from the ilo .
through " intelligent labor market instruments " and " positive dialog with social partners , " employment rates remained fairly stable and wages fell only slightly , the organization said .
the short-time work rules were a " good investment " that prevented layoffs and helped support domestic demand .
bildunterschrift : less security but that flexible labor market also saw the number of people with permanent contracts fall in recent years – even before the crisis .
more people are working in so-called mini-jobs and other temporary arrangements .
the wages paid by such jobs are often not enough for workers to live on .
these kinds of developments , together with agreements between unions and employers on small or moderate wage increases have contributed to the phenomenon of wage stagnation in germany over the last decade .
while the development has made german firms more competitive , it has not strengthened consumer demand and wage levels have become decoupled from increases in productivity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions are beginning to ask for wage increases after years of moderating their demands wage gap in other countries , such as south korea , the us and japan , wages are no longer tied to growth in productivity , according to the ilo .
while company and investment profits have grown , worker income has sunk .
the ilo demanded that rises in productivity be accompanied by wage increases and that more should be done to slow the trend toward low-wage work .
but a new dynamic is slowly being seen in wage structures , brought about largely by germany 's economic boom .
unions have begun demanding higher wages .
in the public-service sector , the demand is for a three-percent increase ; the ig bce industrial union is calling for a 6 percent increase for employees in the chemical sector ; and workers at telecommunications giant deutsche telekom want a 6.5 percent raise . the powerful ig metal union says it plans to increase its demands when it enters important wage negotiations in the spring of 2012 .

but there 's another side to the coin .
wages in germany have stagnated , and the crisis is not entirely to blame . while the german economy is experiencing near record growth in the wake of the global economic crisis in sharp contrast to other european countries , there is a darker side to the country 's economic development - wage stagnation .
while in most other industrialized countries wages over the past 10 years have risen by 25 percent on average , wages in germany have fallen .
from 2000 to 2009 , real incomes among german workers fell by 4.5 percent , according to numbers adjusted for inflation and released by the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- on wednesday .
even though wages in other countries over the past few years have increased , the economic crisis has had a drastic slowing effect .
while , workers around the world saw wage increases of 2.8 percent in 2006 and 2007 , that growth slowed to around 1.5 percent in 2008 and 2009 .
according to the ilo , the bill for the global financial crisis has been paid by workers , particularly when considering the number of unemployed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de genetics -pipe- 16.12.2010 scientists in germany shed new light on embryonic development großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embryos of different species can look remarkably similar at a certain stage in their development darwin noticed striking similarities between embryos of different species .
now , scientists in germany have proven that there are also similarities on the level of gene expression . what do a fish and a mouse have in common ?
not much , most people would say .
yet , if you look at them at a certain stage in their embryonic development , you can hardly distinguish the two .
but this is hardly a new idea - the founder of embryology karl ernst von baer observed this in the 19th century .
" it 's a question scientists have tried to explain ever since these similarities were first observed " , said pavel tomancak , a researcher at the max planck institute of molecular cell biology and genetics in dresden , in an interview with deutsche welle .
in a new paper published last week in the journal nature , scientists in germany have proven that embryos from different species do n't just look the same - there are striking parallels between individual development and the development of a species on the level of gene expression , too .
21st century science confirms 19th century hunch german biologist ernst haeckel in 1866 took it a step further by postulating that at some point human embryos look like the embroys of fish species , he noticed , and since fish were seen as an evolutionary more primitive animal form than humans he proposed that they must all have the same ancestral features of some 600 million years ago .
his theory : the development of an organism mirrors the evolutionary development of the species , or as evolutionary biologists put it : " ontogeny recapitulating phylogeny . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : different fruit fly species are strikingly similar also on the level of gene expression the findings were of a mere qualitative nature , of course : the scientists in the 19th century were drawing their conclusions from what they saw .
in the 20th century , this qualitiative method was largely abandoned , most scientists stopped looking at the morphology and tried to find quantitative proof for their theories .
the second half of the 20th century were an important time for molecular science , with remarkable progress being made in the field of gene and dna analysis .
scientists were able to look at embryos before their phylotypic stage , which is the middle of the embryonic development .
the " waist " of the hourglass they noticed that there were differences before and after the phylotypic stage and came up with what came to be known as the " hourglass model . "
species-specific differences predominate before and after the phylotypic stage , so the phylotypic stage represents the " waist " of the hourglass .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advances in molecular science meant darwin 's theory could be checked quantitatively the question as to how this extensive morphological similarity - the " waist of the hourglass " - arises is one that preoccupied pavel tomancak and his colleagues from the max-planck-institute in dresden .
in a process of one and a half years his team collected samples of embryos of six fruit fly species , and measured gene expression across the genome at different times of embroygenesis .
the analysis took another year .
what they found was that there was a very strong pattern .
" we knew we 'd discovered something very early on " , lead scientist pavel tomancak told deutsche welle .
tomancak 's team found that not only in morphology but also in the expression pattern of the genes , the similarities between embryos of different species in one animal phylum are greatest during the phylotypic stage .
before and after this phase , the differences between the species are greater .
" darwin had a point " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naturalists like carl ernst von baer were the forefathers of the " hourglass theory " but the question remained : which model could be applied to prove that they were right ?
the pattern was so strong that it could n't be random , tomancak observed .
" we found that natural selection constrains genes most strongly during the phylotypic stage " , he told deutsche welle .
the results show that the similarity between different animal species in the middle of their embryonic development is shaped by selection .
their discoveries throw new light on an age-old biological conundrum : that of the link between ontogeny and phylogeny .
" our discovery confirms the earlier anatomical studies and broadens our understanding of how development and evolution are linked at molecular level " , said alex t. kalinka , a researcher from the dresden group , in an interview with the journal , nature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at a certain stage , human embryos look just like fish embryos in a different study , researchers at the max-planck-institute for evolutionary biology in ploen demonstrated with zebrafish that the phylogenetically oldest genes are active during the phylotypic stage and that , before and after this stage , the most active genes are those that arose later in evolutionary history .
the scientists also found something else : in adult zebrafish progressively older genes are also activated with the increasing age of the animals .
they found the same to be true in fruit flies and threadworms .
as a follow-up the researchers in dresden are thinking about manipulating genes at the phylotypic stage to see what happens .
while fossils allow scientists to look at what species looked like when they were living on our planet .
" our findings are like a time machine , we can look at what the genome was like 600 million years ago , " tomancak said .

the german company had advised shareholders to reject the initial offer as undervalued . spain 's acs has revised its offer for hochtief , raising an earlier bid that germany 's biggest construction company advised shareholders to reject .
now hochtief says it is open to talks with its spanish rival .
the spanish concern has been stalking hochtief since september .
two weeks ago it made an official takeover bid that put the german group in a defensive crouch .
on wednesday , acs raised its share-swap offer to exchange nine acs shares for every five hochtief shares .
its previous bid offered a ratio of eight to five .
hochtief categorically rejected the acs bid made on december 1 , saying it did not make sense from either a financial or strategic standpoint .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a state-backed investment company from qatar bought a 9.1 percent stake the initial takeover bid was worth around 2.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- .
the new offer is 12.5 percent higher .
it values each hochtief share at 63.80 euros , which is two percent below the market price . defensive moves hochtief ceo herbert luetkestratkoetter had described that first bid as " decidedly unfriendly , " but on wednesday he said his company was prepared to enter fresh talks with the spanish group .
up to this point , luetkestratkoetter has sought to ward off the takeover attempt , appealing to regulators for protection and entering into a capital-raising deal with qatar , in an attempt to dilute acs ' stake in hochtief .
that move make it harder for the spaniards to get above the 30 percent threshold necessary to further hochtief stocks on the open market .
acs currently owns a 27.2 percent stake in hochtief and has said its goal is a 50 percent controlling share .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief employees protest a hostile takeover by acs , fearing job losses acs has said it is not interested in breaking up hochtief and that it plans to keep the company 's headquarters in the city of essen .
but acs i under no legal obligation to refrain from cuts should it gain control of the concern .
hochtief 's works council warned that a takeover could mean job losses , most of which would be felt in germany .
the company employs around 11,000 people .
union leaders say any change of ownership would put up to 15,000 jobs at supplying firm on the line as well .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 16.12.2010 eu leaders agree to create permanent euro crisis fund großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders need to find a way forward for the eurozone european union leaders meeting in brussels have approved a small change to the lisbon treaty in order to create a eurozone bailout system . european union leaders on thursday agreed on a change in the bloc 's rule-book , the lisbon treaty , enabling the creation of a permanent rescue fund for eurozone countries in crisis from mid-2013 .
" we all share the same objective : to ensure a stable europe and currency , " german chancellor angela merkel said describing the future euro crisis umbrella a " big piece of solidarity between the states that share the euro . "
greek prime minister george papandreou , whose country was the first to need a multi-billion euro bailout from brussels , said all eu members had to stand together now .
" the challenge today is not what we as member states or nations are doing to shore up our individual economy , the challenge is a collective one now , " he said .
as if to underscore the urgency of the matter , the european central bank on thursday announced it has decided to double its capital base by the end of the year to cope with increased credit risk and market volatility .
divergent opinions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has argued against euro bonds but while there may be a collective resolve to protect the eurozone , there is no consensus on the way forward : differences exist between member states , between parties and between european institutions .
this recently prompted european commission president jose manuel barroso to call on the european parliament to demonstrate - above all - unity .
" what we do not need is a beauty pageant of heads of state and government , " he said , " a cacophony of different scenarios and proclamations without an outcome . "
however , statements made by members of the european parliament on the issue have pointed to anything but unity .
belgian politician guy verhofstadt , who leads the liberal faction in the european parliament , attempted to pin down what he believed was the central problem of the monetary union .
" nowhere in the world is there a currency that is not supported by a government , an economic strategy and a bond market , " he said , going on to call for common euro bonds , termed e-bonds , as well as more mutual coordination on european economic and budgetary policy .
however , the government of germany , europe 's largest economy , rejects this idea - and is n't alone on this issue .
two sides to every coin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso called for unity on the euro bonds debate martin schulz , the head of the socialists in the european parliament , bemoans what he calls a crisis of confidence in europe , in which governments only reveal economic truths piecemeal , whether they concern the greek debt crisis or a financial rescue fund .
" it 's a heavy jolt to the trust in governments when the tell the public that all is well and that everything is under control one minute , and then suddenly , overnight , come out and say we need countless billions in aid , " he said .
but while schulz calls for solidarity with debt-laden countries like greece and ireland , conservatives are arguing for the exact opposite .
belgian politician derk jan eppink harkened back to statements by the flemish separatist bart de wever , who names the flemish transfer of public funds to the relatively poor walloons as the chief cause for discontent among the flemish .
eppink believes his divided country can act as a warning to europe : " we have turned a relationship based on partnership -lsb- between walloons and flemish -rsb- into one based on transfer -lsb- from one side to the other -rsb- .
" if europe continues to proceed in the same way , in a few years the eu will find itself in the same position as belgium : a community based on transfers , whose political basis is crumbling . "
but in the debate about how best to stabilize the eurozone , one thing is clear : no matter what course of action is chosen , it will be expensive , for everyone involved .

" we all share the same objective : to ensure a stable europe and currency , " german chancellor angela merkel said describing the future euro crisis umbrella a " big piece of solidarity between the states that share the euro . "
greek prime minister george papandreou , whose country was the first to need a multi-billion euro bailout from brussels , said all eu members had to stand together now .
" the challenge today is not what we as member states or nations are doing to shore up our individual economy , the challenge is a collective one now , " he said .
as if to underscore the urgency of the matter , the european central bank on thursday announced it has decided to double its capital base by the end of the year to cope with increased credit risk and market volatility .
divergent opinions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has argued against euro bonds but while there may be a collective resolve to protect the eurozone , there is no consensus on the way forward : differences exist between member states , between parties and between european institutions .
this recently prompted european commission president jose manuel barroso to call on the european parliament to demonstrate - above all - unity .
" what we do not need is a beauty pageant of heads of state and government , " he said , " a cacophony of different scenarios and proclamations without an outcome . "
however , statements made by members of the european parliament on the issue have pointed to anything but unity .
belgian politician guy verhofstadt , who leads the liberal faction in the european parliament , attempted to pin down what he believed was the central problem of the monetary union .
" nowhere in the world is there a currency that is not supported by a government , an economic strategy and a bond market , " he said , going on to call for common euro bonds , termed e-bonds , as well as more mutual coordination on european economic and budgetary policy .
however , the government of germany , europe 's largest economy , rejects this idea - and is n't alone on this issue .
two sides to every coin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso called for unity on the euro bonds debate martin schulz , the head of the socialists in the european parliament , bemoans what he calls a crisis of confidence in europe , in which governments only reveal economic truths piecemeal , whether they concern the greek debt crisis or a financial rescue fund .
" it 's a heavy jolt to the trust in governments when the tell the public that all is well and that everything is under control one minute , and then suddenly , overnight , come out and say we need countless billions in aid , " he said .
but while schulz calls for solidarity with debt-laden countries like greece and ireland , conservatives are arguing for the exact opposite .
belgian politician derk jan eppink harkened back to statements by the flemish separatist bart de wever , who names the flemish transfer of public funds to the relatively poor walloons as the chief cause for discontent among the flemish .
eppink believes his divided country can act as a warning to europe : " we have turned a relationship based on partnership -lsb- between walloons and flemish -rsb- into one based on transfer -lsb- from one side to the other -rsb- .
" if europe continues to proceed in the same way , in a few years the eu will find itself in the same position as belgium : a community based on transfers , whose political basis is crumbling . "
but in the debate about how best to stabilize the eurozone , one thing is clear : no matter what course of action is chosen , it will be expensive , for everyone involved .

despite a good start , the germans could only manage a draw against their rivals for second place in the group , sevilla . bundesliga leaders borussia dortmund 's hopes of progress in the europa league were dashed on wednesday night when a vital breakthrough goal proved elusive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things looked good at first , with an early dortmund goal from kagawa in their soccer clash with sevilla , dortmund needed a win if they were to seize second place in group j from the spaniards .
japanese striker shinji kagawa gave dortmund an early lead after four minutes after he picked up the ball from a loose clearance by sevilla defender julian escude .
kagawa then directed the ball precisely past goalkeeper andres palop , giving his side a dream start .
things went rapidly downhill after 31 minutes and consistent pressure from sevilla culminated in a goal for ndri romaric following an error in defense from dortmund 's lukasz piszcek .
two minutes later , sevilla went ahead with a glancing header by frederic kanoute - at the end of a cross from midfielder diego perotti .
dortmund 's hopes were raised after half time when a corner from nuri sahin found neven subotic , who headed past palop to bring the scores level .
efforts fail to pay off despite efforts from dortmund to pull ahead , chances were few and far-between and sevilla held onto the draw .
the result meant sevilla progress to the final 32 of the competition with 10 points - two behind leaders paris st. germain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp said the team had only itself to blame dortmund coach juergen klopp rushed onto the field at the end of the game to prevent his players from challenging officials with allegations that sevilla players had been time-wasting .
" we brought the result on ourselves , " said klopp .
" we simply failed to get the third goal but it was possible . "

all german troops should be out of the country by the end of 2014 . foreign minister guido westerwelle has announced that german troops will start withdrawing from afghanistan in a year 's time .
" at the end of 2011 we 'll be able to start reducing our bundeswehr deployment in afghanistan , " westerwelle told the lower house of parliament , the bundestag on thursday .
the minister went further than a progress report on germany 's mission in afghanistan , which said the withdrawal might not begin until the start of 2012 .
westerwelle also told the bundestag that the mission in afghanistan was about defending germany 's security .
" that is why this deployment is the right thing to do .
but it must not go on without end , and that is also the right thing , " he said .
report shows work needs doing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle said the afghan mission could not go on indefinitely the statement was based on the 108-page progress report issued earlier this week in which berlin assessed what had been achieved in the nine years since it first sent soldiers to afghanistan to prevent the taliban from returning to power .
the government is seeking a fresh authorization from parliament in january for the deployment , which has a limit of about 5,000 personnel .
the commitment to start reducing the overall number in late 2011 is aimed at winning over public skepticism in germany about the mission .
as far as the current situation in afghanistan is concerned , westerwelle said there was " light , but there are still too many shadows . "
he said , however , that there was reason to believe that the international community would reach its goals in afghanistan .
according to the progress report , there has to be a longer-term military and civil engagement in afghanistan on the part of international forces .
gernot erler of the opposition social democrats praised the timing of the report .
he said that members of the bundestag " definitely " needed better information in order to make the difficult decision in january .
however , erler criticized the fact that the report did not contain a critical assessment of german activities in afghanistan .
he cited the danger of corruption in the north of the country .
defense minister more vague about timing in comparison to westerwelle , the german defense minister , karl-theodor zu guttenberg , has been reluctant to name a date for the withdrawal of german troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zu guttenberg visited soldiers in afghanistan earlier this week " i 'm not the kind of person who says ' next year we 're going to withdraw soldiers here or there , " ' zu guttenberg told the german news website spiegel online on monday .
" that would be irresponsible . "
zu guttenberg added there were no concrete plans for the withdrawal of the bundeswehr in the north of afghanistan .
by contrast , his cabinet colleague guido westerwelle was more specific on thursday .
he told the bundestag that deployments in the north of afghanistan would be among the first regions to be handed over to afghan command in the first half of 2011 .
nato decided in lisbon last month to end the military mission in afghanistan by the end of 2014 , if the security situation allows for it .
westerwelle confirmed that he expected that there would be no more german troops in afghanistan beyond 2014 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de genetics -pipe- 16.12.2010 scientists in germany shed new light on embryonic development großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embryos of different species can look remarkably similar at a certain stage in their development darwin noticed striking similarities between embryos of different species .
now , scientists in germany have proven that there are also similarities on the level of gene expression . what do a fish and a mouse have in common ?
not much , most people would say .
yet , if you look at them at a certain stage in their embryonic development , you can hardly distinguish the two .
but this is hardly a new idea - the founder of embryology karl ernst von baer observed this in the 19th century .
" it 's a question scientists have tried to explain ever since these similarities were first observed " , said pavel tomancak , a researcher at the max planck institute of molecular cell biology and genetics in dresden , in an interview with deutsche welle .
in a new paper published last week in the journal nature , scientists in germany have proven that embryos from different species do n't just look the same - there are striking parallels between individual development and the development of a species on the level of gene expression , too .
21st century science confirms 19th century hunch german biologist ernst haeckel in 1866 took it a step further by postulating that at some point human embryos look like the embroys of fish species , he noticed , and since fish were seen as an evolutionary more primitive animal form than humans he proposed that they must all have the same ancestral features of some 600 million years ago .
his theory : the development of an organism mirrors the evolutionary development of the species , or as evolutionary biologists put it : " ontogeny recapitulating phylogeny . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : different fruit fly species are strikingly similar also on the level of gene expression the findings were of a mere qualitative nature , of course : the scientists in the 19th century were drawing their conclusions from what they saw .
in the 20th century , this qualitiative method was largely abandoned , most scientists stopped looking at the morphology and tried to find quantitative proof for their theories .
the second half of the 20th century were an important time for molecular science , with remarkable progress being made in the field of gene and dna analysis .
scientists were able to look at embryos before their phylotypic stage , which is the middle of the embryonic development .
the " waist " of the hourglass they noticed that there were differences before and after the phylotypic stage and came up with what came to be known as the " hourglass model . "
species-specific differences predominate before and after the phylotypic stage , so the phylotypic stage represents the " waist " of the hourglass .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advances in molecular science meant darwin 's theory could be checked quantitatively the question as to how this extensive morphological similarity - the " waist of the hourglass " - arises is one that preoccupied pavel tomancak and his colleagues from the max-planck-institute in dresden .
in a process of one and a half years his team collected samples of embryos of six fruit fly species , and measured gene expression across the genome at different times of embroygenesis .
the analysis took another year .
what they found was that there was a very strong pattern .
" we knew we 'd discovered something very early on " , lead scientist pavel tomancak told deutsche welle .
tomancak 's team found that not only in morphology but also in the expression pattern of the genes , the similarities between embryos of different species in one animal phylum are greatest during the phylotypic stage .
before and after this phase , the differences between the species are greater .
" darwin had a point " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naturalists like carl ernst von baer were the forefathers of the " hourglass theory " but the question remained : which model could be applied to prove that they were right ?
the pattern was so strong that it could n't be random , tomancak observed .
" we found that natural selection constrains genes most strongly during the phylotypic stage " , he told deutsche welle .
the results show that the similarity between different animal species in the middle of their embryonic development is shaped by selection .
their discoveries throw new light on an age-old biological conundrum : that of the link between ontogeny and phylogeny .
" our discovery confirms the earlier anatomical studies and broadens our understanding of how development and evolution are linked at molecular level " , said alex t. kalinka , a researcher from the dresden group , in an interview with the journal , nature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at a certain stage , human embryos look just like fish embryos in a different study , researchers at the max-planck-institute for evolutionary biology in ploen demonstrated with zebrafish that the phylogenetically oldest genes are active during the phylotypic stage and that , before and after this stage , the most active genes are those that arose later in evolutionary history .
the scientists also found something else : in adult zebrafish progressively older genes are also activated with the increasing age of the animals .
they found the same to be true in fruit flies and threadworms .
as a follow-up the researchers in dresden are thinking about manipulating genes at the phylotypic stage to see what happens .
while fossils allow scientists to look at what species looked like when they were living on our planet .
" our findings are like a time machine , we can look at what the genome was like 600 million years ago , " tomancak said .

unlike previous trains carrying nuclear waste , the transport has had a relatively easy journey through france and western germany , although it was interrupted briefly by anti-nuclear demonstrators .
the shipment is scheduled to arrive at its destination on thursday .
the train is carrying four containers with around 2,500 spent fuel rods , that are originally from a research facility in the southwestern german city of karlsruhe that went offline in 1991 , and the research vessel otto hahn , which has n't been used since 1979 .
potential for disruption the last few kilometers could be the most challenging for the transport , as protesters gathered outside lubmin on thursday morning , prepared to stage sit-in protests on the tracks .
greenpeace activists managed to unfurl a banner reading " stop transports to lubmin " from a bridge over the rail track near the train 's final destination .
around 200 demonstrators camped for a few hours overnight at three sites outside lubmin , with activists planning to move towards the railway tracks in the course of the morning .
the train began its journey on tuesday evening in the southern french region of aix-en-provence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police searched the tracks before the train passed the transport has made a number of scheduled stops , to allow for staff changes .
shortly before midnight on wednesday the train was held up by anti-nuclear demonstrators near the town of erfurt , but only for a couple of minutes .
around 20 protesters had managed to get close to the tracks .
in the early hours of the morning the train was held up again , apparently because of a technical problem .
easier than gorleben so far this latest transport of nuclear waste has met with noticeably less resistance than a similar shipment five weeks ago , which was travelling from france to another storage facility near the northern german town of gorleben .
that transport was met with massive protests , with tens of thousands of nuclear-energy opponents physically preventing the passage of the train .
around 20,000 police officers were deployed in the operation , and that train was delayed by around 24 hours .
police believe that the freezing december temperatures and heavy snowfall across much of germany have kept protesters away this time round .
a few dozen detemined protesters have tried to disrupt the passage , but the scale of the demonstrations have been much smaller than five weeks ago .

assange is free until a ruling is made on a swedish extradition warrant . julian assange was released from jail in london on thursday evening .
british high court judge duncan ouseley handed down his decision earlier in the day , confirming a lower court 's ruling that the 39-year-old australian could be freed on 200,000 gbp bail -lrb- 236,000 euros , $ 317,000 -rrb- under strict conditions .
" i hope to continue my work and continue to protest my innocence in this matter and to reveal as we get it , which we have not yet , the evidence from these allegations , " he said in a brief statement on the steps of the high court in london . the stringent bail conditions mean that assange will be subject to electronic tagging and a curfew .
assange must also reside at a supporter 's country mansion in suffolk , eastern england , and report regularly to the police , the judge said .
the estate , ellingham hall , belongs to vaughan smith , a former british army officer who founded the frontline club , a media group in london where wikileaks has based part of its operations .
judge : not a ' fugitive from justice ' british prosecutors had been trying to keep assange behind bars until his extradition hearing , arguing that there was a risk he would flee the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assange still faces extradition on sex crime charges justice ouseley rejected that assertion , saying that the court did not view the defendant as a " fugitive from justice " who was seeking to " avoid interrogation and prosecution . "
lawyers for assange said bail money was " in the banking system " and that they expected their client to be released later in the day .
" we are expecting julian to be released some time later today .
everybody is working very hard for that , " said assange 's attorney , mark stephens .
assange has been in jail since december 7 , after he turned himself in to british police over a swedish sex crimes warrant .
two women in sweden , who are wikileaks volunteers , have accused him of rape and sexual molestation .
the australian has denied any wrongdoing and claims that the allegations are trumped up charges and politically motivated .
for their part , the two swedish women have said they were never pressured to file charges .
assange is the main force behind the release of tens of thousands of confidential us diplomatic cables , which include details of overseas sites that washington regards as vital to its national security .

" we all share the same objective : to ensure a stable europe and currency , " german chancellor angela merkel said describing the future euro crisis umbrella a " big piece of solidarity between the states that share the euro . "
greek prime minister george papandreou , whose country was the first to need a multi-billion euro bailout from brussels , said all eu members had to stand together now .
" the challenge today is not what we as member states or nations are doing to shore up our individual economy , the challenge is a collective one now , " he said .
as if to underscore the urgency of the matter , the european central bank on thursday announced it has decided to double its capital base by the end of the year to cope with increased credit risk and market volatility .
divergent opinions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has argued against euro bonds but while there may be a collective resolve to protect the eurozone , there is no consensus on the way forward : differences exist between member states , between parties and between european institutions .
this recently prompted european commission president jose manuel barroso to call on the european parliament to demonstrate - above all - unity .
" what we do not need is a beauty pageant of heads of state and government , " he said , " a cacophony of different scenarios and proclamations without an outcome . "
however , statements made by members of the european parliament on the issue have pointed to anything but unity .
belgian politician guy verhofstadt , who leads the liberal faction in the european parliament , attempted to pin down what he believed was the central problem of the monetary union .
" nowhere in the world is there a currency that is not supported by a government , an economic strategy and a bond market , " he said , going on to call for common euro bonds , termed e-bonds , as well as more mutual coordination on european economic and budgetary policy .
however , the government of germany , europe 's largest economy , rejects this idea - and is n't alone on this issue .
two sides to every coin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso called for unity on the euro bonds debate martin schulz , the head of the socialists in the european parliament , bemoans what he calls a crisis of confidence in europe , in which governments only reveal economic truths piecemeal , whether they concern the greek debt crisis or a financial rescue fund .
" it 's a heavy jolt to the trust in governments when the tell the public that all is well and that everything is under control one minute , and then suddenly , overnight , come out and say we need countless billions in aid , " he said .
but while schulz calls for solidarity with debt-laden countries like greece and ireland , conservatives are arguing for the exact opposite .
belgian politician derk jan eppink harkened back to statements by the flemish separatist bart de wever , who names the flemish transfer of public funds to the relatively poor walloons as the chief cause for discontent among the flemish .
eppink believes his divided country can act as a warning to europe : " we have turned a relationship based on partnership -lsb- between walloons and flemish -rsb- into one based on transfer -lsb- from one side to the other -rsb- .
" if europe continues to proceed in the same way , in a few years the eu will find itself in the same position as belgium : a community based on transfers , whose political basis is crumbling . "
but in the debate about how best to stabilize the eurozone , one thing is clear : no matter what course of action is chosen , it will be expensive , for everyone involved .

putin said of the 47-year-old former oil billionaire khodorkovsky , who is standing trial on charges of stealing over 200 tons of oil from his own wells , that a “ thief must be in prison . ”
" we must operate based on the fact that mr. khodorkovsky 's guilt has been proven in court , " putin said .
khodorkovsky is awaiting delivery of a verdict , which has been delayed until december 27 .

the former oil billionaire , who was a major shareholder in failed petroleum company yukos , is already serving an eight-year sentence for tax evasion , which is set to expire in 2011 .
if found guilty of the fresh charges , he could face an additional six years in prison .

" there is a need to suppress all the manifestations of extremism on all sides , " putin said .
" there should be an order , " he said .
" we are children of one country .
" society , including liberal society , must understand that there must be order and one must support the government now in power in order to support the interests of the majority , " he added putin also addressed the russian economy , which he said would grow by up to four percent this year , with an increase in real incomes thanks to pension increases .
" in the first half of 2012 we should get back to the pre-crisis level -lrb- of gross domestic product -rrb- , " he said .

the german company had advised shareholders to reject the initial offer as undervalued . spain 's acs has revised its offer for hochtief , raising an earlier bid that germany 's biggest construction company advised shareholders to reject .
now hochtief says it is open to talks with its spanish rival .
the spanish concern has been stalking hochtief since september .
two weeks ago it made an official takeover bid that put the german group in a defensive crouch .
on wednesday , acs raised its share-swap offer to exchange nine acs shares for every five hochtief shares .
its previous bid offered a ratio of eight to five .
hochtief categorically rejected the acs bid made on december 1 , saying it did not make sense from either a financial or strategic standpoint .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a state-backed investment company from qatar bought a 9.1 percent stake the initial takeover bid was worth around 2.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- .
the new offer is 12.5 percent higher .
it values each hochtief share at 63.80 euros , which is two percent below the market price . defensive moves hochtief ceo herbert luetkestratkoetter had described that first bid as " decidedly unfriendly , " but on wednesday he said his company was prepared to enter fresh talks with the spanish group .
up to this point , luetkestratkoetter has sought to ward off the takeover attempt , appealing to regulators for protection and entering into a capital-raising deal with qatar , in an attempt to dilute acs ' stake in hochtief .
that move make it harder for the spaniards to get above the 30 percent threshold necessary to further hochtief stocks on the open market .
acs currently owns a 27.2 percent stake in hochtief and has said its goal is a 50 percent controlling share .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief employees protest a hostile takeover by acs , fearing job losses acs has said it is not interested in breaking up hochtief and that it plans to keep the company 's headquarters in the city of essen .
but acs i under no legal obligation to refrain from cuts should it gain control of the concern .
hochtief 's works council warned that a takeover could mean job losses , most of which would be felt in germany .
the company employs around 11,000 people .
union leaders say any change of ownership would put up to 15,000 jobs at supplying firm on the line as well .

now , scientists in germany have proven that there are also similarities on the level of gene expression . what do a fish and a mouse have in common ?
not much , most people would say .
yet , if you look at them at a certain stage in their embryonic development , you can hardly distinguish the two .
but this is hardly a new idea - the founder of embryology karl ernst von baer observed this in the 19th century .
" it 's a question scientists have tried to explain ever since these similarities were first observed " , said pavel tomancak , a researcher at the max planck institute of molecular cell biology and genetics in dresden , in an interview with deutsche welle .
in a new paper published last week in the journal nature , scientists in germany have proven that embryos from different species do n't just look the same - there are striking parallels between individual development and the development of a species on the level of gene expression , too .
21st century science confirms 19th century hunch german biologist ernst haeckel in 1866 took it a step further by postulating that at some point human embryos look like the embroys of fish species , he noticed , and since fish were seen as an evolutionary more primitive animal form than humans he proposed that they must all have the same ancestral features of some 600 million years ago .
his theory : the development of an organism mirrors the evolutionary development of the species , or as evolutionary biologists put it : " ontogeny recapitulating phylogeny . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : different fruit fly species are strikingly similar also on the level of gene expression the findings were of a mere qualitative nature , of course : the scientists in the 19th century were drawing their conclusions from what they saw .
in the 20th century , this qualitiative method was largely abandoned , most scientists stopped looking at the morphology and tried to find quantitative proof for their theories .
the second half of the 20th century were an important time for molecular science , with remarkable progress being made in the field of gene and dna analysis .
scientists were able to look at embryos before their phylotypic stage , which is the middle of the embryonic development .
the " waist " of the hourglass they noticed that there were differences before and after the phylotypic stage and came up with what came to be known as the " hourglass model . "
species-specific differences predominate before and after the phylotypic stage , so the phylotypic stage represents the " waist " of the hourglass .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advances in molecular science meant darwin 's theory could be checked quantitatively the question as to how this extensive morphological similarity - the " waist of the hourglass " - arises is one that preoccupied pavel tomancak and his colleagues from the max-planck-institute in dresden .
in a process of one and a half years his team collected samples of embryos of six fruit fly species , and measured gene expression across the genome at different times of embroygenesis .
the analysis took another year .
what they found was that there was a very strong pattern .
" we knew we 'd discovered something very early on " , lead scientist pavel tomancak told deutsche welle .
tomancak 's team found that not only in morphology but also in the expression pattern of the genes , the similarities between embryos of different species in one animal phylum are greatest during the phylotypic stage .
before and after this phase , the differences between the species are greater .
" darwin had a point " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naturalists like carl ernst von baer were the forefathers of the " hourglass theory " but the question remained : which model could be applied to prove that they were right ?
the pattern was so strong that it could n't be random , tomancak observed .
" we found that natural selection constrains genes most strongly during the phylotypic stage " , he told deutsche welle .
the results show that the similarity between different animal species in the middle of their embryonic development is shaped by selection .
their discoveries throw new light on an age-old biological conundrum : that of the link between ontogeny and phylogeny .
" our discovery confirms the earlier anatomical studies and broadens our understanding of how development and evolution are linked at molecular level " , said alex t. kalinka , a researcher from the dresden group , in an interview with the journal , nature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at a certain stage , human embryos look just like fish embryos in a different study , researchers at the max-planck-institute for evolutionary biology in ploen demonstrated with zebrafish that the phylogenetically oldest genes are active during the phylotypic stage and that , before and after this stage , the most active genes are those that arose later in evolutionary history .
the scientists also found something else : in adult zebrafish progressively older genes are also activated with the increasing age of the animals .
they found the same to be true in fruit flies and threadworms .
as a follow-up the researchers in dresden are thinking about manipulating genes at the phylotypic stage to see what happens .
while fossils allow scientists to look at what species looked like when they were living on our planet .
" our findings are like a time machine , we can look at what the genome was like 600 million years ago , " tomancak said .

" we all share the same objective : to ensure a stable europe and currency , " german chancellor angela merkel said describing the future euro crisis umbrella a " big piece of solidarity between the states that share the euro . "
greek prime minister george papandreou , whose country was the first to need a multi-billion euro bailout from brussels , said all eu members had to stand together now .
" the challenge today is not what we as member states or nations are doing to shore up our individual economy , the challenge is a collective one now , " he said .
as if to underscore the urgency of the matter , the european central bank on thursday announced it has decided to double its capital base by the end of the year to cope with increased credit risk and market volatility .
divergent opinions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has argued against euro bonds but while there may be a collective resolve to protect the eurozone , there is no consensus on the way forward : differences exist between member states , between parties and between european institutions .
this recently prompted european commission president jose manuel barroso to call on the european parliament to demonstrate - above all - unity .
" what we do not need is a beauty pageant of heads of state and government , " he said , " a cacophony of different scenarios and proclamations without an outcome . "
however , statements made by members of the european parliament on the issue have pointed to anything but unity .
belgian politician guy verhofstadt , who leads the liberal faction in the european parliament , attempted to pin down what he believed was the central problem of the monetary union .
" nowhere in the world is there a currency that is not supported by a government , an economic strategy and a bond market , " he said , going on to call for common euro bonds , termed e-bonds , as well as more mutual coordination on european economic and budgetary policy .
however , the government of germany , europe 's largest economy , rejects this idea - and is n't alone on this issue .
two sides to every coin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso called for unity on the euro bonds debate martin schulz , the head of the socialists in the european parliament , bemoans what he calls a crisis of confidence in europe , in which governments only reveal economic truths piecemeal , whether they concern the greek debt crisis or a financial rescue fund .
" it 's a heavy jolt to the trust in governments when the tell the public that all is well and that everything is under control one minute , and then suddenly , overnight , come out and say we need countless billions in aid , " he said .
but while schulz calls for solidarity with debt-laden countries like greece and ireland , conservatives are arguing for the exact opposite .
belgian politician derk jan eppink harkened back to statements by the flemish separatist bart de wever , who names the flemish transfer of public funds to the relatively poor walloons as the chief cause for discontent among the flemish .
eppink believes his divided country can act as a warning to europe : " we have turned a relationship based on partnership -lsb- between walloons and flemish -rsb- into one based on transfer -lsb- from one side to the other -rsb- .
" if europe continues to proceed in the same way , in a few years the eu will find itself in the same position as belgium : a community based on transfers , whose political basis is crumbling . "
but in the debate about how best to stabilize the eurozone , one thing is clear : no matter what course of action is chosen , it will be expensive , for everyone involved .

in a process of one and a half years his team collected samples of embryos of six fruit fly species , and measured gene expression across the genome at different times of embroygenesis .
the analysis took another year .
what they found was that there was a very strong pattern .
" we knew we 'd discovered something very early on " , lead scientist pavel tomancak told deutsche welle .
tomancak 's team found that not only in morphology but also in the expression pattern of the genes , the similarities between embryos of different species in one animal phylum are greatest during the phylotypic stage .
before and after this phase , the differences between the species are greater .
" darwin had a point " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naturalists like carl ernst von baer were the forefathers of the " hourglass theory " but the question remained : which model could be applied to prove that they were right ?
the pattern was so strong that it could n't be random , tomancak observed .
" we found that natural selection constrains genes most strongly during the phylotypic stage " , he told deutsche welle .
the results show that the similarity between different animal species in the middle of their embryonic development is shaped by selection .
their discoveries throw new light on an age-old biological conundrum : that of the link between ontogeny and phylogeny .
" our discovery confirms the earlier anatomical studies and broadens our understanding of how development and evolution are linked at molecular level " , said alex t. kalinka , a researcher from the dresden group , in an interview with the journal , nature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at a certain stage , human embryos look just like fish embryos in a different study , researchers at the max-planck-institute for evolutionary biology in ploen demonstrated with zebrafish that the phylogenetically oldest genes are active during the phylotypic stage and that , before and after this stage , the most active genes are those that arose later in evolutionary history .
the scientists also found something else : in adult zebrafish progressively older genes are also activated with the increasing age of the animals .
they found the same to be true in fruit flies and threadworms .
as a follow-up the researchers in dresden are thinking about manipulating genes at the phylotypic stage to see what happens .
while fossils allow scientists to look at what species looked like when they were living on our planet .
" our findings are like a time machine , we can look at what the genome was like 600 million years ago , " tomancak said .

but there 's another side to the coin .
wages in germany have stagnated , and the crisis is not entirely to blame . while the german economy is experiencing near record growth in the wake of the global economic crisis in sharp contrast to other european countries , there is a darker side to the country 's economic development - wage stagnation .
while in most other industrialized countries wages over the past 10 years have risen by 25 percent on average , wages in germany have fallen .
from 2000 to 2009 , real incomes among german workers fell by 4.5 percent , according to numbers adjusted for inflation and released by the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- on wednesday .
even though wages in other countries over the past few years have increased , the economic crisis has had a drastic slowing effect .
while , workers around the world saw wage increases of 2.8 percent in 2006 and 2007 , that growth slowed to around 1.5 percent in 2008 and 2009 .
according to the ilo , the bill for the global financial crisis has been paid by workers , particularly when considering the number of unemployed .
compared to 2007 , the number of jobless worldwide rose last year by about 30 million to 207 million .
the price of growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany , europe 's ' economic locomotive , ' is going full steam , but wages are n't keeping up none of the world 's leading industrialized countries is better positioned competitively than germany .
europe 's economic locomotive has charged out of financial meltdown , thanks in large part to its more flexible labor market .
one example of the flexibility is state-subsidized " short-time " work , known in german as kurzarbeit .
under this plan , companies do not fire employees during times of crisis , but shorten their hours and pay instead .
therefore employees become less of a load on companies ' accounts but do n't end up in the unemployment line .
their salaries are partially paid by their companies , and then topped off by the federal labor agency .
the plan helped keep germany 's unemployment rate under control during the peak of the financial crisis , and has received praise from the ilo .
through " intelligent labor market instruments " and " positive dialog with social partners , " employment rates remained fairly stable and wages fell only slightly , the organization said .
the short-time work rules were a " good investment " that prevented layoffs and helped support domestic demand .
bildunterschrift : less security but that flexible labor market also saw the number of people with permanent contracts fall in recent years – even before the crisis .
more people are working in so-called mini-jobs and other temporary arrangements .
the wages paid by such jobs are often not enough for workers to live on .
these kinds of developments , together with agreements between unions and employers on small or moderate wage increases have contributed to the phenomenon of wage stagnation in germany over the last decade .
while the development has made german firms more competitive , it has not strengthened consumer demand and wage levels have become decoupled from increases in productivity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions are beginning to ask for wage increases after years of moderating their demands wage gap in other countries , such as south korea , the us and japan , wages are no longer tied to growth in productivity , according to the ilo .
while company and investment profits have grown , worker income has sunk .
the ilo demanded that rises in productivity be accompanied by wage increases and that more should be done to slow the trend toward low-wage work .
but a new dynamic is slowly being seen in wage structures , brought about largely by germany 's economic boom .
unions have begun demanding higher wages .
in the public-service sector , the demand is for a three-percent increase ; the ig bce industrial union is calling for a 6 percent increase for employees in the chemical sector ; and workers at telecommunications giant deutsche telekom want a 6.5 percent raise . the powerful ig metal union says it plans to increase its demands when it enters important wage negotiations in the spring of 2012 .

the bank had harbored countless german tax evaders and has now agreed to a record fine . german prosecutors have dropped a lawsuit against a liechtenstein bank over charges of aiding and abetting tax evasion .
the state-owned lgt bank agreed to a settlement with a record 50 million euro -lrb- $ 67 million -rrb- fine .
the case was triggered when german tax authorities bought several cds from informants in liechtenstein , who had copied and stolen data on german tax evaders hiding their money in the small alpine tax haven .
aside from hunting down german tax evaders with the material , prosecutors also began proceedings against the liechtenstein bank itself for being an accessory to tax evasion .
the bank 's consultants were in effect accused of consciously advising and assisting wealthy germans to evade paying taxes .
fine for bank and employees in the settlement with the german prosecutors , the lgt bank has agreed to pay some 46 million euros .
another 3.6 million euros will have to be shouldered by around 45 individual employees of the bank .
the purchase of the leaked data was highly controversial in germany as the material had initially been stolen in liechtenstein and subsequently offered to germany for the price of several million euros .
in a similar case , germany bought a cd containing lists of tax evaders hiding their money in switzerland 's credit suisse bank .
the stolen data has lead to a number of arrests in germany , among them the high profile case of former deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel .

us president barack obama presented a review of the situation one year since the us launched a new strategy . us president barack obama on thursday said nato troops in afghanistan were making good progress in their fight against taliban insurgents , but cautioned that " gains are still fragile and reversible . "
obama presented a review of the progress made since washington outlined a new strategy one year ago , when obama had ordered 30,000 more troops to afghanistan .
the revised strategy also stepped up civilian efforts to strengthen the local government in kabul .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamid karzai did not always live up to us expectations " it continues to be a very difficult endeavor .
but i can report that , thanks to the extraordinary service of our troops and civilians on the ground , we are on track to achieve our goals . "
currently there are around 90,000 us soldiers stationed in the country as part of the nato contingent , as well as another 23,000 under washington 's immediate command .
al qaeda remains the enemy the main goal of the operation was not to cover the entire country or rebuild it , but to crack down on the al qaeda network hiding in afghanistan , obama said .
in that respect , he added , substantial progress had been made .
" al qaeda is hunkered down .
it will take time to ultimately defeat al qaeda and it remains a ruthless and resilient enemy bent on attacking our country .

putin said of the 47-year-old former oil billionaire khodorkovsky , who is standing trial on charges of stealing over 200 tons of oil from his own wells , that a “ thief must be in prison . ”
" we must operate based on the fact that mr. khodorkovsky 's guilt has been proven in court , " putin said .
khodorkovsky is awaiting delivery of a verdict , which has been delayed until december 27 .
since his incarceration , khodorkovsky has been russia 's highest-profile inmate .
he has been an outspoken critic of the kremlin , and particularly of putin .
the former oil billionaire , who was a major shareholder in failed petroleum company yukos , is already serving an eight-year sentence for tax evasion , which is set to expire in 2011 .
if found guilty of the fresh charges , he could face an additional six years in prison .
putin showcases himself the marathon question-and-answer program , which has lasted up to four hours in the past , has become a winter feature , with putin answering questions ranging from foreign policy to his early sex life .
in this year 's edition , the former president also fielded a question on ethnic clashes in moscow last week , which left more than 30 people injured and raised doubts about the kremlin 's ability to stem a rising tide of xenophobia .
" there is a need to suppress all the manifestations of extremism on all sides , " putin said .
" there should be an order , " he said .
" we are children of one country .
" society , including liberal society , must understand that there must be order and one must support the government now in power in order to support the interests of the majority , " he added putin also addressed the russian economy , which he said would grow by up to four percent this year , with an increase in real incomes thanks to pension increases .
" in the first half of 2012 we should get back to the pre-crisis level -lrb- of gross domestic product -rrb- , " he said .

despite threats from anti-nuclear protesters , there have only been minor delays . the nuclear-waste transport from a research center in southern france is heading towards a storage facility in lubmin in northern germany with only minor hold-ups .
unlike previous trains carrying nuclear waste , the transport has had a relatively easy journey through france and western germany , although it was interrupted briefly by anti-nuclear demonstrators .
the shipment is scheduled to arrive at its destination on thursday .
the train is carrying four containers with around 2,500 spent fuel rods , that are originally from a research facility in the southwestern german city of karlsruhe that went offline in 1991 , and the research vessel otto hahn , which has n't been used since 1979 .
potential for disruption the last few kilometers could be the most challenging for the transport , as protesters gathered outside lubmin on thursday morning , prepared to stage sit-in protests on the tracks .
greenpeace activists managed to unfurl a banner reading " stop transports to lubmin " from a bridge over the rail track near the train 's final destination .
around 200 demonstrators camped for a few hours overnight at three sites outside lubmin , with activists planning to move towards the railway tracks in the course of the morning .
the train began its journey on tuesday evening in the southern french region of aix-en-provence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police searched the tracks before the train passed the transport has made a number of scheduled stops , to allow for staff changes .
shortly before midnight on wednesday the train was held up by anti-nuclear demonstrators near the town of erfurt , but only for a couple of minutes .
around 20 protesters had managed to get close to the tracks .
in the early hours of the morning the train was held up again , apparently because of a technical problem .
easier than gorleben so far this latest transport of nuclear waste has met with noticeably less resistance than a similar shipment five weeks ago , which was travelling from france to another storage facility near the northern german town of gorleben .
that transport was met with massive protests , with tens of thousands of nuclear-energy opponents physically preventing the passage of the train .
around 20,000 police officers were deployed in the operation , and that train was delayed by around 24 hours .
police believe that the freezing december temperatures and heavy snowfall across much of germany have kept protesters away this time round .
a few dozen detemined protesters have tried to disrupt the passage , but the scale of the demonstrations have been much smaller than five weeks ago .

the german company had advised shareholders to reject the initial offer as undervalued . spain 's acs has revised its offer for hochtief , raising an earlier bid that germany 's biggest construction company advised shareholders to reject .
now hochtief says it is open to talks with its spanish rival .
the spanish concern has been stalking hochtief since september .
two weeks ago it made an official takeover bid that put the german group in a defensive crouch .
on wednesday , acs raised its share-swap offer to exchange nine acs shares for every five hochtief shares .
its previous bid offered a ratio of eight to five .
hochtief categorically rejected the acs bid made on december 1 , saying it did not make sense from either a financial or strategic standpoint .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a state-backed investment company from qatar bought a 9.1 percent stake the initial takeover bid was worth around 2.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- .
the new offer is 12.5 percent higher .
it values each hochtief share at 63.80 euros , which is two percent below the market price . defensive moves hochtief ceo herbert luetkestratkoetter had described that first bid as " decidedly unfriendly , " but on wednesday he said his company was prepared to enter fresh talks with the spanish group .
up to this point , luetkestratkoetter has sought to ward off the takeover attempt , appealing to regulators for protection and entering into a capital-raising deal with qatar , in an attempt to dilute acs ' stake in hochtief .
that move make it harder for the spaniards to get above the 30 percent threshold necessary to further hochtief stocks on the open market .
acs currently owns a 27.2 percent stake in hochtief and has said its goal is a 50 percent controlling share .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief employees protest a hostile takeover by acs , fearing job losses acs has said it is not interested in breaking up hochtief and that it plans to keep the company 's headquarters in the city of essen .
but acs i under no legal obligation to refrain from cuts should it gain control of the concern .
hochtief 's works council warned that a takeover could mean job losses , most of which would be felt in germany .
the company employs around 11,000 people .
union leaders say any change of ownership would put up to 15,000 jobs at supplying firm on the line as well .

all german troops should be out of the country by the end of 2014 . foreign minister guido westerwelle has announced that german troops will start withdrawing from afghanistan in a year 's time .
" at the end of 2011 we 'll be able to start reducing our bundeswehr deployment in afghanistan , " westerwelle told the lower house of parliament , the bundestag on thursday .
the minister went further than a progress report on germany 's mission in afghanistan , which said the withdrawal might not begin until the start of 2012 .
westerwelle also told the bundestag that the mission in afghanistan was about defending germany 's security .
" that is why this deployment is the right thing to do .
but it must not go on without end , and that is also the right thing , " he said .
report shows work needs doing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle said the afghan mission could not go on indefinitely the statement was based on the 108-page progress report issued earlier this week in which berlin assessed what had been achieved in the nine years since it first sent soldiers to afghanistan to prevent the taliban from returning to power .
the government is seeking a fresh authorization from parliament in january for the deployment , which has a limit of about 5,000 personnel .
the commitment to start reducing the overall number in late 2011 is aimed at winning over public skepticism in germany about the mission .
as far as the current situation in afghanistan is concerned , westerwelle said there was " light , but there are still too many shadows . "
he said , however , that there was reason to believe that the international community would reach its goals in afghanistan .
according to the progress report , there has to be a longer-term military and civil engagement in afghanistan on the part of international forces .
gernot erler of the opposition social democrats praised the timing of the report .
he said that members of the bundestag " definitely " needed better information in order to make the difficult decision in january .
however , erler criticized the fact that the report did not contain a critical assessment of german activities in afghanistan .
he cited the danger of corruption in the north of the country .
defense minister more vague about timing in comparison to westerwelle , the german defense minister , karl-theodor zu guttenberg , has been reluctant to name a date for the withdrawal of german troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zu guttenberg visited soldiers in afghanistan earlier this week " i 'm not the kind of person who says ' next year we 're going to withdraw soldiers here or there , " ' zu guttenberg told the german news website spiegel online on monday .
" that would be irresponsible . "
zu guttenberg added there were no concrete plans for the withdrawal of the bundeswehr in the north of afghanistan .
by contrast , his cabinet colleague guido westerwelle was more specific on thursday .
he told the bundestag that deployments in the north of afghanistan would be among the first regions to be handed over to afghan command in the first half of 2011 .
nato decided in lisbon last month to end the military mission in afghanistan by the end of 2014 , if the security situation allows for it .
westerwelle confirmed that he expected that there would be no more german troops in afghanistan beyond 2014 .

but a young german photographer has focused exactly on that : waste and waste collectors in india .
the photos are displayed at the berlin gallery . these days , visitors to the gallery of berlin 's adult education center are confronted with photos of people working on a landfill near delhi .
it might seem strange , but the photographs in the exhibition , entitled " tracing waste " , look bright and upbeat . " the idea is to make people aware of certain issues which are perhaps not so comfortable at times , " explains photographer enrico fabian , " i thought i 'd display these issues in the most attractive way so to give people a chance to connect - which is more difficult if you have a dark , very sad kind of work . " keeping the environment clean bildunterschrift : children playing on a waste dump enrico fabian lived most of his life near dresden .
four years ago he decided to move to india and establish himself as a freelance photographer .
soon after arriving in new delhi , he discovered the city 's gigantic landfills .
he saw hundreds of waste collectors and people recycling scrap metal and other materials .
fabian got immediately interested in these people and made them the theme of his photographs .
he believes that people , who do this kind of work , affect the lives of others in a very positive way .
" they help us keep our environment clean .
and of course these people are also the ones who take the burden of this very hard kind of work , " says fabian . " untouchables " most of these waste collectors are dalits , formerly known as " untouchables " , who are at the lowest level of the caste system and simply can not get any other regular job .
when fabian asked the waste collectors if he could accompany them to get to know about their daily routine and aspirations , they were puzzled by the unusual request . " but the confusion , after a while , changed into amusement .
for them it was a very untypical sight to see a foreigner standing atop the mountain of garbage , " tells fabian , " and i never used any kind of protection , so i was really trying to work with them , alongside the way they 'd usually work .
so i think this made us feel connected . " from pity to fascination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photographer enrico fabian stands next to one of his pictures at the berlin gallery when enrico fabian explains his work to visitors at the berlin gallery , he realizes that many german viewers simply feel pity for the people in the pictures at first .

now , scientists in germany have proven that there are also similarities on the level of gene expression . what do a fish and a mouse have in common ?
not much , most people would say .
yet , if you look at them at a certain stage in their embryonic development , you can hardly distinguish the two .
but this is hardly a new idea - the founder of embryology karl ernst von baer observed this in the 19th century .
" it 's a question scientists have tried to explain ever since these similarities were first observed " , said pavel tomancak , a researcher at the max planck institute of molecular cell biology and genetics in dresden , in an interview with deutsche welle .
in a new paper published last week in the journal nature , scientists in germany have proven that embryos from different species do n't just look the same - there are striking parallels between individual development and the development of a species on the level of gene expression , too .
21st century science confirms 19th century hunch german biologist ernst haeckel in 1866 took it a step further by postulating that at some point human embryos look like the embroys of fish species , he noticed , and since fish were seen as an evolutionary more primitive animal form than humans he proposed that they must all have the same ancestral features of some 600 million years ago .
his theory : the development of an organism mirrors the evolutionary development of the species , or as evolutionary biologists put it : " ontogeny recapitulating phylogeny . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : different fruit fly species are strikingly similar also on the level of gene expression the findings were of a mere qualitative nature , of course : the scientists in the 19th century were drawing their conclusions from what they saw .
in the 20th century , this qualitiative method was largely abandoned , most scientists stopped looking at the morphology and tried to find quantitative proof for their theories .
the second half of the 20th century were an important time for molecular science , with remarkable progress being made in the field of gene and dna analysis .
scientists were able to look at embryos before their phylotypic stage , which is the middle of the embryonic development .
the " waist " of the hourglass they noticed that there were differences before and after the phylotypic stage and came up with what came to be known as the " hourglass model . "
species-specific differences predominate before and after the phylotypic stage , so the phylotypic stage represents the " waist " of the hourglass .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advances in molecular science meant darwin 's theory could be checked quantitatively the question as to how this extensive morphological similarity - the " waist of the hourglass " - arises is one that preoccupied pavel tomancak and his colleagues from the max-planck-institute in dresden .
in a process of one and a half years his team collected samples of embryos of six fruit fly species , and measured gene expression across the genome at different times of embroygenesis .
the analysis took another year .
what they found was that there was a very strong pattern .
" we knew we 'd discovered something very early on " , lead scientist pavel tomancak told deutsche welle .
tomancak 's team found that not only in morphology but also in the expression pattern of the genes , the similarities between embryos of different species in one animal phylum are greatest during the phylotypic stage .
before and after this phase , the differences between the species are greater .
" darwin had a point " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naturalists like carl ernst von baer were the forefathers of the " hourglass theory " but the question remained : which model could be applied to prove that they were right ?
the pattern was so strong that it could n't be random , tomancak observed .
" we found that natural selection constrains genes most strongly during the phylotypic stage " , he told deutsche welle .
the results show that the similarity between different animal species in the middle of their embryonic development is shaped by selection .
their discoveries throw new light on an age-old biological conundrum : that of the link between ontogeny and phylogeny .
" our discovery confirms the earlier anatomical studies and broadens our understanding of how development and evolution are linked at molecular level " , said alex t. kalinka , a researcher from the dresden group , in an interview with the journal , nature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at a certain stage , human embryos look just like fish embryos in a different study , researchers at the max-planck-institute for evolutionary biology in ploen demonstrated with zebrafish that the phylogenetically oldest genes are active during the phylotypic stage and that , before and after this stage , the most active genes are those that arose later in evolutionary history .
the scientists also found something else : in adult zebrafish progressively older genes are also activated with the increasing age of the animals .
they found the same to be true in fruit flies and threadworms .
as a follow-up the researchers in dresden are thinking about manipulating genes at the phylotypic stage to see what happens .
while fossils allow scientists to look at what species looked like when they were living on our planet .
" our findings are like a time machine , we can look at what the genome was like 600 million years ago , " tomancak said .

but there 's another side to the coin .
wages in germany have stagnated , and the crisis is not entirely to blame . while the german economy is experiencing near record growth in the wake of the global economic crisis in sharp contrast to other european countries , there is a darker side to the country 's economic development - wage stagnation .
while in most other industrialized countries wages over the past 10 years have risen by 25 percent on average , wages in germany have fallen .
from 2000 to 2009 , real incomes among german workers fell by 4.5 percent , according to numbers adjusted for inflation and released by the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- on wednesday .
even though wages in other countries over the past few years have increased , the economic crisis has had a drastic slowing effect .
while , workers around the world saw wage increases of 2.8 percent in 2006 and 2007 , that growth slowed to around 1.5 percent in 2008 and 2009 .
according to the ilo , the bill for the global financial crisis has been paid by workers , particularly when considering the number of unemployed .
compared to 2007 , the number of jobless worldwide rose last year by about 30 million to 207 million .
the price of growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany , europe 's ' economic locomotive , ' is going full steam , but wages are n't keeping up none of the world 's leading industrialized countries is better positioned competitively than germany .
europe 's economic locomotive has charged out of financial meltdown , thanks in large part to its more flexible labor market .
one example of the flexibility is state-subsidized " short-time " work , known in german as kurzarbeit .
under this plan , companies do not fire employees during times of crisis , but shorten their hours and pay instead .
therefore employees become less of a load on companies ' accounts but do n't end up in the unemployment line .
their salaries are partially paid by their companies , and then topped off by the federal labor agency .
the plan helped keep germany 's unemployment rate under control during the peak of the financial crisis , and has received praise from the ilo .
through " intelligent labor market instruments " and " positive dialog with social partners , " employment rates remained fairly stable and wages fell only slightly , the organization said .
the short-time work rules were a " good investment " that prevented layoffs and helped support domestic demand .
bildunterschrift : less security but that flexible labor market also saw the number of people with permanent contracts fall in recent years – even before the crisis .
more people are working in so-called mini-jobs and other temporary arrangements .
the wages paid by such jobs are often not enough for workers to live on .
these kinds of developments , together with agreements between unions and employers on small or moderate wage increases have contributed to the phenomenon of wage stagnation in germany over the last decade .
while the development has made german firms more competitive , it has not strengthened consumer demand and wage levels have become decoupled from increases in productivity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions are beginning to ask for wage increases after years of moderating their demands wage gap in other countries , such as south korea , the us and japan , wages are no longer tied to growth in productivity , according to the ilo .
while company and investment profits have grown , worker income has sunk .
the ilo demanded that rises in productivity be accompanied by wage increases and that more should be done to slow the trend toward low-wage work .
but a new dynamic is slowly being seen in wage structures , brought about largely by germany 's economic boom .
unions have begun demanding higher wages .
in the public-service sector , the demand is for a three-percent increase ; the ig bce industrial union is calling for a 6 percent increase for employees in the chemical sector ; and workers at telecommunications giant deutsche telekom want a 6.5 percent raise . the powerful ig metal union says it plans to increase its demands when it enters important wage negotiations in the spring of 2012 .

assange is free until a ruling is made on a swedish extradition warrant . julian assange was released from jail in london on thursday evening .
british high court judge duncan ouseley handed down his decision earlier in the day , confirming a lower court 's ruling that the 39-year-old australian could be freed on 200,000 gbp bail -lrb- 236,000 euros , $ 317,000 -rrb- under strict conditions .
" i hope to continue my work and continue to protest my innocence in this matter and to reveal as we get it , which we have not yet , the evidence from these allegations , " he said in a brief statement on the steps of the high court in london . the stringent bail conditions mean that assange will be subject to electronic tagging and a curfew .
assange must also reside at a supporter 's country mansion in suffolk , eastern england , and report regularly to the police , the judge said .
the estate , ellingham hall , belongs to vaughan smith , a former british army officer who founded the frontline club , a media group in london where wikileaks has based part of its operations .
judge : not a ' fugitive from justice ' british prosecutors had been trying to keep assange behind bars until his extradition hearing , arguing that there was a risk he would flee the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assange still faces extradition on sex crime charges justice ouseley rejected that assertion , saying that the court did not view the defendant as a " fugitive from justice " who was seeking to " avoid interrogation and prosecution . "
lawyers for assange said bail money was " in the banking system " and that they expected their client to be released later in the day .
" we are expecting julian to be released some time later today .
everybody is working very hard for that , " said assange 's attorney , mark stephens .
assange has been in jail since december 7 , after he turned himself in to british police over a swedish sex crimes warrant .
two women in sweden , who are wikileaks volunteers , have accused him of rape and sexual molestation .
the australian has denied any wrongdoing and claims that the allegations are trumped up charges and politically motivated .
for their part , the two swedish women have said they were never pressured to file charges .
assange is the main force behind the release of tens of thousands of confidential us diplomatic cables , which include details of overseas sites that washington regards as vital to its national security .

" we all share the same objective : to ensure a stable europe and currency , " german chancellor angela merkel said describing the future euro crisis umbrella a " big piece of solidarity between the states that share the euro . "
greek prime minister george papandreou , whose country was the first to need a multi-billion euro bailout from brussels , said all eu members had to stand together now .
" the challenge today is not what we as member states or nations are doing to shore up our individual economy , the challenge is a collective one now , " he said .
as if to underscore the urgency of the matter , the european central bank on thursday announced it has decided to double its capital base by the end of the year to cope with increased credit risk and market volatility .
divergent opinions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has argued against euro bonds but while there may be a collective resolve to protect the eurozone , there is no consensus on the way forward : differences exist between member states , between parties and between european institutions .
this recently prompted european commission president jose manuel barroso to call on the european parliament to demonstrate - above all - unity .
" what we do not need is a beauty pageant of heads of state and government , " he said , " a cacophony of different scenarios and proclamations without an outcome . "
however , statements made by members of the european parliament on the issue have pointed to anything but unity .
belgian politician guy verhofstadt , who leads the liberal faction in the european parliament , attempted to pin down what he believed was the central problem of the monetary union .
" nowhere in the world is there a currency that is not supported by a government , an economic strategy and a bond market , " he said , going on to call for common euro bonds , termed e-bonds , as well as more mutual coordination on european economic and budgetary policy .
however , the government of germany , europe 's largest economy , rejects this idea - and is n't alone on this issue .
two sides to every coin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso called for unity on the euro bonds debate martin schulz , the head of the socialists in the european parliament , bemoans what he calls a crisis of confidence in europe , in which governments only reveal economic truths piecemeal , whether they concern the greek debt crisis or a financial rescue fund .
" it 's a heavy jolt to the trust in governments when the tell the public that all is well and that everything is under control one minute , and then suddenly , overnight , come out and say we need countless billions in aid , " he said .
but while schulz calls for solidarity with debt-laden countries like greece and ireland , conservatives are arguing for the exact opposite .
belgian politician derk jan eppink harkened back to statements by the flemish separatist bart de wever , who names the flemish transfer of public funds to the relatively poor walloons as the chief cause for discontent among the flemish .
eppink believes his divided country can act as a warning to europe : " we have turned a relationship based on partnership -lsb- between walloons and flemish -rsb- into one based on transfer -lsb- from one side to the other -rsb- .
" if europe continues to proceed in the same way , in a few years the eu will find itself in the same position as belgium : a community based on transfers , whose political basis is crumbling . "
but in the debate about how best to stabilize the eurozone , one thing is clear : no matter what course of action is chosen , it will be expensive , for everyone involved .

us president barack obama presented a review of the situation one year since the us launched a new strategy . us president barack obama on thursday said nato troops in afghanistan were making good progress in their fight against taliban insurgents , but cautioned that " gains are still fragile and reversible . "
obama presented a review of the progress made since washington outlined a new strategy one year ago , when obama had ordered 30,000 more troops to afghanistan .
the revised strategy also stepped up civilian efforts to strengthen the local government in kabul .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamid karzai did not always live up to us expectations " it continues to be a very difficult endeavor .
but i can report that , thanks to the extraordinary service of our troops and civilians on the ground , we are on track to achieve our goals . "
currently there are around 90,000 us soldiers stationed in the country as part of the nato contingent , as well as another 23,000 under washington 's immediate command .
al qaeda remains the enemy the main goal of the operation was not to cover the entire country or rebuild it , but to crack down on the al qaeda network hiding in afghanistan , obama said .
in that respect , he added , substantial progress had been made .
" al qaeda is hunkered down .
it will take time to ultimately defeat al qaeda and it remains a ruthless and resilient enemy bent on attacking our country .
but make no mistake we 're going to remain relentless in disrupting and dismantling that terrorist organization . "
the report outlined major gains that had been made in clearing the taliban from the kandahar and helmand provinces while at the same time improving the capability of the afghan army and security forces .
nato forces plan to hand over security responsibility to kabul in 2014 in order to subsequently take on a training and advisory role .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato troops hope to hand over to afghan forces in 2014 close ties to kabul and islamabad the us president called upon the afghan government to implement more transparency and announced a new american-afghan partnership deal in the coming year .
this seems to indicate a move away from the recent harsh criticism of president hamid karzai for his government 's inefficiency in backing nato efforts to defeat the taliban .
obama also stressed the importance of washington 's close cooperation with pakistan in addressing the growing problem of islamist insurgents seeking refuge in mountains along the afghan-pakistani border .
" nevertheless , progress has not come fast enough , so we will continue to insist to pakistani leaders that terrorist safe havens within their borders must be dealt with .
we 'll speed up our investment in civilian institutions and projects that improve the lives of pakistanis , " obama said .
improving relations with islamabad is seen as key in the new strategy deny .
the us congress last year approved a $ 7.5 billion-package -lrb- 5.7 billion euros -rrb- to support aid to the frontline country .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things looked good at first , with an early dortmund goal from kagawa in their soccer clash with sevilla , dortmund needed a win if they were to seize second place in group j from the spaniards .
japanese striker shinji kagawa gave dortmund an early lead after four minutes after he picked up the ball from a loose clearance by sevilla defender julian escude .
kagawa then directed the ball precisely past goalkeeper andres palop , giving his side a dream start .
things went rapidly downhill after 31 minutes and consistent pressure from sevilla culminated in a goal for ndri romaric following an error in defense from dortmund 's lukasz piszcek .
two minutes later , sevilla went ahead with a glancing header by frederic kanoute - at the end of a cross from midfielder diego perotti .
dortmund 's hopes were raised after half time when a corner from nuri sahin found neven subotic , who headed past palop to bring the scores level .
efforts fail to pay off despite efforts from dortmund to pull ahead , chances were few and far-between and sevilla held onto the draw .
the result meant sevilla progress to the final 32 of the competition with 10 points - two behind leaders paris st. germain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp said the team had only itself to blame dortmund coach juergen klopp rushed onto the field at the end of the game to prevent his players from challenging officials with allegations that sevilla players had been time-wasting .

despite threats from anti-nuclear protesters , there have only been minor delays . the nuclear-waste transport from a research center in southern france is heading towards a storage facility in lubmin in northern germany with only minor hold-ups .
unlike previous trains carrying nuclear waste , the transport has had a relatively easy journey through france and western germany , although it was interrupted briefly by anti-nuclear demonstrators .
the shipment is scheduled to arrive at its destination on thursday .
the train is carrying four containers with around 2,500 spent fuel rods , that are originally from a research facility in the southwestern german city of karlsruhe that went offline in 1991 , and the research vessel otto hahn , which has n't been used since 1979 .
potential for disruption the last few kilometers could be the most challenging for the transport , as protesters gathered outside lubmin on thursday morning , prepared to stage sit-in protests on the tracks .
greenpeace activists managed to unfurl a banner reading " stop transports to lubmin " from a bridge over the rail track near the train 's final destination .
around 200 demonstrators camped for a few hours overnight at three sites outside lubmin , with activists planning to move towards the railway tracks in the course of the morning .
the train began its journey on tuesday evening in the southern french region of aix-en-provence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police searched the tracks before the train passed the transport has made a number of scheduled stops , to allow for staff changes .
shortly before midnight on wednesday the train was held up by anti-nuclear demonstrators near the town of erfurt , but only for a couple of minutes .
around 20 protesters had managed to get close to the tracks .
in the early hours of the morning the train was held up again , apparently because of a technical problem .
easier than gorleben so far this latest transport of nuclear waste has met with noticeably less resistance than a similar shipment five weeks ago , which was travelling from france to another storage facility near the northern german town of gorleben .
that transport was met with massive protests , with tens of thousands of nuclear-energy opponents physically preventing the passage of the train .
around 20,000 police officers were deployed in the operation , and that train was delayed by around 24 hours .
police believe that the freezing december temperatures and heavy snowfall across much of germany have kept protesters away this time round .
a few dozen detemined protesters have tried to disrupt the passage , but the scale of the demonstrations have been much smaller than five weeks ago .

all german troops should be out of the country by the end of 2014 . foreign minister guido westerwelle has announced that german troops will start withdrawing from afghanistan in a year 's time .
" at the end of 2011 we 'll be able to start reducing our bundeswehr deployment in afghanistan , " westerwelle told the lower house of parliament , the bundestag on thursday .
the minister went further than a progress report on germany 's mission in afghanistan , which said the withdrawal might not begin until the start of 2012 .
westerwelle also told the bundestag that the mission in afghanistan was about defending germany 's security .
" that is why this deployment is the right thing to do .
but it must not go on without end , and that is also the right thing , " he said .
report shows work needs doing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle said the afghan mission could not go on indefinitely the statement was based on the 108-page progress report issued earlier this week in which berlin assessed what had been achieved in the nine years since it first sent soldiers to afghanistan to prevent the taliban from returning to power .
the government is seeking a fresh authorization from parliament in january for the deployment , which has a limit of about 5,000 personnel .
the commitment to start reducing the overall number in late 2011 is aimed at winning over public skepticism in germany about the mission .
as far as the current situation in afghanistan is concerned , westerwelle said there was " light , but there are still too many shadows . "
he said , however , that there was reason to believe that the international community would reach its goals in afghanistan .
according to the progress report , there has to be a longer-term military and civil engagement in afghanistan on the part of international forces .
gernot erler of the opposition social democrats praised the timing of the report .
he said that members of the bundestag " definitely " needed better information in order to make the difficult decision in january .
however , erler criticized the fact that the report did not contain a critical assessment of german activities in afghanistan .
he cited the danger of corruption in the north of the country .
defense minister more vague about timing in comparison to westerwelle , the german defense minister , karl-theodor zu guttenberg , has been reluctant to name a date for the withdrawal of german troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zu guttenberg visited soldiers in afghanistan earlier this week " i 'm not the kind of person who says ' next year we 're going to withdraw soldiers here or there , " ' zu guttenberg told the german news website spiegel online on monday .
" that would be irresponsible . "
zu guttenberg added there were no concrete plans for the withdrawal of the bundeswehr in the north of afghanistan .
by contrast , his cabinet colleague guido westerwelle was more specific on thursday .
he told the bundestag that deployments in the north of afghanistan would be among the first regions to be handed over to afghan command in the first half of 2011 .
nato decided in lisbon last month to end the military mission in afghanistan by the end of 2014 , if the security situation allows for it .
westerwelle confirmed that he expected that there would be no more german troops in afghanistan beyond 2014 .

the verdict is an important test case for the country 's crackdown on the popular soft drug dens , which have attracted so many tourists from neighboring countries , in particular germany and belgium , that many cities are having a problem coping with what has become a widespread public nuisance .
specifically , the eu 's highest court said that the southern dutch city of maastricht – just barely 20 minutes from the german border – was within its rights when it introduced a " weed passport " in 2005 to prevent foreigners from entering cafes that sell marijuana and hashish .
maastricht 's 14 pot cafes attract around 10,000 visitors a day , or 3.9 million a year , and 70 percent of them are not from the netherlands , according to data presented to the ecj . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legal dutch drug outlets are a popular destination foreign ids to be checked thursday 's ruling rejected a claim by the owner of one maastricht coffee shop that the policy was discriminatory and breached european union laws on the free movement of goods and services .
the decision now means that cities in the netherlands can go through with their plan to set up a network of computers in coffee shops that can read electronic id cards to identify foreign patrons .
the city of amsterdam has been locked in a similar battle with coffee shop owners to ban anyone who is not an " adult resident of the netherlands . "
despite the court ruling , however , the country 's 670 coffee shops will remain a legal – and lucrative - business in the netherlands , serving an estimated five to six million customers annually , even without the foreigners .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 16.12.2010 wage stagnation : the other side of germany 's economic story großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of low-wage jobs has grown in germany germany has emerged from the economic crisis looking good – growth is strong and expected to continue .
but there 's another side to the coin .
wages in germany have stagnated , and the crisis is not entirely to blame . while the german economy is experiencing near record growth in the wake of the global economic crisis in sharp contrast to other european countries , there is a darker side to the country 's economic development - wage stagnation .
while in most other industrialized countries wages over the past 10 years have risen by 25 percent on average , wages in germany have fallen .
from 2000 to 2009 , real incomes among german workers fell by 4.5 percent , according to numbers adjusted for inflation and released by the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- on wednesday .
even though wages in other countries over the past few years have increased , the economic crisis has had a drastic slowing effect .
while , workers around the world saw wage increases of 2.8 percent in 2006 and 2007 , that growth slowed to around 1.5 percent in 2008 and 2009 .
according to the ilo , the bill for the global financial crisis has been paid by workers , particularly when considering the number of unemployed .
compared to 2007 , the number of jobless worldwide rose last year by about 30 million to 207 million .
the price of growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany , europe 's ' economic locomotive , ' is going full steam , but wages are n't keeping up none of the world 's leading industrialized countries is better positioned competitively than germany .
europe 's economic locomotive has charged out of financial meltdown , thanks in large part to its more flexible labor market .
one example of the flexibility is state-subsidized " short-time " work , known in german as kurzarbeit .
under this plan , companies do not fire employees during times of crisis , but shorten their hours and pay instead .
therefore employees become less of a load on companies ' accounts but do n't end up in the unemployment line .
their salaries are partially paid by their companies , and then topped off by the federal labor agency .
the plan helped keep germany 's unemployment rate under control during the peak of the financial crisis , and has received praise from the ilo .
through " intelligent labor market instruments " and " positive dialog with social partners , " employment rates remained fairly stable and wages fell only slightly , the organization said .
the short-time work rules were a " good investment " that prevented layoffs and helped support domestic demand .
bildunterschrift : less security but that flexible labor market also saw the number of people with permanent contracts fall in recent years – even before the crisis .
more people are working in so-called mini-jobs and other temporary arrangements .
the wages paid by such jobs are often not enough for workers to live on .
these kinds of developments , together with agreements between unions and employers on small or moderate wage increases have contributed to the phenomenon of wage stagnation in germany over the last decade .
while the development has made german firms more competitive , it has not strengthened consumer demand and wage levels have become decoupled from increases in productivity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions are beginning to ask for wage increases after years of moderating their demands wage gap in other countries , such as south korea , the us and japan , wages are no longer tied to growth in productivity , according to the ilo .
while company and investment profits have grown , worker income has sunk .
the ilo demanded that rises in productivity be accompanied by wage increases and that more should be done to slow the trend toward low-wage work .
but a new dynamic is slowly being seen in wage structures , brought about largely by germany 's economic boom .
unions have begun demanding higher wages .
in the public-service sector , the demand is for a three-percent increase ; the ig bce industrial union is calling for a 6 percent increase for employees in the chemical sector ; and workers at telecommunications giant deutsche telekom want a 6.5 percent raise . the powerful ig metal union says it plans to increase its demands when it enters important wage negotiations in the spring of 2012 .

but there 's another side to the coin .
wages in germany have stagnated , and the crisis is not entirely to blame . while the german economy is experiencing near record growth in the wake of the global economic crisis in sharp contrast to other european countries , there is a darker side to the country 's economic development - wage stagnation .
while in most other industrialized countries wages over the past 10 years have risen by 25 percent on average , wages in germany have fallen .
from 2000 to 2009 , real incomes among german workers fell by 4.5 percent , according to numbers adjusted for inflation and released by the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- on wednesday .
even though wages in other countries over the past few years have increased , the economic crisis has had a drastic slowing effect .
while , workers around the world saw wage increases of 2.8 percent in 2006 and 2007 , that growth slowed to around 1.5 percent in 2008 and 2009 .
according to the ilo , the bill for the global financial crisis has been paid by workers , particularly when considering the number of unemployed .
compared to 2007 , the number of jobless worldwide rose last year by about 30 million to 207 million .
the price of growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany , europe 's ' economic locomotive , ' is going full steam , but wages are n't keeping up none of the world 's leading industrialized countries is better positioned competitively than germany .
europe 's economic locomotive has charged out of financial meltdown , thanks in large part to its more flexible labor market .
one example of the flexibility is state-subsidized " short-time " work , known in german as kurzarbeit .
under this plan , companies do not fire employees during times of crisis , but shorten their hours and pay instead .
therefore employees become less of a load on companies ' accounts but do n't end up in the unemployment line .
their salaries are partially paid by their companies , and then topped off by the federal labor agency .
the plan helped keep germany 's unemployment rate under control during the peak of the financial crisis , and has received praise from the ilo .
through " intelligent labor market instruments " and " positive dialog with social partners , " employment rates remained fairly stable and wages fell only slightly , the organization said .
the short-time work rules were a " good investment " that prevented layoffs and helped support domestic demand .
bildunterschrift : less security but that flexible labor market also saw the number of people with permanent contracts fall in recent years – even before the crisis .
more people are working in so-called mini-jobs and other temporary arrangements .
the wages paid by such jobs are often not enough for workers to live on .
these kinds of developments , together with agreements between unions and employers on small or moderate wage increases have contributed to the phenomenon of wage stagnation in germany over the last decade .
while the development has made german firms more competitive , it has not strengthened consumer demand and wage levels have become decoupled from increases in productivity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions are beginning to ask for wage increases after years of moderating their demands wage gap in other countries , such as south korea , the us and japan , wages are no longer tied to growth in productivity , according to the ilo .
while company and investment profits have grown , worker income has sunk .
the ilo demanded that rises in productivity be accompanied by wage increases and that more should be done to slow the trend toward low-wage work .
but a new dynamic is slowly being seen in wage structures , brought about largely by germany 's economic boom .
unions have begun demanding higher wages .
in the public-service sector , the demand is for a three-percent increase ; the ig bce industrial union is calling for a 6 percent increase for employees in the chemical sector ; and workers at telecommunications giant deutsche telekom want a 6.5 percent raise . the powerful ig metal union says it plans to increase its demands when it enters important wage negotiations in the spring of 2012 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de kosovo -pipe- 16.12.2010 kosovo report casts dark shadow over leader 's wartime past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thaci was a leader in the kosovo liberation army the council of europe is gearing up thursday to endorse a new report by its special rapporteur accusing leaders of the tiny balkan nation of kosovo of serious human rights violations after the 1998-99 kosovo war . the council of europe shone a bright light on the young republic of kosovo this week , with a damning report accusing its leadership of having been at the helm of criminal acts after the country 's war of independence from serbia in the late 1990s .
the report , compiled by special council rapporteur dick marty , implicates incumbent prime minister hashim thaci and other former members of the kosovo liberation army -lrb- kla -rrb- in organ and drug trafficking during and after the kosovo war .
it argues that thaci was a mafia-style boss who helped set up and run some of these networks .
it also links former kla leaders with organized crime groups in kosovo and in neighboring albania , and says they were implicit in assassinations and beatings .
the council of europe is an independent organization with 47 member states that works alongside the european union .
it has a particular emphasis on european integration , human rights and democratic development .
naturally , the kosovo government has denied the allegations , threatening legal and political action in response .
tainted leadership ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many thousands were killed in the kosovo war focus in the matter has now shifted to how the marty report might affect thaci 's leadership of the small nation , and the status of its fragile independence .
foreign affairs expert dusan reljic of the german institute for international and security affairs says this is not the first time these kinds of accusations have been leveled against kosovo leaders like prime minister thaci .
" the current wisdom was that a lot of the leading politicians in kosovo and in the region were part of the problem , " reljic told deutsche welle .
" so in the case of prime minister thaci , again and again there have been not only rumors , but accusations in the public , also in some confidential reports to certain governments … in which he was linked to organized crime and also with this terrible case of harvesting human organs . "
many kosovo observers say the report is n't likely to affect the tiny country 's hopes of eventually joining the european union , which is decades away if at all .
but reljic says that if dick marty 's report is endorsed by the council of europe it could greatly complicate kosovo 's relations with the western nations that underpin its independence .
" after this uproar in the international media , it will certainly be more difficult to maintain … that mr. thaci contributes to stability in the region , " reljic said .
" but whether western powers will drop him will very much depend on their analysis of the situation and whether they see other political actors , political leaders in kosovo who could take over in the government . "
secretive past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo declared independence from serbia in early 2008 lawrence marzouk , who is based in pristina as kosovo editor for the balkan investigative reporting network , said neither the kosovo government , opposition groups nor civil society have scrambled to address the contents of the report , which , he said , are sensitive matters for most kosovo albanians .
" it 's that it remains an incredibly taboo issue that people do n't want to talk about , mainly because of this status that the kosovo liberation army obviously has in kosovo , as freedom fighters , as liberators , " he told deutsche welle .
" there is still an enormous amount of respect for these people who fought to free kosovo . "
marzouk adds that investigators faced an uphill battle to force a rethink of the kla 's actions during the war .
" the line from the kla has always been that they fought a clean war , and that there was no wrong-doing , and that 's a line that most people take publically . "
dick marty 's 27-page report will be presented to the council of europe 's legal affairs committee on thursday for adoption .
if it is endorsed , it will then be up for debate at the next parliamentary assembly in january .
kosovo 's eu justice mission , meanwhile , has already announced it would examine the allegations .
such momentum could heap more pressure on hashim thaci and the kosovo government , and perhaps force a rethink of the country 's wartime past .

that 's a 23 percent rise over last year , as western european tech companies discover the benefits in their backyard . it 's morning at appdec in pristina , kosovo , and betim drenica 's development team is hard at work .
a flock of twenty-somethings sit glued to their computers , coding , as the 24-year-old chief development officer surveys his flock of europe 's newest generation of information technology professionals .
" here , we have different projects , " drenica says .
" we have finance software we are trying to put to market .
this software is very complex and they are , as you can see , developing freely , without any need to help .
but if we see for example , next to this monitor , they are developing very sensitive software for small arms control . "
yes , kosovar interns working on a system to allow the country 's nascent law enforcement authorities to track guns .
it 's a pretty big responsibility for interns , and some even work for free in exchange for training on the latest software development platforms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens and deutsche telekom are amongst two major western european companies currently outsourcing to eastern and central europe outsourcing is booming despite being in one of europe 's most improvised nations , these young people are poised to enter a gold rush happening in central and eastern europe .
it outsourcing in the region has become a huge business - 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- in 2009 , and it 's expected to hit 3.7 billion euros this year , according to a new report from the central and eastern european outsourcing association , an industry trade group .
keen to cut costs , western european companies are increasingly sending tech work eastward .
deutsche bank has some of its software developed in ukraine , while siemens has a research and development center in romania .
those countries also are seeing the largest growth in it outsourcing .
furthermore , with the exception of the baltic states , countries from bulgaria to slovakia defied an economic downturn as the number of the number of it specialists working for outsourcing companies grew to almost 100,000 people , according to the report .
it 's quite a big number and it means it outsourcing and services in central and eastern europe are developing very fast , " says andriy cherevko of softserve , an outsourcing firm that sponsored the study .
kosovo 's unemployment remains high the it industry is still very new here in kosovo , but it offers a glimmer of hope for an otherwise dismal economy , where unemployment exceeds 40 percent .
widespread internet access did n't arrive until after the war with serbia ended in 1999 .
still , kosovo has the youngest population in europe , many of whom are well educated , tech savvy and eager to work .
it helps explains why appdec - the software development firm in pristina - has no shortage of talent .
a junior developer might only make 500 euros per month .
that 's a pittance by western european standards .
however , it 's more than twice the average wage in europe 's newest country .
for adem gashi , a 25-year-old appdec web specialist , his job is n't just about having a decent wage .
it 's also about helping his country without having to leave it in search of work .
" i kind of feel that i 'm chosen to work in it in kosovo , " gashi says .
" i can work in tele-presence , tele-remote working ; i can do outsourcing from here , but i 'm not going to leave my country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : countries like kosovo have an advantage over other outsourcing hotspots like india , as they are physically closer to western europe after all , kosovo is closer than india despite the fact that kosovo , with its high poverty and broken infrastructure , seems a world away from western europe , it 's no more than a few hours from the continent 's major cities like frankfurt , athens or rome .
that makes it a key attraction for companies on the other side of the continent .
that proximity to the rest of europe is n't lost on joan de boer when shuttles back and forth between amsterdam and pristina , where the 49-year-old dutchman heads a web development firm called sprigs .
" wages are quite low here , " de boer says .
" we can compete with india , actually , and still it 's a european country .
it 's quite near - it 's in the same time zone .
and if there 's a problem , you can actually get on a plane at 10 o 'clock on the morning and be at a meeting in amsterdam . "
sprigs ' offices in berlin , amsterdam and paris bring in work from western european clients , but the jobs then go to a team in pristina .
de boer says his developers create better work than their western european counterparts , with an overall discount of about 20 percent .
going forward , the central and eastern european outsourcing association sees continued growth in the region 's it sector .
but with more western european companies catching on , the ceeoa reports that wages for these sought-after developers are rising .
while it 's good for the developers in the short-run , it potentially could make them less competitive with their western counterparts .
" they 're well-educated , they have good universities - ok , they lag now because of the war , " de boer says .
" but if the software developers that we have would work in a company in amsterdam , you would n't tell that they 're from kosovo .
they would just blend in with the rest . "

21st century science confirms 19th century hunch german biologist ernst haeckel in 1866 took it a step further by postulating that at some point human embryos look like the embroys of fish species , he noticed , and since fish were seen as an evolutionary more primitive animal form than humans he proposed that they must all have the same ancestral features of some 600 million years ago .

but serbia is saying that the claims show the " true face of kosovo . " the kosovo prime minister , hashim thaci , has dismissed as " scandalous " a report accusing him and other kosovo leaders of involvement in organ trafficking .
the report was officially presented to the council of europe 's legal affairs committee on thursday by a special rapporteur , dick marty .
it said that thaci had headed a group within the kosovo liberation army -lrb- kla -rrb- which operated a serious of unofficial prisons in albania and that organs were forcibly extracted from prisoners to fund the military struggle against serbia in 1998 and 1999 .
thaci said the aim of the report was " to devalue both the kla and the independence of kosovo . "
the deputy president of the kosovo parliament , xhavit haliti , who is named in the report as one of the main people involved in weapons , drug and organ trafficking , described the accusations as " absurd . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no-one can deny that the kla needed weapons he told deutsche welle that most of the accusations had surfaced directly after the war .
" the kla never smuggled drugs or had help from drug smugglers , " he said .
" the accusation about organ trafficking is very odd , since there never was anything like that .
and as for arms smuggling : everyone knew we were interested in weapons , because we were at war with serbia . but there was never any smuggling .
we bought weapons to fight with , and there was no need to hide the fact . "
new investigations needed haliti wants europe and the united states to set up an expert commission to examine the accusations in detail .
the kosovo interior minister , bajram rexhepi , said he would support any investigation of the claims by the kosovo police .
" the police is ready , " he said .
" the representatives of -lsb- the european police mission -rsb- eulex have also said they will investigate , but only on the basis of the facts and not on the basis of assumptions .
but if these accusations are without any foundation , then the one who made them must be held to his responsibility , since these are very serious accusations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the accusations raise questions about the party which won the recent elections the report was published only four days after general elections in kosovo in which thaci 's party won the most votes .
but rainer stinner , german parliamentary spokesman for foreign affairs of the liberal free democrats - the party of the german foreign minister , guido westerwelle - does not think the report 's motives are political .
" you can speculate , " he said , " but i have no reason to think that it was deliberate .
the accusations have been around for some time .
the report is very details , but when you read it , you find a lot of assumptions and conclusions . i 'd be interested to see whether it would stand up in a court of law . "
but stinner does think it will have political consequences .
" on the one hand , serbia will feel justified in its attitude towards kosovo .
on the other , the international community has received a shock and will have to work how it will deal with mr thaci . "
serbian suspicions confirmed first reactions from serbia suggest satisfaction at marty 's findings . foreign minister vuk jeremic said they showed " the true face of kosovo . "
vladimir vukcevic , the serbian war crimes prosecutor who has led an investigation into the alleged organ trafficking said that he had evidence that around 400 serbs and 100 " non-albanians " had organs removed .
he offered to cooperate with colleagues in kosovo and albania , and said that his investigations were much further forward than those of dick marty .
however , the serbian president , boris tadic , said he would not preclude a dialogue with the kosovo prime minister until the accusations were confirmed or disproved .

us president barack obama presented a review of the situation one year since the us launched a new strategy . us president barack obama on thursday said nato troops in afghanistan were making good progress in their fight against taliban insurgents , but cautioned that " gains are still fragile and reversible . "
obama presented a review of the progress made since washington outlined a new strategy one year ago , when obama had ordered 30,000 more troops to afghanistan .
the revised strategy also stepped up civilian efforts to strengthen the local government in kabul .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamid karzai did not always live up to us expectations " it continues to be a very difficult endeavor .
but i can report that , thanks to the extraordinary service of our troops and civilians on the ground , we are on track to achieve our goals . "
currently there are around 90,000 us soldiers stationed in the country as part of the nato contingent , as well as another 23,000 under washington 's immediate command .
al qaeda remains the enemy the main goal of the operation was not to cover the entire country or rebuild it , but to crack down on the al qaeda network hiding in afghanistan , obama said .
in that respect , he added , substantial progress had been made .
" al qaeda is hunkered down .
it will take time to ultimately defeat al qaeda and it remains a ruthless and resilient enemy bent on attacking our country .
but make no mistake we 're going to remain relentless in disrupting and dismantling that terrorist organization . "
the report outlined major gains that had been made in clearing the taliban from the kandahar and helmand provinces while at the same time improving the capability of the afghan army and security forces .
nato forces plan to hand over security responsibility to kabul in 2014 in order to subsequently take on a training and advisory role .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato troops hope to hand over to afghan forces in 2014 close ties to kabul and islamabad the us president called upon the afghan government to implement more transparency and announced a new american-afghan partnership deal in the coming year .
this seems to indicate a move away from the recent harsh criticism of president hamid karzai for his government 's inefficiency in backing nato efforts to defeat the taliban .
obama also stressed the importance of washington 's close cooperation with pakistan in addressing the growing problem of islamist insurgents seeking refuge in mountains along the afghan-pakistani border .
" nevertheless , progress has not come fast enough , so we will continue to insist to pakistani leaders that terrorist safe havens within their borders must be dealt with .
we 'll speed up our investment in civilian institutions and projects that improve the lives of pakistanis , " obama said .
improving relations with islamabad is seen as key in the new strategy deny .
the us congress last year approved a $ 7.5 billion-package -lrb- 5.7 billion euros -rrb- to support aid to the frontline country .

putin said of the 47-year-old former oil billionaire khodorkovsky , who is standing trial on charges of stealing over 200 tons of oil from his own wells , that a “ thief must be in prison . ”
" we must operate based on the fact that mr. khodorkovsky 's guilt has been proven in court , " putin said .
khodorkovsky is awaiting delivery of a verdict , which has been delayed until december 27 .
since his incarceration , khodorkovsky has been russia 's highest-profile inmate .
he has been an outspoken critic of the kremlin , and particularly of putin .
the former oil billionaire , who was a major shareholder in failed petroleum company yukos , is already serving an eight-year sentence for tax evasion , which is set to expire in 2011 .
if found guilty of the fresh charges , he could face an additional six years in prison .

in this year 's edition , the former president also fielded a question on ethnic clashes in moscow last week , which left more than 30 people injured and raised doubts about the kremlin 's ability to stem a rising tide of xenophobia .
" there is a need to suppress all the manifestations of extremism on all sides , " putin said .
" there should be an order , " he said .
" we are children of one country .
" society , including liberal society , must understand that there must be order and one must support the government now in power in order to support the interests of the majority , " he added putin also addressed the russian economy , which he said would grow by up to four percent this year , with an increase in real incomes thanks to pension increases .
" in the first half of 2012 we should get back to the pre-crisis level -lrb- of gross domestic product -rrb- , " he said .

the bank had harbored countless german tax evaders and has now agreed to a record fine . german prosecutors have dropped a lawsuit against a liechtenstein bank over charges of aiding and abetting tax evasion .
the state-owned lgt bank agreed to a settlement with a record 50 million euro -lrb- $ 67 million -rrb- fine .
the case was triggered when german tax authorities bought several cds from informants in liechtenstein , who had copied and stolen data on german tax evaders hiding their money in the small alpine tax haven .
aside from hunting down german tax evaders with the material , prosecutors also began proceedings against the liechtenstein bank itself for being an accessory to tax evasion .
the bank 's consultants were in effect accused of consciously advising and assisting wealthy germans to evade paying taxes .
fine for bank and employees in the settlement with the german prosecutors , the lgt bank has agreed to pay some 46 million euros .
another 3.6 million euros will have to be shouldered by around 45 individual employees of the bank .
the purchase of the leaked data was highly controversial in germany as the material had initially been stolen in liechtenstein and subsequently offered to germany for the price of several million euros .
in a similar case , germany bought a cd containing lists of tax evaders hiding their money in switzerland 's credit suisse bank .
the stolen data has lead to a number of arrests in germany , among them the high profile case of former deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 16.12.2010 it outsourcing to eastern europe on the rise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outsourcing is up over 20 percent in eastern europe a new industry report says it outsourcing to eastern europe is up to 3.7 billion euros annually .
that 's a 23 percent rise over last year , as western european tech companies discover the benefits in their backyard . it 's morning at appdec in pristina , kosovo , and betim drenica 's development team is hard at work .
a flock of twenty-somethings sit glued to their computers , coding , as the 24-year-old chief development officer surveys his flock of europe 's newest generation of information technology professionals .
" here , we have different projects , " drenica says .
" we have finance software we are trying to put to market .
this software is very complex and they are , as you can see , developing freely , without any need to help .
but if we see for example , next to this monitor , they are developing very sensitive software for small arms control . "
yes , kosovar interns working on a system to allow the country 's nascent law enforcement authorities to track guns .
it 's a pretty big responsibility for interns , and some even work for free in exchange for training on the latest software development platforms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens and deutsche telekom are amongst two major western european companies currently outsourcing to eastern and central europe outsourcing is booming despite being in one of europe 's most improvised nations , these young people are poised to enter a gold rush happening in central and eastern europe .
it outsourcing in the region has become a huge business - 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- in 2009 , and it 's expected to hit 3.7 billion euros this year , according to a new report from the central and eastern european outsourcing association , an industry trade group .
keen to cut costs , western european companies are increasingly sending tech work eastward .
deutsche bank has some of its software developed in ukraine , while siemens has a research and development center in romania .
those countries also are seeing the largest growth in it outsourcing .
furthermore , with the exception of the baltic states , countries from bulgaria to slovakia defied an economic downturn as the number of the number of it specialists working for outsourcing companies grew to almost 100,000 people , according to the report .
it 's quite a big number and it means it outsourcing and services in central and eastern europe are developing very fast , " says andriy cherevko of softserve , an outsourcing firm that sponsored the study .
kosovo 's unemployment remains high the it industry is still very new here in kosovo , but it offers a glimmer of hope for an otherwise dismal economy , where unemployment exceeds 40 percent .
widespread internet access did n't arrive until after the war with serbia ended in 1999 .
still , kosovo has the youngest population in europe , many of whom are well educated , tech savvy and eager to work .
it helps explains why appdec - the software development firm in pristina - has no shortage of talent .
a junior developer might only make 500 euros per month .
that 's a pittance by western european standards .
however , it 's more than twice the average wage in europe 's newest country .
for adem gashi , a 25-year-old appdec web specialist , his job is n't just about having a decent wage .
it 's also about helping his country without having to leave it in search of work .
" i kind of feel that i 'm chosen to work in it in kosovo , " gashi says .
" i can work in tele-presence , tele-remote working ; i can do outsourcing from here , but i 'm not going to leave my country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : countries like kosovo have an advantage over other outsourcing hotspots like india , as they are physically closer to western europe after all , kosovo is closer than india despite the fact that kosovo , with its high poverty and broken infrastructure , seems a world away from western europe , it 's no more than a few hours from the continent 's major cities like frankfurt , athens or rome .
that makes it a key attraction for companies on the other side of the continent .
that proximity to the rest of europe is n't lost on joan de boer when shuttles back and forth between amsterdam and pristina , where the 49-year-old dutchman heads a web development firm called sprigs .
" wages are quite low here , " de boer says .
" we can compete with india , actually , and still it 's a european country .
it 's quite near - it 's in the same time zone .
and if there 's a problem , you can actually get on a plane at 10 o 'clock on the morning and be at a meeting in amsterdam . "
sprigs ' offices in berlin , amsterdam and paris bring in work from western european clients , but the jobs then go to a team in pristina .
de boer says his developers create better work than their western european counterparts , with an overall discount of about 20 percent .
going forward , the central and eastern european outsourcing association sees continued growth in the region 's it sector .
but with more western european companies catching on , the ceeoa reports that wages for these sought-after developers are rising .
while it 's good for the developers in the short-run , it potentially could make them less competitive with their western counterparts .
" they 're well-educated , they have good universities - ok , they lag now because of the war , " de boer says .
" but if the software developers that we have would work in a company in amsterdam , you would n't tell that they 're from kosovo .
they would just blend in with the rest . "

now , scientists in germany have proven that there are also similarities on the level of gene expression . what do a fish and a mouse have in common ?
not much , most people would say .
yet , if you look at them at a certain stage in their embryonic development , you can hardly distinguish the two .
but this is hardly a new idea - the founder of embryology karl ernst von baer observed this in the 19th century .
" it 's a question scientists have tried to explain ever since these similarities were first observed " , said pavel tomancak , a researcher at the max planck institute of molecular cell biology and genetics in dresden , in an interview with deutsche welle .
in a new paper published last week in the journal nature , scientists in germany have proven that embryos from different species do n't just look the same - there are striking parallels between individual development and the development of a species on the level of gene expression , too .
21st century science confirms 19th century hunch german biologist ernst haeckel in 1866 took it a step further by postulating that at some point human embryos look like the embroys of fish species , he noticed , and since fish were seen as an evolutionary more primitive animal form than humans he proposed that they must all have the same ancestral features of some 600 million years ago .
his theory : the development of an organism mirrors the evolutionary development of the species , or as evolutionary biologists put it : " ontogeny recapitulating phylogeny . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : different fruit fly species are strikingly similar also on the level of gene expression the findings were of a mere qualitative nature , of course : the scientists in the 19th century were drawing their conclusions from what they saw .
in the 20th century , this qualitiative method was largely abandoned , most scientists stopped looking at the morphology and tried to find quantitative proof for their theories .
the second half of the 20th century were an important time for molecular science , with remarkable progress being made in the field of gene and dna analysis .
scientists were able to look at embryos before their phylotypic stage , which is the middle of the embryonic development .
the " waist " of the hourglass they noticed that there were differences before and after the phylotypic stage and came up with what came to be known as the " hourglass model . "
species-specific differences predominate before and after the phylotypic stage , so the phylotypic stage represents the " waist " of the hourglass .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advances in molecular science meant darwin 's theory could be checked quantitatively the question as to how this extensive morphological similarity - the " waist of the hourglass " - arises is one that preoccupied pavel tomancak and his colleagues from the max-planck-institute in dresden .
in a process of one and a half years his team collected samples of embryos of six fruit fly species , and measured gene expression across the genome at different times of embroygenesis .
the analysis took another year .
what they found was that there was a very strong pattern .
" we knew we 'd discovered something very early on " , lead scientist pavel tomancak told deutsche welle .
tomancak 's team found that not only in morphology but also in the expression pattern of the genes , the similarities between embryos of different species in one animal phylum are greatest during the phylotypic stage .
before and after this phase , the differences between the species are greater .
" darwin had a point " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naturalists like carl ernst von baer were the forefathers of the " hourglass theory " but the question remained : which model could be applied to prove that they were right ?
the pattern was so strong that it could n't be random , tomancak observed .
" we found that natural selection constrains genes most strongly during the phylotypic stage " , he told deutsche welle .
the results show that the similarity between different animal species in the middle of their embryonic development is shaped by selection .
their discoveries throw new light on an age-old biological conundrum : that of the link between ontogeny and phylogeny .
" our discovery confirms the earlier anatomical studies and broadens our understanding of how development and evolution are linked at molecular level " , said alex t. kalinka , a researcher from the dresden group , in an interview with the journal , nature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at a certain stage , human embryos look just like fish embryos in a different study , researchers at the max-planck-institute for evolutionary biology in ploen demonstrated with zebrafish that the phylogenetically oldest genes are active during the phylotypic stage and that , before and after this stage , the most active genes are those that arose later in evolutionary history .
the scientists also found something else : in adult zebrafish progressively older genes are also activated with the increasing age of the animals .
they found the same to be true in fruit flies and threadworms .
as a follow-up the researchers in dresden are thinking about manipulating genes at the phylotypic stage to see what happens .
while fossils allow scientists to look at what species looked like when they were living on our planet .
" our findings are like a time machine , we can look at what the genome was like 600 million years ago , " tomancak said .

21st century science confirms 19th century hunch german biologist ernst haeckel in 1866 took it a step further by postulating that at some point human embryos look like the embroys of fish species , he noticed , and since fish were seen as an evolutionary more primitive animal form than humans he proposed that they must all have the same ancestral features of some 600 million years ago .
his theory : the development of an organism mirrors the evolutionary development of the species , or as evolutionary biologists put it : " ontogeny recapitulating phylogeny . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : different fruit fly species are strikingly similar also on the level of gene expression the findings were of a mere qualitative nature , of course : the scientists in the 19th century were drawing their conclusions from what they saw .
in the 20th century , this qualitiative method was largely abandoned , most scientists stopped looking at the morphology and tried to find quantitative proof for their theories .
the second half of the 20th century were an important time for molecular science , with remarkable progress being made in the field of gene and dna analysis .
scientists were able to look at embryos before their phylotypic stage , which is the middle of the embryonic development .
the " waist " of the hourglass they noticed that there were differences before and after the phylotypic stage and came up with what came to be known as the " hourglass model . "
species-specific differences predominate before and after the phylotypic stage , so the phylotypic stage represents the " waist " of the hourglass .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advances in molecular science meant darwin 's theory could be checked quantitatively the question as to how this extensive morphological similarity - the " waist of the hourglass " - arises is one that preoccupied pavel tomancak and his colleagues from the max-planck-institute in dresden .
in a process of one and a half years his team collected samples of embryos of six fruit fly species , and measured gene expression across the genome at different times of embroygenesis .
the analysis took another year .
what they found was that there was a very strong pattern .
" we knew we 'd discovered something very early on " , lead scientist pavel tomancak told deutsche welle .
tomancak 's team found that not only in morphology but also in the expression pattern of the genes , the similarities between embryos of different species in one animal phylum are greatest during the phylotypic stage .
before and after this phase , the differences between the species are greater .
" darwin had a point " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naturalists like carl ernst von baer were the forefathers of the " hourglass theory " but the question remained : which model could be applied to prove that they were right ?
the pattern was so strong that it could n't be random , tomancak observed .
" we found that natural selection constrains genes most strongly during the phylotypic stage " , he told deutsche welle .
the results show that the similarity between different animal species in the middle of their embryonic development is shaped by selection .
their discoveries throw new light on an age-old biological conundrum : that of the link between ontogeny and phylogeny .
" our discovery confirms the earlier anatomical studies and broadens our understanding of how development and evolution are linked at molecular level " , said alex t. kalinka , a researcher from the dresden group , in an interview with the journal , nature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at a certain stage , human embryos look just like fish embryos in a different study , researchers at the max-planck-institute for evolutionary biology in ploen demonstrated with zebrafish that the phylogenetically oldest genes are active during the phylotypic stage and that , before and after this stage , the most active genes are those that arose later in evolutionary history .
the scientists also found something else : in adult zebrafish progressively older genes are also activated with the increasing age of the animals .
they found the same to be true in fruit flies and threadworms .
as a follow-up the researchers in dresden are thinking about manipulating genes at the phylotypic stage to see what happens .
while fossils allow scientists to look at what species looked like when they were living on our planet .
" our findings are like a time machine , we can look at what the genome was like 600 million years ago , " tomancak said .

but there 's another side to the coin .
wages in germany have stagnated , and the crisis is not entirely to blame . while the german economy is experiencing near record growth in the wake of the global economic crisis in sharp contrast to other european countries , there is a darker side to the country 's economic development - wage stagnation .
while in most other industrialized countries wages over the past 10 years have risen by 25 percent on average , wages in germany have fallen .
from 2000 to 2009 , real incomes among german workers fell by 4.5 percent , according to numbers adjusted for inflation and released by the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- on wednesday .
even though wages in other countries over the past few years have increased , the economic crisis has had a drastic slowing effect .
while , workers around the world saw wage increases of 2.8 percent in 2006 and 2007 , that growth slowed to around 1.5 percent in 2008 and 2009 .
according to the ilo , the bill for the global financial crisis has been paid by workers , particularly when considering the number of unemployed .
compared to 2007 , the number of jobless worldwide rose last year by about 30 million to 207 million .
the price of growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany , europe 's ' economic locomotive , ' is going full steam , but wages are n't keeping up none of the world 's leading industrialized countries is better positioned competitively than germany .
europe 's economic locomotive has charged out of financial meltdown , thanks in large part to its more flexible labor market .
one example of the flexibility is state-subsidized " short-time " work , known in german as kurzarbeit .
under this plan , companies do not fire employees during times of crisis , but shorten their hours and pay instead .
therefore employees become less of a load on companies ' accounts but do n't end up in the unemployment line .
their salaries are partially paid by their companies , and then topped off by the federal labor agency .
the plan helped keep germany 's unemployment rate under control during the peak of the financial crisis , and has received praise from the ilo .
through " intelligent labor market instruments " and " positive dialog with social partners , " employment rates remained fairly stable and wages fell only slightly , the organization said .
the short-time work rules were a " good investment " that prevented layoffs and helped support domestic demand .
bildunterschrift : less security but that flexible labor market also saw the number of people with permanent contracts fall in recent years – even before the crisis .
more people are working in so-called mini-jobs and other temporary arrangements .
the wages paid by such jobs are often not enough for workers to live on .
these kinds of developments , together with agreements between unions and employers on small or moderate wage increases have contributed to the phenomenon of wage stagnation in germany over the last decade .
while the development has made german firms more competitive , it has not strengthened consumer demand and wage levels have become decoupled from increases in productivity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions are beginning to ask for wage increases after years of moderating their demands wage gap in other countries , such as south korea , the us and japan , wages are no longer tied to growth in productivity , according to the ilo .
while company and investment profits have grown , worker income has sunk .
the ilo demanded that rises in productivity be accompanied by wage increases and that more should be done to slow the trend toward low-wage work .
but a new dynamic is slowly being seen in wage structures , brought about largely by germany 's economic boom .
unions have begun demanding higher wages .
in the public-service sector , the demand is for a three-percent increase ; the ig bce industrial union is calling for a 6 percent increase for employees in the chemical sector ; and workers at telecommunications giant deutsche telekom want a 6.5 percent raise . the powerful ig metal union says it plans to increase its demands when it enters important wage negotiations in the spring of 2012 .

now , scientists in germany have proven that there are also similarities on the level of gene expression . what do a fish and a mouse have in common ?
not much , most people would say .
yet , if you look at them at a certain stage in their embryonic development , you can hardly distinguish the two .

the bank had harbored countless german tax evaders and has now agreed to a record fine . german prosecutors have dropped a lawsuit against a liechtenstein bank over charges of aiding and abetting tax evasion .
the state-owned lgt bank agreed to a settlement with a record 50 million euro -lrb- $ 67 million -rrb- fine .
the case was triggered when german tax authorities bought several cds from informants in liechtenstein , who had copied and stolen data on german tax evaders hiding their money in the small alpine tax haven .
aside from hunting down german tax evaders with the material , prosecutors also began proceedings against the liechtenstein bank itself for being an accessory to tax evasion .
the bank 's consultants were in effect accused of consciously advising and assisting wealthy germans to evade paying taxes .
fine for bank and employees in the settlement with the german prosecutors , the lgt bank has agreed to pay some 46 million euros .
another 3.6 million euros will have to be shouldered by around 45 individual employees of the bank .
the purchase of the leaked data was highly controversial in germany as the material had initially been stolen in liechtenstein and subsequently offered to germany for the price of several million euros .
in a similar case , germany bought a cd containing lists of tax evaders hiding their money in switzerland 's credit suisse bank .
the stolen data has lead to a number of arrests in germany , among them the high profile case of former deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel .

but serbia is saying that the claims show the " true face of kosovo . " the kosovo prime minister , hashim thaci , has dismissed as " scandalous " a report accusing him and other kosovo leaders of involvement in organ trafficking .
the report was officially presented to the council of europe 's legal affairs committee on thursday by a special rapporteur , dick marty .
it said that thaci had headed a group within the kosovo liberation army -lrb- kla -rrb- which operated a serious of unofficial prisons in albania and that organs were forcibly extracted from prisoners to fund the military struggle against serbia in 1998 and 1999 .
thaci said the aim of the report was " to devalue both the kla and the independence of kosovo . "
the deputy president of the kosovo parliament , xhavit haliti , who is named in the report as one of the main people involved in weapons , drug and organ trafficking , described the accusations as " absurd . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no-one can deny that the kla needed weapons he told deutsche welle that most of the accusations had surfaced directly after the war .
" the kla never smuggled drugs or had help from drug smugglers , " he said .
" the accusation about organ trafficking is very odd , since there never was anything like that .
and as for arms smuggling : everyone knew we were interested in weapons , because we were at war with serbia . but there was never any smuggling .
we bought weapons to fight with , and there was no need to hide the fact . "
new investigations needed haliti wants europe and the united states to set up an expert commission to examine the accusations in detail .
the kosovo interior minister , bajram rexhepi , said he would support any investigation of the claims by the kosovo police .
" the police is ready , " he said .
" the representatives of -lsb- the european police mission -rsb- eulex have also said they will investigate , but only on the basis of the facts and not on the basis of assumptions .
but if these accusations are without any foundation , then the one who made them must be held to his responsibility , since these are very serious accusations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the accusations raise questions about the party which won the recent elections the report was published only four days after general elections in kosovo in which thaci 's party won the most votes .
but rainer stinner , german parliamentary spokesman for foreign affairs of the liberal free democrats - the party of the german foreign minister , guido westerwelle - does not think the report 's motives are political .
" you can speculate , " he said , " but i have no reason to think that it was deliberate .
the accusations have been around for some time .
the report is very details , but when you read it , you find a lot of assumptions and conclusions . i 'd be interested to see whether it would stand up in a court of law . "
but stinner does think it will have political consequences .
" on the one hand , serbia will feel justified in its attitude towards kosovo .
on the other , the international community has received a shock and will have to work how it will deal with mr thaci . "
serbian suspicions confirmed first reactions from serbia suggest satisfaction at marty 's findings . foreign minister vuk jeremic said they showed " the true face of kosovo . "
vladimir vukcevic , the serbian war crimes prosecutor who has led an investigation into the alleged organ trafficking said that he had evidence that around 400 serbs and 100 " non-albanians " had organs removed .
he offered to cooperate with colleagues in kosovo and albania , and said that his investigations were much further forward than those of dick marty .
however , the serbian president , boris tadic , said he would not preclude a dialogue with the kosovo prime minister until the accusations were confirmed or disproved .

us president barack obama presented a review of the situation one year since the us launched a new strategy . us president barack obama on thursday said nato troops in afghanistan were making good progress in their fight against taliban insurgents , but cautioned that " gains are still fragile and reversible . "
obama presented a review of the progress made since washington outlined a new strategy one year ago , when obama had ordered 30,000 more troops to afghanistan .
the revised strategy also stepped up civilian efforts to strengthen the local government in kabul .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamid karzai did not always live up to us expectations " it continues to be a very difficult endeavor .
but i can report that , thanks to the extraordinary service of our troops and civilians on the ground , we are on track to achieve our goals . "
currently there are around 90,000 us soldiers stationed in the country as part of the nato contingent , as well as another 23,000 under washington 's immediate command .
al qaeda remains the enemy the main goal of the operation was not to cover the entire country or rebuild it , but to crack down on the al qaeda network hiding in afghanistan , obama said .
in that respect , he added , substantial progress had been made .
" al qaeda is hunkered down .
it will take time to ultimately defeat al qaeda and it remains a ruthless and resilient enemy bent on attacking our country .
but make no mistake we 're going to remain relentless in disrupting and dismantling that terrorist organization . "
the report outlined major gains that had been made in clearing the taliban from the kandahar and helmand provinces while at the same time improving the capability of the afghan army and security forces .
nato forces plan to hand over security responsibility to kabul in 2014 in order to subsequently take on a training and advisory role .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato troops hope to hand over to afghan forces in 2014 close ties to kabul and islamabad the us president called upon the afghan government to implement more transparency and announced a new american-afghan partnership deal in the coming year .
this seems to indicate a move away from the recent harsh criticism of president hamid karzai for his government 's inefficiency in backing nato efforts to defeat the taliban .
obama also stressed the importance of washington 's close cooperation with pakistan in addressing the growing problem of islamist insurgents seeking refuge in mountains along the afghan-pakistani border .
" nevertheless , progress has not come fast enough , so we will continue to insist to pakistani leaders that terrorist safe havens within their borders must be dealt with .
we 'll speed up our investment in civilian institutions and projects that improve the lives of pakistanis , " obama said .
improving relations with islamabad is seen as key in the new strategy deny .
the us congress last year approved a $ 7.5 billion-package -lrb- 5.7 billion euros -rrb- to support aid to the frontline country .

the verdict is an important test case for the country 's crackdown on the popular soft drug dens , which have attracted so many tourists from neighboring countries , in particular germany and belgium , that many cities are having a problem coping with what has become a widespread public nuisance .
specifically , the eu 's highest court said that the southern dutch city of maastricht – just barely 20 minutes from the german border – was within its rights when it introduced a " weed passport " in 2005 to prevent foreigners from entering cafes that sell marijuana and hashish .
maastricht 's 14 pot cafes attract around 10,000 visitors a day , or 3.9 million a year , and 70 percent of them are not from the netherlands , according to data presented to the ecj . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legal dutch drug outlets are a popular destination foreign ids to be checked thursday 's ruling rejected a claim by the owner of one maastricht coffee shop that the policy was discriminatory and breached european union laws on the free movement of goods and services .
the decision now means that cities in the netherlands can go through with their plan to set up a network of computers in coffee shops that can read electronic id cards to identify foreign patrons .
the city of amsterdam has been locked in a similar battle with coffee shop owners to ban anyone who is not an " adult resident of the netherlands . "
despite the court ruling , however , the country 's 670 coffee shops will remain a legal – and lucrative - business in the netherlands , serving an estimated five to six million customers annually , even without the foreigners .

now , scientists in germany have proven that there are also similarities on the level of gene expression . what do a fish and a mouse have in common ?
not much , most people would say .
yet , if you look at them at a certain stage in their embryonic development , you can hardly distinguish the two .
but this is hardly a new idea - the founder of embryology karl ernst von baer observed this in the 19th century .
" it 's a question scientists have tried to explain ever since these similarities were first observed " , said pavel tomancak , a researcher at the max planck institute of molecular cell biology and genetics in dresden , in an interview with deutsche welle .
in a new paper published last week in the journal nature , scientists in germany have proven that embryos from different species do n't just look the same - there are striking parallels between individual development and the development of a species on the level of gene expression , too .
21st century science confirms 19th century hunch german biologist ernst haeckel in 1866 took it a step further by postulating that at some point human embryos look like the embroys of fish species , he noticed , and since fish were seen as an evolutionary more primitive animal form than humans he proposed that they must all have the same ancestral features of some 600 million years ago .
his theory : the development of an organism mirrors the evolutionary development of the species , or as evolutionary biologists put it : " ontogeny recapitulating phylogeny . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : different fruit fly species are strikingly similar also on the level of gene expression the findings were of a mere qualitative nature , of course : the scientists in the 19th century were drawing their conclusions from what they saw .
in the 20th century , this qualitiative method was largely abandoned , most scientists stopped looking at the morphology and tried to find quantitative proof for their theories .
the second half of the 20th century were an important time for molecular science , with remarkable progress being made in the field of gene and dna analysis .
scientists were able to look at embryos before their phylotypic stage , which is the middle of the embryonic development .
the " waist " of the hourglass they noticed that there were differences before and after the phylotypic stage and came up with what came to be known as the " hourglass model . "
species-specific differences predominate before and after the phylotypic stage , so the phylotypic stage represents the " waist " of the hourglass .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advances in molecular science meant darwin 's theory could be checked quantitatively the question as to how this extensive morphological similarity - the " waist of the hourglass " - arises is one that preoccupied pavel tomancak and his colleagues from the max-planck-institute in dresden .
in a process of one and a half years his team collected samples of embryos of six fruit fly species , and measured gene expression across the genome at different times of embroygenesis .
the analysis took another year .
what they found was that there was a very strong pattern .
" we knew we 'd discovered something very early on " , lead scientist pavel tomancak told deutsche welle .
tomancak 's team found that not only in morphology but also in the expression pattern of the genes , the similarities between embryos of different species in one animal phylum are greatest during the phylotypic stage .
before and after this phase , the differences between the species are greater .
" darwin had a point " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naturalists like carl ernst von baer were the forefathers of the " hourglass theory " but the question remained : which model could be applied to prove that they were right ?
the pattern was so strong that it could n't be random , tomancak observed .
" we found that natural selection constrains genes most strongly during the phylotypic stage " , he told deutsche welle .
the results show that the similarity between different animal species in the middle of their embryonic development is shaped by selection .
their discoveries throw new light on an age-old biological conundrum : that of the link between ontogeny and phylogeny .
" our discovery confirms the earlier anatomical studies and broadens our understanding of how development and evolution are linked at molecular level " , said alex t. kalinka , a researcher from the dresden group , in an interview with the journal , nature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at a certain stage , human embryos look just like fish embryos in a different study , researchers at the max-planck-institute for evolutionary biology in ploen demonstrated with zebrafish that the phylogenetically oldest genes are active during the phylotypic stage and that , before and after this stage , the most active genes are those that arose later in evolutionary history .
the scientists also found something else : in adult zebrafish progressively older genes are also activated with the increasing age of the animals .
they found the same to be true in fruit flies and threadworms .
as a follow-up the researchers in dresden are thinking about manipulating genes at the phylotypic stage to see what happens .
while fossils allow scientists to look at what species looked like when they were living on our planet .
" our findings are like a time machine , we can look at what the genome was like 600 million years ago , " tomancak said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 16.12.2010 wage stagnation : the other side of germany 's economic story großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of low-wage jobs has grown in germany germany has emerged from the economic crisis looking good – growth is strong and expected to continue .
but there 's another side to the coin .
wages in germany have stagnated , and the crisis is not entirely to blame . while the german economy is experiencing near record growth in the wake of the global economic crisis in sharp contrast to other european countries , there is a darker side to the country 's economic development - wage stagnation .
while in most other industrialized countries wages over the past 10 years have risen by 25 percent on average , wages in germany have fallen .
from 2000 to 2009 , real incomes among german workers fell by 4.5 percent , according to numbers adjusted for inflation and released by the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- on wednesday .
even though wages in other countries over the past few years have increased , the economic crisis has had a drastic slowing effect .
while , workers around the world saw wage increases of 2.8 percent in 2006 and 2007 , that growth slowed to around 1.5 percent in 2008 and 2009 .
according to the ilo , the bill for the global financial crisis has been paid by workers , particularly when considering the number of unemployed .
compared to 2007 , the number of jobless worldwide rose last year by about 30 million to 207 million .
the price of growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany , europe 's ' economic locomotive , ' is going full steam , but wages are n't keeping up none of the world 's leading industrialized countries is better positioned competitively than germany .
europe 's economic locomotive has charged out of financial meltdown , thanks in large part to its more flexible labor market .
one example of the flexibility is state-subsidized " short-time " work , known in german as kurzarbeit .
under this plan , companies do not fire employees during times of crisis , but shorten their hours and pay instead .
therefore employees become less of a load on companies ' accounts but do n't end up in the unemployment line .
their salaries are partially paid by their companies , and then topped off by the federal labor agency .
the plan helped keep germany 's unemployment rate under control during the peak of the financial crisis , and has received praise from the ilo .
through " intelligent labor market instruments " and " positive dialog with social partners , " employment rates remained fairly stable and wages fell only slightly , the organization said .
the short-time work rules were a " good investment " that prevented layoffs and helped support domestic demand .
bildunterschrift : less security but that flexible labor market also saw the number of people with permanent contracts fall in recent years – even before the crisis .
more people are working in so-called mini-jobs and other temporary arrangements .
the wages paid by such jobs are often not enough for workers to live on .
these kinds of developments , together with agreements between unions and employers on small or moderate wage increases have contributed to the phenomenon of wage stagnation in germany over the last decade .
while the development has made german firms more competitive , it has not strengthened consumer demand and wage levels have become decoupled from increases in productivity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions are beginning to ask for wage increases after years of moderating their demands wage gap in other countries , such as south korea , the us and japan , wages are no longer tied to growth in productivity , according to the ilo .
while company and investment profits have grown , worker income has sunk .
the ilo demanded that rises in productivity be accompanied by wage increases and that more should be done to slow the trend toward low-wage work .
but a new dynamic is slowly being seen in wage structures , brought about largely by germany 's economic boom .
unions have begun demanding higher wages .
in the public-service sector , the demand is for a three-percent increase ; the ig bce industrial union is calling for a 6 percent increase for employees in the chemical sector ; and workers at telecommunications giant deutsche telekom want a 6.5 percent raise . the powerful ig metal union says it plans to increase its demands when it enters important wage negotiations in the spring of 2012 .

but there 's another side to the coin .
wages in germany have stagnated , and the crisis is not entirely to blame . while the german economy is experiencing near record growth in the wake of the global economic crisis in sharp contrast to other european countries , there is a darker side to the country 's economic development - wage stagnation .
while in most other industrialized countries wages over the past 10 years have risen by 25 percent on average , wages in germany have fallen .
from 2000 to 2009 , real incomes among german workers fell by 4.5 percent , according to numbers adjusted for inflation and released by the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- on wednesday .
even though wages in other countries over the past few years have increased , the economic crisis has had a drastic slowing effect .
while , workers around the world saw wage increases of 2.8 percent in 2006 and 2007 , that growth slowed to around 1.5 percent in 2008 and 2009 .
according to the ilo , the bill for the global financial crisis has been paid by workers , particularly when considering the number of unemployed .
compared to 2007 , the number of jobless worldwide rose last year by about 30 million to 207 million .
the price of growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany , europe 's ' economic locomotive , ' is going full steam , but wages are n't keeping up none of the world 's leading industrialized countries is better positioned competitively than germany .
europe 's economic locomotive has charged out of financial meltdown , thanks in large part to its more flexible labor market .
one example of the flexibility is state-subsidized " short-time " work , known in german as kurzarbeit .
under this plan , companies do not fire employees during times of crisis , but shorten their hours and pay instead .
therefore employees become less of a load on companies ' accounts but do n't end up in the unemployment line .
their salaries are partially paid by their companies , and then topped off by the federal labor agency .
the plan helped keep germany 's unemployment rate under control during the peak of the financial crisis , and has received praise from the ilo .
through " intelligent labor market instruments " and " positive dialog with social partners , " employment rates remained fairly stable and wages fell only slightly , the organization said .
the short-time work rules were a " good investment " that prevented layoffs and helped support domestic demand .
bildunterschrift : less security but that flexible labor market also saw the number of people with permanent contracts fall in recent years – even before the crisis .
more people are working in so-called mini-jobs and other temporary arrangements .
the wages paid by such jobs are often not enough for workers to live on .
these kinds of developments , together with agreements between unions and employers on small or moderate wage increases have contributed to the phenomenon of wage stagnation in germany over the last decade .
while the development has made german firms more competitive , it has not strengthened consumer demand and wage levels have become decoupled from increases in productivity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions are beginning to ask for wage increases after years of moderating their demands wage gap in other countries , such as south korea , the us and japan , wages are no longer tied to growth in productivity , according to the ilo .
while company and investment profits have grown , worker income has sunk .
the ilo demanded that rises in productivity be accompanied by wage increases and that more should be done to slow the trend toward low-wage work .
but a new dynamic is slowly being seen in wage structures , brought about largely by germany 's economic boom .
unions have begun demanding higher wages .
in the public-service sector , the demand is for a three-percent increase ; the ig bce industrial union is calling for a 6 percent increase for employees in the chemical sector ; and workers at telecommunications giant deutsche telekom want a 6.5 percent raise . the powerful ig metal union says it plans to increase its demands when it enters important wage negotiations in the spring of 2012 .

assange is free until a ruling is made on a swedish extradition warrant . julian assange was released from jail in london on thursday evening .
british high court judge duncan ouseley handed down his decision earlier in the day , confirming a lower court 's ruling that the 39-year-old australian could be freed on 200,000 gbp bail -lrb- 236,000 euros , $ 317,000 -rrb- under strict conditions .
" i hope to continue my work and continue to protest my innocence in this matter and to reveal as we get it , which we have not yet , the evidence from these allegations , " he said in a brief statement on the steps of the high court in london . the stringent bail conditions mean that assange will be subject to electronic tagging and a curfew .
assange must also reside at a supporter 's country mansion in suffolk , eastern england , and report regularly to the police , the judge said .
the estate , ellingham hall , belongs to vaughan smith , a former british army officer who founded the frontline club , a media group in london where wikileaks has based part of its operations .
judge : not a ' fugitive from justice ' british prosecutors had been trying to keep assange behind bars until his extradition hearing , arguing that there was a risk he would flee the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assange still faces extradition on sex crime charges justice ouseley rejected that assertion , saying that the court did not view the defendant as a " fugitive from justice " who was seeking to " avoid interrogation and prosecution . "
lawyers for assange said bail money was " in the banking system " and that they expected their client to be released later in the day .
" we are expecting julian to be released some time later today .
everybody is working very hard for that , " said assange 's attorney , mark stephens .
assange has been in jail since december 7 , after he turned himself in to british police over a swedish sex crimes warrant .
two women in sweden , who are wikileaks volunteers , have accused him of rape and sexual molestation .
the australian has denied any wrongdoing and claims that the allegations are trumped up charges and politically motivated .
for their part , the two swedish women have said they were never pressured to file charges .
assange is the main force behind the release of tens of thousands of confidential us diplomatic cables , which include details of overseas sites that washington regards as vital to its national security .

us president barack obama presented a review of the situation one year since the us launched a new strategy . us president barack obama on thursday said nato troops in afghanistan were making good progress in their fight against taliban insurgents , but cautioned that " gains are still fragile and reversible . "
obama presented a review of the progress made since washington outlined a new strategy one year ago , when obama had ordered 30,000 more troops to afghanistan .
the revised strategy also stepped up civilian efforts to strengthen the local government in kabul .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamid karzai did not always live up to us expectations " it continues to be a very difficult endeavor .
but i can report that , thanks to the extraordinary service of our troops and civilians on the ground , we are on track to achieve our goals . "
currently there are around 90,000 us soldiers stationed in the country as part of the nato contingent , as well as another 23,000 under washington 's immediate command .
al qaeda remains the enemy the main goal of the operation was not to cover the entire country or rebuild it , but to crack down on the al qaeda network hiding in afghanistan , obama said .
in that respect , he added , substantial progress had been made .
" al qaeda is hunkered down .
it will take time to ultimately defeat al qaeda and it remains a ruthless and resilient enemy bent on attacking our country .
but make no mistake we 're going to remain relentless in disrupting and dismantling that terrorist organization . "
the report outlined major gains that had been made in clearing the taliban from the kandahar and helmand provinces while at the same time improving the capability of the afghan army and security forces .
nato forces plan to hand over security responsibility to kabul in 2014 in order to subsequently take on a training and advisory role .

this seems to indicate a move away from the recent harsh criticism of president hamid karzai for his government 's inefficiency in backing nato efforts to defeat the taliban .
obama also stressed the importance of washington 's close cooperation with pakistan in addressing the growing problem of islamist insurgents seeking refuge in mountains along the afghan-pakistani border .
" nevertheless , progress has not come fast enough , so we will continue to insist to pakistani leaders that terrorist safe havens within their borders must be dealt with .
we 'll speed up our investment in civilian institutions and projects that improve the lives of pakistanis , " obama said .
improving relations with islamabad is seen as key in the new strategy deny .

all german troops should be out of the country by the end of 2014 . foreign minister guido westerwelle has announced that german troops will start withdrawing from afghanistan in a year 's time .
" at the end of 2011 we 'll be able to start reducing our bundeswehr deployment in afghanistan , " westerwelle told the lower house of parliament , the bundestag on thursday .
the minister went further than a progress report on germany 's mission in afghanistan , which said the withdrawal might not begin until the start of 2012 .
westerwelle also told the bundestag that the mission in afghanistan was about defending germany 's security .
" that is why this deployment is the right thing to do .
but it must not go on without end , and that is also the right thing , " he said .
report shows work needs doing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle said the afghan mission could not go on indefinitely the statement was based on the 108-page progress report issued earlier this week in which berlin assessed what had been achieved in the nine years since it first sent soldiers to afghanistan to prevent the taliban from returning to power .
the government is seeking a fresh authorization from parliament in january for the deployment , which has a limit of about 5,000 personnel .
the commitment to start reducing the overall number in late 2011 is aimed at winning over public skepticism in germany about the mission .
as far as the current situation in afghanistan is concerned , westerwelle said there was " light , but there are still too many shadows . "
he said , however , that there was reason to believe that the international community would reach its goals in afghanistan .
according to the progress report , there has to be a longer-term military and civil engagement in afghanistan on the part of international forces .
gernot erler of the opposition social democrats praised the timing of the report .
he said that members of the bundestag " definitely " needed better information in order to make the difficult decision in january .
however , erler criticized the fact that the report did not contain a critical assessment of german activities in afghanistan .
he cited the danger of corruption in the north of the country .
defense minister more vague about timing in comparison to westerwelle , the german defense minister , karl-theodor zu guttenberg , has been reluctant to name a date for the withdrawal of german troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zu guttenberg visited soldiers in afghanistan earlier this week " i 'm not the kind of person who says ' next year we 're going to withdraw soldiers here or there , " ' zu guttenberg told the german news website spiegel online on monday .
" that would be irresponsible . "
zu guttenberg added there were no concrete plans for the withdrawal of the bundeswehr in the north of afghanistan .
by contrast , his cabinet colleague guido westerwelle was more specific on thursday .
he told the bundestag that deployments in the north of afghanistan would be among the first regions to be handed over to afghan command in the first half of 2011 .
nato decided in lisbon last month to end the military mission in afghanistan by the end of 2014 , if the security situation allows for it .
westerwelle confirmed that he expected that there would be no more german troops in afghanistan beyond 2014 .

all german troops should be out of the country by the end of 2014 . foreign minister guido westerwelle has announced that german troops will start withdrawing from afghanistan in a year 's time .
" at the end of 2011 we 'll be able to start reducing our bundeswehr deployment in afghanistan , " westerwelle told the lower house of parliament , the bundestag on thursday .
the minister went further than a progress report on germany 's mission in afghanistan , which said the withdrawal might not begin until the start of 2012 .
westerwelle also told the bundestag that the mission in afghanistan was about defending germany 's security .
" that is why this deployment is the right thing to do .
but it must not go on without end , and that is also the right thing , " he said .
report shows work needs doing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle said the afghan mission could not go on indefinitely the statement was based on the 108-page progress report issued earlier this week in which berlin assessed what had been achieved in the nine years since it first sent soldiers to afghanistan to prevent the taliban from returning to power .
the government is seeking a fresh authorization from parliament in january for the deployment , which has a limit of about 5,000 personnel .
the commitment to start reducing the overall number in late 2011 is aimed at winning over public skepticism in germany about the mission .
as far as the current situation in afghanistan is concerned , westerwelle said there was " light , but there are still too many shadows . "
he said , however , that there was reason to believe that the international community would reach its goals in afghanistan .
according to the progress report , there has to be a longer-term military and civil engagement in afghanistan on the part of international forces .
gernot erler of the opposition social democrats praised the timing of the report .
he said that members of the bundestag " definitely " needed better information in order to make the difficult decision in january .
however , erler criticized the fact that the report did not contain a critical assessment of german activities in afghanistan .
he cited the danger of corruption in the north of the country .
defense minister more vague about timing in comparison to westerwelle , the german defense minister , karl-theodor zu guttenberg , has been reluctant to name a date for the withdrawal of german troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zu guttenberg visited soldiers in afghanistan earlier this week " i 'm not the kind of person who says ' next year we 're going to withdraw soldiers here or there , " ' zu guttenberg told the german news website spiegel online on monday .
" that would be irresponsible . "
zu guttenberg added there were no concrete plans for the withdrawal of the bundeswehr in the north of afghanistan .
by contrast , his cabinet colleague guido westerwelle was more specific on thursday .
he told the bundestag that deployments in the north of afghanistan would be among the first regions to be handed over to afghan command in the first half of 2011 .
nato decided in lisbon last month to end the military mission in afghanistan by the end of 2014 , if the security situation allows for it .
westerwelle confirmed that he expected that there would be no more german troops in afghanistan beyond 2014 .

despite threats from anti-nuclear protesters , there have only been minor delays . the nuclear-waste transport from a research center in southern france is heading towards a storage facility in lubmin in northern germany with only minor hold-ups .
unlike previous trains carrying nuclear waste , the transport has had a relatively easy journey through france and western germany , although it was interrupted briefly by anti-nuclear demonstrators .
the shipment is scheduled to arrive at its destination on thursday .
the train is carrying four containers with around 2,500 spent fuel rods , that are originally from a research facility in the southwestern german city of karlsruhe that went offline in 1991 , and the research vessel otto hahn , which has n't been used since 1979 .
potential for disruption the last few kilometers could be the most challenging for the transport , as protesters gathered outside lubmin on thursday morning , prepared to stage sit-in protests on the tracks .
greenpeace activists managed to unfurl a banner reading " stop transports to lubmin " from a bridge over the rail track near the train 's final destination .
around 200 demonstrators camped for a few hours overnight at three sites outside lubmin , with activists planning to move towards the railway tracks in the course of the morning .
the train began its journey on tuesday evening in the southern french region of aix-en-provence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police searched the tracks before the train passed the transport has made a number of scheduled stops , to allow for staff changes .
shortly before midnight on wednesday the train was held up by anti-nuclear demonstrators near the town of erfurt , but only for a couple of minutes .
around 20 protesters had managed to get close to the tracks .
in the early hours of the morning the train was held up again , apparently because of a technical problem .
easier than gorleben so far this latest transport of nuclear waste has met with noticeably less resistance than a similar shipment five weeks ago , which was travelling from france to another storage facility near the northern german town of gorleben .
that transport was met with massive protests , with tens of thousands of nuclear-energy opponents physically preventing the passage of the train .
around 20,000 police officers were deployed in the operation , and that train was delayed by around 24 hours .
police believe that the freezing december temperatures and heavy snowfall across much of germany have kept protesters away this time round .
a few dozen detemined protesters have tried to disrupt the passage , but the scale of the demonstrations have been much smaller than five weeks ago .

kagawa then directed the ball precisely past goalkeeper andres palop , giving his side a dream start .
things went rapidly downhill after 31 minutes and consistent pressure from sevilla culminated in a goal for ndri romaric following an error in defense from dortmund 's lukasz piszcek .
two minutes later , sevilla went ahead with a glancing header by frederic kanoute - at the end of a cross from midfielder diego perotti .
dortmund 's hopes were raised after half time when a corner from nuri sahin found neven subotic , who headed past palop to bring the scores level .
efforts fail to pay off despite efforts from dortmund to pull ahead , chances were few and far-between and sevilla held onto the draw .
the result meant sevilla progress to the final 32 of the competition with 10 points - two behind leaders paris st. germain .

despite a good start , the germans could only manage a draw against their rivals for second place in the group , sevilla . bundesliga leaders borussia dortmund 's hopes of progress in the europa league were dashed on wednesday night when a vital breakthrough goal proved elusive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things looked good at first , with an early dortmund goal from kagawa in their soccer clash with sevilla , dortmund needed a win if they were to seize second place in group j from the spaniards .
japanese striker shinji kagawa gave dortmund an early lead after four minutes after he picked up the ball from a loose clearance by sevilla defender julian escude .
kagawa then directed the ball precisely past goalkeeper andres palop , giving his side a dream start .
things went rapidly downhill after 31 minutes and consistent pressure from sevilla culminated in a goal for ndri romaric following an error in defense from dortmund 's lukasz piszcek .
two minutes later , sevilla went ahead with a glancing header by frederic kanoute - at the end of a cross from midfielder diego perotti .
dortmund 's hopes were raised after half time when a corner from nuri sahin found neven subotic , who headed past palop to bring the scores level .
efforts fail to pay off despite efforts from dortmund to pull ahead , chances were few and far-between and sevilla held onto the draw .
the result meant sevilla progress to the final 32 of the competition with 10 points - two behind leaders paris st. germain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp said the team had only itself to blame dortmund coach juergen klopp rushed onto the field at the end of the game to prevent his players from challenging officials with allegations that sevilla players had been time-wasting .
" we brought the result on ourselves , " said klopp .
" we simply failed to get the third goal but it was possible . "
in tomorrow 's europa league football , stuttgart host danish side odense bk while bayer leverkusen entertain atletico madrid .
both german teams sit at the top of their respective groups .

the bank had harbored countless german tax evaders and has now agreed to a record fine . german prosecutors have dropped a lawsuit against a liechtenstein bank over charges of aiding and abetting tax evasion .
the state-owned lgt bank agreed to a settlement with a record 50 million euro -lrb- $ 67 million -rrb- fine .
the case was triggered when german tax authorities bought several cds from informants in liechtenstein , who had copied and stolen data on german tax evaders hiding their money in the small alpine tax haven .
aside from hunting down german tax evaders with the material , prosecutors also began proceedings against the liechtenstein bank itself for being an accessory to tax evasion .
the bank 's consultants were in effect accused of consciously advising and assisting wealthy germans to evade paying taxes .
fine for bank and employees in the settlement with the german prosecutors , the lgt bank has agreed to pay some 46 million euros .
another 3.6 million euros will have to be shouldered by around 45 individual employees of the bank .
the purchase of the leaked data was highly controversial in germany as the material had initially been stolen in liechtenstein and subsequently offered to germany for the price of several million euros .
in a similar case , germany bought a cd containing lists of tax evaders hiding their money in switzerland 's credit suisse bank .
the stolen data has lead to a number of arrests in germany , among them the high profile case of former deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de genetics -pipe- 16.12.2010 scientists in germany shed new light on embryonic development großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embryos of different species can look remarkably similar at a certain stage in their development darwin noticed striking similarities between embryos of different species .
now , scientists in germany have proven that there are also similarities on the level of gene expression . what do a fish and a mouse have in common ?
not much , most people would say .
yet , if you look at them at a certain stage in their embryonic development , you can hardly distinguish the two .
but this is hardly a new idea - the founder of embryology karl ernst von baer observed this in the 19th century .
" it 's a question scientists have tried to explain ever since these similarities were first observed " , said pavel tomancak , a researcher at the max planck institute of molecular cell biology and genetics in dresden , in an interview with deutsche welle .
in a new paper published last week in the journal nature , scientists in germany have proven that embryos from different species do n't just look the same - there are striking parallels between individual development and the development of a species on the level of gene expression , too .
21st century science confirms 19th century hunch german biologist ernst haeckel in 1866 took it a step further by postulating that at some point human embryos look like the embroys of fish species , he noticed , and since fish were seen as an evolutionary more primitive animal form than humans he proposed that they must all have the same ancestral features of some 600 million years ago .
his theory : the development of an organism mirrors the evolutionary development of the species , or as evolutionary biologists put it : " ontogeny recapitulating phylogeny . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : different fruit fly species are strikingly similar also on the level of gene expression the findings were of a mere qualitative nature , of course : the scientists in the 19th century were drawing their conclusions from what they saw .
in the 20th century , this qualitiative method was largely abandoned , most scientists stopped looking at the morphology and tried to find quantitative proof for their theories .
the second half of the 20th century were an important time for molecular science , with remarkable progress being made in the field of gene and dna analysis .
scientists were able to look at embryos before their phylotypic stage , which is the middle of the embryonic development .
the " waist " of the hourglass they noticed that there were differences before and after the phylotypic stage and came up with what came to be known as the " hourglass model . "
species-specific differences predominate before and after the phylotypic stage , so the phylotypic stage represents the " waist " of the hourglass .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advances in molecular science meant darwin 's theory could be checked quantitatively the question as to how this extensive morphological similarity - the " waist of the hourglass " - arises is one that preoccupied pavel tomancak and his colleagues from the max-planck-institute in dresden .
in a process of one and a half years his team collected samples of embryos of six fruit fly species , and measured gene expression across the genome at different times of embroygenesis .
the analysis took another year .
what they found was that there was a very strong pattern .
" we knew we 'd discovered something very early on " , lead scientist pavel tomancak told deutsche welle .
tomancak 's team found that not only in morphology but also in the expression pattern of the genes , the similarities between embryos of different species in one animal phylum are greatest during the phylotypic stage .
before and after this phase , the differences between the species are greater .
" darwin had a point " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naturalists like carl ernst von baer were the forefathers of the " hourglass theory " but the question remained : which model could be applied to prove that they were right ?
the pattern was so strong that it could n't be random , tomancak observed .
" we found that natural selection constrains genes most strongly during the phylotypic stage " , he told deutsche welle .
the results show that the similarity between different animal species in the middle of their embryonic development is shaped by selection .
their discoveries throw new light on an age-old biological conundrum : that of the link between ontogeny and phylogeny .
" our discovery confirms the earlier anatomical studies and broadens our understanding of how development and evolution are linked at molecular level " , said alex t. kalinka , a researcher from the dresden group , in an interview with the journal , nature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at a certain stage , human embryos look just like fish embryos in a different study , researchers at the max-planck-institute for evolutionary biology in ploen demonstrated with zebrafish that the phylogenetically oldest genes are active during the phylotypic stage and that , before and after this stage , the most active genes are those that arose later in evolutionary history .
the scientists also found something else : in adult zebrafish progressively older genes are also activated with the increasing age of the animals .
they found the same to be true in fruit flies and threadworms .
as a follow-up the researchers in dresden are thinking about manipulating genes at the phylotypic stage to see what happens .
while fossils allow scientists to look at what species looked like when they were living on our planet .
" our findings are like a time machine , we can look at what the genome was like 600 million years ago , " tomancak said .

" darwin had a point " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naturalists like carl ernst von baer were the forefathers of the " hourglass theory " but the question remained : which model could be applied to prove that they were right ?
the pattern was so strong that it could n't be random , tomancak observed .
" we found that natural selection constrains genes most strongly during the phylotypic stage " , he told deutsche welle .
the results show that the similarity between different animal species in the middle of their embryonic development is shaped by selection .
their discoveries throw new light on an age-old biological conundrum : that of the link between ontogeny and phylogeny .
" our discovery confirms the earlier anatomical studies and broadens our understanding of how development and evolution are linked at molecular level " , said alex t. kalinka , a researcher from the dresden group , in an interview with the journal , nature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at a certain stage , human embryos look just like fish embryos in a different study , researchers at the max-planck-institute for evolutionary biology in ploen demonstrated with zebrafish that the phylogenetically oldest genes are active during the phylotypic stage and that , before and after this stage , the most active genes are those that arose later in evolutionary history .
the scientists also found something else : in adult zebrafish progressively older genes are also activated with the increasing age of the animals .
they found the same to be true in fruit flies and threadworms .
as a follow-up the researchers in dresden are thinking about manipulating genes at the phylotypic stage to see what happens .
while fossils allow scientists to look at what species looked like when they were living on our planet .
" our findings are like a time machine , we can look at what the genome was like 600 million years ago , " tomancak said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 16.12.2010 eu leaders agree to create permanent euro crisis fund großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders need to find a way forward for the eurozone european union leaders meeting in brussels have approved a small change to the lisbon treaty in order to create a eurozone bailout system . european union leaders on thursday agreed on a change in the bloc 's rule-book , the lisbon treaty , enabling the creation of a permanent rescue fund for eurozone countries in crisis from mid-2013 .
" we all share the same objective : to ensure a stable europe and currency , " german chancellor angela merkel said describing the future euro crisis umbrella a " big piece of solidarity between the states that share the euro . "
greek prime minister george papandreou , whose country was the first to need a multi-billion euro bailout from brussels , said all eu members had to stand together now .
" the challenge today is not what we as member states or nations are doing to shore up our individual economy , the challenge is a collective one now , " he said .
as if to underscore the urgency of the matter , the european central bank on thursday announced it has decided to double its capital base by the end of the year to cope with increased credit risk and market volatility .
divergent opinions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has argued against euro bonds but while there may be a collective resolve to protect the eurozone , there is no consensus on the way forward : differences exist between member states , between parties and between european institutions .
this recently prompted european commission president jose manuel barroso to call on the european parliament to demonstrate - above all - unity .
" what we do not need is a beauty pageant of heads of state and government , " he said , " a cacophony of different scenarios and proclamations without an outcome . "
however , statements made by members of the european parliament on the issue have pointed to anything but unity .
belgian politician guy verhofstadt , who leads the liberal faction in the european parliament , attempted to pin down what he believed was the central problem of the monetary union .
" nowhere in the world is there a currency that is not supported by a government , an economic strategy and a bond market , " he said , going on to call for common euro bonds , termed e-bonds , as well as more mutual coordination on european economic and budgetary policy .
however , the government of germany , europe 's largest economy , rejects this idea - and is n't alone on this issue .
two sides to every coin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso called for unity on the euro bonds debate martin schulz , the head of the socialists in the european parliament , bemoans what he calls a crisis of confidence in europe , in which governments only reveal economic truths piecemeal , whether they concern the greek debt crisis or a financial rescue fund .
" it 's a heavy jolt to the trust in governments when the tell the public that all is well and that everything is under control one minute , and then suddenly , overnight , come out and say we need countless billions in aid , " he said .
but while schulz calls for solidarity with debt-laden countries like greece and ireland , conservatives are arguing for the exact opposite .
belgian politician derk jan eppink harkened back to statements by the flemish separatist bart de wever , who names the flemish transfer of public funds to the relatively poor walloons as the chief cause for discontent among the flemish .
eppink believes his divided country can act as a warning to europe : " we have turned a relationship based on partnership -lsb- between walloons and flemish -rsb- into one based on transfer -lsb- from one side to the other -rsb- .
" if europe continues to proceed in the same way , in a few years the eu will find itself in the same position as belgium : a community based on transfers , whose political basis is crumbling . "
but in the debate about how best to stabilize the eurozone , one thing is clear : no matter what course of action is chosen , it will be expensive , for everyone involved .

putin said of the 47-year-old former oil billionaire khodorkovsky , who is standing trial on charges of stealing over 200 tons of oil from his own wells , that a “ thief must be in prison . ”
" we must operate based on the fact that mr. khodorkovsky 's guilt has been proven in court , " putin said .
khodorkovsky is awaiting delivery of a verdict , which has been delayed until december 27 .
since his incarceration , khodorkovsky has been russia 's highest-profile inmate .
he has been an outspoken critic of the kremlin , and particularly of putin .
the former oil billionaire , who was a major shareholder in failed petroleum company yukos , is already serving an eight-year sentence for tax evasion , which is set to expire in 2011 .
if found guilty of the fresh charges , he could face an additional six years in prison .

in this year 's edition , the former president also fielded a question on ethnic clashes in moscow last week , which left more than 30 people injured and raised doubts about the kremlin 's ability to stem a rising tide of xenophobia .
" there is a need to suppress all the manifestations of extremism on all sides , " putin said .
" there should be an order , " he said .
" we are children of one country .
" society , including liberal society , must understand that there must be order and one must support the government now in power in order to support the interests of the majority , " he added putin also addressed the russian economy , which he said would grow by up to four percent this year , with an increase in real incomes thanks to pension increases .
" in the first half of 2012 we should get back to the pre-crisis level -lrb- of gross domestic product -rrb- , " he said .

us president barack obama presented a review of the situation one year since the us launched a new strategy . us president barack obama on thursday said nato troops in afghanistan were making good progress in their fight against taliban insurgents , but cautioned that " gains are still fragile and reversible . "
obama presented a review of the progress made since washington outlined a new strategy one year ago , when obama had ordered 30,000 more troops to afghanistan .
the revised strategy also stepped up civilian efforts to strengthen the local government in kabul .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamid karzai did not always live up to us expectations " it continues to be a very difficult endeavor .
but i can report that , thanks to the extraordinary service of our troops and civilians on the ground , we are on track to achieve our goals . "
currently there are around 90,000 us soldiers stationed in the country as part of the nato contingent , as well as another 23,000 under washington 's immediate command .
al qaeda remains the enemy the main goal of the operation was not to cover the entire country or rebuild it , but to crack down on the al qaeda network hiding in afghanistan , obama said .
in that respect , he added , substantial progress had been made .
" al qaeda is hunkered down .
it will take time to ultimately defeat al qaeda and it remains a ruthless and resilient enemy bent on attacking our country .
but make no mistake we 're going to remain relentless in disrupting and dismantling that terrorist organization . "
the report outlined major gains that had been made in clearing the taliban from the kandahar and helmand provinces while at the same time improving the capability of the afghan army and security forces .
nato forces plan to hand over security responsibility to kabul in 2014 in order to subsequently take on a training and advisory role .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato troops hope to hand over to afghan forces in 2014 close ties to kabul and islamabad the us president called upon the afghan government to implement more transparency and announced a new american-afghan partnership deal in the coming year .
this seems to indicate a move away from the recent harsh criticism of president hamid karzai for his government 's inefficiency in backing nato efforts to defeat the taliban .
obama also stressed the importance of washington 's close cooperation with pakistan in addressing the growing problem of islamist insurgents seeking refuge in mountains along the afghan-pakistani border .
" nevertheless , progress has not come fast enough , so we will continue to insist to pakistani leaders that terrorist safe havens within their borders must be dealt with .
we 'll speed up our investment in civilian institutions and projects that improve the lives of pakistanis , " obama said .
improving relations with islamabad is seen as key in the new strategy deny .
the us congress last year approved a $ 7.5 billion-package -lrb- 5.7 billion euros -rrb- to support aid to the frontline country .

but there 's another side to the coin .
wages in germany have stagnated , and the crisis is not entirely to blame . while the german economy is experiencing near record growth in the wake of the global economic crisis in sharp contrast to other european countries , there is a darker side to the country 's economic development - wage stagnation .
while in most other industrialized countries wages over the past 10 years have risen by 25 percent on average , wages in germany have fallen .
from 2000 to 2009 , real incomes among german workers fell by 4.5 percent , according to numbers adjusted for inflation and released by the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- on wednesday .
even though wages in other countries over the past few years have increased , the economic crisis has had a drastic slowing effect .
while , workers around the world saw wage increases of 2.8 percent in 2006 and 2007 , that growth slowed to around 1.5 percent in 2008 and 2009 .
according to the ilo , the bill for the global financial crisis has been paid by workers , particularly when considering the number of unemployed .
compared to 2007 , the number of jobless worldwide rose last year by about 30 million to 207 million .
the price of growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany , europe 's ' economic locomotive , ' is going full steam , but wages are n't keeping up none of the world 's leading industrialized countries is better positioned competitively than germany .
europe 's economic locomotive has charged out of financial meltdown , thanks in large part to its more flexible labor market .
one example of the flexibility is state-subsidized " short-time " work , known in german as kurzarbeit .
under this plan , companies do not fire employees during times of crisis , but shorten their hours and pay instead .
therefore employees become less of a load on companies ' accounts but do n't end up in the unemployment line .
their salaries are partially paid by their companies , and then topped off by the federal labor agency .
the plan helped keep germany 's unemployment rate under control during the peak of the financial crisis , and has received praise from the ilo .
through " intelligent labor market instruments " and " positive dialog with social partners , " employment rates remained fairly stable and wages fell only slightly , the organization said .
the short-time work rules were a " good investment " that prevented layoffs and helped support domestic demand .
bildunterschrift : less security but that flexible labor market also saw the number of people with permanent contracts fall in recent years – even before the crisis .
more people are working in so-called mini-jobs and other temporary arrangements .
the wages paid by such jobs are often not enough for workers to live on .
these kinds of developments , together with agreements between unions and employers on small or moderate wage increases have contributed to the phenomenon of wage stagnation in germany over the last decade .
while the development has made german firms more competitive , it has not strengthened consumer demand and wage levels have become decoupled from increases in productivity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions are beginning to ask for wage increases after years of moderating their demands wage gap in other countries , such as south korea , the us and japan , wages are no longer tied to growth in productivity , according to the ilo .
while company and investment profits have grown , worker income has sunk .
the ilo demanded that rises in productivity be accompanied by wage increases and that more should be done to slow the trend toward low-wage work .
but a new dynamic is slowly being seen in wage structures , brought about largely by germany 's economic boom .
unions have begun demanding higher wages .
in the public-service sector , the demand is for a three-percent increase ; the ig bce industrial union is calling for a 6 percent increase for employees in the chemical sector ; and workers at telecommunications giant deutsche telekom want a 6.5 percent raise . the powerful ig metal union says it plans to increase its demands when it enters important wage negotiations in the spring of 2012 .

all german troops should be out of the country by the end of 2014 . foreign minister guido westerwelle has announced that german troops will start withdrawing from afghanistan in a year 's time .
" at the end of 2011 we 'll be able to start reducing our bundeswehr deployment in afghanistan , " westerwelle told the lower house of parliament , the bundestag on thursday .
the minister went further than a progress report on germany 's mission in afghanistan , which said the withdrawal might not begin until the start of 2012 .
westerwelle also told the bundestag that the mission in afghanistan was about defending germany 's security .
" that is why this deployment is the right thing to do .
but it must not go on without end , and that is also the right thing , " he said .
report shows work needs doing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle said the afghan mission could not go on indefinitely the statement was based on the 108-page progress report issued earlier this week in which berlin assessed what had been achieved in the nine years since it first sent soldiers to afghanistan to prevent the taliban from returning to power .
the government is seeking a fresh authorization from parliament in january for the deployment , which has a limit of about 5,000 personnel .
the commitment to start reducing the overall number in late 2011 is aimed at winning over public skepticism in germany about the mission .
as far as the current situation in afghanistan is concerned , westerwelle said there was " light , but there are still too many shadows . "
he said , however , that there was reason to believe that the international community would reach its goals in afghanistan .
according to the progress report , there has to be a longer-term military and civil engagement in afghanistan on the part of international forces .
gernot erler of the opposition social democrats praised the timing of the report .
he said that members of the bundestag " definitely " needed better information in order to make the difficult decision in january .
however , erler criticized the fact that the report did not contain a critical assessment of german activities in afghanistan .
he cited the danger of corruption in the north of the country .
defense minister more vague about timing in comparison to westerwelle , the german defense minister , karl-theodor zu guttenberg , has been reluctant to name a date for the withdrawal of german troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zu guttenberg visited soldiers in afghanistan earlier this week " i 'm not the kind of person who says ' next year we 're going to withdraw soldiers here or there , " ' zu guttenberg told the german news website spiegel online on monday .
" that would be irresponsible . "
zu guttenberg added there were no concrete plans for the withdrawal of the bundeswehr in the north of afghanistan .
by contrast , his cabinet colleague guido westerwelle was more specific on thursday .
he told the bundestag that deployments in the north of afghanistan would be among the first regions to be handed over to afghan command in the first half of 2011 .
nato decided in lisbon last month to end the military mission in afghanistan by the end of 2014 , if the security situation allows for it .
westerwelle confirmed that he expected that there would be no more german troops in afghanistan beyond 2014 .

to the contrary , national public broadcasters in germany are financed from subscription fees . in the restructuring of the broadcast landscape following german unification , dw was the only broadcaster to remain organized under federal law .
unlike the ard public broadcasting networks , deutschlandradio and zdf , dw receives no funding from subscription fees , but is rather supported through tax revenue .
the minister of culture and media , currently bernd neumann , is the responsible official .

us president barack obama presented a review of the situation one year since the us launched a new strategy . us president barack obama on thursday said nato troops in afghanistan were making good progress in their fight against taliban insurgents , but cautioned that " gains are still fragile and reversible . "
obama presented a review of the progress made since washington outlined a new strategy one year ago , when obama had ordered 30,000 more troops to afghanistan .
the revised strategy also stepped up civilian efforts to strengthen the local government in kabul .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamid karzai did not always live up to us expectations " it continues to be a very difficult endeavor .
but i can report that , thanks to the extraordinary service of our troops and civilians on the ground , we are on track to achieve our goals . "
currently there are around 90,000 us soldiers stationed in the country as part of the nato contingent , as well as another 23,000 under washington 's immediate command .
al qaeda remains the enemy the main goal of the operation was not to cover the entire country or rebuild it , but to crack down on the al qaeda network hiding in afghanistan , obama said .
in that respect , he added , substantial progress had been made .
" al qaeda is hunkered down .
it will take time to ultimately defeat al qaeda and it remains a ruthless and resilient enemy bent on attacking our country .
but make no mistake we 're going to remain relentless in disrupting and dismantling that terrorist organization . "
the report outlined major gains that had been made in clearing the taliban from the kandahar and helmand provinces while at the same time improving the capability of the afghan army and security forces .
nato forces plan to hand over security responsibility to kabul in 2014 in order to subsequently take on a training and advisory role .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato troops hope to hand over to afghan forces in 2014 close ties to kabul and islamabad the us president called upon the afghan government to implement more transparency and announced a new american-afghan partnership deal in the coming year .
this seems to indicate a move away from the recent harsh criticism of president hamid karzai for his government 's inefficiency in backing nato efforts to defeat the taliban .
obama also stressed the importance of washington 's close cooperation with pakistan in addressing the growing problem of islamist insurgents seeking refuge in mountains along the afghan-pakistani border .
" nevertheless , progress has not come fast enough , so we will continue to insist to pakistani leaders that terrorist safe havens within their borders must be dealt with .
we 'll speed up our investment in civilian institutions and projects that improve the lives of pakistanis , " obama said .
improving relations with islamabad is seen as key in the new strategy deny .
the us congress last year approved a $ 7.5 billion-package -lrb- 5.7 billion euros -rrb- to support aid to the frontline country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 16.12.2010 eu leaders agree to create permanent euro crisis fund großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders need to find a way forward for the eurozone european union leaders meeting in brussels have approved a small change to the lisbon treaty in order to create a eurozone bailout system . european union leaders on thursday agreed on a change in the bloc 's rule-book , the lisbon treaty , enabling the creation of a permanent rescue fund for eurozone countries in crisis from mid-2013 .
" we all share the same objective : to ensure a stable europe and currency , " german chancellor angela merkel said describing the future euro crisis umbrella a " big piece of solidarity between the states that share the euro . "
greek prime minister george papandreou , whose country was the first to need a multi-billion euro bailout from brussels , said all eu members had to stand together now .
" the challenge today is not what we as member states or nations are doing to shore up our individual economy , the challenge is a collective one now , " he said .
as if to underscore the urgency of the matter , the european central bank on thursday announced it has decided to double its capital base by the end of the year to cope with increased credit risk and market volatility .
divergent opinions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has argued against euro bonds but while there may be a collective resolve to protect the eurozone , there is no consensus on the way forward : differences exist between member states , between parties and between european institutions .
this recently prompted european commission president jose manuel barroso to call on the european parliament to demonstrate - above all - unity .
" what we do not need is a beauty pageant of heads of state and government , " he said , " a cacophony of different scenarios and proclamations without an outcome . "
however , statements made by members of the european parliament on the issue have pointed to anything but unity .
belgian politician guy verhofstadt , who leads the liberal faction in the european parliament , attempted to pin down what he believed was the central problem of the monetary union .
" nowhere in the world is there a currency that is not supported by a government , an economic strategy and a bond market , " he said , going on to call for common euro bonds , termed e-bonds , as well as more mutual coordination on european economic and budgetary policy .
however , the government of germany , europe 's largest economy , rejects this idea - and is n't alone on this issue .
two sides to every coin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso called for unity on the euro bonds debate martin schulz , the head of the socialists in the european parliament , bemoans what he calls a crisis of confidence in europe , in which governments only reveal economic truths piecemeal , whether they concern the greek debt crisis or a financial rescue fund .
" it 's a heavy jolt to the trust in governments when the tell the public that all is well and that everything is under control one minute , and then suddenly , overnight , come out and say we need countless billions in aid , " he said .
but while schulz calls for solidarity with debt-laden countries like greece and ireland , conservatives are arguing for the exact opposite .
belgian politician derk jan eppink harkened back to statements by the flemish separatist bart de wever , who names the flemish transfer of public funds to the relatively poor walloons as the chief cause for discontent among the flemish .
eppink believes his divided country can act as a warning to europe : " we have turned a relationship based on partnership -lsb- between walloons and flemish -rsb- into one based on transfer -lsb- from one side to the other -rsb- .
" if europe continues to proceed in the same way , in a few years the eu will find itself in the same position as belgium : a community based on transfers , whose political basis is crumbling . "
but in the debate about how best to stabilize the eurozone , one thing is clear : no matter what course of action is chosen , it will be expensive , for everyone involved .

dw-world.de merkel stands firm , but german parliament split over euro crisis in a speech to parliament , german chancellor angela merkel has fortified her stance against eurozone bonds and increasing the eu 's financial rescue fund a day ahead of an eu summit to consider new rules for the eurozone .
-lrb- 15.12.2010 -rrb- eurobond proposals wo n't go away chancellor merkel has dismissed calls for the eurozone to pool sovereign debt due to the high costs it would impose on germany .

" we all share the same objective : to ensure a stable europe and currency , " german chancellor angela merkel said describing the future euro crisis umbrella a " big piece of solidarity between the states that share the euro . "
greek prime minister george papandreou , whose country was the first to need a multi-billion euro bailout from brussels , said all eu members had to stand together now .
" the challenge today is not what we as member states or nations are doing to shore up our individual economy , the challenge is a collective one now , " he said .
as if to underscore the urgency of the matter , the european central bank on thursday announced it has decided to double its capital base by the end of the year to cope with increased credit risk and market volatility .
divergent opinions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has argued against euro bonds but while there may be a collective resolve to protect the eurozone , there is no consensus on the way forward : differences exist between member states , between parties and between european institutions .
this recently prompted european commission president jose manuel barroso to call on the european parliament to demonstrate - above all - unity .
" what we do not need is a beauty pageant of heads of state and government , " he said , " a cacophony of different scenarios and proclamations without an outcome . "
however , statements made by members of the european parliament on the issue have pointed to anything but unity .
belgian politician guy verhofstadt , who leads the liberal faction in the european parliament , attempted to pin down what he believed was the central problem of the monetary union .
" nowhere in the world is there a currency that is not supported by a government , an economic strategy and a bond market , " he said , going on to call for common euro bonds , termed e-bonds , as well as more mutual coordination on european economic and budgetary policy .
however , the government of germany , europe 's largest economy , rejects this idea - and is n't alone on this issue .
two sides to every coin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso called for unity on the euro bonds debate martin schulz , the head of the socialists in the european parliament , bemoans what he calls a crisis of confidence in europe , in which governments only reveal economic truths piecemeal , whether they concern the greek debt crisis or a financial rescue fund .
" it 's a heavy jolt to the trust in governments when the tell the public that all is well and that everything is under control one minute , and then suddenly , overnight , come out and say we need countless billions in aid , " he said .
but while schulz calls for solidarity with debt-laden countries like greece and ireland , conservatives are arguing for the exact opposite .
belgian politician derk jan eppink harkened back to statements by the flemish separatist bart de wever , who names the flemish transfer of public funds to the relatively poor walloons as the chief cause for discontent among the flemish .
eppink believes his divided country can act as a warning to europe : " we have turned a relationship based on partnership -lsb- between walloons and flemish -rsb- into one based on transfer -lsb- from one side to the other -rsb- .
" if europe continues to proceed in the same way , in a few years the eu will find itself in the same position as belgium : a community based on transfers , whose political basis is crumbling . "
but in the debate about how best to stabilize the eurozone , one thing is clear : no matter what course of action is chosen , it will be expensive , for everyone involved .

all german troops should be out of the country by the end of 2014 . foreign minister guido westerwelle has announced that german troops will start withdrawing from afghanistan in a year 's time .
" at the end of 2011 we 'll be able to start reducing our bundeswehr deployment in afghanistan , " westerwelle told the lower house of parliament , the bundestag on thursday .
the minister went further than a progress report on germany 's mission in afghanistan , which said the withdrawal might not begin until the start of 2012 .
westerwelle also told the bundestag that the mission in afghanistan was about defending germany 's security .
" that is why this deployment is the right thing to do .
but it must not go on without end , and that is also the right thing , " he said .
report shows work needs doing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle said the afghan mission could not go on indefinitely the statement was based on the 108-page progress report issued earlier this week in which berlin assessed what had been achieved in the nine years since it first sent soldiers to afghanistan to prevent the taliban from returning to power .
the government is seeking a fresh authorization from parliament in january for the deployment , which has a limit of about 5,000 personnel .
the commitment to start reducing the overall number in late 2011 is aimed at winning over public skepticism in germany about the mission .
as far as the current situation in afghanistan is concerned , westerwelle said there was " light , but there are still too many shadows . "
he said , however , that there was reason to believe that the international community would reach its goals in afghanistan .
according to the progress report , there has to be a longer-term military and civil engagement in afghanistan on the part of international forces .
gernot erler of the opposition social democrats praised the timing of the report .
he said that members of the bundestag " definitely " needed better information in order to make the difficult decision in january .
however , erler criticized the fact that the report did not contain a critical assessment of german activities in afghanistan .
he cited the danger of corruption in the north of the country .
defense minister more vague about timing in comparison to westerwelle , the german defense minister , karl-theodor zu guttenberg , has been reluctant to name a date for the withdrawal of german troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zu guttenberg visited soldiers in afghanistan earlier this week " i 'm not the kind of person who says ' next year we 're going to withdraw soldiers here or there , " ' zu guttenberg told the german news website spiegel online on monday .
" that would be irresponsible . "
zu guttenberg added there were no concrete plans for the withdrawal of the bundeswehr in the north of afghanistan .
by contrast , his cabinet colleague guido westerwelle was more specific on thursday .
he told the bundestag that deployments in the north of afghanistan would be among the first regions to be handed over to afghan command in the first half of 2011 .
nato decided in lisbon last month to end the military mission in afghanistan by the end of 2014 , if the security situation allows for it .
westerwelle confirmed that he expected that there would be no more german troops in afghanistan beyond 2014 .

all german troops should be out of the country by the end of 2014 . foreign minister guido westerwelle has announced that german troops will start withdrawing from afghanistan in a year 's time .
" at the end of 2011 we 'll be able to start reducing our bundeswehr deployment in afghanistan , " westerwelle told the lower house of parliament , the bundestag on thursday .
the minister went further than a progress report on germany 's mission in afghanistan , which said the withdrawal might not begin until the start of 2012 .
westerwelle also told the bundestag that the mission in afghanistan was about defending germany 's security .
" that is why this deployment is the right thing to do .
but it must not go on without end , and that is also the right thing , " he said .
report shows work needs doing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle said the afghan mission could not go on indefinitely the statement was based on the 108-page progress report issued earlier this week in which berlin assessed what had been achieved in the nine years since it first sent soldiers to afghanistan to prevent the taliban from returning to power .
the government is seeking a fresh authorization from parliament in january for the deployment , which has a limit of about 5,000 personnel .
the commitment to start reducing the overall number in late 2011 is aimed at winning over public skepticism in germany about the mission .
as far as the current situation in afghanistan is concerned , westerwelle said there was " light , but there are still too many shadows . "
he said , however , that there was reason to believe that the international community would reach its goals in afghanistan .
according to the progress report , there has to be a longer-term military and civil engagement in afghanistan on the part of international forces .
gernot erler of the opposition social democrats praised the timing of the report .
he said that members of the bundestag " definitely " needed better information in order to make the difficult decision in january .
however , erler criticized the fact that the report did not contain a critical assessment of german activities in afghanistan .
he cited the danger of corruption in the north of the country .
defense minister more vague about timing in comparison to westerwelle , the german defense minister , karl-theodor zu guttenberg , has been reluctant to name a date for the withdrawal of german troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zu guttenberg visited soldiers in afghanistan earlier this week " i 'm not the kind of person who says ' next year we 're going to withdraw soldiers here or there , " ' zu guttenberg told the german news website spiegel online on monday .
" that would be irresponsible . "
zu guttenberg added there were no concrete plans for the withdrawal of the bundeswehr in the north of afghanistan .
by contrast , his cabinet colleague guido westerwelle was more specific on thursday .
he told the bundestag that deployments in the north of afghanistan would be among the first regions to be handed over to afghan command in the first half of 2011 .
nato decided in lisbon last month to end the military mission in afghanistan by the end of 2014 , if the security situation allows for it .
westerwelle confirmed that he expected that there would be no more german troops in afghanistan beyond 2014 .

us president barack obama presented a review of the situation one year since the us launched a new strategy . us president barack obama on thursday said nato troops in afghanistan were making good progress in their fight against taliban insurgents , but cautioned that " gains are still fragile and reversible . "

the revised strategy also stepped up civilian efforts to strengthen the local government in kabul .

it will take time to ultimately defeat al qaeda and it remains a ruthless and resilient enemy bent on attacking our country .

obama also stressed the importance of washington 's close cooperation with pakistan in addressing the growing problem of islamist insurgents seeking refuge in mountains along the afghan-pakistani border .
" nevertheless , progress has not come fast enough , so we will continue to insist to pakistani leaders that terrorist safe havens within their borders must be dealt with .

us president barack obama presented a review of the situation one year since the us launched a new strategy . us president barack obama on thursday said nato troops in afghanistan were making good progress in their fight against taliban insurgents , but cautioned that " gains are still fragile and reversible . "
obama presented a review of the progress made since washington outlined a new strategy one year ago , when obama had ordered 30,000 more troops to afghanistan .
the revised strategy also stepped up civilian efforts to strengthen the local government in kabul .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamid karzai did not always live up to us expectations " it continues to be a very difficult endeavor .
but i can report that , thanks to the extraordinary service of our troops and civilians on the ground , we are on track to achieve our goals . "
currently there are around 90,000 us soldiers stationed in the country as part of the nato contingent , as well as another 23,000 under washington 's immediate command .
al qaeda remains the enemy the main goal of the operation was not to cover the entire country or rebuild it , but to crack down on the al qaeda network hiding in afghanistan , obama said .
in that respect , he added , substantial progress had been made .
" al qaeda is hunkered down .
it will take time to ultimately defeat al qaeda and it remains a ruthless and resilient enemy bent on attacking our country .
but make no mistake we 're going to remain relentless in disrupting and dismantling that terrorist organization . "
the report outlined major gains that had been made in clearing the taliban from the kandahar and helmand provinces while at the same time improving the capability of the afghan army and security forces .
nato forces plan to hand over security responsibility to kabul in 2014 in order to subsequently take on a training and advisory role .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato troops hope to hand over to afghan forces in 2014 close ties to kabul and islamabad the us president called upon the afghan government to implement more transparency and announced a new american-afghan partnership deal in the coming year .
this seems to indicate a move away from the recent harsh criticism of president hamid karzai for his government 's inefficiency in backing nato efforts to defeat the taliban .
obama also stressed the importance of washington 's close cooperation with pakistan in addressing the growing problem of islamist insurgents seeking refuge in mountains along the afghan-pakistani border .
" nevertheless , progress has not come fast enough , so we will continue to insist to pakistani leaders that terrorist safe havens within their borders must be dealt with .
we 'll speed up our investment in civilian institutions and projects that improve the lives of pakistanis , " obama said .
improving relations with islamabad is seen as key in the new strategy deny .
the us congress last year approved a $ 7.5 billion-package -lrb- 5.7 billion euros -rrb- to support aid to the frontline country .

the bank had harbored countless german tax evaders and has now agreed to a record fine . german prosecutors have dropped a lawsuit against a liechtenstein bank over charges of aiding and abetting tax evasion .
the state-owned lgt bank agreed to a settlement with a record 50 million euro -lrb- $ 67 million -rrb- fine .
the case was triggered when german tax authorities bought several cds from informants in liechtenstein , who had copied and stolen data on german tax evaders hiding their money in the small alpine tax haven .
aside from hunting down german tax evaders with the material , prosecutors also began proceedings against the liechtenstein bank itself for being an accessory to tax evasion .
the bank 's consultants were in effect accused of consciously advising and assisting wealthy germans to evade paying taxes .
fine for bank and employees in the settlement with the german prosecutors , the lgt bank has agreed to pay some 46 million euros .
another 3.6 million euros will have to be shouldered by around 45 individual employees of the bank .
the purchase of the leaked data was highly controversial in germany as the material had initially been stolen in liechtenstein and subsequently offered to germany for the price of several million euros .
in a similar case , germany bought a cd containing lists of tax evaders hiding their money in switzerland 's credit suisse bank .
the stolen data has lead to a number of arrests in germany , among them the high profile case of former deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel .

now , scientists in germany have proven that there are also similarities on the level of gene expression . what do a fish and a mouse have in common ?
not much , most people would say .
yet , if you look at them at a certain stage in their embryonic development , you can hardly distinguish the two .
but this is hardly a new idea - the founder of embryology karl ernst von baer observed this in the 19th century .
" it 's a question scientists have tried to explain ever since these similarities were first observed " , said pavel tomancak , a researcher at the max planck institute of molecular cell biology and genetics in dresden , in an interview with deutsche welle .
in a new paper published last week in the journal nature , scientists in germany have proven that embryos from different species do n't just look the same - there are striking parallels between individual development and the development of a species on the level of gene expression , too .
21st century science confirms 19th century hunch german biologist ernst haeckel in 1866 took it a step further by postulating that at some point human embryos look like the embroys of fish species , he noticed , and since fish were seen as an evolutionary more primitive animal form than humans he proposed that they must all have the same ancestral features of some 600 million years ago .
his theory : the development of an organism mirrors the evolutionary development of the species , or as evolutionary biologists put it : " ontogeny recapitulating phylogeny . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : different fruit fly species are strikingly similar also on the level of gene expression the findings were of a mere qualitative nature , of course : the scientists in the 19th century were drawing their conclusions from what they saw .
in the 20th century , this qualitiative method was largely abandoned , most scientists stopped looking at the morphology and tried to find quantitative proof for their theories .
the second half of the 20th century were an important time for molecular science , with remarkable progress being made in the field of gene and dna analysis .
scientists were able to look at embryos before their phylotypic stage , which is the middle of the embryonic development .
the " waist " of the hourglass they noticed that there were differences before and after the phylotypic stage and came up with what came to be known as the " hourglass model . "
species-specific differences predominate before and after the phylotypic stage , so the phylotypic stage represents the " waist " of the hourglass .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advances in molecular science meant darwin 's theory could be checked quantitatively the question as to how this extensive morphological similarity - the " waist of the hourglass " - arises is one that preoccupied pavel tomancak and his colleagues from the max-planck-institute in dresden .
in a process of one and a half years his team collected samples of embryos of six fruit fly species , and measured gene expression across the genome at different times of embroygenesis .
the analysis took another year .
what they found was that there was a very strong pattern .
" we knew we 'd discovered something very early on " , lead scientist pavel tomancak told deutsche welle .
tomancak 's team found that not only in morphology but also in the expression pattern of the genes , the similarities between embryos of different species in one animal phylum are greatest during the phylotypic stage .
before and after this phase , the differences between the species are greater .
" darwin had a point " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naturalists like carl ernst von baer were the forefathers of the " hourglass theory " but the question remained : which model could be applied to prove that they were right ?
the pattern was so strong that it could n't be random , tomancak observed .
" we found that natural selection constrains genes most strongly during the phylotypic stage " , he told deutsche welle .
the results show that the similarity between different animal species in the middle of their embryonic development is shaped by selection .
their discoveries throw new light on an age-old biological conundrum : that of the link between ontogeny and phylogeny .
" our discovery confirms the earlier anatomical studies and broadens our understanding of how development and evolution are linked at molecular level " , said alex t. kalinka , a researcher from the dresden group , in an interview with the journal , nature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at a certain stage , human embryos look just like fish embryos in a different study , researchers at the max-planck-institute for evolutionary biology in ploen demonstrated with zebrafish that the phylogenetically oldest genes are active during the phylotypic stage and that , before and after this stage , the most active genes are those that arose later in evolutionary history .
the scientists also found something else : in adult zebrafish progressively older genes are also activated with the increasing age of the animals .
they found the same to be true in fruit flies and threadworms .
as a follow-up the researchers in dresden are thinking about manipulating genes at the phylotypic stage to see what happens .
while fossils allow scientists to look at what species looked like when they were living on our planet .
" our findings are like a time machine , we can look at what the genome was like 600 million years ago , " tomancak said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 16.12.2010 it outsourcing to eastern europe on the rise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outsourcing is up over 20 percent in eastern europe a new industry report says it outsourcing to eastern europe is up to 3.7 billion euros annually .
that 's a 23 percent rise over last year , as western european tech companies discover the benefits in their backyard . it 's morning at appdec in pristina , kosovo , and betim drenica 's development team is hard at work .
a flock of twenty-somethings sit glued to their computers , coding , as the 24-year-old chief development officer surveys his flock of europe 's newest generation of information technology professionals .
" here , we have different projects , " drenica says .
" we have finance software we are trying to put to market .
this software is very complex and they are , as you can see , developing freely , without any need to help .
but if we see for example , next to this monitor , they are developing very sensitive software for small arms control . "
yes , kosovar interns working on a system to allow the country 's nascent law enforcement authorities to track guns .
it 's a pretty big responsibility for interns , and some even work for free in exchange for training on the latest software development platforms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens and deutsche telekom are amongst two major western european companies currently outsourcing to eastern and central europe outsourcing is booming despite being in one of europe 's most improvised nations , these young people are poised to enter a gold rush happening in central and eastern europe .
it outsourcing in the region has become a huge business - 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- in 2009 , and it 's expected to hit 3.7 billion euros this year , according to a new report from the central and eastern european outsourcing association , an industry trade group .
keen to cut costs , western european companies are increasingly sending tech work eastward .
deutsche bank has some of its software developed in ukraine , while siemens has a research and development center in romania .
those countries also are seeing the largest growth in it outsourcing .
furthermore , with the exception of the baltic states , countries from bulgaria to slovakia defied an economic downturn as the number of the number of it specialists working for outsourcing companies grew to almost 100,000 people , according to the report .
it 's quite a big number and it means it outsourcing and services in central and eastern europe are developing very fast , " says andriy cherevko of softserve , an outsourcing firm that sponsored the study .
kosovo 's unemployment remains high the it industry is still very new here in kosovo , but it offers a glimmer of hope for an otherwise dismal economy , where unemployment exceeds 40 percent .
widespread internet access did n't arrive until after the war with serbia ended in 1999 .
still , kosovo has the youngest population in europe , many of whom are well educated , tech savvy and eager to work .
it helps explains why appdec - the software development firm in pristina - has no shortage of talent .
a junior developer might only make 500 euros per month .
that 's a pittance by western european standards .
however , it 's more than twice the average wage in europe 's newest country .
for adem gashi , a 25-year-old appdec web specialist , his job is n't just about having a decent wage .
it 's also about helping his country without having to leave it in search of work .
" i kind of feel that i 'm chosen to work in it in kosovo , " gashi says .
" i can work in tele-presence , tele-remote working ; i can do outsourcing from here , but i 'm not going to leave my country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : countries like kosovo have an advantage over other outsourcing hotspots like india , as they are physically closer to western europe after all , kosovo is closer than india despite the fact that kosovo , with its high poverty and broken infrastructure , seems a world away from western europe , it 's no more than a few hours from the continent 's major cities like frankfurt , athens or rome .
that makes it a key attraction for companies on the other side of the continent .
that proximity to the rest of europe is n't lost on joan de boer when shuttles back and forth between amsterdam and pristina , where the 49-year-old dutchman heads a web development firm called sprigs .
" wages are quite low here , " de boer says .
" we can compete with india , actually , and still it 's a european country .
it 's quite near - it 's in the same time zone .
and if there 's a problem , you can actually get on a plane at 10 o 'clock on the morning and be at a meeting in amsterdam . "
sprigs ' offices in berlin , amsterdam and paris bring in work from western european clients , but the jobs then go to a team in pristina .
de boer says his developers create better work than their western european counterparts , with an overall discount of about 20 percent .
going forward , the central and eastern european outsourcing association sees continued growth in the region 's it sector .
but with more western european companies catching on , the ceeoa reports that wages for these sought-after developers are rising .
while it 's good for the developers in the short-run , it potentially could make them less competitive with their western counterparts .
" they 're well-educated , they have good universities - ok , they lag now because of the war , " de boer says .
" but if the software developers that we have would work in a company in amsterdam , you would n't tell that they 're from kosovo .
they would just blend in with the rest . "

but there 's another side to the coin .
wages in germany have stagnated , and the crisis is not entirely to blame . while the german economy is experiencing near record growth in the wake of the global economic crisis in sharp contrast to other european countries , there is a darker side to the country 's economic development - wage stagnation .
while in most other industrialized countries wages over the past 10 years have risen by 25 percent on average , wages in germany have fallen .
from 2000 to 2009 , real incomes among german workers fell by 4.5 percent , according to numbers adjusted for inflation and released by the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- on wednesday .
even though wages in other countries over the past few years have increased , the economic crisis has had a drastic slowing effect .
while , workers around the world saw wage increases of 2.8 percent in 2006 and 2007 , that growth slowed to around 1.5 percent in 2008 and 2009 .
according to the ilo , the bill for the global financial crisis has been paid by workers , particularly when considering the number of unemployed .
compared to 2007 , the number of jobless worldwide rose last year by about 30 million to 207 million .
the price of growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany , europe 's ' economic locomotive , ' is going full steam , but wages are n't keeping up none of the world 's leading industrialized countries is better positioned competitively than germany .
europe 's economic locomotive has charged out of financial meltdown , thanks in large part to its more flexible labor market .
one example of the flexibility is state-subsidized " short-time " work , known in german as kurzarbeit .
under this plan , companies do not fire employees during times of crisis , but shorten their hours and pay instead .
therefore employees become less of a load on companies ' accounts but do n't end up in the unemployment line .
their salaries are partially paid by their companies , and then topped off by the federal labor agency .
the plan helped keep germany 's unemployment rate under control during the peak of the financial crisis , and has received praise from the ilo .
through " intelligent labor market instruments " and " positive dialog with social partners , " employment rates remained fairly stable and wages fell only slightly , the organization said .
the short-time work rules were a " good investment " that prevented layoffs and helped support domestic demand .
bildunterschrift : less security but that flexible labor market also saw the number of people with permanent contracts fall in recent years – even before the crisis .
more people are working in so-called mini-jobs and other temporary arrangements .
the wages paid by such jobs are often not enough for workers to live on .
these kinds of developments , together with agreements between unions and employers on small or moderate wage increases have contributed to the phenomenon of wage stagnation in germany over the last decade .
while the development has made german firms more competitive , it has not strengthened consumer demand and wage levels have become decoupled from increases in productivity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions are beginning to ask for wage increases after years of moderating their demands wage gap in other countries , such as south korea , the us and japan , wages are no longer tied to growth in productivity , according to the ilo .
while company and investment profits have grown , worker income has sunk .
the ilo demanded that rises in productivity be accompanied by wage increases and that more should be done to slow the trend toward low-wage work .
but a new dynamic is slowly being seen in wage structures , brought about largely by germany 's economic boom .
unions have begun demanding higher wages .
in the public-service sector , the demand is for a three-percent increase ; the ig bce industrial union is calling for a 6 percent increase for employees in the chemical sector ; and workers at telecommunications giant deutsche telekom want a 6.5 percent raise . the powerful ig metal union says it plans to increase its demands when it enters important wage negotiations in the spring of 2012 .

but there 's another side to the coin .
wages in germany have stagnated , and the crisis is not entirely to blame . while the german economy is experiencing near record growth in the wake of the global economic crisis in sharp contrast to other european countries , there is a darker side to the country 's economic development - wage stagnation .
while in most other industrialized countries wages over the past 10 years have risen by 25 percent on average , wages in germany have fallen .
from 2000 to 2009 , real incomes among german workers fell by 4.5 percent , according to numbers adjusted for inflation and released by the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- on wednesday .
even though wages in other countries over the past few years have increased , the economic crisis has had a drastic slowing effect .
while , workers around the world saw wage increases of 2.8 percent in 2006 and 2007 , that growth slowed to around 1.5 percent in 2008 and 2009 .
according to the ilo , the bill for the global financial crisis has been paid by workers , particularly when considering the number of unemployed .
compared to 2007 , the number of jobless worldwide rose last year by about 30 million to 207 million .
the price of growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany , europe 's ' economic locomotive , ' is going full steam , but wages are n't keeping up none of the world 's leading industrialized countries is better positioned competitively than germany .
europe 's economic locomotive has charged out of financial meltdown , thanks in large part to its more flexible labor market .
one example of the flexibility is state-subsidized " short-time " work , known in german as kurzarbeit .
under this plan , companies do not fire employees during times of crisis , but shorten their hours and pay instead .
therefore employees become less of a load on companies ' accounts but do n't end up in the unemployment line .
their salaries are partially paid by their companies , and then topped off by the federal labor agency .
the plan helped keep germany 's unemployment rate under control during the peak of the financial crisis , and has received praise from the ilo .
through " intelligent labor market instruments " and " positive dialog with social partners , " employment rates remained fairly stable and wages fell only slightly , the organization said .
the short-time work rules were a " good investment " that prevented layoffs and helped support domestic demand .
bildunterschrift : less security but that flexible labor market also saw the number of people with permanent contracts fall in recent years – even before the crisis .
more people are working in so-called mini-jobs and other temporary arrangements .
the wages paid by such jobs are often not enough for workers to live on .
these kinds of developments , together with agreements between unions and employers on small or moderate wage increases have contributed to the phenomenon of wage stagnation in germany over the last decade .
while the development has made german firms more competitive , it has not strengthened consumer demand and wage levels have become decoupled from increases in productivity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions are beginning to ask for wage increases after years of moderating their demands wage gap in other countries , such as south korea , the us and japan , wages are no longer tied to growth in productivity , according to the ilo .
while company and investment profits have grown , worker income has sunk .
the ilo demanded that rises in productivity be accompanied by wage increases and that more should be done to slow the trend toward low-wage work .
but a new dynamic is slowly being seen in wage structures , brought about largely by germany 's economic boom .
unions have begun demanding higher wages .
in the public-service sector , the demand is for a three-percent increase ; the ig bce industrial union is calling for a 6 percent increase for employees in the chemical sector ; and workers at telecommunications giant deutsche telekom want a 6.5 percent raise . the powerful ig metal union says it plans to increase its demands when it enters important wage negotiations in the spring of 2012 .
