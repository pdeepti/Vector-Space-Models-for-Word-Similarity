but they did find corroboration for accusations of physical abuse and misuse of funds . former catholic bishop walter mixa has been cleared of allegations that he sexually abused children , prosecutors said friday .
but their investigation confirmed claims that he beat children while working at a children 's home .
he is also under investigation for improperly using funds meant for the home .
a special investigator , sebastian knott , told news agency dpa that about a dozen former residents of the home gave credible testimony regarding physical abuse by mixa .
mixa served as the parish priest of the southern town of schrobenhausen from 1975 to 1996 , and oversaw the board which administered the children 's home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mixa was head of this children 's home before becoming bishop the residents said that mixa punched children or beat them with sticks or belts , and allegedly beat one girl until she could not stand .
those claims will not be prosecuted because the time limit for pursuing them has passed .
the abuse allegedly took place in the 1970s , when the victims were between six and 15 years old .
" he often said sentences such as : ' satan is in you , i will drive him out of you , " ' said knott , quoting a man who had lived in the home as a child .
another witness said that beatings were sometimes accompanied by mixa shouting " child of god , take this punishment and repent . "
misuse of funds ?
knott said allegations that mixa had misused the home 's money could not be disproven .
" there are a few articles which mr. mixa had purchased , but which never turned up in the home , " knott said .
the total loss would add up to about 30,000 euros .
mixa , 69 , served as the bishop of augsburg until stepping down in april , after admitting that he had given some children " a cuff or two around the ear 20 years ago . "
in his resignation letter , he asked forgiveness from the victims and apologized for his behavior .
according to german media reports , mixa has been living at a clinic in switzerland since resigning. svs / dpa / kna / epd editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

police found glass bottles containing petrol in the house and are treating the attack as arson .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.05.2010 german firms look for asian opportunities großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the asia-pacific conference of german business was held in singapore this week this year , asian economies are expected to grow by 7.5 percent and continue to grow over the next few years .
german businesses are capitalizing on that optimism in the asian market . although the financial crisis and problems with the euro are hanging over the economy in germany , there is a sense of optimism in asia . economies there are expecting several years of growth , and it is hoped this may boost german business , too .
more than 700 companies demonstrated their appetite for a slice of the asian market at this year 's asia-pacific conference for german business .
business opportunities in asia are nothing new - many german companies have been steadily investing in the region for decades .
martin brudermueller is a board member of chemical giant basf responsible for asia pacific .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basf is looking to build on opportunities in asia " it is very important that when operating in asia , most of the products are made on site , " said brudermueller .
" that 's why more than 60 percent of the products we sell here are also locally produced . "
although basf was founded in mannheim , they now have hundreds of production sites around the world , and around 50 of those are in asia .
basf said they are now concentrating on boosting their market share there .
" it should be kept in mind that of the 750-billion-euro -lrb- $ 931.9 billion -rrb- chemical market predicted for 2020 , 500 billion of that is in asia .
therefore , asia is the growth market for basf , " brudermueller said .
growth in troubled times basf is not the only german company to benefit from links to asian economies .
the precious metals and technology company heraeus can thank the region for an encouraging start to 2010 .
" business in america and europe is going backwards , as so many factories have closed down , " said heraeus ceo juergen heraeus .
the heraeus family business , which has its base in frankfurt , has now been in asia for 70 years .
over 40 percent of their production is based in the region .
" when the companies have customers in asia , it makes sense to expand business in asia - and here everything moves very quickly .
in one year here you can start up a factory and begin production , " heraeus added .
piracy problems while it may be quick to set up production in asia , this also means that counterfeiters can adapt and copy european products in no time at all .
technology theft is a big problem , and piracy is becoming an increasingly expensive issue to deal with .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german economic minister rainer bruederle attended the singapore conference michael schadlich , chairman of the german company dorma , says they are always on the lookout for pirated material .
" normally when this happens we shut down production , " he said .
" but we are fooling ourselves . "
" it 's a bit like lawn mowing : you mow the lawn on saturday but then one week later you need to do it all over again , " schadlich said .
attempts to combat piracy , despite costing companies thousands of euros , are considered a worthwhile investment .
piracy aside , german companies know they can do good business in asia .

goals from arjen robben , ivica olic , franck ribery and bastian schweinsteiger allowed the bavarians to claim the second leg of a potential bundesliga , dfb-pokal and champions league treble .
although bayern were not at their free-flowing best , clinical second-half finishing from louis van gaal 's side saw them ease to a comfortable victory .
bremen , returning to berlin to defend the cup they won a year ago , had few answers to their opponents ' dominance , and the dismissal of their captain torsten frings was symptomatic of their frustration in the closing stages .
" the result was clearer than the game actually was .
we went 2-0 -lsb- ahead -rsb- at the perfect time , " bayern defender philipp lahm said after the game .
" we really want to get the treble . "
" i think it was one of the best games that we played this season , " said van gaal .
" i told my players that it was important to win , but also how we won . "
a full-strength bayern team took the initiative from the opening minutes , and never let go of it .
despite coach thomas schaaf 's clear instructions for his bremen players to double up on in-form arjen robben , the winger was at the heart of his side 's best work in the first half .
tim wiese in the bremen goal was called on as early as the third minute , tipping a long-range robben effort over the bar .
the dutchman then found himself on the left , playing in ivica olic , who failed to find the net from not more than five yards .
olic was heavily involved in the opening goal though .
the croatian striker 's flick hit the hand of per mertesacker just inside the penalty and , although the big german defender could have known little about it from such close range , the referee pointed to the spot .
wiese guessed the right way , but robben 's penalty was hit hard and low and found the corner , to give bayern a 35th-minute lead .
the floodgates open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's torsten frings , right , was sent off at the 77th minute mertesacker was unlucky again for the second goal shortly after half-time .
his attempt to head clear deflected into the path of olic , who poked home a classic predator 's finish .
with bremen pushing up to try and get something back , ribery put the game to bed in the 63rd minute .
the frenchman was played through by mark van bommel and finished coolly , before sliding on the wet turf by the corner flag in memorable celebration .
former bayern midfielder frings was shown a second yellow with 15 minutes to go , catching bastian schweinsteiger late as bayern played keep-ball in the closing stages , and barely waiting to see the referee produce the red before he left the pitch .
schweinsteiger relinquished himself from a disciplined midfield role in the final minutes , taking philipp lahm 's lofted ball on the chest and volleying inside the far corner of the net for bayern 's fourth .
" the first half was great , in the second , we scored the goals , " said bayern striker thomas mueller .
" such a result is like a dream . "
closer to the treble the scoreline was harsh on werder bremen , who came into the game on the back of some fine late-season bundesliga form .
they could have taken the lead inside the first ten minutes , joerg butt in the bayern goal making an excellent double-save after claudio pizarro got in .
pizarro was too often isolated up front though , mesut oezil and aaron hunt failing to get the cup holders ' passing game going in very wet conditions in berlin .
" bayern dominated the game and i can only congratulate them , " admitted bremen coach schaaf .
bayern must wish they could play at the olympic stadium every day .
on two consecutive saturdays , captain van bommel has now lifted domestic silverware in the capital .
bayern wrapped up the domestic title with a 3-1 win over hertha berlin last weekend , and , with the dfb-pokal now secured , travel to madrid next weekend knowing that victory over internazionale would see them complete an unprecedented treble .
with seemingly no instructions to take it easy before next week 's game , bayern players celebrated hard after the final whistle .

goals from arjen robben , ivica olic , franck ribery and bastian schweinsteiger allowed the bavarians to claim the second leg of a potential bundesliga , dfb-pokal and champions league treble .
although bayern were not at their free-flowing best , clinical second-half finishing from louis van gaal 's side saw them ease to a comfortable victory .
bremen , returning to berlin to defend the cup they won a year ago , had few answers to their opponents ' dominance , and the dismissal of their captain torsten frings was symptomatic of their frustration in the closing stages .
" the result was clearer than the game actually was .
we went 2-0 -lsb- ahead -rsb- at the perfect time , " bayern defender philipp lahm said after the game .
" we really want to get the treble . "
" i think it was one of the best games that we played this season , " said van gaal .
" i told my players that it was important to win , but also how we won . "
a full-strength bayern team took the initiative from the opening minutes , and never let go of it .
despite coach thomas schaaf 's clear instructions for his bremen players to double up on in-form arjen robben , the winger was at the heart of his side 's best work in the first half .
tim wiese in the bremen goal was called on as early as the third minute , tipping a long-range robben effort over the bar .
the dutchman then found himself on the left , playing in ivica olic , who failed to find the net from not more than five yards .
olic was heavily involved in the opening goal though .
the croatian striker 's flick hit the hand of per mertesacker just inside the penalty and , although the big german defender could have known little about it from such close range , the referee pointed to the spot .
wiese guessed the right way , but robben 's penalty was hit hard and low and found the corner , to give bayern a 35th-minute lead .
the floodgates open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's torsten frings , right , was sent off at the 77th minute mertesacker was unlucky again for the second goal shortly after half-time .
his attempt to head clear deflected into the path of olic , who poked home a classic predator 's finish .
with bremen pushing up to try and get something back , ribery put the game to bed in the 63rd minute .
the frenchman was played through by mark van bommel and finished coolly , before sliding on the wet turf by the corner flag in memorable celebration .
former bayern midfielder frings was shown a second yellow with 15 minutes to go , catching bastian schweinsteiger late as bayern played keep-ball in the closing stages , and barely waiting to see the referee produce the red before he left the pitch .
schweinsteiger relinquished himself from a disciplined midfield role in the final minutes , taking philipp lahm 's lofted ball on the chest and volleying inside the far corner of the net for bayern 's fourth .
" the first half was great , in the second , we scored the goals , " said bayern striker thomas mueller .
" such a result is like a dream . "
closer to the treble the scoreline was harsh on werder bremen , who came into the game on the back of some fine late-season bundesliga form .
they could have taken the lead inside the first ten minutes , joerg butt in the bayern goal making an excellent double-save after claudio pizarro got in .
pizarro was too often isolated up front though , mesut oezil and aaron hunt failing to get the cup holders ' passing game going in very wet conditions in berlin .
" bayern dominated the game and i can only congratulate them , " admitted bremen coach schaaf .
bayern must wish they could play at the olympic stadium every day .
on two consecutive saturdays , captain van bommel has now lifted domestic silverware in the capital .
bayern wrapped up the domestic title with a 3-1 win over hertha berlin last weekend , and , with the dfb-pokal now secured , travel to madrid next weekend knowing that victory over internazionale would see them complete an unprecedented treble .
with seemingly no instructions to take it easy before next week 's game , bayern players celebrated hard after the final whistle .

german businesses are capitalizing on that optimism in the asian market . although the financial crisis and problems with the euro are hanging over the economy in germany , there is a sense of optimism in asia . economies there are expecting several years of growth , and it is hoped this may boost german business , too .
more than 700 companies demonstrated their appetite for a slice of the asian market at this year 's asia-pacific conference for german business .

although basf was founded in mannheim , they now have hundreds of production sites around the world , and around 50 of those are in asia .

in an interview with deutsche welle he spoke about the future of the eu , about integration , expansion and the bloc 's international role . polish prime minister donald tusk is the 2010 recipient of the charlemagne prize , an annual award that recognizes efforts in promoting european understanding .
tusk received the prize in aachen on may 13 , with the charlemagne judges praising him for steering poland away from nationalism and bringing the former soviet-bloc country into the heart of europe .
deutsche welle had a chance to speak with the prime minister about his vision for the future of the european union and the issues surrounding the bloc : integration , expansion of the eurozone , shared defense and its international presence .
deutsche welle : in the words of the judges , you are " a convinced and a convincing european . "
what is your vision of europe for europeans , and also its dealings with the rest of the world ?
donald tusk : for all those who understand the meaning of freedom , the meaning of human rights , the meaning of respect for tradition - for all those who have faith in themselves , in their own potential - europe is , first and foremost , the best model for europeans .
europe is understood as a union , the european union - but it is also a continuing dream and a continuing challenge .
sometimes , especially in the so-called old europe , i hear doubting voices , that europe is not proving itself ; that times of crisis have shown that the european union is not up to the challenges .
and we , the polish people , but also many other europeans , reply that it is precisely at such critical moments that the idea of europe , or the union of free people , who believe in their potential and in fundamental values , becomes the most attractive challenge .
and , as i have been repeating frequently over the last few weeks , the more difficult and painful our experiences , the more the doubting voices arise all around , the more we need to hold high the european flag , affirm the conviction that this is a phenomenal invention : the european family .
we must repeat this all the louder and raise the rallying cry all the higher .
bildunterschrift : the polish leader was praised for steering poland away from nationalism what should the model for the european union be ?
a europe of nation states , or the united states of europe ?
which should we aim for ?
i think that , very often , discussion about the future of europe is a discussion about banal , empty slogans .
a moment of historic reflection and common sense is enough to understand that nations will remain nations ; poles will feel polish .
and germans , german .
the french , french .
and so on .
this is as true about nations as it is about smaller ethnic groups .
we shall remain true to our religions .
we shall remain faithful to our customs , while at the same time being aware that europe needs to be an ever closer union ; it needs to think more effectively about its security , including energy security .
in the global world , a europe divided by conflicting interests and conflicting values does n't stand a chance .
but a europe that can rise above these differences while not negating them has a chance to become one of the key world powers , and that is our shared dream .
you say europe should be more integrated , and you talk about europe as a union of values and not merely a continent .
is further enlargement of the eu the way to steam ahead under the present circumstances ?
and , if so , should all the balkan countries and turkey become members of this united europe ?
the greatness of europe has also been based on the fact that europe has shown magnanimity and patience for those who wanted to participate – not in a mechanical , empty political union , but in a union which respects all these values , a union aware of what the foundations of europe are .
this is why i would direct the question about further enlargement of the european union equally to brussels , to the capitals of the european union , as well as to the candidate countries themselves .
right from the beginning , poland has been in favor of the process of the enlargement of the european union , without putting down any conditions of a political and organizational character .
these have , in any case , been included in the treaties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk and poland are set to take the eu presidency in just over a year nevertheless , we shall always be asking ourselves and other europeans , as well as those who want to join the union , do you share our system of values ?
do you want to participate in this union which takes responsibility for itself , where every person is ready to help another ?
and a union where solidarity or freedom are not mere empty slogans ?
we shall ask these questions also of the turks , ukrainians and all those who apply to become members .
but we have examples closer to home , in the sense of realistic possibilities , such as croatia or serbia .
and it appears that under no circumstances can europe become closed .
even , if for germany or for others , today 's experience of greece may be prompting us to think , let 's be careful with those who do n't live up to the crisis or who have not played by the book .
but is it really the case that the core european countries have always played by the book ?
is it really the case that some can point their finger and say , we are fit to be in -lsb- the union -rsb- , but you are not fit ?
everybody has to do their homework on this crisis , everybody , without any exceptions .
the eurozone is wobbly .
and even , possibly , falling apart at the seams .
although you are not obliged to , you want to help greece .
are you still keen for poland to join the common currency , to adopt the euro , as soon as possible ?
just as is the case for the european union , so it is for the eurozone : it should n't be a club for the countries which have joined , but then each one will do as it likes .
the eurozone can not afford for the grim experience of the recent months to be repeated ever again .
poland wants to become a member of the eurozone as soon as possible by fulfilling the criteria which have been agreed to by all .
today , we point our finger at the greeks or talk about possible problems for other mediterranean countries , but we all remember that even the most stable of the union 's members which also belong to the eurozone also have a case to answer when it comes to fulfilling the criteria and sticking to fiscal discipline .
in just over a year , poland will take over the presidency of the european union .
for six months , your hand will be at the helm of the eu .
what ideas will you be especially keen to ' sell ' to europe ?
what will matter to you the most ?
we live in the european union under the lisbon treaty .
this is not the time nor place to explain all the aspects of the treaty , and i am a sober and common-sense politician and i know well that the presidency is very important , but the european union has its powers that be .
poland has a positive role to play during its presidency , but my common sense prompts me to say that the decisions will not be mine to take .
i will be jointly responsible , and not the one who makes the decisions .
it has been just over a month since the death of president lech kaczynski and 95 outstanding poles .
it was a difficult time for poland , which also brought hope for a polish-russian reconciliation .
what can poland and russia , acting together , offer to europe ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent death of polish president lech kaczynski and many elites shook the country first of all , this greatest of tragedies that the world has seen , when it comes to the death toll of government elites , shook to the core our minds and our hearts .
a genuine sense of mourning was pervasive in poland .
but it did not shake the country .
everybody watched with admiration how poles and the polish nation coped with the turn of events .
and we are really trying to draw positive conclusions for the future from this tragedy .
also political ones .
also regarding improving relations between poland and russia , because they are the key to good relations between europe and russia .
such were my aims also before the catastrophe , but both my aims and the efforts of the russian leaders , which i appreciate , have acquired a sense of urgency precisely due to the catastrophe .
therefore , if this is to be the legacy of those who died in the crash near smolensk , then maybe the most important thing is that this legacy becomes a positive factor in furthering understanding - rather than conflicts - between nations .

the group of experts tasked with drafting the paper must tackle not only a changed security environment , but also different threat perceptions . it is merely 11 years , but in terms of the geopolitical developments that have occurred since nato last adapted its strategic concept , it was a different era .
while the cold war had come to an end with the fall of the berlin wall a decade earlier , it was still largely unclear what global trends and events would shape the next era .
the attacks of september 11 in 2001 brutally ended this interval , launching an era where islamic terrorism , asymetric threats , counterinsurgency warfare and failing states quickly became the new currency in the international debate on global security .
nato has repeatedly discussed what the changed geopolitcal landscape means for the venerable institution .
but it has n't - until now - framed and formalized the allliance 's response to these challenges in a revised doctrine .
to do just that , to develop a new strategic concept , was the task given to former us secretary of state madeleine albright and a group of international experts .
and it is n't just the world that has changed since nato 's last concept introduced in 1999 .
nato has changed itself , explains latvia 's foreign minister aivis ronis , who was part of the expert group until he resigned in early may after accepting the post as his country 's top diplomat .
new members " since many central and eastern european states , including the baltic countries , have joined nato in 2004 and of course have not participated in drafting the strategic concept of 1999 , for the first time in these open seminars and conferences central and eastern europeans could contribute to the common vision of nato and the transatlantic community regarding security , threats and challenges and global changes , " says ronis .
" this is an historic experience for the central and eastern european countries and especially for the baltic states . "
due to their recent history with and proximity to russia , many of these newer countries have a different view of nato 's main priorities than some of the alliance 's older and larger members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's new members bring new perspectives to the alliance " the strategy will have to cope with fears which exist in eastern europe primarily with regard to russia , i.e. article 5 -lrb- collective defense - ed . -rrb- , " says fred tanner , director of the geneva center for security policy , who served as a rapporteur on one of the seminars held by the group of experts .
" on the other hand of course you have other countries like france or the uk who have more of an interest to use nato together with the us outside of nato . "
the experts agree that , as latvia 's foreign minister puts it , there needs to be a synergy of territorial defense and the promotion of stability security outside of nato 's traditional realm of influence .
new and old threats but , karl kaiser , director of the program on transatlantic relations at the weatherhead center for international affairs at harvard university , argues that collective defense as laid out in article 5 of the nato treaty ca n't be the alliance 's raison d 'etre . " article 5 should not dissappear , " says kaiser who testified before the group of experts last year .
" of course if a country gets attacked , the others have to come to its assistance , but that is not the main reason for the alliance today .
the main reason is elsewhere .
so we have to reconcile the two , we have to have both , but we should n't put article 5 at the top anymore and do , as some of these countries want , exercizes looking at the potential of russian aggression . "
the underlying dilemma for nato and the group of experts is the lack of a common threat perception within the new , larger alliance .
and this threat assessment gap does n't just exist between newer and older members , it is also evident between european members and the us .
while the us wants nato to focus much more on counter-terrorism efforts outside nato territory , many european members are deeply skeptical about such a global military role as exemplified by the debate over the afghanistan mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group of experts visited moscow to engage russia as well flexibility needed for nato and the group of experts , this means the new concept must try and square the circle .
" the strategy will have to be flexible , " says tanner .
it will have to take into account different threat perceptions and various contingencies , both inside nato 's traditional transatlantic realm of influence and beyond .
to do just that , to ensure that nato can act in classical military fashion against an outside aggressor and at the same time can engage in counter-terrorism activities and state-building measures in asia or africa could be easier on paper than in practice .
especially in times of tight budgets and with nato members like greece on the brink of financial collapse .
despite these steep challenges , nato is indispensable , argue the experts .
" nato is needed for the security of our people , defending our democracy and promoting peace and stability in this very unpredictable , very uncertain and very complex world , " says ronis .
" nato 's big advantage today is that it has the ability to act in a robust environment , " argues tanner .
" it can use force if necessary .
and it is actually the only organization which has this capability with a certain projection of power . "
to harness that unique power , a convincing new strategy laid out by the panel of experts would be a good start , says kaiser : " it should n't be too long , it should n't be some bland lowest common denominator , but be sharp in defining the threats to modern society and what modern societies have to do in order to deal with these new threats .

in an interview with deutsche welle he spoke about the future of the eu , about integration , expansion and the bloc 's international role . polish prime minister donald tusk is the 2010 recipient of the charlemagne prize , an annual award that recognizes efforts in promoting european understanding .
tusk received the prize in aachen on may 13 , with the charlemagne judges praising him for steering poland away from nationalism and bringing the former soviet-bloc country into the heart of europe .
deutsche welle had a chance to speak with the prime minister about his vision for the future of the european union and the issues surrounding the bloc : integration , expansion of the eurozone , shared defense and its international presence .
deutsche welle : in the words of the judges , you are " a convinced and a convincing european . "
what is your vision of europe for europeans , and also its dealings with the rest of the world ?
donald tusk : for all those who understand the meaning of freedom , the meaning of human rights , the meaning of respect for tradition - for all those who have faith in themselves , in their own potential - europe is , first and foremost , the best model for europeans .
europe is understood as a union , the european union - but it is also a continuing dream and a continuing challenge .
sometimes , especially in the so-called old europe , i hear doubting voices , that europe is not proving itself ; that times of crisis have shown that the european union is not up to the challenges .
and we , the polish people , but also many other europeans , reply that it is precisely at such critical moments that the idea of europe , or the union of free people , who believe in their potential and in fundamental values , becomes the most attractive challenge .
and , as i have been repeating frequently over the last few weeks , the more difficult and painful our experiences , the more the doubting voices arise all around , the more we need to hold high the european flag , affirm the conviction that this is a phenomenal invention : the european family .
we must repeat this all the louder and raise the rallying cry all the higher .
bildunterschrift : the polish leader was praised for steering poland away from nationalism what should the model for the european union be ?
a europe of nation states , or the united states of europe ?
which should we aim for ?
i think that , very often , discussion about the future of europe is a discussion about banal , empty slogans .
a moment of historic reflection and common sense is enough to understand that nations will remain nations ; poles will feel polish .
and germans , german .
the french , french .
and so on .
this is as true about nations as it is about smaller ethnic groups .
we shall remain true to our religions .
we shall remain faithful to our customs , while at the same time being aware that europe needs to be an ever closer union ; it needs to think more effectively about its security , including energy security .
in the global world , a europe divided by conflicting interests and conflicting values does n't stand a chance .
but a europe that can rise above these differences while not negating them has a chance to become one of the key world powers , and that is our shared dream .
you say europe should be more integrated , and you talk about europe as a union of values and not merely a continent .
is further enlargement of the eu the way to steam ahead under the present circumstances ?
and , if so , should all the balkan countries and turkey become members of this united europe ?
the greatness of europe has also been based on the fact that europe has shown magnanimity and patience for those who wanted to participate – not in a mechanical , empty political union , but in a union which respects all these values , a union aware of what the foundations of europe are .
this is why i would direct the question about further enlargement of the european union equally to brussels , to the capitals of the european union , as well as to the candidate countries themselves .
right from the beginning , poland has been in favor of the process of the enlargement of the european union , without putting down any conditions of a political and organizational character .
these have , in any case , been included in the treaties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk and poland are set to take the eu presidency in just over a year nevertheless , we shall always be asking ourselves and other europeans , as well as those who want to join the union , do you share our system of values ?
do you want to participate in this union which takes responsibility for itself , where every person is ready to help another ?
and a union where solidarity or freedom are not mere empty slogans ?
we shall ask these questions also of the turks , ukrainians and all those who apply to become members .
but we have examples closer to home , in the sense of realistic possibilities , such as croatia or serbia .
and it appears that under no circumstances can europe become closed .
even , if for germany or for others , today 's experience of greece may be prompting us to think , let 's be careful with those who do n't live up to the crisis or who have not played by the book .
but is it really the case that the core european countries have always played by the book ?
is it really the case that some can point their finger and say , we are fit to be in -lsb- the union -rsb- , but you are not fit ?
everybody has to do their homework on this crisis , everybody , without any exceptions .
the eurozone is wobbly .
and even , possibly , falling apart at the seams .
although you are not obliged to , you want to help greece .
are you still keen for poland to join the common currency , to adopt the euro , as soon as possible ?
just as is the case for the european union , so it is for the eurozone : it should n't be a club for the countries which have joined , but then each one will do as it likes .
the eurozone can not afford for the grim experience of the recent months to be repeated ever again .
poland wants to become a member of the eurozone as soon as possible by fulfilling the criteria which have been agreed to by all .
today , we point our finger at the greeks or talk about possible problems for other mediterranean countries , but we all remember that even the most stable of the union 's members which also belong to the eurozone also have a case to answer when it comes to fulfilling the criteria and sticking to fiscal discipline .
in just over a year , poland will take over the presidency of the european union .
for six months , your hand will be at the helm of the eu .
what ideas will you be especially keen to ' sell ' to europe ?
what will matter to you the most ?
we live in the european union under the lisbon treaty .
this is not the time nor place to explain all the aspects of the treaty , and i am a sober and common-sense politician and i know well that the presidency is very important , but the european union has its powers that be .
poland has a positive role to play during its presidency , but my common sense prompts me to say that the decisions will not be mine to take .
i will be jointly responsible , and not the one who makes the decisions .
it has been just over a month since the death of president lech kaczynski and 95 outstanding poles .
it was a difficult time for poland , which also brought hope for a polish-russian reconciliation .
what can poland and russia , acting together , offer to europe ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent death of polish president lech kaczynski and many elites shook the country first of all , this greatest of tragedies that the world has seen , when it comes to the death toll of government elites , shook to the core our minds and our hearts .
a genuine sense of mourning was pervasive in poland .
but it did not shake the country .
everybody watched with admiration how poles and the polish nation coped with the turn of events .
and we are really trying to draw positive conclusions for the future from this tragedy .
also political ones .
also regarding improving relations between poland and russia , because they are the key to good relations between europe and russia .
such were my aims also before the catastrophe , but both my aims and the efforts of the russian leaders , which i appreciate , have acquired a sense of urgency precisely due to the catastrophe .
therefore , if this is to be the legacy of those who died in the crash near smolensk , then maybe the most important thing is that this legacy becomes a positive factor in furthering understanding - rather than conflicts - between nations .

the group of experts tasked with drafting the paper must tackle not only a changed security environment , but also different threat perceptions . it is merely 11 years , but in terms of the geopolitical developments that have occurred since nato last adapted its strategic concept , it was a different era .
while the cold war had come to an end with the fall of the berlin wall a decade earlier , it was still largely unclear what global trends and events would shape the next era .
the attacks of september 11 in 2001 brutally ended this interval , launching an era where islamic terrorism , asymetric threats , counterinsurgency warfare and failing states quickly became the new currency in the international debate on global security .
nato has repeatedly discussed what the changed geopolitcal landscape means for the venerable institution .
but it has n't - until now - framed and formalized the allliance 's response to these challenges in a revised doctrine .
to do just that , to develop a new strategic concept , was the task given to former us secretary of state madeleine albright and a group of international experts .
and it is n't just the world that has changed since nato 's last concept introduced in 1999 .
nato has changed itself , explains latvia 's foreign minister aivis ronis , who was part of the expert group until he resigned in early may after accepting the post as his country 's top diplomat .
new members " since many central and eastern european states , including the baltic countries , have joined nato in 2004 and of course have not participated in drafting the strategic concept of 1999 , for the first time in these open seminars and conferences central and eastern europeans could contribute to the common vision of nato and the transatlantic community regarding security , threats and challenges and global changes , " says ronis .
" this is an historic experience for the central and eastern european countries and especially for the baltic states . "
due to their recent history with and proximity to russia , many of these newer countries have a different view of nato 's main priorities than some of the alliance 's older and larger members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's new members bring new perspectives to the alliance " the strategy will have to cope with fears which exist in eastern europe primarily with regard to russia , i.e. article 5 -lrb- collective defense - ed . -rrb- , " says fred tanner , director of the geneva center for security policy , who served as a rapporteur on one of the seminars held by the group of experts .
" on the other hand of course you have other countries like france or the uk who have more of an interest to use nato together with the us outside of nato . "
the experts agree that , as latvia 's foreign minister puts it , there needs to be a synergy of territorial defense and the promotion of stability security outside of nato 's traditional realm of influence .
new and old threats but , karl kaiser , director of the program on transatlantic relations at the weatherhead center for international affairs at harvard university , argues that collective defense as laid out in article 5 of the nato treaty ca n't be the alliance 's raison d 'etre . " article 5 should not dissappear , " says kaiser who testified before the group of experts last year .
" of course if a country gets attacked , the others have to come to its assistance , but that is not the main reason for the alliance today .
the main reason is elsewhere .
so we have to reconcile the two , we have to have both , but we should n't put article 5 at the top anymore and do , as some of these countries want , exercizes looking at the potential of russian aggression . "
the underlying dilemma for nato and the group of experts is the lack of a common threat perception within the new , larger alliance .
and this threat assessment gap does n't just exist between newer and older members , it is also evident between european members and the us .
while the us wants nato to focus much more on counter-terrorism efforts outside nato territory , many european members are deeply skeptical about such a global military role as exemplified by the debate over the afghanistan mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group of experts visited moscow to engage russia as well flexibility needed for nato and the group of experts , this means the new concept must try and square the circle .
" the strategy will have to be flexible , " says tanner .
it will have to take into account different threat perceptions and various contingencies , both inside nato 's traditional transatlantic realm of influence and beyond .
to do just that , to ensure that nato can act in classical military fashion against an outside aggressor and at the same time can engage in counter-terrorism activities and state-building measures in asia or africa could be easier on paper than in practice .
especially in times of tight budgets and with nato members like greece on the brink of financial collapse .
despite these steep challenges , nato is indispensable , argue the experts .
" nato is needed for the security of our people , defending our democracy and promoting peace and stability in this very unpredictable , very uncertain and very complex world , " says ronis .
" nato 's big advantage today is that it has the ability to act in a robust environment , " argues tanner .
" it can use force if necessary .
and it is actually the only organization which has this capability with a certain projection of power . "
to harness that unique power , a convincing new strategy laid out by the panel of experts would be a good start , says kaiser : " it should n't be too long , it should n't be some bland lowest common denominator , but be sharp in defining the threats to modern society and what modern societies have to do in order to deal with these new threats .

the group of experts tasked with drafting the paper must tackle not only a changed security environment , but also different threat perceptions . it is merely 11 years , but in terms of the geopolitical developments that have occurred since nato last adapted its strategic concept , it was a different era .
while the cold war had come to an end with the fall of the berlin wall a decade earlier , it was still largely unclear what global trends and events would shape the next era .
the attacks of september 11 in 2001 brutally ended this interval , launching an era where islamic terrorism , asymetric threats , counterinsurgency warfare and failing states quickly became the new currency in the international debate on global security .
nato has repeatedly discussed what the changed geopolitcal landscape means for the venerable institution .
but it has n't - until now - framed and formalized the allliance 's response to these challenges in a revised doctrine .
to do just that , to develop a new strategic concept , was the task given to former us secretary of state madeleine albright and a group of international experts .
and it is n't just the world that has changed since nato 's last concept introduced in 1999 .
nato has changed itself , explains latvia 's foreign minister aivis ronis , who was part of the expert group until he resigned in early may after accepting the post as his country 's top diplomat .
new members " since many central and eastern european states , including the baltic countries , have joined nato in 2004 and of course have not participated in drafting the strategic concept of 1999 , for the first time in these open seminars and conferences central and eastern europeans could contribute to the common vision of nato and the transatlantic community regarding security , threats and challenges and global changes , " says ronis .
" this is an historic experience for the central and eastern european countries and especially for the baltic states . "
due to their recent history with and proximity to russia , many of these newer countries have a different view of nato 's main priorities than some of the alliance 's older and larger members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's new members bring new perspectives to the alliance " the strategy will have to cope with fears which exist in eastern europe primarily with regard to russia , i.e. article 5 -lrb- collective defense - ed . -rrb- , " says fred tanner , director of the geneva center for security policy , who served as a rapporteur on one of the seminars held by the group of experts .
" on the other hand of course you have other countries like france or the uk who have more of an interest to use nato together with the us outside of nato . "
the experts agree that , as latvia 's foreign minister puts it , there needs to be a synergy of territorial defense and the promotion of stability security outside of nato 's traditional realm of influence .
new and old threats but , karl kaiser , director of the program on transatlantic relations at the weatherhead center for international affairs at harvard university , argues that collective defense as laid out in article 5 of the nato treaty ca n't be the alliance 's raison d 'etre . " article 5 should not dissappear , " says kaiser who testified before the group of experts last year .
" of course if a country gets attacked , the others have to come to its assistance , but that is not the main reason for the alliance today .
the main reason is elsewhere .
so we have to reconcile the two , we have to have both , but we should n't put article 5 at the top anymore and do , as some of these countries want , exercizes looking at the potential of russian aggression . "
the underlying dilemma for nato and the group of experts is the lack of a common threat perception within the new , larger alliance .
and this threat assessment gap does n't just exist between newer and older members , it is also evident between european members and the us .
while the us wants nato to focus much more on counter-terrorism efforts outside nato territory , many european members are deeply skeptical about such a global military role as exemplified by the debate over the afghanistan mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group of experts visited moscow to engage russia as well flexibility needed for nato and the group of experts , this means the new concept must try and square the circle .
" the strategy will have to be flexible , " says tanner .
it will have to take into account different threat perceptions and various contingencies , both inside nato 's traditional transatlantic realm of influence and beyond .
to do just that , to ensure that nato can act in classical military fashion against an outside aggressor and at the same time can engage in counter-terrorism activities and state-building measures in asia or africa could be easier on paper than in practice .
especially in times of tight budgets and with nato members like greece on the brink of financial collapse .
despite these steep challenges , nato is indispensable , argue the experts .
" nato is needed for the security of our people , defending our democracy and promoting peace and stability in this very unpredictable , very uncertain and very complex world , " says ronis .
" nato 's big advantage today is that it has the ability to act in a robust environment , " argues tanner .
" it can use force if necessary .
and it is actually the only organization which has this capability with a certain projection of power . "
to harness that unique power , a convincing new strategy laid out by the panel of experts would be a good start , says kaiser : " it should n't be too long , it should n't be some bland lowest common denominator , but be sharp in defining the threats to modern society and what modern societies have to do in order to deal with these new threats .

due to their recent history with and proximity to russia , many of these newer countries have a different view of nato 's main priorities than some of the alliance 's older and larger members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's new members bring new perspectives to the alliance " the strategy will have to cope with fears which exist in eastern europe primarily with regard to russia , i.e. article 5 -lrb- collective defense - ed . -rrb- , " says fred tanner , director of the geneva center for security policy , who served as a rapporteur on one of the seminars held by the group of experts .
" on the other hand of course you have other countries like france or the uk who have more of an interest to use nato together with the us outside of nato . "
the experts agree that , as latvia 's foreign minister puts it , there needs to be a synergy of territorial defense and the promotion of stability security outside of nato 's traditional realm of influence .
new and old threats but , karl kaiser , director of the program on transatlantic relations at the weatherhead center for international affairs at harvard university , argues that collective defense as laid out in article 5 of the nato treaty ca n't be the alliance 's raison d 'etre . " article 5 should not dissappear , " says kaiser who testified before the group of experts last year .
" of course if a country gets attacked , the others have to come to its assistance , but that is not the main reason for the alliance today .
the main reason is elsewhere .
so we have to reconcile the two , we have to have both , but we should n't put article 5 at the top anymore and do , as some of these countries want , exercizes looking at the potential of russian aggression . "
the underlying dilemma for nato and the group of experts is the lack of a common threat perception within the new , larger alliance .
and this threat assessment gap does n't just exist between newer and older members , it is also evident between european members and the us .
while the us wants nato to focus much more on counter-terrorism efforts outside nato territory , many european members are deeply skeptical about such a global military role as exemplified by the debate over the afghanistan mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group of experts visited moscow to engage russia as well flexibility needed for nato and the group of experts , this means the new concept must try and square the circle .
" the strategy will have to be flexible , " says tanner .
it will have to take into account different threat perceptions and various contingencies , both inside nato 's traditional transatlantic realm of influence and beyond .
to do just that , to ensure that nato can act in classical military fashion against an outside aggressor and at the same time can engage in counter-terrorism activities and state-building measures in asia or africa could be easier on paper than in practice .
especially in times of tight budgets and with nato members like greece on the brink of financial collapse .
despite these steep challenges , nato is indispensable , argue the experts .
" nato is needed for the security of our people , defending our democracy and promoting peace and stability in this very unpredictable , very uncertain and very complex world , " says ronis .
" nato 's big advantage today is that it has the ability to act in a robust environment , " argues tanner .
" it can use force if necessary .
and it is actually the only organization which has this capability with a certain projection of power . "
to harness that unique power , a convincing new strategy laid out by the panel of experts would be a good start , says kaiser : " it should n't be too long , it should n't be some bland lowest common denominator , but be sharp in defining the threats to modern society and what modern societies have to do in order to deal with these new threats .

the group of experts tasked with drafting the paper must tackle not only a changed security environment , but also different threat perceptions . it is merely 11 years , but in terms of the geopolitical developments that have occurred since nato last adapted its strategic concept , it was a different era .
while the cold war had come to an end with the fall of the berlin wall a decade earlier , it was still largely unclear what global trends and events would shape the next era .
the attacks of september 11 in 2001 brutally ended this interval , launching an era where islamic terrorism , asymetric threats , counterinsurgency warfare and failing states quickly became the new currency in the international debate on global security .
nato has repeatedly discussed what the changed geopolitcal landscape means for the venerable institution .
but it has n't - until now - framed and formalized the allliance 's response to these challenges in a revised doctrine .
to do just that , to develop a new strategic concept , was the task given to former us secretary of state madeleine albright and a group of international experts .
and it is n't just the world that has changed since nato 's last concept introduced in 1999 .
nato has changed itself , explains latvia 's foreign minister aivis ronis , who was part of the expert group until he resigned in early may after accepting the post as his country 's top diplomat .
new members " since many central and eastern european states , including the baltic countries , have joined nato in 2004 and of course have not participated in drafting the strategic concept of 1999 , for the first time in these open seminars and conferences central and eastern europeans could contribute to the common vision of nato and the transatlantic community regarding security , threats and challenges and global changes , " says ronis .

the group of experts tasked with drafting the paper must tackle not only a changed security environment , but also different threat perceptions . it is merely 11 years , but in terms of the geopolitical developments that have occurred since nato last adapted its strategic concept , it was a different era .
while the cold war had come to an end with the fall of the berlin wall a decade earlier , it was still largely unclear what global trends and events would shape the next era .
the attacks of september 11 in 2001 brutally ended this interval , launching an era where islamic terrorism , asymetric threats , counterinsurgency warfare and failing states quickly became the new currency in the international debate on global security .
nato has repeatedly discussed what the changed geopolitcal landscape means for the venerable institution .
but it has n't - until now - framed and formalized the allliance 's response to these challenges in a revised doctrine .
to do just that , to develop a new strategic concept , was the task given to former us secretary of state madeleine albright and a group of international experts .
and it is n't just the world that has changed since nato 's last concept introduced in 1999 .
nato has changed itself , explains latvia 's foreign minister aivis ronis , who was part of the expert group until he resigned in early may after accepting the post as his country 's top diplomat .
new members " since many central and eastern european states , including the baltic countries , have joined nato in 2004 and of course have not participated in drafting the strategic concept of 1999 , for the first time in these open seminars and conferences central and eastern europeans could contribute to the common vision of nato and the transatlantic community regarding security , threats and challenges and global changes , " says ronis .
" this is an historic experience for the central and eastern european countries and especially for the baltic states . "
due to their recent history with and proximity to russia , many of these newer countries have a different view of nato 's main priorities than some of the alliance 's older and larger members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's new members bring new perspectives to the alliance " the strategy will have to cope with fears which exist in eastern europe primarily with regard to russia , i.e. article 5 -lrb- collective defense - ed . -rrb- , " says fred tanner , director of the geneva center for security policy , who served as a rapporteur on one of the seminars held by the group of experts .
" on the other hand of course you have other countries like france or the uk who have more of an interest to use nato together with the us outside of nato . "
the experts agree that , as latvia 's foreign minister puts it , there needs to be a synergy of territorial defense and the promotion of stability security outside of nato 's traditional realm of influence .
new and old threats but , karl kaiser , director of the program on transatlantic relations at the weatherhead center for international affairs at harvard university , argues that collective defense as laid out in article 5 of the nato treaty ca n't be the alliance 's raison d 'etre . " article 5 should not dissappear , " says kaiser who testified before the group of experts last year .
" of course if a country gets attacked , the others have to come to its assistance , but that is not the main reason for the alliance today .
the main reason is elsewhere .
so we have to reconcile the two , we have to have both , but we should n't put article 5 at the top anymore and do , as some of these countries want , exercizes looking at the potential of russian aggression . "
the underlying dilemma for nato and the group of experts is the lack of a common threat perception within the new , larger alliance .
and this threat assessment gap does n't just exist between newer and older members , it is also evident between european members and the us .
while the us wants nato to focus much more on counter-terrorism efforts outside nato territory , many european members are deeply skeptical about such a global military role as exemplified by the debate over the afghanistan mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group of experts visited moscow to engage russia as well flexibility needed for nato and the group of experts , this means the new concept must try and square the circle .
" the strategy will have to be flexible , " says tanner .
it will have to take into account different threat perceptions and various contingencies , both inside nato 's traditional transatlantic realm of influence and beyond .
to do just that , to ensure that nato can act in classical military fashion against an outside aggressor and at the same time can engage in counter-terrorism activities and state-building measures in asia or africa could be easier on paper than in practice .
especially in times of tight budgets and with nato members like greece on the brink of financial collapse .
despite these steep challenges , nato is indispensable , argue the experts .
" nato is needed for the security of our people , defending our democracy and promoting peace and stability in this very unpredictable , very uncertain and very complex world , " says ronis .
" nato 's big advantage today is that it has the ability to act in a robust environment , " argues tanner .
" it can use force if necessary .
and it is actually the only organization which has this capability with a certain projection of power . "
to harness that unique power , a convincing new strategy laid out by the panel of experts would be a good start , says kaiser : " it should n't be too long , it should n't be some bland lowest common denominator , but be sharp in defining the threats to modern society and what modern societies have to do in order to deal with these new threats .

new and old threats but , karl kaiser , director of the program on transatlantic relations at the weatherhead center for international affairs at harvard university , argues that collective defense as laid out in article 5 of the nato treaty ca n't be the alliance 's raison d 'etre . " article 5 should not dissappear , " says kaiser who testified before the group of experts last year .
" of course if a country gets attacked , the others have to come to its assistance , but that is not the main reason for the alliance today .
the main reason is elsewhere .
so we have to reconcile the two , we have to have both , but we should n't put article 5 at the top anymore and do , as some of these countries want , exercizes looking at the potential of russian aggression . "
the underlying dilemma for nato and the group of experts is the lack of a common threat perception within the new , larger alliance .
and this threat assessment gap does n't just exist between newer and older members , it is also evident between european members and the us .
while the us wants nato to focus much more on counter-terrorism efforts outside nato territory , many european members are deeply skeptical about such a global military role as exemplified by the debate over the afghanistan mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group of experts visited moscow to engage russia as well flexibility needed for nato and the group of experts , this means the new concept must try and square the circle .
" the strategy will have to be flexible , " says tanner .
it will have to take into account different threat perceptions and various contingencies , both inside nato 's traditional transatlantic realm of influence and beyond .
to do just that , to ensure that nato can act in classical military fashion against an outside aggressor and at the same time can engage in counter-terrorism activities and state-building measures in asia or africa could be easier on paper than in practice .
especially in times of tight budgets and with nato members like greece on the brink of financial collapse .
despite these steep challenges , nato is indispensable , argue the experts .
" nato is needed for the security of our people , defending our democracy and promoting peace and stability in this very unpredictable , very uncertain and very complex world , " says ronis .
" nato 's big advantage today is that it has the ability to act in a robust environment , " argues tanner .
" it can use force if necessary .
and it is actually the only organization which has this capability with a certain projection of power . "
to harness that unique power , a convincing new strategy laid out by the panel of experts would be a good start , says kaiser : " it should n't be too long , it should n't be some bland lowest common denominator , but be sharp in defining the threats to modern society and what modern societies have to do in order to deal with these new threats .

the group of experts tasked with drafting the paper must tackle not only a changed security environment , but also different threat perceptions . it is merely 11 years , but in terms of the geopolitical developments that have occurred since nato last adapted its strategic concept , it was a different era .
while the cold war had come to an end with the fall of the berlin wall a decade earlier , it was still largely unclear what global trends and events would shape the next era .
the attacks of september 11 in 2001 brutally ended this interval , launching an era where islamic terrorism , asymetric threats , counterinsurgency warfare and failing states quickly became the new currency in the international debate on global security .
nato has repeatedly discussed what the changed geopolitcal landscape means for the venerable institution .
but it has n't - until now - framed and formalized the allliance 's response to these challenges in a revised doctrine .
to do just that , to develop a new strategic concept , was the task given to former us secretary of state madeleine albright and a group of international experts .
and it is n't just the world that has changed since nato 's last concept introduced in 1999 .
nato has changed itself , explains latvia 's foreign minister aivis ronis , who was part of the expert group until he resigned in early may after accepting the post as his country 's top diplomat .
new members " since many central and eastern european states , including the baltic countries , have joined nato in 2004 and of course have not participated in drafting the strategic concept of 1999 , for the first time in these open seminars and conferences central and eastern europeans could contribute to the common vision of nato and the transatlantic community regarding security , threats and challenges and global changes , " says ronis .
" this is an historic experience for the central and eastern european countries and especially for the baltic states . "
due to their recent history with and proximity to russia , many of these newer countries have a different view of nato 's main priorities than some of the alliance 's older and larger members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's new members bring new perspectives to the alliance " the strategy will have to cope with fears which exist in eastern europe primarily with regard to russia , i.e. article 5 -lrb- collective defense - ed . -rrb- , " says fred tanner , director of the geneva center for security policy , who served as a rapporteur on one of the seminars held by the group of experts .

despite the tough times , eu leaders are staying the course . at times in recent weeks it 's felt a bit like a contest : what new low will the euro sink to next ?
on friday , the common currency shared by 16 of the european union members sank to its lowest level in 18 months , briefly trading at $ 1.2358 .
as recently as last summer , the euro was pushing $ 1.50 .
the causes of the drastic decline in the euro 's value are not difficult to discern .
budget deficit problems across europe - most notably in greece - and massive bailout packages designed to prop up ailing economies have caused financial markets to lose faith in the euro , causing some speculation that the existence of the euro itself was being threatened .
european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- president jean-claude trichet is n't sugarcoating the issue .
in an interview with the german magazine der spiegel , he said europe is in the most difficult situation since world war ii , possibly even since world war i.
' quantum leap ' in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet knows the euro has seen better days , but is confident things can be fixed despite the dire straits , however , trichet sees a way out of the crisis .
" what we need is a quantum leap in mutual surveillance of economic policies in europe , " trichet told spiegel .
" we need improved mechanisms to prevent and punish misconduct . "
part of the problem in the eurozone comes from countries ignoring the european stability and growth pact , which sets a budget deficit limit of three percent of a country 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
most eu countries have exceeded this limit , and greece is four times over the mark .
trichet called for " effective sanctions for breaches of the stability and growth pact . "
defending the euro in germany , chancellor angela merkel echoed some of trichet 's sentiments in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper and defended her own decisions to support a financial rescue package for greece .
" when the stability of the euro is threatened , we ca n't evade our responsibility , " merkel told the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" with our guarantee package from the entire eurozone for greece , we 're ensuring that the common currency remains stable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and trichet agree : eu nations need to do a better job of balancing the books she added that europe , as a whole , needed to get its public budgets in order and reduce debts in the years ahead .
merkel 's decision to back aid for greece was not popular with many germans , while the opposition in parliament criticized that her initial reluctance to send money to athens only exacerbated the situation in greece and made the financial bailout more expensive than it needed to be .
however , merkel maintained she just wanted to make sure all legal and economic bases had been covered , and reiterated her stance that sending help to greece was only done in the wider interest of the euro .
" we all know , if the euro fails , more failures will follow , " she said , adding that the only way to ensure the stability of the euro in the future was a convergence of financial policies in europe. mz / reuters / apn / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" according to the information available to us so far , google has for years penetrated private networks , apparently illegally , " aigner said in a statement on saturday .
the " alarming incident " showed that google still lacks understanding for the need for privacy , according to the statement .
privacy breach google 's fleet of street view cars , photographing streets for its online map program , has been collecting more data than previously thought .
after reviewing a system in the cars that recorded names and addresses of wireless networks detected along the routes , google revealed that a programming error had led to small amounts of personal data to be collected from unsecured wi-fi networks .
" it 's now clear that we have been mistakenly collecting samples of payload data from open wi-fi networks , " google 's head of engineering alan eustace said in a blog posting .
the blog post did not specify what kinds of personal data had been collected but indicated it could be things such as email and web browsing history .
however , since the data had been collected by moving vehicles , only fragments of information were recorded .
google regretted its mistake and would look for a way to destroy the personal data .
" maintaining people 's trust is crucial to everything we do , and in this case we fell short , " said eustace in the blog post .
google reviewed its data collection methods in response to an inquiry from the data protection authority in hamburg .
the google street view service allows users to " walk " along panoramic street views in many countries , using images recorded by specially-outfitted cars .
the fleet of cars around the world has been halted for the time being as google attempts to fix the glitch .

" it 's now clear that we have been mistakenly collecting samples of payload data from open wi-fi networks , " google 's head of engineering alan eustace said in a blog posting .
the blog post did not specify what kinds of personal data had been collected but indicated it could be things such as email and web browsing history .
however , since the data had been collected by moving vehicles , only fragments of information were recorded .
google regretted its mistake and would look for a way to destroy the personal data .
" maintaining people 's trust is crucial to everything we do , and in this case we fell short , " said eustace in the blog post .
google reviewed its data collection methods in response to an inquiry from the data protection authority in hamburg .
the google street view service allows users to " walk " along panoramic street views in many countries , using images recorded by specially-outfitted cars .

the group of experts tasked with drafting the paper must tackle not only a changed security environment , but also different threat perceptions . it is merely 11 years , but in terms of the geopolitical developments that have occurred since nato last adapted its strategic concept , it was a different era .
while the cold war had come to an end with the fall of the berlin wall a decade earlier , it was still largely unclear what global trends and events would shape the next era .
the attacks of september 11 in 2001 brutally ended this interval , launching an era where islamic terrorism , asymetric threats , counterinsurgency warfare and failing states quickly became the new currency in the international debate on global security .
nato has repeatedly discussed what the changed geopolitcal landscape means for the venerable institution .
but it has n't - until now - framed and formalized the allliance 's response to these challenges in a revised doctrine .
to do just that , to develop a new strategic concept , was the task given to former us secretary of state madeleine albright and a group of international experts .
and it is n't just the world that has changed since nato 's last concept introduced in 1999 .
nato has changed itself , explains latvia 's foreign minister aivis ronis , who was part of the expert group until he resigned in early may after accepting the post as his country 's top diplomat .
new members " since many central and eastern european states , including the baltic countries , have joined nato in 2004 and of course have not participated in drafting the strategic concept of 1999 , for the first time in these open seminars and conferences central and eastern europeans could contribute to the common vision of nato and the transatlantic community regarding security , threats and challenges and global changes , " says ronis .
" this is an historic experience for the central and eastern european countries and especially for the baltic states . "
due to their recent history with and proximity to russia , many of these newer countries have a different view of nato 's main priorities than some of the alliance 's older and larger members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's new members bring new perspectives to the alliance " the strategy will have to cope with fears which exist in eastern europe primarily with regard to russia , i.e. article 5 -lrb- collective defense - ed . -rrb- , " says fred tanner , director of the geneva center for security policy , who served as a rapporteur on one of the seminars held by the group of experts .
" on the other hand of course you have other countries like france or the uk who have more of an interest to use nato together with the us outside of nato . "
the experts agree that , as latvia 's foreign minister puts it , there needs to be a synergy of territorial defense and the promotion of stability security outside of nato 's traditional realm of influence .
new and old threats but , karl kaiser , director of the program on transatlantic relations at the weatherhead center for international affairs at harvard university , argues that collective defense as laid out in article 5 of the nato treaty ca n't be the alliance 's raison d 'etre . " article 5 should not dissappear , " says kaiser who testified before the group of experts last year .
" of course if a country gets attacked , the others have to come to its assistance , but that is not the main reason for the alliance today .
the main reason is elsewhere .
so we have to reconcile the two , we have to have both , but we should n't put article 5 at the top anymore and do , as some of these countries want , exercizes looking at the potential of russian aggression . "
the underlying dilemma for nato and the group of experts is the lack of a common threat perception within the new , larger alliance .
and this threat assessment gap does n't just exist between newer and older members , it is also evident between european members and the us .
while the us wants nato to focus much more on counter-terrorism efforts outside nato territory , many european members are deeply skeptical about such a global military role as exemplified by the debate over the afghanistan mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group of experts visited moscow to engage russia as well flexibility needed for nato and the group of experts , this means the new concept must try and square the circle .
" the strategy will have to be flexible , " says tanner .
it will have to take into account different threat perceptions and various contingencies , both inside nato 's traditional transatlantic realm of influence and beyond .
to do just that , to ensure that nato can act in classical military fashion against an outside aggressor and at the same time can engage in counter-terrorism activities and state-building measures in asia or africa could be easier on paper than in practice .
especially in times of tight budgets and with nato members like greece on the brink of financial collapse .
despite these steep challenges , nato is indispensable , argue the experts .
" nato is needed for the security of our people , defending our democracy and promoting peace and stability in this very unpredictable , very uncertain and very complex world , " says ronis .
" nato 's big advantage today is that it has the ability to act in a robust environment , " argues tanner .
" it can use force if necessary .
and it is actually the only organization which has this capability with a certain projection of power . "
to harness that unique power , a convincing new strategy laid out by the panel of experts would be a good start , says kaiser : " it should n't be too long , it should n't be some bland lowest common denominator , but be sharp in defining the threats to modern society and what modern societies have to do in order to deal with these new threats .

the group of experts tasked with drafting the paper must tackle not only a changed security environment , but also different threat perceptions . it is merely 11 years , but in terms of the geopolitical developments that have occurred since nato last adapted its strategic concept , it was a different era .
while the cold war had come to an end with the fall of the berlin wall a decade earlier , it was still largely unclear what global trends and events would shape the next era .
the attacks of september 11 in 2001 brutally ended this interval , launching an era where islamic terrorism , asymetric threats , counterinsurgency warfare and failing states quickly became the new currency in the international debate on global security .
nato has repeatedly discussed what the changed geopolitcal landscape means for the venerable institution .
but it has n't - until now - framed and formalized the allliance 's response to these challenges in a revised doctrine .
to do just that , to develop a new strategic concept , was the task given to former us secretary of state madeleine albright and a group of international experts .
and it is n't just the world that has changed since nato 's last concept introduced in 1999 .
nato has changed itself , explains latvia 's foreign minister aivis ronis , who was part of the expert group until he resigned in early may after accepting the post as his country 's top diplomat .
new members " since many central and eastern european states , including the baltic countries , have joined nato in 2004 and of course have not participated in drafting the strategic concept of 1999 , for the first time in these open seminars and conferences central and eastern europeans could contribute to the common vision of nato and the transatlantic community regarding security , threats and challenges and global changes , " says ronis .
" this is an historic experience for the central and eastern european countries and especially for the baltic states . "
due to their recent history with and proximity to russia , many of these newer countries have a different view of nato 's main priorities than some of the alliance 's older and larger members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's new members bring new perspectives to the alliance " the strategy will have to cope with fears which exist in eastern europe primarily with regard to russia , i.e. article 5 -lrb- collective defense - ed . -rrb- , " says fred tanner , director of the geneva center for security policy , who served as a rapporteur on one of the seminars held by the group of experts .
" on the other hand of course you have other countries like france or the uk who have more of an interest to use nato together with the us outside of nato . "
the experts agree that , as latvia 's foreign minister puts it , there needs to be a synergy of territorial defense and the promotion of stability security outside of nato 's traditional realm of influence .
new and old threats but , karl kaiser , director of the program on transatlantic relations at the weatherhead center for international affairs at harvard university , argues that collective defense as laid out in article 5 of the nato treaty ca n't be the alliance 's raison d 'etre . " article 5 should not dissappear , " says kaiser who testified before the group of experts last year .
" of course if a country gets attacked , the others have to come to its assistance , but that is not the main reason for the alliance today .
the main reason is elsewhere .
so we have to reconcile the two , we have to have both , but we should n't put article 5 at the top anymore and do , as some of these countries want , exercizes looking at the potential of russian aggression . "
the underlying dilemma for nato and the group of experts is the lack of a common threat perception within the new , larger alliance .
and this threat assessment gap does n't just exist between newer and older members , it is also evident between european members and the us .
while the us wants nato to focus much more on counter-terrorism efforts outside nato territory , many european members are deeply skeptical about such a global military role as exemplified by the debate over the afghanistan mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group of experts visited moscow to engage russia as well flexibility needed for nato and the group of experts , this means the new concept must try and square the circle .
" the strategy will have to be flexible , " says tanner .
it will have to take into account different threat perceptions and various contingencies , both inside nato 's traditional transatlantic realm of influence and beyond .
to do just that , to ensure that nato can act in classical military fashion against an outside aggressor and at the same time can engage in counter-terrorism activities and state-building measures in asia or africa could be easier on paper than in practice .
especially in times of tight budgets and with nato members like greece on the brink of financial collapse .
despite these steep challenges , nato is indispensable , argue the experts .
" nato is needed for the security of our people , defending our democracy and promoting peace and stability in this very unpredictable , very uncertain and very complex world , " says ronis .
" nato 's big advantage today is that it has the ability to act in a robust environment , " argues tanner .
" it can use force if necessary .
and it is actually the only organization which has this capability with a certain projection of power . "
to harness that unique power , a convincing new strategy laid out by the panel of experts would be a good start , says kaiser : " it should n't be too long , it should n't be some bland lowest common denominator , but be sharp in defining the threats to modern society and what modern societies have to do in order to deal with these new threats .

goals from arjen robben , ivica olic , franck ribery and bastian schweinsteiger allowed the bavarians to claim the second leg of a potential bundesliga , dfb-pokal and champions league treble .
although bayern were not at their free-flowing best , clinical second-half finishing from louis van gaal 's side saw them ease to a comfortable victory .
bremen , returning to berlin to defend the cup they won a year ago , had few answers to their opponents ' dominance , and the dismissal of their captain torsten frings was symptomatic of their frustration in the closing stages .
" the result was clearer than the game actually was .
we went 2-0 -lsb- ahead -rsb- at the perfect time , " bayern defender philipp lahm said after the game .
" we really want to get the treble . "
" i think it was one of the best games that we played this season , " said van gaal .
" i told my players that it was important to win , but also how we won . "
a full-strength bayern team took the initiative from the opening minutes , and never let go of it .
despite coach thomas schaaf 's clear instructions for his bremen players to double up on in-form arjen robben , the winger was at the heart of his side 's best work in the first half .
tim wiese in the bremen goal was called on as early as the third minute , tipping a long-range robben effort over the bar .
the dutchman then found himself on the left , playing in ivica olic , who failed to find the net from not more than five yards .
olic was heavily involved in the opening goal though .
the croatian striker 's flick hit the hand of per mertesacker just inside the penalty and , although the big german defender could have known little about it from such close range , the referee pointed to the spot .
wiese guessed the right way , but robben 's penalty was hit hard and low and found the corner , to give bayern a 35th-minute lead .
the floodgates open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's torsten frings , right , was sent off at the 77th minute mertesacker was unlucky again for the second goal shortly after half-time .
his attempt to head clear deflected into the path of olic , who poked home a classic predator 's finish .
with bremen pushing up to try and get something back , ribery put the game to bed in the 63rd minute .
the frenchman was played through by mark van bommel and finished coolly , before sliding on the wet turf by the corner flag in memorable celebration .
former bayern midfielder frings was shown a second yellow with 15 minutes to go , catching bastian schweinsteiger late as bayern played keep-ball in the closing stages , and barely waiting to see the referee produce the red before he left the pitch .
schweinsteiger relinquished himself from a disciplined midfield role in the final minutes , taking philipp lahm 's lofted ball on the chest and volleying inside the far corner of the net for bayern 's fourth .
" the first half was great , in the second , we scored the goals , " said bayern striker thomas mueller .
" such a result is like a dream . "
closer to the treble the scoreline was harsh on werder bremen , who came into the game on the back of some fine late-season bundesliga form .
they could have taken the lead inside the first ten minutes , joerg butt in the bayern goal making an excellent double-save after claudio pizarro got in .
pizarro was too often isolated up front though , mesut oezil and aaron hunt failing to get the cup holders ' passing game going in very wet conditions in berlin .
" bayern dominated the game and i can only congratulate them , " admitted bremen coach schaaf .
bayern must wish they could play at the olympic stadium every day .
on two consecutive saturdays , captain van bommel has now lifted domestic silverware in the capital .
bayern wrapped up the domestic title with a 3-1 win over hertha berlin last weekend , and , with the dfb-pokal now secured , travel to madrid next weekend knowing that victory over internazionale would see them complete an unprecedented treble .
with seemingly no instructions to take it easy before next week 's game , bayern players celebrated hard after the final whistle .

despite the tough times , eu leaders are staying the course . at times in recent weeks it 's felt a bit like a contest : what new low will the euro sink to next ?
on friday , the common currency shared by 16 of the european union members sank to its lowest level in 18 months , briefly trading at $ 1.2358 .
as recently as last summer , the euro was pushing $ 1.50 .
the causes of the drastic decline in the euro 's value are not difficult to discern .

" what we need is a quantum leap in mutual surveillance of economic policies in europe , " trichet told spiegel .
" we need improved mechanisms to prevent and punish misconduct . "
part of the problem in the eurozone comes from countries ignoring the european stability and growth pact , which sets a budget deficit limit of three percent of a country 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
most eu countries have exceeded this limit , and greece is four times over the mark .
trichet called for " effective sanctions for breaches of the stability and growth pact . "
defending the euro in germany , chancellor angela merkel echoed some of trichet 's sentiments in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper and defended her own decisions to support a financial rescue package for greece .
" when the stability of the euro is threatened , we ca n't evade our responsibility , " merkel told the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" with our guarantee package from the entire eurozone for greece , we 're ensuring that the common currency remains stable . "

merkel 's decision to back aid for greece was not popular with many germans , while the opposition in parliament criticized that her initial reluctance to send money to athens only exacerbated the situation in greece and made the financial bailout more expensive than it needed to be .
however , merkel maintained she just wanted to make sure all legal and economic bases had been covered , and reiterated her stance that sending help to greece was only done in the wider interest of the euro .

despite the tough times , eu leaders are staying the course . at times in recent weeks it 's felt a bit like a contest : what new low will the euro sink to next ?
on friday , the common currency shared by 16 of the european union members sank to its lowest level in 18 months , briefly trading at $ 1.2358 .
as recently as last summer , the euro was pushing $ 1.50 .
the causes of the drastic decline in the euro 's value are not difficult to discern .
budget deficit problems across europe - most notably in greece - and massive bailout packages designed to prop up ailing economies have caused financial markets to lose faith in the euro , causing some speculation that the existence of the euro itself was being threatened .
european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- president jean-claude trichet is n't sugarcoating the issue .
in an interview with the german magazine der spiegel , he said europe is in the most difficult situation since world war ii , possibly even since world war i.

" what we need is a quantum leap in mutual surveillance of economic policies in europe , " trichet told spiegel .
" we need improved mechanisms to prevent and punish misconduct . "
part of the problem in the eurozone comes from countries ignoring the european stability and growth pact , which sets a budget deficit limit of three percent of a country 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
most eu countries have exceeded this limit , and greece is four times over the mark .
trichet called for " effective sanctions for breaches of the stability and growth pact . "

" when the stability of the euro is threatened , we ca n't evade our responsibility , " merkel told the sueddeutsche zeitung .

merkel 's decision to back aid for greece was not popular with many germans , while the opposition in parliament criticized that her initial reluctance to send money to athens only exacerbated the situation in greece and made the financial bailout more expensive than it needed to be .
however , merkel maintained she just wanted to make sure all legal and economic bases had been covered , and reiterated her stance that sending help to greece was only done in the wider interest of the euro .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 15.05.2010 europe 's single currency down , but not out großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been dark days for the euro recently the euro has fallen in value to its lowest level in over a year as massive bailout packages to save greece and the eurozone fly out of eu coffers .
despite the tough times , eu leaders are staying the course . at times in recent weeks it 's felt a bit like a contest : what new low will the euro sink to next ?
on friday , the common currency shared by 16 of the european union members sank to its lowest level in 18 months , briefly trading at $ 1.2358 .
as recently as last summer , the euro was pushing $ 1.50 .
the causes of the drastic decline in the euro 's value are not difficult to discern .
budget deficit problems across europe - most notably in greece - and massive bailout packages designed to prop up ailing economies have caused financial markets to lose faith in the euro , causing some speculation that the existence of the euro itself was being threatened .
european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- president jean-claude trichet is n't sugarcoating the issue .
in an interview with the german magazine der spiegel , he said europe is in the most difficult situation since world war ii , possibly even since world war i.
' quantum leap ' in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet knows the euro has seen better days , but is confident things can be fixed despite the dire straits , however , trichet sees a way out of the crisis .
" what we need is a quantum leap in mutual surveillance of economic policies in europe , " trichet told spiegel .
" we need improved mechanisms to prevent and punish misconduct . "
part of the problem in the eurozone comes from countries ignoring the european stability and growth pact , which sets a budget deficit limit of three percent of a country 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
most eu countries have exceeded this limit , and greece is four times over the mark .
trichet called for " effective sanctions for breaches of the stability and growth pact . "
defending the euro in germany , chancellor angela merkel echoed some of trichet 's sentiments in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper and defended her own decisions to support a financial rescue package for greece .
" when the stability of the euro is threatened , we ca n't evade our responsibility , " merkel told the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" with our guarantee package from the entire eurozone for greece , we 're ensuring that the common currency remains stable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and trichet agree : eu nations need to do a better job of balancing the books she added that europe , as a whole , needed to get its public budgets in order and reduce debts in the years ahead .
merkel 's decision to back aid for greece was not popular with many germans , while the opposition in parliament criticized that her initial reluctance to send money to athens only exacerbated the situation in greece and made the financial bailout more expensive than it needed to be .
however , merkel maintained she just wanted to make sure all legal and economic bases had been covered , and reiterated her stance that sending help to greece was only done in the wider interest of the euro .

" according to the information available to us so far , google has for years penetrated private networks , apparently illegally , " aigner said in a statement on saturday .
the " alarming incident " showed that google still lacks understanding for the need for privacy , according to the statement .
privacy breach google 's fleet of street view cars , photographing streets for its online map program , has been collecting more data than previously thought .
after reviewing a system in the cars that recorded names and addresses of wireless networks detected along the routes , google revealed that a programming error had led to small amounts of personal data to be collected from unsecured wi-fi networks .

however , since the data had been collected by moving vehicles , only fragments of information were recorded .
google regretted its mistake and would look for a way to destroy the personal data .

" probably i ca n't live there any more , " said vilks , who was not home at the time .
" the damage is rather minor ; part of the front is blackened and some windows were broken , " scanie district police spokeswoman sofie oesterheim told news agency agence france-presse .
" the fire went out by itself . "
police found glass bottles containing petrol in the house and are treating the attack as arson .
string of attacks the incident comes just days after vilks was beaten while giving a lecture at uppsala university in sweden .
vilks , who depicted the prophet muhammad with the body of a dog for swedish daily nerikes allehanda in 2007 , has been targeted by muslim extremists ever since .
an al-qaida organization has offered $ 100,000 -lrb- 80,900 euros -rrb- to anyone who would murder vilks .
danish cartoonist kurt westergaard , who showed muhammad with a bomb-shaped turban in a danish newspaper in 2005 , has also been subject to attacks by outraged muslims , who believe any depiction of the prophet is blasphemous .
in january , a somali man was charged with terrorism and attempted murder for breaking into westergaard 's home .
westergaard 's and vilks ' cartoons have sparked outrage across the muslim world , with at least 50 people killed in riots in the middle east , africa and asia .
there were also formal complaints from pakistan , egypt and iran. ng / afp / reuters / ap editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

goals from arjen robben , ivica olic , franck ribery and bastian schweinsteiger allowed the bavarians to claim the second leg of a potential bundesliga , dfb-pokal and champions league treble .
although bayern were not at their free-flowing best , clinical second-half finishing from louis van gaal 's side saw them ease to a comfortable victory .
bremen , returning to berlin to defend the cup they won a year ago , had few answers to their opponents ' dominance , and the dismissal of their captain torsten frings was symptomatic of their frustration in the closing stages .
" the result was clearer than the game actually was .
we went 2-0 -lsb- ahead -rsb- at the perfect time , " bayern defender philipp lahm said after the game .
" we really want to get the treble . "
" i think it was one of the best games that we played this season , " said van gaal .
" i told my players that it was important to win , but also how we won . "
a full-strength bayern team took the initiative from the opening minutes , and never let go of it .
despite coach thomas schaaf 's clear instructions for his bremen players to double up on in-form arjen robben , the winger was at the heart of his side 's best work in the first half .
tim wiese in the bremen goal was called on as early as the third minute , tipping a long-range robben effort over the bar .
the dutchman then found himself on the left , playing in ivica olic , who failed to find the net from not more than five yards .
olic was heavily involved in the opening goal though .
the croatian striker 's flick hit the hand of per mertesacker just inside the penalty and , although the big german defender could have known little about it from such close range , the referee pointed to the spot .
wiese guessed the right way , but robben 's penalty was hit hard and low and found the corner , to give bayern a 35th-minute lead .
the floodgates open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's torsten frings , right , was sent off at the 77th minute mertesacker was unlucky again for the second goal shortly after half-time .
his attempt to head clear deflected into the path of olic , who poked home a classic predator 's finish .
with bremen pushing up to try and get something back , ribery put the game to bed in the 63rd minute .
the frenchman was played through by mark van bommel and finished coolly , before sliding on the wet turf by the corner flag in memorable celebration .
former bayern midfielder frings was shown a second yellow with 15 minutes to go , catching bastian schweinsteiger late as bayern played keep-ball in the closing stages , and barely waiting to see the referee produce the red before he left the pitch .
schweinsteiger relinquished himself from a disciplined midfield role in the final minutes , taking philipp lahm 's lofted ball on the chest and volleying inside the far corner of the net for bayern 's fourth .
" the first half was great , in the second , we scored the goals , " said bayern striker thomas mueller .
" such a result is like a dream . "
closer to the treble the scoreline was harsh on werder bremen , who came into the game on the back of some fine late-season bundesliga form .
they could have taken the lead inside the first ten minutes , joerg butt in the bayern goal making an excellent double-save after claudio pizarro got in .
pizarro was too often isolated up front though , mesut oezil and aaron hunt failing to get the cup holders ' passing game going in very wet conditions in berlin .
" bayern dominated the game and i can only congratulate them , " admitted bremen coach schaaf .
bayern must wish they could play at the olympic stadium every day .
on two consecutive saturdays , captain van bommel has now lifted domestic silverware in the capital .
bayern wrapped up the domestic title with a 3-1 win over hertha berlin last weekend , and , with the dfb-pokal now secured , travel to madrid next weekend knowing that victory over internazionale would see them complete an unprecedented treble .
with seemingly no instructions to take it easy before next week 's game , bayern players celebrated hard after the final whistle .

bremen , returning to berlin to defend the cup they won a year ago , had few answers to their opponents ' dominance , and the dismissal of their captain torsten frings was symptomatic of their frustration in the closing stages .
" the result was clearer than the game actually was .
we went 2-0 -lsb- ahead -rsb- at the perfect time , " bayern defender philipp lahm said after the game .
" we really want to get the treble . "
" i think it was one of the best games that we played this season , " said van gaal .
" i told my players that it was important to win , but also how we won . "
a full-strength bayern team took the initiative from the opening minutes , and never let go of it .
despite coach thomas schaaf 's clear instructions for his bremen players to double up on in-form arjen robben , the winger was at the heart of his side 's best work in the first half .
tim wiese in the bremen goal was called on as early as the third minute , tipping a long-range robben effort over the bar .
the dutchman then found himself on the left , playing in ivica olic , who failed to find the net from not more than five yards .
olic was heavily involved in the opening goal though .
the croatian striker 's flick hit the hand of per mertesacker just inside the penalty and , although the big german defender could have known little about it from such close range , the referee pointed to the spot .
wiese guessed the right way , but robben 's penalty was hit hard and low and found the corner , to give bayern a 35th-minute lead .
the floodgates open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's torsten frings , right , was sent off at the 77th minute mertesacker was unlucky again for the second goal shortly after half-time .
his attempt to head clear deflected into the path of olic , who poked home a classic predator 's finish .
with bremen pushing up to try and get something back , ribery put the game to bed in the 63rd minute .
the frenchman was played through by mark van bommel and finished coolly , before sliding on the wet turf by the corner flag in memorable celebration .
former bayern midfielder frings was shown a second yellow with 15 minutes to go , catching bastian schweinsteiger late as bayern played keep-ball in the closing stages , and barely waiting to see the referee produce the red before he left the pitch .
schweinsteiger relinquished himself from a disciplined midfield role in the final minutes , taking philipp lahm 's lofted ball on the chest and volleying inside the far corner of the net for bayern 's fourth .
" the first half was great , in the second , we scored the goals , " said bayern striker thomas mueller .
" such a result is like a dream . "
closer to the treble the scoreline was harsh on werder bremen , who came into the game on the back of some fine late-season bundesliga form .
they could have taken the lead inside the first ten minutes , joerg butt in the bayern goal making an excellent double-save after claudio pizarro got in .
pizarro was too often isolated up front though , mesut oezil and aaron hunt failing to get the cup holders ' passing game going in very wet conditions in berlin .
" bayern dominated the game and i can only congratulate them , " admitted bremen coach schaaf .
bayern must wish they could play at the olympic stadium every day .
on two consecutive saturdays , captain van bommel has now lifted domestic silverware in the capital .
bayern wrapped up the domestic title with a 3-1 win over hertha berlin last weekend , and , with the dfb-pokal now secured , travel to madrid next weekend knowing that victory over internazionale would see them complete an unprecedented treble .
with seemingly no instructions to take it easy before next week 's game , bayern players celebrated hard after the final whistle .

despite coach thomas schaaf 's clear instructions for his bremen players to double up on in-form arjen robben , the winger was at the heart of his side 's best work in the first half .
tim wiese in the bremen goal was called on as early as the third minute , tipping a long-range robben effort over the bar .
the dutchman then found himself on the left , playing in ivica olic , who failed to find the net from not more than five yards .
olic was heavily involved in the opening goal though .
the croatian striker 's flick hit the hand of per mertesacker just inside the penalty and , although the big german defender could have known little about it from such close range , the referee pointed to the spot .
wiese guessed the right way , but robben 's penalty was hit hard and low and found the corner , to give bayern a 35th-minute lead .
the floodgates open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's torsten frings , right , was sent off at the 77th minute mertesacker was unlucky again for the second goal shortly after half-time .
his attempt to head clear deflected into the path of olic , who poked home a classic predator 's finish .
with bremen pushing up to try and get something back , ribery put the game to bed in the 63rd minute .
the frenchman was played through by mark van bommel and finished coolly , before sliding on the wet turf by the corner flag in memorable celebration .
former bayern midfielder frings was shown a second yellow with 15 minutes to go , catching bastian schweinsteiger late as bayern played keep-ball in the closing stages , and barely waiting to see the referee produce the red before he left the pitch .
schweinsteiger relinquished himself from a disciplined midfield role in the final minutes , taking philipp lahm 's lofted ball on the chest and volleying inside the far corner of the net for bayern 's fourth .
" the first half was great , in the second , we scored the goals , " said bayern striker thomas mueller .
" such a result is like a dream . "
closer to the treble the scoreline was harsh on werder bremen , who came into the game on the back of some fine late-season bundesliga form .
they could have taken the lead inside the first ten minutes , joerg butt in the bayern goal making an excellent double-save after claudio pizarro got in .
pizarro was too often isolated up front though , mesut oezil and aaron hunt failing to get the cup holders ' passing game going in very wet conditions in berlin .
" bayern dominated the game and i can only congratulate them , " admitted bremen coach schaaf .
bayern must wish they could play at the olympic stadium every day .
on two consecutive saturdays , captain van bommel has now lifted domestic silverware in the capital .
bayern wrapped up the domestic title with a 3-1 win over hertha berlin last weekend , and , with the dfb-pokal now secured , travel to madrid next weekend knowing that victory over internazionale would see them complete an unprecedented treble .
with seemingly no instructions to take it easy before next week 's game , bayern players celebrated hard after the final whistle .
" if we win something , we must celebrate , " said van gaal .
" on wednesday i will start with preparation for inter milan . " tms / dpa / sid editor : stephanie siek send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german businesses are capitalizing on that optimism in the asian market . although the financial crisis and problems with the euro are hanging over the economy in germany , there is a sense of optimism in asia . economies there are expecting several years of growth , and it is hoped this may boost german business , too .
more than 700 companies demonstrated their appetite for a slice of the asian market at this year 's asia-pacific conference for german business .
business opportunities in asia are nothing new - many german companies have been steadily investing in the region for decades .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basf is looking to build on opportunities in asia " it is very important that when operating in asia , most of the products are made on site , " said brudermueller .
" that 's why more than 60 percent of the products we sell here are also locally produced . "
although basf was founded in mannheim , they now have hundreds of production sites around the world , and around 50 of those are in asia .
basf said they are now concentrating on boosting their market share there .
" it should be kept in mind that of the 750-billion-euro -lrb- $ 931.9 billion -rrb- chemical market predicted for 2020 , 500 billion of that is in asia .
therefore , asia is the growth market for basf , " brudermueller said .

" business in america and europe is going backwards , as so many factories have closed down , " said heraeus ceo juergen heraeus .
the heraeus family business , which has its base in frankfurt , has now been in asia for 70 years .
over 40 percent of their production is based in the region .
" when the companies have customers in asia , it makes sense to expand business in asia - and here everything moves very quickly .
in one year here you can start up a factory and begin production , " heraeus added .
piracy problems while it may be quick to set up production in asia , this also means that counterfeiters can adapt and copy european products in no time at all .
technology theft is a big problem , and piracy is becoming an increasingly expensive issue to deal with .

german businesses are capitalizing on that optimism in the asian market . although the financial crisis and problems with the euro are hanging over the economy in germany , there is a sense of optimism in asia . economies there are expecting several years of growth , and it is hoped this may boost german business , too .
more than 700 companies demonstrated their appetite for a slice of the asian market at this year 's asia-pacific conference for german business .
business opportunities in asia are nothing new - many german companies have been steadily investing in the region for decades .
martin brudermueller is a board member of chemical giant basf responsible for asia pacific .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basf is looking to build on opportunities in asia " it is very important that when operating in asia , most of the products are made on site , " said brudermueller .
" that 's why more than 60 percent of the products we sell here are also locally produced . "
although basf was founded in mannheim , they now have hundreds of production sites around the world , and around 50 of those are in asia .
basf said they are now concentrating on boosting their market share there .
" it should be kept in mind that of the 750-billion-euro -lrb- $ 931.9 billion -rrb- chemical market predicted for 2020 , 500 billion of that is in asia .
therefore , asia is the growth market for basf , " brudermueller said .

over 40 percent of their production is based in the region .
" when the companies have customers in asia , it makes sense to expand business in asia - and here everything moves very quickly .
in one year here you can start up a factory and begin production , " heraeus added .
piracy problems while it may be quick to set up production in asia , this also means that counterfeiters can adapt and copy european products in no time at all .

" but we are fooling ourselves . "
" it 's a bit like lawn mowing : you mow the lawn on saturday but then one week later you need to do it all over again , " schadlich said .
attempts to combat piracy , despite costing companies thousands of euros , are considered a worthwhile investment .
piracy aside , german companies know they can do good business in asia .
the biggest winners are those firms who took their chances early with the asian market .
the others are still struggling to catch up .

in an interview with deutsche welle he spoke about the future of the eu , about integration , expansion and the bloc 's international role . polish prime minister donald tusk is the 2010 recipient of the charlemagne prize , an annual award that recognizes efforts in promoting european understanding .
tusk received the prize in aachen on may 13 , with the charlemagne judges praising him for steering poland away from nationalism and bringing the former soviet-bloc country into the heart of europe .
deutsche welle had a chance to speak with the prime minister about his vision for the future of the european union and the issues surrounding the bloc : integration , expansion of the eurozone , shared defense and its international presence .
deutsche welle : in the words of the judges , you are " a convinced and a convincing european . "
what is your vision of europe for europeans , and also its dealings with the rest of the world ?
donald tusk : for all those who understand the meaning of freedom , the meaning of human rights , the meaning of respect for tradition - for all those who have faith in themselves , in their own potential - europe is , first and foremost , the best model for europeans .
europe is understood as a union , the european union - but it is also a continuing dream and a continuing challenge .
sometimes , especially in the so-called old europe , i hear doubting voices , that europe is not proving itself ; that times of crisis have shown that the european union is not up to the challenges .
and we , the polish people , but also many other europeans , reply that it is precisely at such critical moments that the idea of europe , or the union of free people , who believe in their potential and in fundamental values , becomes the most attractive challenge .
and , as i have been repeating frequently over the last few weeks , the more difficult and painful our experiences , the more the doubting voices arise all around , the more we need to hold high the european flag , affirm the conviction that this is a phenomenal invention : the european family .
we must repeat this all the louder and raise the rallying cry all the higher .
bildunterschrift : the polish leader was praised for steering poland away from nationalism what should the model for the european union be ?
a europe of nation states , or the united states of europe ?
which should we aim for ?
i think that , very often , discussion about the future of europe is a discussion about banal , empty slogans .
a moment of historic reflection and common sense is enough to understand that nations will remain nations ; poles will feel polish .
and germans , german .
the french , french .
and so on .
this is as true about nations as it is about smaller ethnic groups .
we shall remain true to our religions .
we shall remain faithful to our customs , while at the same time being aware that europe needs to be an ever closer union ; it needs to think more effectively about its security , including energy security .
in the global world , a europe divided by conflicting interests and conflicting values does n't stand a chance .
but a europe that can rise above these differences while not negating them has a chance to become one of the key world powers , and that is our shared dream .
you say europe should be more integrated , and you talk about europe as a union of values and not merely a continent .
is further enlargement of the eu the way to steam ahead under the present circumstances ?
and , if so , should all the balkan countries and turkey become members of this united europe ?
the greatness of europe has also been based on the fact that europe has shown magnanimity and patience for those who wanted to participate – not in a mechanical , empty political union , but in a union which respects all these values , a union aware of what the foundations of europe are .
this is why i would direct the question about further enlargement of the european union equally to brussels , to the capitals of the european union , as well as to the candidate countries themselves .
right from the beginning , poland has been in favor of the process of the enlargement of the european union , without putting down any conditions of a political and organizational character .
these have , in any case , been included in the treaties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk and poland are set to take the eu presidency in just over a year nevertheless , we shall always be asking ourselves and other europeans , as well as those who want to join the union , do you share our system of values ?
do you want to participate in this union which takes responsibility for itself , where every person is ready to help another ?
and a union where solidarity or freedom are not mere empty slogans ?
we shall ask these questions also of the turks , ukrainians and all those who apply to become members .
but we have examples closer to home , in the sense of realistic possibilities , such as croatia or serbia .
and it appears that under no circumstances can europe become closed .
even , if for germany or for others , today 's experience of greece may be prompting us to think , let 's be careful with those who do n't live up to the crisis or who have not played by the book .
but is it really the case that the core european countries have always played by the book ?
is it really the case that some can point their finger and say , we are fit to be in -lsb- the union -rsb- , but you are not fit ?
everybody has to do their homework on this crisis , everybody , without any exceptions .
the eurozone is wobbly .
and even , possibly , falling apart at the seams .
although you are not obliged to , you want to help greece .
are you still keen for poland to join the common currency , to adopt the euro , as soon as possible ?
just as is the case for the european union , so it is for the eurozone : it should n't be a club for the countries which have joined , but then each one will do as it likes .
the eurozone can not afford for the grim experience of the recent months to be repeated ever again .
poland wants to become a member of the eurozone as soon as possible by fulfilling the criteria which have been agreed to by all .
today , we point our finger at the greeks or talk about possible problems for other mediterranean countries , but we all remember that even the most stable of the union 's members which also belong to the eurozone also have a case to answer when it comes to fulfilling the criteria and sticking to fiscal discipline .
in just over a year , poland will take over the presidency of the european union .
for six months , your hand will be at the helm of the eu .
what ideas will you be especially keen to ' sell ' to europe ?
what will matter to you the most ?
we live in the european union under the lisbon treaty .
this is not the time nor place to explain all the aspects of the treaty , and i am a sober and common-sense politician and i know well that the presidency is very important , but the european union has its powers that be .
poland has a positive role to play during its presidency , but my common sense prompts me to say that the decisions will not be mine to take .
i will be jointly responsible , and not the one who makes the decisions .
it has been just over a month since the death of president lech kaczynski and 95 outstanding poles .
it was a difficult time for poland , which also brought hope for a polish-russian reconciliation .
what can poland and russia , acting together , offer to europe ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent death of polish president lech kaczynski and many elites shook the country first of all , this greatest of tragedies that the world has seen , when it comes to the death toll of government elites , shook to the core our minds and our hearts .
a genuine sense of mourning was pervasive in poland .
but it did not shake the country .
everybody watched with admiration how poles and the polish nation coped with the turn of events .
and we are really trying to draw positive conclusions for the future from this tragedy .
also political ones .
also regarding improving relations between poland and russia , because they are the key to good relations between europe and russia .
such were my aims also before the catastrophe , but both my aims and the efforts of the russian leaders , which i appreciate , have acquired a sense of urgency precisely due to the catastrophe .
therefore , if this is to be the legacy of those who died in the crash near smolensk , then maybe the most important thing is that this legacy becomes a positive factor in furthering understanding - rather than conflicts - between nations .

in an interview with deutsche welle he spoke about the future of the eu , about integration , expansion and the bloc 's international role . polish prime minister donald tusk is the 2010 recipient of the charlemagne prize , an annual award that recognizes efforts in promoting european understanding .
tusk received the prize in aachen on may 13 , with the charlemagne judges praising him for steering poland away from nationalism and bringing the former soviet-bloc country into the heart of europe .
deutsche welle had a chance to speak with the prime minister about his vision for the future of the european union and the issues surrounding the bloc : integration , expansion of the eurozone , shared defense and its international presence .
deutsche welle : in the words of the judges , you are " a convinced and a convincing european . "
what is your vision of europe for europeans , and also its dealings with the rest of the world ?
donald tusk : for all those who understand the meaning of freedom , the meaning of human rights , the meaning of respect for tradition - for all those who have faith in themselves , in their own potential - europe is , first and foremost , the best model for europeans .
europe is understood as a union , the european union - but it is also a continuing dream and a continuing challenge .

in an interview with deutsche welle he spoke about the future of the eu , about integration , expansion and the bloc 's international role . polish prime minister donald tusk is the 2010 recipient of the charlemagne prize , an annual award that recognizes efforts in promoting european understanding .
tusk received the prize in aachen on may 13 , with the charlemagne judges praising him for steering poland away from nationalism and bringing the former soviet-bloc country into the heart of europe .
deutsche welle had a chance to speak with the prime minister about his vision for the future of the european union and the issues surrounding the bloc : integration , expansion of the eurozone , shared defense and its international presence .
deutsche welle : in the words of the judges , you are " a convinced and a convincing european . "
what is your vision of europe for europeans , and also its dealings with the rest of the world ?
donald tusk : for all those who understand the meaning of freedom , the meaning of human rights , the meaning of respect for tradition - for all those who have faith in themselves , in their own potential - europe is , first and foremost , the best model for europeans .
europe is understood as a union , the european union - but it is also a continuing dream and a continuing challenge .
sometimes , especially in the so-called old europe , i hear doubting voices , that europe is not proving itself ; that times of crisis have shown that the european union is not up to the challenges .
and we , the polish people , but also many other europeans , reply that it is precisely at such critical moments that the idea of europe , or the union of free people , who believe in their potential and in fundamental values , becomes the most attractive challenge .
and , as i have been repeating frequently over the last few weeks , the more difficult and painful our experiences , the more the doubting voices arise all around , the more we need to hold high the european flag , affirm the conviction that this is a phenomenal invention : the european family .
we must repeat this all the louder and raise the rallying cry all the higher .
bildunterschrift : the polish leader was praised for steering poland away from nationalism what should the model for the european union be ?
a europe of nation states , or the united states of europe ?
which should we aim for ?
i think that , very often , discussion about the future of europe is a discussion about banal , empty slogans .
a moment of historic reflection and common sense is enough to understand that nations will remain nations ; poles will feel polish .
and germans , german .
the french , french .
and so on .
this is as true about nations as it is about smaller ethnic groups .
we shall remain true to our religions .
we shall remain faithful to our customs , while at the same time being aware that europe needs to be an ever closer union ; it needs to think more effectively about its security , including energy security .
in the global world , a europe divided by conflicting interests and conflicting values does n't stand a chance .
but a europe that can rise above these differences while not negating them has a chance to become one of the key world powers , and that is our shared dream .
you say europe should be more integrated , and you talk about europe as a union of values and not merely a continent .
is further enlargement of the eu the way to steam ahead under the present circumstances ?
and , if so , should all the balkan countries and turkey become members of this united europe ?
the greatness of europe has also been based on the fact that europe has shown magnanimity and patience for those who wanted to participate – not in a mechanical , empty political union , but in a union which respects all these values , a union aware of what the foundations of europe are .
this is why i would direct the question about further enlargement of the european union equally to brussels , to the capitals of the european union , as well as to the candidate countries themselves .
right from the beginning , poland has been in favor of the process of the enlargement of the european union , without putting down any conditions of a political and organizational character .
these have , in any case , been included in the treaties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk and poland are set to take the eu presidency in just over a year nevertheless , we shall always be asking ourselves and other europeans , as well as those who want to join the union , do you share our system of values ?
do you want to participate in this union which takes responsibility for itself , where every person is ready to help another ?
and a union where solidarity or freedom are not mere empty slogans ?
we shall ask these questions also of the turks , ukrainians and all those who apply to become members .
but we have examples closer to home , in the sense of realistic possibilities , such as croatia or serbia .
and it appears that under no circumstances can europe become closed .
even , if for germany or for others , today 's experience of greece may be prompting us to think , let 's be careful with those who do n't live up to the crisis or who have not played by the book .
but is it really the case that the core european countries have always played by the book ?
is it really the case that some can point their finger and say , we are fit to be in -lsb- the union -rsb- , but you are not fit ?
everybody has to do their homework on this crisis , everybody , without any exceptions .
the eurozone is wobbly .
and even , possibly , falling apart at the seams .
although you are not obliged to , you want to help greece .
are you still keen for poland to join the common currency , to adopt the euro , as soon as possible ?
just as is the case for the european union , so it is for the eurozone : it should n't be a club for the countries which have joined , but then each one will do as it likes .
the eurozone can not afford for the grim experience of the recent months to be repeated ever again .
poland wants to become a member of the eurozone as soon as possible by fulfilling the criteria which have been agreed to by all .
today , we point our finger at the greeks or talk about possible problems for other mediterranean countries , but we all remember that even the most stable of the union 's members which also belong to the eurozone also have a case to answer when it comes to fulfilling the criteria and sticking to fiscal discipline .
in just over a year , poland will take over the presidency of the european union .
for six months , your hand will be at the helm of the eu .
what ideas will you be especially keen to ' sell ' to europe ?
what will matter to you the most ?
we live in the european union under the lisbon treaty .
this is not the time nor place to explain all the aspects of the treaty , and i am a sober and common-sense politician and i know well that the presidency is very important , but the european union has its powers that be .
poland has a positive role to play during its presidency , but my common sense prompts me to say that the decisions will not be mine to take .
i will be jointly responsible , and not the one who makes the decisions .
it has been just over a month since the death of president lech kaczynski and 95 outstanding poles .
it was a difficult time for poland , which also brought hope for a polish-russian reconciliation .
what can poland and russia , acting together , offer to europe ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent death of polish president lech kaczynski and many elites shook the country first of all , this greatest of tragedies that the world has seen , when it comes to the death toll of government elites , shook to the core our minds and our hearts .
a genuine sense of mourning was pervasive in poland .
but it did not shake the country .
everybody watched with admiration how poles and the polish nation coped with the turn of events .
and we are really trying to draw positive conclusions for the future from this tragedy .
also political ones .
also regarding improving relations between poland and russia , because they are the key to good relations between europe and russia .
such were my aims also before the catastrophe , but both my aims and the efforts of the russian leaders , which i appreciate , have acquired a sense of urgency precisely due to the catastrophe .
therefore , if this is to be the legacy of those who died in the crash near smolensk , then maybe the most important thing is that this legacy becomes a positive factor in furthering understanding - rather than conflicts - between nations .

tusk received the prize in aachen on may 13 , with the charlemagne judges praising him for steering poland away from nationalism and bringing the former soviet-bloc country into the heart of europe .
deutsche welle had a chance to speak with the prime minister about his vision for the future of the european union and the issues surrounding the bloc : integration , expansion of the eurozone , shared defense and its international presence .
deutsche welle : in the words of the judges , you are " a convinced and a convincing european . "
what is your vision of europe for europeans , and also its dealings with the rest of the world ?
donald tusk : for all those who understand the meaning of freedom , the meaning of human rights , the meaning of respect for tradition - for all those who have faith in themselves , in their own potential - europe is , first and foremost , the best model for europeans .
europe is understood as a union , the european union - but it is also a continuing dream and a continuing challenge .
sometimes , especially in the so-called old europe , i hear doubting voices , that europe is not proving itself ; that times of crisis have shown that the european union is not up to the challenges .
and we , the polish people , but also many other europeans , reply that it is precisely at such critical moments that the idea of europe , or the union of free people , who believe in their potential and in fundamental values , becomes the most attractive challenge .
and , as i have been repeating frequently over the last few weeks , the more difficult and painful our experiences , the more the doubting voices arise all around , the more we need to hold high the european flag , affirm the conviction that this is a phenomenal invention : the european family .
we must repeat this all the louder and raise the rallying cry all the higher .
bildunterschrift : the polish leader was praised for steering poland away from nationalism what should the model for the european union be ?
a europe of nation states , or the united states of europe ?
which should we aim for ?
i think that , very often , discussion about the future of europe is a discussion about banal , empty slogans .
a moment of historic reflection and common sense is enough to understand that nations will remain nations ; poles will feel polish .
and germans , german .
the french , french .
and so on .
this is as true about nations as it is about smaller ethnic groups .
we shall remain true to our religions .
we shall remain faithful to our customs , while at the same time being aware that europe needs to be an ever closer union ; it needs to think more effectively about its security , including energy security .
in the global world , a europe divided by conflicting interests and conflicting values does n't stand a chance .
but a europe that can rise above these differences while not negating them has a chance to become one of the key world powers , and that is our shared dream .
you say europe should be more integrated , and you talk about europe as a union of values and not merely a continent .
is further enlargement of the eu the way to steam ahead under the present circumstances ?
and , if so , should all the balkan countries and turkey become members of this united europe ?
the greatness of europe has also been based on the fact that europe has shown magnanimity and patience for those who wanted to participate – not in a mechanical , empty political union , but in a union which respects all these values , a union aware of what the foundations of europe are .
this is why i would direct the question about further enlargement of the european union equally to brussels , to the capitals of the european union , as well as to the candidate countries themselves .
right from the beginning , poland has been in favor of the process of the enlargement of the european union , without putting down any conditions of a political and organizational character .
these have , in any case , been included in the treaties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk and poland are set to take the eu presidency in just over a year nevertheless , we shall always be asking ourselves and other europeans , as well as those who want to join the union , do you share our system of values ?
do you want to participate in this union which takes responsibility for itself , where every person is ready to help another ?
and a union where solidarity or freedom are not mere empty slogans ?
we shall ask these questions also of the turks , ukrainians and all those who apply to become members .
but we have examples closer to home , in the sense of realistic possibilities , such as croatia or serbia .
and it appears that under no circumstances can europe become closed .
even , if for germany or for others , today 's experience of greece may be prompting us to think , let 's be careful with those who do n't live up to the crisis or who have not played by the book .
but is it really the case that the core european countries have always played by the book ?
is it really the case that some can point their finger and say , we are fit to be in -lsb- the union -rsb- , but you are not fit ?
everybody has to do their homework on this crisis , everybody , without any exceptions .
the eurozone is wobbly .
and even , possibly , falling apart at the seams .
although you are not obliged to , you want to help greece .
are you still keen for poland to join the common currency , to adopt the euro , as soon as possible ?
just as is the case for the european union , so it is for the eurozone : it should n't be a club for the countries which have joined , but then each one will do as it likes .
the eurozone can not afford for the grim experience of the recent months to be repeated ever again .
poland wants to become a member of the eurozone as soon as possible by fulfilling the criteria which have been agreed to by all .
today , we point our finger at the greeks or talk about possible problems for other mediterranean countries , but we all remember that even the most stable of the union 's members which also belong to the eurozone also have a case to answer when it comes to fulfilling the criteria and sticking to fiscal discipline .
in just over a year , poland will take over the presidency of the european union .
for six months , your hand will be at the helm of the eu .
what ideas will you be especially keen to ' sell ' to europe ?
what will matter to you the most ?
we live in the european union under the lisbon treaty .
this is not the time nor place to explain all the aspects of the treaty , and i am a sober and common-sense politician and i know well that the presidency is very important , but the european union has its powers that be .
poland has a positive role to play during its presidency , but my common sense prompts me to say that the decisions will not be mine to take .
i will be jointly responsible , and not the one who makes the decisions .
it has been just over a month since the death of president lech kaczynski and 95 outstanding poles .
it was a difficult time for poland , which also brought hope for a polish-russian reconciliation .
what can poland and russia , acting together , offer to europe ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent death of polish president lech kaczynski and many elites shook the country first of all , this greatest of tragedies that the world has seen , when it comes to the death toll of government elites , shook to the core our minds and our hearts .
a genuine sense of mourning was pervasive in poland .
but it did not shake the country .
everybody watched with admiration how poles and the polish nation coped with the turn of events .
and we are really trying to draw positive conclusions for the future from this tragedy .
also political ones .
also regarding improving relations between poland and russia , because they are the key to good relations between europe and russia .
such were my aims also before the catastrophe , but both my aims and the efforts of the russian leaders , which i appreciate , have acquired a sense of urgency precisely due to the catastrophe .
therefore , if this is to be the legacy of those who died in the crash near smolensk , then maybe the most important thing is that this legacy becomes a positive factor in furthering understanding - rather than conflicts - between nations .

" according to the information available to us so far , google has for years penetrated private networks , apparently illegally , " aigner said in a statement on saturday .
the " alarming incident " showed that google still lacks understanding for the need for privacy , according to the statement .
privacy breach google 's fleet of street view cars , photographing streets for its online map program , has been collecting more data than previously thought .
after reviewing a system in the cars that recorded names and addresses of wireless networks detected along the routes , google revealed that a programming error had led to small amounts of personal data to be collected from unsecured wi-fi networks .
" it 's now clear that we have been mistakenly collecting samples of payload data from open wi-fi networks , " google 's head of engineering alan eustace said in a blog posting .
the blog post did not specify what kinds of personal data had been collected but indicated it could be things such as email and web browsing history .
however , since the data had been collected by moving vehicles , only fragments of information were recorded .
google regretted its mistake and would look for a way to destroy the personal data .
" maintaining people 's trust is crucial to everything we do , and in this case we fell short , " said eustace in the blog post .
google reviewed its data collection methods in response to an inquiry from the data protection authority in hamburg .
the google street view service allows users to " walk " along panoramic street views in many countries , using images recorded by specially-outfitted cars .
the fleet of cars around the world has been halted for the time being as google attempts to fix the glitch .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de german cup -pipe- 15.05.2010 bayern thrash bremen to win german cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is munich 's 15th german cup victory bayern munich took the second step towards a historic treble on saturday night with an emphatic victory over 10-man werder bremen in the german cup final . bayern munich won the german cup for the 15th time on saturday , defeating werder bremen 4-0 in the final in berlin 's olympic stadium .
goals from arjen robben , ivica olic , franck ribery and bastian schweinsteiger allowed the bavarians to claim the second leg of a potential bundesliga , dfb-pokal and champions league treble .
although bayern were not at their free-flowing best , clinical second-half finishing from louis van gaal 's side saw them ease to a comfortable victory .
bremen , returning to berlin to defend the cup they won a year ago , had few answers to their opponents ' dominance , and the dismissal of their captain torsten frings was symptomatic of their frustration in the closing stages .
" the result was clearer than the game actually was .
we went 2-0 -lsb- ahead -rsb- at the perfect time , " bayern defender philipp lahm said after the game .
" we really want to get the treble . "
" i think it was one of the best games that we played this season , " said van gaal .
" i told my players that it was important to win , but also how we won . "
a full-strength bayern team took the initiative from the opening minutes , and never let go of it .
despite coach thomas schaaf 's clear instructions for his bremen players to double up on in-form arjen robben , the winger was at the heart of his side 's best work in the first half .
tim wiese in the bremen goal was called on as early as the third minute , tipping a long-range robben effort over the bar .
the dutchman then found himself on the left , playing in ivica olic , who failed to find the net from not more than five yards .
olic was heavily involved in the opening goal though .
the croatian striker 's flick hit the hand of per mertesacker just inside the penalty and , although the big german defender could have known little about it from such close range , the referee pointed to the spot .
wiese guessed the right way , but robben 's penalty was hit hard and low and found the corner , to give bayern a 35th-minute lead .
the floodgates open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's torsten frings , right , was sent off at the 77th minute mertesacker was unlucky again for the second goal shortly after half-time .
his attempt to head clear deflected into the path of olic , who poked home a classic predator 's finish .
with bremen pushing up to try and get something back , ribery put the game to bed in the 63rd minute .
the frenchman was played through by mark van bommel and finished coolly , before sliding on the wet turf by the corner flag in memorable celebration .
former bayern midfielder frings was shown a second yellow with 15 minutes to go , catching bastian schweinsteiger late as bayern played keep-ball in the closing stages , and barely waiting to see the referee produce the red before he left the pitch .
schweinsteiger relinquished himself from a disciplined midfield role in the final minutes , taking philipp lahm 's lofted ball on the chest and volleying inside the far corner of the net for bayern 's fourth .
" the first half was great , in the second , we scored the goals , " said bayern striker thomas mueller .
" such a result is like a dream . "
closer to the treble the scoreline was harsh on werder bremen , who came into the game on the back of some fine late-season bundesliga form .
they could have taken the lead inside the first ten minutes , joerg butt in the bayern goal making an excellent double-save after claudio pizarro got in .
pizarro was too often isolated up front though , mesut oezil and aaron hunt failing to get the cup holders ' passing game going in very wet conditions in berlin .
" bayern dominated the game and i can only congratulate them , " admitted bremen coach schaaf .
bayern must wish they could play at the olympic stadium every day .
on two consecutive saturdays , captain van bommel has now lifted domestic silverware in the capital .

" the fire went out by itself . "
police found glass bottles containing petrol in the house and are treating the attack as arson .
string of attacks the incident comes just days after vilks was beaten while giving a lecture at uppsala university in sweden .
vilks , who depicted the prophet muhammad with the body of a dog for swedish daily nerikes allehanda in 2007 , has been targeted by muslim extremists ever since .

despite the tough times , eu leaders are staying the course . at times in recent weeks it 's felt a bit like a contest : what new low will the euro sink to next ?
on friday , the common currency shared by 16 of the european union members sank to its lowest level in 18 months , briefly trading at $ 1.2358 .
as recently as last summer , the euro was pushing $ 1.50 .
the causes of the drastic decline in the euro 's value are not difficult to discern .
budget deficit problems across europe - most notably in greece - and massive bailout packages designed to prop up ailing economies have caused financial markets to lose faith in the euro , causing some speculation that the existence of the euro itself was being threatened .
european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- president jean-claude trichet is n't sugarcoating the issue .

" what we need is a quantum leap in mutual surveillance of economic policies in europe , " trichet told spiegel .
" we need improved mechanisms to prevent and punish misconduct . "
part of the problem in the eurozone comes from countries ignoring the european stability and growth pact , which sets a budget deficit limit of three percent of a country 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
most eu countries have exceeded this limit , and greece is four times over the mark .
trichet called for " effective sanctions for breaches of the stability and growth pact . "
defending the euro in germany , chancellor angela merkel echoed some of trichet 's sentiments in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper and defended her own decisions to support a financial rescue package for greece .
" when the stability of the euro is threatened , we ca n't evade our responsibility , " merkel told the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" with our guarantee package from the entire eurozone for greece , we 're ensuring that the common currency remains stable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and trichet agree : eu nations need to do a better job of balancing the books she added that europe , as a whole , needed to get its public budgets in order and reduce debts in the years ahead .
merkel 's decision to back aid for greece was not popular with many germans , while the opposition in parliament criticized that her initial reluctance to send money to athens only exacerbated the situation in greece and made the financial bailout more expensive than it needed to be .
however , merkel maintained she just wanted to make sure all legal and economic bases had been covered , and reiterated her stance that sending help to greece was only done in the wider interest of the euro .
" we all know , if the euro fails , more failures will follow , " she said , adding that the only way to ensure the stability of the euro in the future was a convergence of financial policies in europe. mz / reuters / apn / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

most eu countries have exceeded this limit , and greece is four times over the mark .
trichet called for " effective sanctions for breaches of the stability and growth pact . "
defending the euro in germany , chancellor angela merkel echoed some of trichet 's sentiments in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper and defended her own decisions to support a financial rescue package for greece .
" when the stability of the euro is threatened , we ca n't evade our responsibility , " merkel told the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" with our guarantee package from the entire eurozone for greece , we 're ensuring that the common currency remains stable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and trichet agree : eu nations need to do a better job of balancing the books she added that europe , as a whole , needed to get its public budgets in order and reduce debts in the years ahead .
merkel 's decision to back aid for greece was not popular with many germans , while the opposition in parliament criticized that her initial reluctance to send money to athens only exacerbated the situation in greece and made the financial bailout more expensive than it needed to be .
however , merkel maintained she just wanted to make sure all legal and economic bases had been covered , and reiterated her stance that sending help to greece was only done in the wider interest of the euro .
" we all know , if the euro fails , more failures will follow , " she said , adding that the only way to ensure the stability of the euro in the future was a convergence of financial policies in europe. mz / reuters / apn / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

goals from arjen robben , ivica olic , franck ribery and bastian schweinsteiger allowed the bavarians to claim the second leg of a potential bundesliga , dfb-pokal and champions league treble .
although bayern were not at their free-flowing best , clinical second-half finishing from louis van gaal 's side saw them ease to a comfortable victory .
bremen , returning to berlin to defend the cup they won a year ago , had few answers to their opponents ' dominance , and the dismissal of their captain torsten frings was symptomatic of their frustration in the closing stages .
" the result was clearer than the game actually was .
we went 2-0 -lsb- ahead -rsb- at the perfect time , " bayern defender philipp lahm said after the game .
" we really want to get the treble . "
" i think it was one of the best games that we played this season , " said van gaal .
" i told my players that it was important to win , but also how we won . "
a full-strength bayern team took the initiative from the opening minutes , and never let go of it .
despite coach thomas schaaf 's clear instructions for his bremen players to double up on in-form arjen robben , the winger was at the heart of his side 's best work in the first half .
tim wiese in the bremen goal was called on as early as the third minute , tipping a long-range robben effort over the bar .
the dutchman then found himself on the left , playing in ivica olic , who failed to find the net from not more than five yards .
olic was heavily involved in the opening goal though .
the croatian striker 's flick hit the hand of per mertesacker just inside the penalty and , although the big german defender could have known little about it from such close range , the referee pointed to the spot .
wiese guessed the right way , but robben 's penalty was hit hard and low and found the corner , to give bayern a 35th-minute lead .
the floodgates open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's torsten frings , right , was sent off at the 77th minute mertesacker was unlucky again for the second goal shortly after half-time .
his attempt to head clear deflected into the path of olic , who poked home a classic predator 's finish .
with bremen pushing up to try and get something back , ribery put the game to bed in the 63rd minute .
the frenchman was played through by mark van bommel and finished coolly , before sliding on the wet turf by the corner flag in memorable celebration .
former bayern midfielder frings was shown a second yellow with 15 minutes to go , catching bastian schweinsteiger late as bayern played keep-ball in the closing stages , and barely waiting to see the referee produce the red before he left the pitch .
schweinsteiger relinquished himself from a disciplined midfield role in the final minutes , taking philipp lahm 's lofted ball on the chest and volleying inside the far corner of the net for bayern 's fourth .
" the first half was great , in the second , we scored the goals , " said bayern striker thomas mueller .
" such a result is like a dream . "
closer to the treble the scoreline was harsh on werder bremen , who came into the game on the back of some fine late-season bundesliga form .
they could have taken the lead inside the first ten minutes , joerg butt in the bayern goal making an excellent double-save after claudio pizarro got in .
pizarro was too often isolated up front though , mesut oezil and aaron hunt failing to get the cup holders ' passing game going in very wet conditions in berlin .
" bayern dominated the game and i can only congratulate them , " admitted bremen coach schaaf .
bayern must wish they could play at the olympic stadium every day .
on two consecutive saturdays , captain van bommel has now lifted domestic silverware in the capital .
bayern wrapped up the domestic title with a 3-1 win over hertha berlin last weekend , and , with the dfb-pokal now secured , travel to madrid next weekend knowing that victory over internazionale would see them complete an unprecedented treble .
with seemingly no instructions to take it easy before next week 's game , bayern players celebrated hard after the final whistle .
" if we win something , we must celebrate , " said van gaal .

goals from arjen robben , ivica olic , franck ribery and bastian schweinsteiger allowed the bavarians to claim the second leg of a potential bundesliga , dfb-pokal and champions league treble .
although bayern were not at their free-flowing best , clinical second-half finishing from louis van gaal 's side saw them ease to a comfortable victory .
bremen , returning to berlin to defend the cup they won a year ago , had few answers to their opponents ' dominance , and the dismissal of their captain torsten frings was symptomatic of their frustration in the closing stages .
" the result was clearer than the game actually was .
we went 2-0 -lsb- ahead -rsb- at the perfect time , " bayern defender philipp lahm said after the game .
" we really want to get the treble . "
" i think it was one of the best games that we played this season , " said van gaal .
" i told my players that it was important to win , but also how we won . "
a full-strength bayern team took the initiative from the opening minutes , and never let go of it .
despite coach thomas schaaf 's clear instructions for his bremen players to double up on in-form arjen robben , the winger was at the heart of his side 's best work in the first half .
tim wiese in the bremen goal was called on as early as the third minute , tipping a long-range robben effort over the bar .
the dutchman then found himself on the left , playing in ivica olic , who failed to find the net from not more than five yards .
olic was heavily involved in the opening goal though .
the croatian striker 's flick hit the hand of per mertesacker just inside the penalty and , although the big german defender could have known little about it from such close range , the referee pointed to the spot .
wiese guessed the right way , but robben 's penalty was hit hard and low and found the corner , to give bayern a 35th-minute lead .
the floodgates open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's torsten frings , right , was sent off at the 77th minute mertesacker was unlucky again for the second goal shortly after half-time .
his attempt to head clear deflected into the path of olic , who poked home a classic predator 's finish .
with bremen pushing up to try and get something back , ribery put the game to bed in the 63rd minute .
the frenchman was played through by mark van bommel and finished coolly , before sliding on the wet turf by the corner flag in memorable celebration .
former bayern midfielder frings was shown a second yellow with 15 minutes to go , catching bastian schweinsteiger late as bayern played keep-ball in the closing stages , and barely waiting to see the referee produce the red before he left the pitch .
schweinsteiger relinquished himself from a disciplined midfield role in the final minutes , taking philipp lahm 's lofted ball on the chest and volleying inside the far corner of the net for bayern 's fourth .
" the first half was great , in the second , we scored the goals , " said bayern striker thomas mueller .
" such a result is like a dream . "
closer to the treble the scoreline was harsh on werder bremen , who came into the game on the back of some fine late-season bundesliga form .
they could have taken the lead inside the first ten minutes , joerg butt in the bayern goal making an excellent double-save after claudio pizarro got in .
pizarro was too often isolated up front though , mesut oezil and aaron hunt failing to get the cup holders ' passing game going in very wet conditions in berlin .
" bayern dominated the game and i can only congratulate them , " admitted bremen coach schaaf .
bayern must wish they could play at the olympic stadium every day .
on two consecutive saturdays , captain van bommel has now lifted domestic silverware in the capital .
bayern wrapped up the domestic title with a 3-1 win over hertha berlin last weekend , and , with the dfb-pokal now secured , travel to madrid next weekend knowing that victory over internazionale would see them complete an unprecedented treble .
with seemingly no instructions to take it easy before next week 's game , bayern players celebrated hard after the final whistle .
" if we win something , we must celebrate , " said van gaal .

" according to the information available to us so far , google has for years penetrated private networks , apparently illegally , " aigner said in a statement on saturday .
the " alarming incident " showed that google still lacks understanding for the need for privacy , according to the statement .
privacy breach google 's fleet of street view cars , photographing streets for its online map program , has been collecting more data than previously thought .
after reviewing a system in the cars that recorded names and addresses of wireless networks detected along the routes , google revealed that a programming error had led to small amounts of personal data to be collected from unsecured wi-fi networks .
" it 's now clear that we have been mistakenly collecting samples of payload data from open wi-fi networks , " google 's head of engineering alan eustace said in a blog posting .
the blog post did not specify what kinds of personal data had been collected but indicated it could be things such as email and web browsing history .
however , since the data had been collected by moving vehicles , only fragments of information were recorded .
google regretted its mistake and would look for a way to destroy the personal data .
" maintaining people 's trust is crucial to everything we do , and in this case we fell short , " said eustace in the blog post .
google reviewed its data collection methods in response to an inquiry from the data protection authority in hamburg .
the google street view service allows users to " walk " along panoramic street views in many countries , using images recorded by specially-outfitted cars .
the fleet of cars around the world has been halted for the time being as google attempts to fix the glitch .

the " alarming incident " showed that google still lacks understanding for the need for privacy , according to the statement .
privacy breach google 's fleet of street view cars , photographing streets for its online map program , has been collecting more data than previously thought .
after reviewing a system in the cars that recorded names and addresses of wireless networks detected along the routes , google revealed that a programming error had led to small amounts of personal data to be collected from unsecured wi-fi networks .

the blog post did not specify what kinds of personal data had been collected but indicated it could be things such as email and web browsing history .
however , since the data had been collected by moving vehicles , only fragments of information were recorded .
google regretted its mistake and would look for a way to destroy the personal data .
" maintaining people 's trust is crucial to everything we do , and in this case we fell short , " said eustace in the blog post .

goals from arjen robben , ivica olic , franck ribery and bastian schweinsteiger allowed the bavarians to claim the second leg of a potential bundesliga , dfb-pokal and champions league treble .
although bayern were not at their free-flowing best , clinical second-half finishing from louis van gaal 's side saw them ease to a comfortable victory .
bremen , returning to berlin to defend the cup they won a year ago , had few answers to their opponents ' dominance , and the dismissal of their captain torsten frings was symptomatic of their frustration in the closing stages .
" the result was clearer than the game actually was .
we went 2-0 -lsb- ahead -rsb- at the perfect time , " bayern defender philipp lahm said after the game .
" we really want to get the treble . "
" i think it was one of the best games that we played this season , " said van gaal .
" i told my players that it was important to win , but also how we won . "
a full-strength bayern team took the initiative from the opening minutes , and never let go of it .
despite coach thomas schaaf 's clear instructions for his bremen players to double up on in-form arjen robben , the winger was at the heart of his side 's best work in the first half .
tim wiese in the bremen goal was called on as early as the third minute , tipping a long-range robben effort over the bar .
the dutchman then found himself on the left , playing in ivica olic , who failed to find the net from not more than five yards .
olic was heavily involved in the opening goal though .
the croatian striker 's flick hit the hand of per mertesacker just inside the penalty and , although the big german defender could have known little about it from such close range , the referee pointed to the spot .
wiese guessed the right way , but robben 's penalty was hit hard and low and found the corner , to give bayern a 35th-minute lead .
the floodgates open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's torsten frings , right , was sent off at the 77th minute mertesacker was unlucky again for the second goal shortly after half-time .
his attempt to head clear deflected into the path of olic , who poked home a classic predator 's finish .
with bremen pushing up to try and get something back , ribery put the game to bed in the 63rd minute .
the frenchman was played through by mark van bommel and finished coolly , before sliding on the wet turf by the corner flag in memorable celebration .
former bayern midfielder frings was shown a second yellow with 15 minutes to go , catching bastian schweinsteiger late as bayern played keep-ball in the closing stages , and barely waiting to see the referee produce the red before he left the pitch .
schweinsteiger relinquished himself from a disciplined midfield role in the final minutes , taking philipp lahm 's lofted ball on the chest and volleying inside the far corner of the net for bayern 's fourth .
" the first half was great , in the second , we scored the goals , " said bayern striker thomas mueller .
" such a result is like a dream . "
closer to the treble the scoreline was harsh on werder bremen , who came into the game on the back of some fine late-season bundesliga form .
they could have taken the lead inside the first ten minutes , joerg butt in the bayern goal making an excellent double-save after claudio pizarro got in .
pizarro was too often isolated up front though , mesut oezil and aaron hunt failing to get the cup holders ' passing game going in very wet conditions in berlin .
" bayern dominated the game and i can only congratulate them , " admitted bremen coach schaaf .
bayern must wish they could play at the olympic stadium every day .
on two consecutive saturdays , captain van bommel has now lifted domestic silverware in the capital .
bayern wrapped up the domestic title with a 3-1 win over hertha berlin last weekend , and , with the dfb-pokal now secured , travel to madrid next weekend knowing that victory over internazionale would see them complete an unprecedented treble .
with seemingly no instructions to take it easy before next week 's game , bayern players celebrated hard after the final whistle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.05.2010 german firms look for asian opportunities großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the asia-pacific conference of german business was held in singapore this week this year , asian economies are expected to grow by 7.5 percent and continue to grow over the next few years .
german businesses are capitalizing on that optimism in the asian market . although the financial crisis and problems with the euro are hanging over the economy in germany , there is a sense of optimism in asia . economies there are expecting several years of growth , and it is hoped this may boost german business , too .
more than 700 companies demonstrated their appetite for a slice of the asian market at this year 's asia-pacific conference for german business .
business opportunities in asia are nothing new - many german companies have been steadily investing in the region for decades .
martin brudermueller is a board member of chemical giant basf responsible for asia pacific .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basf is looking to build on opportunities in asia " it is very important that when operating in asia , most of the products are made on site , " said brudermueller .
" that 's why more than 60 percent of the products we sell here are also locally produced . "
although basf was founded in mannheim , they now have hundreds of production sites around the world , and around 50 of those are in asia .
basf said they are now concentrating on boosting their market share there .
" it should be kept in mind that of the 750-billion-euro -lrb- $ 931.9 billion -rrb- chemical market predicted for 2020 , 500 billion of that is in asia .
therefore , asia is the growth market for basf , " brudermueller said .
growth in troubled times basf is not the only german company to benefit from links to asian economies .
the precious metals and technology company heraeus can thank the region for an encouraging start to 2010 .
" business in america and europe is going backwards , as so many factories have closed down , " said heraeus ceo juergen heraeus .
the heraeus family business , which has its base in frankfurt , has now been in asia for 70 years .
over 40 percent of their production is based in the region .
" when the companies have customers in asia , it makes sense to expand business in asia - and here everything moves very quickly .
in one year here you can start up a factory and begin production , " heraeus added .
piracy problems while it may be quick to set up production in asia , this also means that counterfeiters can adapt and copy european products in no time at all .
technology theft is a big problem , and piracy is becoming an increasingly expensive issue to deal with .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german economic minister rainer bruederle attended the singapore conference michael schadlich , chairman of the german company dorma , says they are always on the lookout for pirated material .
" normally when this happens we shut down production , " he said .
" but we are fooling ourselves . "
" it 's a bit like lawn mowing : you mow the lawn on saturday but then one week later you need to do it all over again , " schadlich said .
attempts to combat piracy , despite costing companies thousands of euros , are considered a worthwhile investment .
piracy aside , german companies know they can do good business in asia .
the biggest winners are those firms who took their chances early with the asian market .
the others are still struggling to catch up .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basf is looking to build on opportunities in asia " it is very important that when operating in asia , most of the products are made on site , " said brudermueller .
" that 's why more than 60 percent of the products we sell here are also locally produced . "
although basf was founded in mannheim , they now have hundreds of production sites around the world , and around 50 of those are in asia .
basf said they are now concentrating on boosting their market share there .
" it should be kept in mind that of the 750-billion-euro -lrb- $ 931.9 billion -rrb- chemical market predicted for 2020 , 500 billion of that is in asia .
therefore , asia is the growth market for basf , " brudermueller said .

the precious metals and technology company heraeus can thank the region for an encouraging start to 2010 .
" business in america and europe is going backwards , as so many factories have closed down , " said heraeus ceo juergen heraeus .

over 40 percent of their production is based in the region .
" when the companies have customers in asia , it makes sense to expand business in asia - and here everything moves very quickly .
in one year here you can start up a factory and begin production , " heraeus added .
piracy problems while it may be quick to set up production in asia , this also means that counterfeiters can adapt and copy european products in no time at all .

goals from arjen robben , ivica olic , franck ribery and bastian schweinsteiger allowed the bavarians to claim the second leg of a potential bundesliga , dfb-pokal and champions league treble .
although bayern were not at their free-flowing best , clinical second-half finishing from louis van gaal 's side saw them ease to a comfortable victory .
bremen , returning to berlin to defend the cup they won a year ago , had few answers to their opponents ' dominance , and the dismissal of their captain torsten frings was symptomatic of their frustration in the closing stages .
" the result was clearer than the game actually was .
we went 2-0 -lsb- ahead -rsb- at the perfect time , " bayern defender philipp lahm said after the game .
" we really want to get the treble . "
" i think it was one of the best games that we played this season , " said van gaal .
" i told my players that it was important to win , but also how we won . "
a full-strength bayern team took the initiative from the opening minutes , and never let go of it .
despite coach thomas schaaf 's clear instructions for his bremen players to double up on in-form arjen robben , the winger was at the heart of his side 's best work in the first half .
tim wiese in the bremen goal was called on as early as the third minute , tipping a long-range robben effort over the bar .
the dutchman then found himself on the left , playing in ivica olic , who failed to find the net from not more than five yards .
olic was heavily involved in the opening goal though .
the croatian striker 's flick hit the hand of per mertesacker just inside the penalty and , although the big german defender could have known little about it from such close range , the referee pointed to the spot .
wiese guessed the right way , but robben 's penalty was hit hard and low and found the corner , to give bayern a 35th-minute lead .
the floodgates open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's torsten frings , right , was sent off at the 77th minute mertesacker was unlucky again for the second goal shortly after half-time .
his attempt to head clear deflected into the path of olic , who poked home a classic predator 's finish .
with bremen pushing up to try and get something back , ribery put the game to bed in the 63rd minute .
the frenchman was played through by mark van bommel and finished coolly , before sliding on the wet turf by the corner flag in memorable celebration .
former bayern midfielder frings was shown a second yellow with 15 minutes to go , catching bastian schweinsteiger late as bayern played keep-ball in the closing stages , and barely waiting to see the referee produce the red before he left the pitch .
schweinsteiger relinquished himself from a disciplined midfield role in the final minutes , taking philipp lahm 's lofted ball on the chest and volleying inside the far corner of the net for bayern 's fourth .
" the first half was great , in the second , we scored the goals , " said bayern striker thomas mueller .
" such a result is like a dream . "
closer to the treble the scoreline was harsh on werder bremen , who came into the game on the back of some fine late-season bundesliga form .
they could have taken the lead inside the first ten minutes , joerg butt in the bayern goal making an excellent double-save after claudio pizarro got in .
pizarro was too often isolated up front though , mesut oezil and aaron hunt failing to get the cup holders ' passing game going in very wet conditions in berlin .
" bayern dominated the game and i can only congratulate them , " admitted bremen coach schaaf .
bayern must wish they could play at the olympic stadium every day .
on two consecutive saturdays , captain van bommel has now lifted domestic silverware in the capital .
bayern wrapped up the domestic title with a 3-1 win over hertha berlin last weekend , and , with the dfb-pokal now secured , travel to madrid next weekend knowing that victory over internazionale would see them complete an unprecedented treble .
with seemingly no instructions to take it easy before next week 's game , bayern players celebrated hard after the final whistle .
" if we win something , we must celebrate , " said van gaal .

german businesses are capitalizing on that optimism in the asian market . although the financial crisis and problems with the euro are hanging over the economy in germany , there is a sense of optimism in asia . economies there are expecting several years of growth , and it is hoped this may boost german business , too .
more than 700 companies demonstrated their appetite for a slice of the asian market at this year 's asia-pacific conference for german business .
business opportunities in asia are nothing new - many german companies have been steadily investing in the region for decades .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basf is looking to build on opportunities in asia " it is very important that when operating in asia , most of the products are made on site , " said brudermueller .
" that 's why more than 60 percent of the products we sell here are also locally produced . "
although basf was founded in mannheim , they now have hundreds of production sites around the world , and around 50 of those are in asia .
basf said they are now concentrating on boosting their market share there .
" it should be kept in mind that of the 750-billion-euro -lrb- $ 931.9 billion -rrb- chemical market predicted for 2020 , 500 billion of that is in asia .
therefore , asia is the growth market for basf , " brudermueller said .

" when the companies have customers in asia , it makes sense to expand business in asia - and here everything moves very quickly .

the latest party in nantes even cost one 21-year-old man his life .
on the way home from the party , the man stumbled over a bridge and plunged five meters to the ground below .
he later died in the hospital from his injuries .

" this is a national problem , and it must be dealt with on that level . "

goals from arjen robben , ivica olic , franck ribery and bastian schweinsteiger allowed the bavarians to claim the second leg of a potential bundesliga , dfb-pokal and champions league treble .
although bayern were not at their free-flowing best , clinical second-half finishing from louis van gaal 's side saw them ease to a comfortable victory .
bremen , returning to berlin to defend the cup they won a year ago , had few answers to their opponents ' dominance , and the dismissal of their captain torsten frings was symptomatic of their frustration in the closing stages .
" the result was clearer than the game actually was .
we went 2-0 -lsb- ahead -rsb- at the perfect time , " bayern defender philipp lahm said after the game .
" we really want to get the treble . "
" i think it was one of the best games that we played this season , " said van gaal .
" i told my players that it was important to win , but also how we won . "
a full-strength bayern team took the initiative from the opening minutes , and never let go of it .
despite coach thomas schaaf 's clear instructions for his bremen players to double up on in-form arjen robben , the winger was at the heart of his side 's best work in the first half .
tim wiese in the bremen goal was called on as early as the third minute , tipping a long-range robben effort over the bar .
the dutchman then found himself on the left , playing in ivica olic , who failed to find the net from not more than five yards .
olic was heavily involved in the opening goal though .
the croatian striker 's flick hit the hand of per mertesacker just inside the penalty and , although the big german defender could have known little about it from such close range , the referee pointed to the spot .
wiese guessed the right way , but robben 's penalty was hit hard and low and found the corner , to give bayern a 35th-minute lead .
the floodgates open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's torsten frings , right , was sent off at the 77th minute mertesacker was unlucky again for the second goal shortly after half-time .
his attempt to head clear deflected into the path of olic , who poked home a classic predator 's finish .
with bremen pushing up to try and get something back , ribery put the game to bed in the 63rd minute .
the frenchman was played through by mark van bommel and finished coolly , before sliding on the wet turf by the corner flag in memorable celebration .
former bayern midfielder frings was shown a second yellow with 15 minutes to go , catching bastian schweinsteiger late as bayern played keep-ball in the closing stages , and barely waiting to see the referee produce the red before he left the pitch .
schweinsteiger relinquished himself from a disciplined midfield role in the final minutes , taking philipp lahm 's lofted ball on the chest and volleying inside the far corner of the net for bayern 's fourth .
" the first half was great , in the second , we scored the goals , " said bayern striker thomas mueller .
" such a result is like a dream . "
closer to the treble the scoreline was harsh on werder bremen , who came into the game on the back of some fine late-season bundesliga form .
they could have taken the lead inside the first ten minutes , joerg butt in the bayern goal making an excellent double-save after claudio pizarro got in .
pizarro was too often isolated up front though , mesut oezil and aaron hunt failing to get the cup holders ' passing game going in very wet conditions in berlin .
" bayern dominated the game and i can only congratulate them , " admitted bremen coach schaaf .
bayern must wish they could play at the olympic stadium every day .
on two consecutive saturdays , captain van bommel has now lifted domestic silverware in the capital .
bayern wrapped up the domestic title with a 3-1 win over hertha berlin last weekend , and , with the dfb-pokal now secured , travel to madrid next weekend knowing that victory over internazionale would see them complete an unprecedented treble .
with seemingly no instructions to take it easy before next week 's game , bayern players celebrated hard after the final whistle .
" if we win something , we must celebrate , " said van gaal .

" according to the information available to us so far , google has for years penetrated private networks , apparently illegally , " aigner said in a statement on saturday .
the " alarming incident " showed that google still lacks understanding for the need for privacy , according to the statement .
privacy breach google 's fleet of street view cars , photographing streets for its online map program , has been collecting more data than previously thought .
after reviewing a system in the cars that recorded names and addresses of wireless networks detected along the routes , google revealed that a programming error had led to small amounts of personal data to be collected from unsecured wi-fi networks .
" it 's now clear that we have been mistakenly collecting samples of payload data from open wi-fi networks , " google 's head of engineering alan eustace said in a blog posting .
the blog post did not specify what kinds of personal data had been collected but indicated it could be things such as email and web browsing history .
however , since the data had been collected by moving vehicles , only fragments of information were recorded .
google regretted its mistake and would look for a way to destroy the personal data .
" maintaining people 's trust is crucial to everything we do , and in this case we fell short , " said eustace in the blog post .
google reviewed its data collection methods in response to an inquiry from the data protection authority in hamburg .
the google street view service allows users to " walk " along panoramic street views in many countries , using images recorded by specially-outfitted cars .

" according to the information available to us so far , google has for years penetrated private networks , apparently illegally , " aigner said in a statement on saturday .
the " alarming incident " showed that google still lacks understanding for the need for privacy , according to the statement .
privacy breach google 's fleet of street view cars , photographing streets for its online map program , has been collecting more data than previously thought .
after reviewing a system in the cars that recorded names and addresses of wireless networks detected along the routes , google revealed that a programming error had led to small amounts of personal data to be collected from unsecured wi-fi networks .
" it 's now clear that we have been mistakenly collecting samples of payload data from open wi-fi networks , " google 's head of engineering alan eustace said in a blog posting .
the blog post did not specify what kinds of personal data had been collected but indicated it could be things such as email and web browsing history .
however , since the data had been collected by moving vehicles , only fragments of information were recorded .
google regretted its mistake and would look for a way to destroy the personal data .
" maintaining people 's trust is crucial to everything we do , and in this case we fell short , " said eustace in the blog post .
google reviewed its data collection methods in response to an inquiry from the data protection authority in hamburg .
the google street view service allows users to " walk " along panoramic street views in many countries , using images recorded by specially-outfitted cars .
the fleet of cars around the world has been halted for the time being as google attempts to fix the glitch .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 15.05.2010 polish prime minister calls for europe to become a closer union großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk won the charlemagne prize on thursday polish prime minister donald tusk has won the 2010 charlemagne prize in aachen .
in an interview with deutsche welle he spoke about the future of the eu , about integration , expansion and the bloc 's international role . polish prime minister donald tusk is the 2010 recipient of the charlemagne prize , an annual award that recognizes efforts in promoting european understanding .
tusk received the prize in aachen on may 13 , with the charlemagne judges praising him for steering poland away from nationalism and bringing the former soviet-bloc country into the heart of europe .
deutsche welle had a chance to speak with the prime minister about his vision for the future of the european union and the issues surrounding the bloc : integration , expansion of the eurozone , shared defense and its international presence .
deutsche welle : in the words of the judges , you are " a convinced and a convincing european . "
what is your vision of europe for europeans , and also its dealings with the rest of the world ?
donald tusk : for all those who understand the meaning of freedom , the meaning of human rights , the meaning of respect for tradition - for all those who have faith in themselves , in their own potential - europe is , first and foremost , the best model for europeans .
europe is understood as a union , the european union - but it is also a continuing dream and a continuing challenge .
sometimes , especially in the so-called old europe , i hear doubting voices , that europe is not proving itself ; that times of crisis have shown that the european union is not up to the challenges .
and we , the polish people , but also many other europeans , reply that it is precisely at such critical moments that the idea of europe , or the union of free people , who believe in their potential and in fundamental values , becomes the most attractive challenge .
and , as i have been repeating frequently over the last few weeks , the more difficult and painful our experiences , the more the doubting voices arise all around , the more we need to hold high the european flag , affirm the conviction that this is a phenomenal invention : the european family .
we must repeat this all the louder and raise the rallying cry all the higher .
bildunterschrift : the polish leader was praised for steering poland away from nationalism what should the model for the european union be ?
a europe of nation states , or the united states of europe ?
which should we aim for ?
i think that , very often , discussion about the future of europe is a discussion about banal , empty slogans .
a moment of historic reflection and common sense is enough to understand that nations will remain nations ; poles will feel polish .
and germans , german .
the french , french .
and so on .
this is as true about nations as it is about smaller ethnic groups .
we shall remain true to our religions .
we shall remain faithful to our customs , while at the same time being aware that europe needs to be an ever closer union ; it needs to think more effectively about its security , including energy security .
in the global world , a europe divided by conflicting interests and conflicting values does n't stand a chance .
but a europe that can rise above these differences while not negating them has a chance to become one of the key world powers , and that is our shared dream .
you say europe should be more integrated , and you talk about europe as a union of values and not merely a continent .
is further enlargement of the eu the way to steam ahead under the present circumstances ?
and , if so , should all the balkan countries and turkey become members of this united europe ?
the greatness of europe has also been based on the fact that europe has shown magnanimity and patience for those who wanted to participate – not in a mechanical , empty political union , but in a union which respects all these values , a union aware of what the foundations of europe are .
this is why i would direct the question about further enlargement of the european union equally to brussels , to the capitals of the european union , as well as to the candidate countries themselves .
right from the beginning , poland has been in favor of the process of the enlargement of the european union , without putting down any conditions of a political and organizational character .
these have , in any case , been included in the treaties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk and poland are set to take the eu presidency in just over a year nevertheless , we shall always be asking ourselves and other europeans , as well as those who want to join the union , do you share our system of values ?
do you want to participate in this union which takes responsibility for itself , where every person is ready to help another ?
and a union where solidarity or freedom are not mere empty slogans ?
we shall ask these questions also of the turks , ukrainians and all those who apply to become members .
but we have examples closer to home , in the sense of realistic possibilities , such as croatia or serbia .
and it appears that under no circumstances can europe become closed .
even , if for germany or for others , today 's experience of greece may be prompting us to think , let 's be careful with those who do n't live up to the crisis or who have not played by the book .
but is it really the case that the core european countries have always played by the book ?
is it really the case that some can point their finger and say , we are fit to be in -lsb- the union -rsb- , but you are not fit ?
everybody has to do their homework on this crisis , everybody , without any exceptions .
the eurozone is wobbly .
and even , possibly , falling apart at the seams .
although you are not obliged to , you want to help greece .
are you still keen for poland to join the common currency , to adopt the euro , as soon as possible ?
just as is the case for the european union , so it is for the eurozone : it should n't be a club for the countries which have joined , but then each one will do as it likes .
the eurozone can not afford for the grim experience of the recent months to be repeated ever again .
poland wants to become a member of the eurozone as soon as possible by fulfilling the criteria which have been agreed to by all .
today , we point our finger at the greeks or talk about possible problems for other mediterranean countries , but we all remember that even the most stable of the union 's members which also belong to the eurozone also have a case to answer when it comes to fulfilling the criteria and sticking to fiscal discipline .
in just over a year , poland will take over the presidency of the european union .
for six months , your hand will be at the helm of the eu .
what ideas will you be especially keen to ' sell ' to europe ?
what will matter to you the most ?
we live in the european union under the lisbon treaty .
this is not the time nor place to explain all the aspects of the treaty , and i am a sober and common-sense politician and i know well that the presidency is very important , but the european union has its powers that be .
poland has a positive role to play during its presidency , but my common sense prompts me to say that the decisions will not be mine to take .
i will be jointly responsible , and not the one who makes the decisions .
it has been just over a month since the death of president lech kaczynski and 95 outstanding poles .
it was a difficult time for poland , which also brought hope for a polish-russian reconciliation .
what can poland and russia , acting together , offer to europe ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent death of polish president lech kaczynski and many elites shook the country first of all , this greatest of tragedies that the world has seen , when it comes to the death toll of government elites , shook to the core our minds and our hearts .
a genuine sense of mourning was pervasive in poland .
but it did not shake the country .
everybody watched with admiration how poles and the polish nation coped with the turn of events .
and we are really trying to draw positive conclusions for the future from this tragedy .
also political ones .
also regarding improving relations between poland and russia , because they are the key to good relations between europe and russia .
such were my aims also before the catastrophe , but both my aims and the efforts of the russian leaders , which i appreciate , have acquired a sense of urgency precisely due to the catastrophe .
therefore , if this is to be the legacy of those who died in the crash near smolensk , then maybe the most important thing is that this legacy becomes a positive factor in furthering understanding - rather than conflicts - between nations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 15.05.2010 moldovan wine exports cover 15 percent of country 's budget großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cricova is a brand of wine mostly known in eastern europe moldova was once a major wine producer for the soviet union .
today , it still relies heavily on russia as an export market for its wine and sparkling wine .
but lately moldovan vintners have been seeking new markets . moldova is a small country and one of europe 's poorest .
however , few western europeans realize the country is a significant producer of wine , supplying a large portion of the wine consumed in russia .
some 15 kilometers outside of moldova 's capital of chisinau is the town of cricova , home to a state-run winery big enough to produce 15 percent of country 's annual national budget .
the cricova winery was founded by soviet authorities during the 1950s ; it produced one of the eastern bloc 's most famous brands of wine and sparkling wine .

in an interview with deutsche welle he spoke about the future of the eu , about integration , expansion and the bloc 's international role . polish prime minister donald tusk is the 2010 recipient of the charlemagne prize , an annual award that recognizes efforts in promoting european understanding .
tusk received the prize in aachen on may 13 , with the charlemagne judges praising him for steering poland away from nationalism and bringing the former soviet-bloc country into the heart of europe .
deutsche welle had a chance to speak with the prime minister about his vision for the future of the european union and the issues surrounding the bloc : integration , expansion of the eurozone , shared defense and its international presence .
deutsche welle : in the words of the judges , you are " a convinced and a convincing european . "
what is your vision of europe for europeans , and also its dealings with the rest of the world ?
donald tusk : for all those who understand the meaning of freedom , the meaning of human rights , the meaning of respect for tradition - for all those who have faith in themselves , in their own potential - europe is , first and foremost , the best model for europeans .
europe is understood as a union , the european union - but it is also a continuing dream and a continuing challenge .
sometimes , especially in the so-called old europe , i hear doubting voices , that europe is not proving itself ; that times of crisis have shown that the european union is not up to the challenges .
and we , the polish people , but also many other europeans , reply that it is precisely at such critical moments that the idea of europe , or the union of free people , who believe in their potential and in fundamental values , becomes the most attractive challenge .
and , as i have been repeating frequently over the last few weeks , the more difficult and painful our experiences , the more the doubting voices arise all around , the more we need to hold high the european flag , affirm the conviction that this is a phenomenal invention : the european family .
we must repeat this all the louder and raise the rallying cry all the higher .
bildunterschrift : the polish leader was praised for steering poland away from nationalism what should the model for the european union be ?
a europe of nation states , or the united states of europe ?
which should we aim for ?
i think that , very often , discussion about the future of europe is a discussion about banal , empty slogans .
a moment of historic reflection and common sense is enough to understand that nations will remain nations ; poles will feel polish .
and germans , german .
the french , french .
and so on .
this is as true about nations as it is about smaller ethnic groups .
we shall remain true to our religions .
we shall remain faithful to our customs , while at the same time being aware that europe needs to be an ever closer union ; it needs to think more effectively about its security , including energy security .
in the global world , a europe divided by conflicting interests and conflicting values does n't stand a chance .
but a europe that can rise above these differences while not negating them has a chance to become one of the key world powers , and that is our shared dream .
you say europe should be more integrated , and you talk about europe as a union of values and not merely a continent .
is further enlargement of the eu the way to steam ahead under the present circumstances ?
and , if so , should all the balkan countries and turkey become members of this united europe ?
the greatness of europe has also been based on the fact that europe has shown magnanimity and patience for those who wanted to participate – not in a mechanical , empty political union , but in a union which respects all these values , a union aware of what the foundations of europe are .
this is why i would direct the question about further enlargement of the european union equally to brussels , to the capitals of the european union , as well as to the candidate countries themselves .
right from the beginning , poland has been in favor of the process of the enlargement of the european union , without putting down any conditions of a political and organizational character .
these have , in any case , been included in the treaties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk and poland are set to take the eu presidency in just over a year nevertheless , we shall always be asking ourselves and other europeans , as well as those who want to join the union , do you share our system of values ?
do you want to participate in this union which takes responsibility for itself , where every person is ready to help another ?
and a union where solidarity or freedom are not mere empty slogans ?
we shall ask these questions also of the turks , ukrainians and all those who apply to become members .
but we have examples closer to home , in the sense of realistic possibilities , such as croatia or serbia .
and it appears that under no circumstances can europe become closed .
even , if for germany or for others , today 's experience of greece may be prompting us to think , let 's be careful with those who do n't live up to the crisis or who have not played by the book .
but is it really the case that the core european countries have always played by the book ?
is it really the case that some can point their finger and say , we are fit to be in -lsb- the union -rsb- , but you are not fit ?
everybody has to do their homework on this crisis , everybody , without any exceptions .
the eurozone is wobbly .
and even , possibly , falling apart at the seams .
although you are not obliged to , you want to help greece .
are you still keen for poland to join the common currency , to adopt the euro , as soon as possible ?
just as is the case for the european union , so it is for the eurozone : it should n't be a club for the countries which have joined , but then each one will do as it likes .
the eurozone can not afford for the grim experience of the recent months to be repeated ever again .
poland wants to become a member of the eurozone as soon as possible by fulfilling the criteria which have been agreed to by all .
today , we point our finger at the greeks or talk about possible problems for other mediterranean countries , but we all remember that even the most stable of the union 's members which also belong to the eurozone also have a case to answer when it comes to fulfilling the criteria and sticking to fiscal discipline .
in just over a year , poland will take over the presidency of the european union .
for six months , your hand will be at the helm of the eu .
what ideas will you be especially keen to ' sell ' to europe ?
what will matter to you the most ?
we live in the european union under the lisbon treaty .
this is not the time nor place to explain all the aspects of the treaty , and i am a sober and common-sense politician and i know well that the presidency is very important , but the european union has its powers that be .
poland has a positive role to play during its presidency , but my common sense prompts me to say that the decisions will not be mine to take .
i will be jointly responsible , and not the one who makes the decisions .
it has been just over a month since the death of president lech kaczynski and 95 outstanding poles .
it was a difficult time for poland , which also brought hope for a polish-russian reconciliation .
what can poland and russia , acting together , offer to europe ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent death of polish president lech kaczynski and many elites shook the country first of all , this greatest of tragedies that the world has seen , when it comes to the death toll of government elites , shook to the core our minds and our hearts .
a genuine sense of mourning was pervasive in poland .
but it did not shake the country .
everybody watched with admiration how poles and the polish nation coped with the turn of events .
and we are really trying to draw positive conclusions for the future from this tragedy .
also political ones .
also regarding improving relations between poland and russia , because they are the key to good relations between europe and russia .
such were my aims also before the catastrophe , but both my aims and the efforts of the russian leaders , which i appreciate , have acquired a sense of urgency precisely due to the catastrophe .
therefore , if this is to be the legacy of those who died in the crash near smolensk , then maybe the most important thing is that this legacy becomes a positive factor in furthering understanding - rather than conflicts - between nations .

" moldova does have some great wines and , honestly , i prefer a moldovan wine for 5 euros per bottle to a french wine of the same price range , ” drobis told deutsche welle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 15.05.2010 moldovan wine exports cover 15 percent of country 's budget großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cricova is a brand of wine mostly known in eastern europe moldova was once a major wine producer for the soviet union .
today , it still relies heavily on russia as an export market for its wine and sparkling wine .
but lately moldovan vintners have been seeking new markets . moldova is a small country and one of europe 's poorest .
however , few western europeans realize the country is a significant producer of wine , supplying a large portion of the wine consumed in russia .
some 15 kilometers outside of moldova 's capital of chisinau is the town of cricova , home to a state-run winery big enough to produce 15 percent of country 's annual national budget .
the cricova winery was founded by soviet authorities during the 1950s ; it produced one of the eastern bloc 's most famous brands of wine and sparkling wine .
today cricova wine is sold in 28 countries around the world , but most exports go straight to russia .
in 2005 , 85 percent of moldovan wine was exported , and 90 percent of that went to russia .
vulnerable export market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldova 's national wine collection is stored in part of an active mine moldova 's dependence on exporting into the russian wine market , however , has left the country vulnerable to bullying by its enormous neighbor .
for instance , it received an economic blow in march 2006 when russia imposed an embargo on moldovan wines lasting until the end of 2007 .
while russian authorities said low-quality wine posed a threat to russian consumers , observers did n't rule out that moldova 's political turn to the west may have also played a role .
industry flagships like cricova were n't directly accused of poor quality , but they did suffer under the embargo and were forced to look for new export markets .
vadim drobis , a moscow-based expert on the alcohol industry , said doing so successfully means overcoming the preconceived notions of many consumers .

in an interview with deutsche welle he spoke about the future of the eu , about integration , expansion and the bloc 's international role . polish prime minister donald tusk is the 2010 recipient of the charlemagne prize , an annual award that recognizes efforts in promoting european understanding .
tusk received the prize in aachen on may 13 , with the charlemagne judges praising him for steering poland away from nationalism and bringing the former soviet-bloc country into the heart of europe .
deutsche welle had a chance to speak with the prime minister about his vision for the future of the european union and the issues surrounding the bloc : integration , expansion of the eurozone , shared defense and its international presence .
deutsche welle : in the words of the judges , you are " a convinced and a convincing european . "
what is your vision of europe for europeans , and also its dealings with the rest of the world ?
donald tusk : for all those who understand the meaning of freedom , the meaning of human rights , the meaning of respect for tradition - for all those who have faith in themselves , in their own potential - europe is , first and foremost , the best model for europeans .
europe is understood as a union , the european union - but it is also a continuing dream and a continuing challenge .
sometimes , especially in the so-called old europe , i hear doubting voices , that europe is not proving itself ; that times of crisis have shown that the european union is not up to the challenges .
and we , the polish people , but also many other europeans , reply that it is precisely at such critical moments that the idea of europe , or the union of free people , who believe in their potential and in fundamental values , becomes the most attractive challenge .
and , as i have been repeating frequently over the last few weeks , the more difficult and painful our experiences , the more the doubting voices arise all around , the more we need to hold high the european flag , affirm the conviction that this is a phenomenal invention : the european family .
we must repeat this all the louder and raise the rallying cry all the higher .
bildunterschrift : the polish leader was praised for steering poland away from nationalism what should the model for the european union be ?
a europe of nation states , or the united states of europe ?
which should we aim for ?
i think that , very often , discussion about the future of europe is a discussion about banal , empty slogans .
a moment of historic reflection and common sense is enough to understand that nations will remain nations ; poles will feel polish .
and germans , german .
the french , french .
and so on .
this is as true about nations as it is about smaller ethnic groups .
we shall remain true to our religions .
we shall remain faithful to our customs , while at the same time being aware that europe needs to be an ever closer union ; it needs to think more effectively about its security , including energy security .
in the global world , a europe divided by conflicting interests and conflicting values does n't stand a chance .
but a europe that can rise above these differences while not negating them has a chance to become one of the key world powers , and that is our shared dream .
you say europe should be more integrated , and you talk about europe as a union of values and not merely a continent .
is further enlargement of the eu the way to steam ahead under the present circumstances ?
and , if so , should all the balkan countries and turkey become members of this united europe ?
the greatness of europe has also been based on the fact that europe has shown magnanimity and patience for those who wanted to participate – not in a mechanical , empty political union , but in a union which respects all these values , a union aware of what the foundations of europe are .
this is why i would direct the question about further enlargement of the european union equally to brussels , to the capitals of the european union , as well as to the candidate countries themselves .
right from the beginning , poland has been in favor of the process of the enlargement of the european union , without putting down any conditions of a political and organizational character .
these have , in any case , been included in the treaties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk and poland are set to take the eu presidency in just over a year nevertheless , we shall always be asking ourselves and other europeans , as well as those who want to join the union , do you share our system of values ?
do you want to participate in this union which takes responsibility for itself , where every person is ready to help another ?
and a union where solidarity or freedom are not mere empty slogans ?
we shall ask these questions also of the turks , ukrainians and all those who apply to become members .
but we have examples closer to home , in the sense of realistic possibilities , such as croatia or serbia .
and it appears that under no circumstances can europe become closed .
even , if for germany or for others , today 's experience of greece may be prompting us to think , let 's be careful with those who do n't live up to the crisis or who have not played by the book .
but is it really the case that the core european countries have always played by the book ?
is it really the case that some can point their finger and say , we are fit to be in -lsb- the union -rsb- , but you are not fit ?
everybody has to do their homework on this crisis , everybody , without any exceptions .
the eurozone is wobbly .
and even , possibly , falling apart at the seams .
although you are not obliged to , you want to help greece .
are you still keen for poland to join the common currency , to adopt the euro , as soon as possible ?
just as is the case for the european union , so it is for the eurozone : it should n't be a club for the countries which have joined , but then each one will do as it likes .
the eurozone can not afford for the grim experience of the recent months to be repeated ever again .
poland wants to become a member of the eurozone as soon as possible by fulfilling the criteria which have been agreed to by all .
today , we point our finger at the greeks or talk about possible problems for other mediterranean countries , but we all remember that even the most stable of the union 's members which also belong to the eurozone also have a case to answer when it comes to fulfilling the criteria and sticking to fiscal discipline .
in just over a year , poland will take over the presidency of the european union .
for six months , your hand will be at the helm of the eu .
what ideas will you be especially keen to ' sell ' to europe ?
what will matter to you the most ?
we live in the european union under the lisbon treaty .
this is not the time nor place to explain all the aspects of the treaty , and i am a sober and common-sense politician and i know well that the presidency is very important , but the european union has its powers that be .
poland has a positive role to play during its presidency , but my common sense prompts me to say that the decisions will not be mine to take .
i will be jointly responsible , and not the one who makes the decisions .
it has been just over a month since the death of president lech kaczynski and 95 outstanding poles .
it was a difficult time for poland , which also brought hope for a polish-russian reconciliation .
what can poland and russia , acting together , offer to europe ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent death of polish president lech kaczynski and many elites shook the country first of all , this greatest of tragedies that the world has seen , when it comes to the death toll of government elites , shook to the core our minds and our hearts .
a genuine sense of mourning was pervasive in poland .
but it did not shake the country .
everybody watched with admiration how poles and the polish nation coped with the turn of events .
and we are really trying to draw positive conclusions for the future from this tragedy .
also political ones .
also regarding improving relations between poland and russia , because they are the key to good relations between europe and russia .
such were my aims also before the catastrophe , but both my aims and the efforts of the russian leaders , which i appreciate , have acquired a sense of urgency precisely due to the catastrophe .
therefore , if this is to be the legacy of those who died in the crash near smolensk , then maybe the most important thing is that this legacy becomes a positive factor in furthering understanding - rather than conflicts - between nations .

today , it still relies heavily on russia as an export market for its wine and sparkling wine .
but lately moldovan vintners have been seeking new markets . moldova is a small country and one of europe 's poorest .
however , few western europeans realize the country is a significant producer of wine , supplying a large portion of the wine consumed in russia .
some 15 kilometers outside of moldova 's capital of chisinau is the town of cricova , home to a state-run winery big enough to produce 15 percent of country 's annual national budget .
the cricova winery was founded by soviet authorities during the 1950s ; it produced one of the eastern bloc 's most famous brands of wine and sparkling wine .
today cricova wine is sold in 28 countries around the world , but most exports go straight to russia .
in 2005 , 85 percent of moldovan wine was exported , and 90 percent of that went to russia .
vulnerable export market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldova 's national wine collection is stored in part of an active mine moldova 's dependence on exporting into the russian wine market , however , has left the country vulnerable to bullying by its enormous neighbor .
for instance , it received an economic blow in march 2006 when russia imposed an embargo on moldovan wines lasting until the end of 2007 .
while russian authorities said low-quality wine posed a threat to russian consumers , observers did n't rule out that moldova 's political turn to the west may have also played a role .
industry flagships like cricova were n't directly accused of poor quality , but they did suffer under the embargo and were forced to look for new export markets .
vadim drobis , a moscow-based expert on the alcohol industry , said doing so successfully means overcoming the preconceived notions of many consumers .
" moldova does have some great wines and , honestly , i prefer a moldovan wine for 5 euros per bottle to a french wine of the same price range , ” drobis told deutsche welle .
“ but western wine drinkers have their own mentality , and i do n't think i will live to see day when moldovan wine becomes widely popular in europe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi hermann goering 's former wine collection is stored in cricova massive national collection but moldovan vintners do have some public relations inroads to the western world .
the country 's national wine collection at cricova is a powerful promotional tool .
the collection of more than 1.5 million bottles is housed in a maze of tunnels , which are part of a still-functioning mine .
the mine is 120 kilometers long , with 60 kilometers used for wine storage .
its interior temperatures remain a constant 10 to 12 degrees , and air humidity stays between 97 and 98 percent .
californian blake malatester recently visited moldova for the first time with his wife , who is from the country .
" i tasted cricova the moment i got off the plane , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ it was a bottle of champagne , and i immediately fell in love with it … i deal with wines back home , so i really wanted to see for myself what the big talk is about , what the jewel of moldova is . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 15.05.2010 polish prime minister calls for europe to become a closer union großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk won the charlemagne prize on thursday polish prime minister donald tusk has won the 2010 charlemagne prize in aachen .
in an interview with deutsche welle he spoke about the future of the eu , about integration , expansion and the bloc 's international role . polish prime minister donald tusk is the 2010 recipient of the charlemagne prize , an annual award that recognizes efforts in promoting european understanding .
tusk received the prize in aachen on may 13 , with the charlemagne judges praising him for steering poland away from nationalism and bringing the former soviet-bloc country into the heart of europe .
deutsche welle had a chance to speak with the prime minister about his vision for the future of the european union and the issues surrounding the bloc : integration , expansion of the eurozone , shared defense and its international presence .
deutsche welle : in the words of the judges , you are " a convinced and a convincing european . "
what is your vision of europe for europeans , and also its dealings with the rest of the world ?
donald tusk : for all those who understand the meaning of freedom , the meaning of human rights , the meaning of respect for tradition - for all those who have faith in themselves , in their own potential - europe is , first and foremost , the best model for europeans .
europe is understood as a union , the european union - but it is also a continuing dream and a continuing challenge .
sometimes , especially in the so-called old europe , i hear doubting voices , that europe is not proving itself ; that times of crisis have shown that the european union is not up to the challenges .
and we , the polish people , but also many other europeans , reply that it is precisely at such critical moments that the idea of europe , or the union of free people , who believe in their potential and in fundamental values , becomes the most attractive challenge .
and , as i have been repeating frequently over the last few weeks , the more difficult and painful our experiences , the more the doubting voices arise all around , the more we need to hold high the european flag , affirm the conviction that this is a phenomenal invention : the european family .
we must repeat this all the louder and raise the rallying cry all the higher .
bildunterschrift : the polish leader was praised for steering poland away from nationalism what should the model for the european union be ?
a europe of nation states , or the united states of europe ?
which should we aim for ?
i think that , very often , discussion about the future of europe is a discussion about banal , empty slogans .
a moment of historic reflection and common sense is enough to understand that nations will remain nations ; poles will feel polish .
and germans , german .
the french , french .
and so on .
this is as true about nations as it is about smaller ethnic groups .
we shall remain true to our religions .
we shall remain faithful to our customs , while at the same time being aware that europe needs to be an ever closer union ; it needs to think more effectively about its security , including energy security .
in the global world , a europe divided by conflicting interests and conflicting values does n't stand a chance .
but a europe that can rise above these differences while not negating them has a chance to become one of the key world powers , and that is our shared dream .
you say europe should be more integrated , and you talk about europe as a union of values and not merely a continent .
is further enlargement of the eu the way to steam ahead under the present circumstances ?
and , if so , should all the balkan countries and turkey become members of this united europe ?
the greatness of europe has also been based on the fact that europe has shown magnanimity and patience for those who wanted to participate – not in a mechanical , empty political union , but in a union which respects all these values , a union aware of what the foundations of europe are .
this is why i would direct the question about further enlargement of the european union equally to brussels , to the capitals of the european union , as well as to the candidate countries themselves .
right from the beginning , poland has been in favor of the process of the enlargement of the european union , without putting down any conditions of a political and organizational character .
these have , in any case , been included in the treaties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk and poland are set to take the eu presidency in just over a year nevertheless , we shall always be asking ourselves and other europeans , as well as those who want to join the union , do you share our system of values ?
do you want to participate in this union which takes responsibility for itself , where every person is ready to help another ?
and a union where solidarity or freedom are not mere empty slogans ?
we shall ask these questions also of the turks , ukrainians and all those who apply to become members .
but we have examples closer to home , in the sense of realistic possibilities , such as croatia or serbia .
and it appears that under no circumstances can europe become closed .
even , if for germany or for others , today 's experience of greece may be prompting us to think , let 's be careful with those who do n't live up to the crisis or who have not played by the book .
but is it really the case that the core european countries have always played by the book ?
is it really the case that some can point their finger and say , we are fit to be in -lsb- the union -rsb- , but you are not fit ?
everybody has to do their homework on this crisis , everybody , without any exceptions .
the eurozone is wobbly .
and even , possibly , falling apart at the seams .
although you are not obliged to , you want to help greece .
are you still keen for poland to join the common currency , to adopt the euro , as soon as possible ?
just as is the case for the european union , so it is for the eurozone : it should n't be a club for the countries which have joined , but then each one will do as it likes .
the eurozone can not afford for the grim experience of the recent months to be repeated ever again .
poland wants to become a member of the eurozone as soon as possible by fulfilling the criteria which have been agreed to by all .
today , we point our finger at the greeks or talk about possible problems for other mediterranean countries , but we all remember that even the most stable of the union 's members which also belong to the eurozone also have a case to answer when it comes to fulfilling the criteria and sticking to fiscal discipline .
in just over a year , poland will take over the presidency of the european union .
for six months , your hand will be at the helm of the eu .
what ideas will you be especially keen to ' sell ' to europe ?
what will matter to you the most ?
we live in the european union under the lisbon treaty .
this is not the time nor place to explain all the aspects of the treaty , and i am a sober and common-sense politician and i know well that the presidency is very important , but the european union has its powers that be .
poland has a positive role to play during its presidency , but my common sense prompts me to say that the decisions will not be mine to take .
i will be jointly responsible , and not the one who makes the decisions .
it has been just over a month since the death of president lech kaczynski and 95 outstanding poles .
it was a difficult time for poland , which also brought hope for a polish-russian reconciliation .
what can poland and russia , acting together , offer to europe ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent death of polish president lech kaczynski and many elites shook the country first of all , this greatest of tragedies that the world has seen , when it comes to the death toll of government elites , shook to the core our minds and our hearts .
a genuine sense of mourning was pervasive in poland .
but it did not shake the country .
everybody watched with admiration how poles and the polish nation coped with the turn of events .
and we are really trying to draw positive conclusions for the future from this tragedy .
also political ones .
also regarding improving relations between poland and russia , because they are the key to good relations between europe and russia .
such were my aims also before the catastrophe , but both my aims and the efforts of the russian leaders , which i appreciate , have acquired a sense of urgency precisely due to the catastrophe .
therefore , if this is to be the legacy of those who died in the crash near smolensk , then maybe the most important thing is that this legacy becomes a positive factor in furthering understanding - rather than conflicts - between nations .

the eurozone is wobbly .
and even , possibly , falling apart at the seams .
although you are not obliged to , you want to help greece .
are you still keen for poland to join the common currency , to adopt the euro , as soon as possible ?
just as is the case for the european union , so it is for the eurozone : it should n't be a club for the countries which have joined , but then each one will do as it likes .
the eurozone can not afford for the grim experience of the recent months to be repeated ever again .
poland wants to become a member of the eurozone as soon as possible by fulfilling the criteria which have been agreed to by all .
today , we point our finger at the greeks or talk about possible problems for other mediterranean countries , but we all remember that even the most stable of the union 's members which also belong to the eurozone also have a case to answer when it comes to fulfilling the criteria and sticking to fiscal discipline .
in just over a year , poland will take over the presidency of the european union .
for six months , your hand will be at the helm of the eu .
what ideas will you be especially keen to ' sell ' to europe ?
what will matter to you the most ?
we live in the european union under the lisbon treaty .
this is not the time nor place to explain all the aspects of the treaty , and i am a sober and common-sense politician and i know well that the presidency is very important , but the european union has its powers that be .
poland has a positive role to play during its presidency , but my common sense prompts me to say that the decisions will not be mine to take .
i will be jointly responsible , and not the one who makes the decisions .
it has been just over a month since the death of president lech kaczynski and 95 outstanding poles .
it was a difficult time for poland , which also brought hope for a polish-russian reconciliation .
what can poland and russia , acting together , offer to europe ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent death of polish president lech kaczynski and many elites shook the country first of all , this greatest of tragedies that the world has seen , when it comes to the death toll of government elites , shook to the core our minds and our hearts .
a genuine sense of mourning was pervasive in poland .
but it did not shake the country .
everybody watched with admiration how poles and the polish nation coped with the turn of events .
and we are really trying to draw positive conclusions for the future from this tragedy .
also political ones .
also regarding improving relations between poland and russia , because they are the key to good relations between europe and russia .
such were my aims also before the catastrophe , but both my aims and the efforts of the russian leaders , which i appreciate , have acquired a sense of urgency precisely due to the catastrophe .
therefore , if this is to be the legacy of those who died in the crash near smolensk , then maybe the most important thing is that this legacy becomes a positive factor in furthering understanding - rather than conflicts - between nations .

the group of experts tasked with drafting the paper must tackle not only a changed security environment , but also different threat perceptions . it is merely 11 years , but in terms of the geopolitical developments that have occurred since nato last adapted its strategic concept , it was a different era .
while the cold war had come to an end with the fall of the berlin wall a decade earlier , it was still largely unclear what global trends and events would shape the next era .
the attacks of september 11 in 2001 brutally ended this interval , launching an era where islamic terrorism , asymetric threats , counterinsurgency warfare and failing states quickly became the new currency in the international debate on global security .
nato has repeatedly discussed what the changed geopolitcal landscape means for the venerable institution .
but it has n't - until now - framed and formalized the allliance 's response to these challenges in a revised doctrine .
to do just that , to develop a new strategic concept , was the task given to former us secretary of state madeleine albright and a group of international experts .
and it is n't just the world that has changed since nato 's last concept introduced in 1999 .
nato has changed itself , explains latvia 's foreign minister aivis ronis , who was part of the expert group until he resigned in early may after accepting the post as his country 's top diplomat .
new members " since many central and eastern european states , including the baltic countries , have joined nato in 2004 and of course have not participated in drafting the strategic concept of 1999 , for the first time in these open seminars and conferences central and eastern europeans could contribute to the common vision of nato and the transatlantic community regarding security , threats and challenges and global changes , " says ronis .
" this is an historic experience for the central and eastern european countries and especially for the baltic states . "
due to their recent history with and proximity to russia , many of these newer countries have a different view of nato 's main priorities than some of the alliance 's older and larger members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's new members bring new perspectives to the alliance " the strategy will have to cope with fears which exist in eastern europe primarily with regard to russia , i.e. article 5 -lrb- collective defense - ed . -rrb- , " says fred tanner , director of the geneva center for security policy , who served as a rapporteur on one of the seminars held by the group of experts .
" on the other hand of course you have other countries like france or the uk who have more of an interest to use nato together with the us outside of nato . "
the experts agree that , as latvia 's foreign minister puts it , there needs to be a synergy of territorial defense and the promotion of stability security outside of nato 's traditional realm of influence .
new and old threats but , karl kaiser , director of the program on transatlantic relations at the weatherhead center for international affairs at harvard university , argues that collective defense as laid out in article 5 of the nato treaty ca n't be the alliance 's raison d 'etre . " article 5 should not dissappear , " says kaiser who testified before the group of experts last year .
" of course if a country gets attacked , the others have to come to its assistance , but that is not the main reason for the alliance today .
the main reason is elsewhere .
so we have to reconcile the two , we have to have both , but we should n't put article 5 at the top anymore and do , as some of these countries want , exercizes looking at the potential of russian aggression . "
the underlying dilemma for nato and the group of experts is the lack of a common threat perception within the new , larger alliance .
and this threat assessment gap does n't just exist between newer and older members , it is also evident between european members and the us .
while the us wants nato to focus much more on counter-terrorism efforts outside nato territory , many european members are deeply skeptical about such a global military role as exemplified by the debate over the afghanistan mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group of experts visited moscow to engage russia as well flexibility needed for nato and the group of experts , this means the new concept must try and square the circle .
" the strategy will have to be flexible , " says tanner .
it will have to take into account different threat perceptions and various contingencies , both inside nato 's traditional transatlantic realm of influence and beyond .
to do just that , to ensure that nato can act in classical military fashion against an outside aggressor and at the same time can engage in counter-terrorism activities and state-building measures in asia or africa could be easier on paper than in practice .
especially in times of tight budgets and with nato members like greece on the brink of financial collapse .
despite these steep challenges , nato is indispensable , argue the experts .
" nato is needed for the security of our people , defending our democracy and promoting peace and stability in this very unpredictable , very uncertain and very complex world , " says ronis .
" nato 's big advantage today is that it has the ability to act in a robust environment , " argues tanner .
" it can use force if necessary .
and it is actually the only organization which has this capability with a certain projection of power . "
to harness that unique power , a convincing new strategy laid out by the panel of experts would be a good start , says kaiser : " it should n't be too long , it should n't be some bland lowest common denominator , but be sharp in defining the threats to modern society and what modern societies have to do in order to deal with these new threats .

the group of experts tasked with drafting the paper must tackle not only a changed security environment , but also different threat perceptions . it is merely 11 years , but in terms of the geopolitical developments that have occurred since nato last adapted its strategic concept , it was a different era .
while the cold war had come to an end with the fall of the berlin wall a decade earlier , it was still largely unclear what global trends and events would shape the next era .
the attacks of september 11 in 2001 brutally ended this interval , launching an era where islamic terrorism , asymetric threats , counterinsurgency warfare and failing states quickly became the new currency in the international debate on global security .
nato has repeatedly discussed what the changed geopolitcal landscape means for the venerable institution .
but it has n't - until now - framed and formalized the allliance 's response to these challenges in a revised doctrine .
to do just that , to develop a new strategic concept , was the task given to former us secretary of state madeleine albright and a group of international experts .
and it is n't just the world that has changed since nato 's last concept introduced in 1999 .
nato has changed itself , explains latvia 's foreign minister aivis ronis , who was part of the expert group until he resigned in early may after accepting the post as his country 's top diplomat .
new members " since many central and eastern european states , including the baltic countries , have joined nato in 2004 and of course have not participated in drafting the strategic concept of 1999 , for the first time in these open seminars and conferences central and eastern europeans could contribute to the common vision of nato and the transatlantic community regarding security , threats and challenges and global changes , " says ronis .
" this is an historic experience for the central and eastern european countries and especially for the baltic states . "
due to their recent history with and proximity to russia , many of these newer countries have a different view of nato 's main priorities than some of the alliance 's older and larger members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's new members bring new perspectives to the alliance " the strategy will have to cope with fears which exist in eastern europe primarily with regard to russia , i.e. article 5 -lrb- collective defense - ed . -rrb- , " says fred tanner , director of the geneva center for security policy , who served as a rapporteur on one of the seminars held by the group of experts .
" on the other hand of course you have other countries like france or the uk who have more of an interest to use nato together with the us outside of nato . "
the experts agree that , as latvia 's foreign minister puts it , there needs to be a synergy of territorial defense and the promotion of stability security outside of nato 's traditional realm of influence .
new and old threats but , karl kaiser , director of the program on transatlantic relations at the weatherhead center for international affairs at harvard university , argues that collective defense as laid out in article 5 of the nato treaty ca n't be the alliance 's raison d 'etre . " article 5 should not dissappear , " says kaiser who testified before the group of experts last year .
" of course if a country gets attacked , the others have to come to its assistance , but that is not the main reason for the alliance today .
the main reason is elsewhere .
so we have to reconcile the two , we have to have both , but we should n't put article 5 at the top anymore and do , as some of these countries want , exercizes looking at the potential of russian aggression . "
the underlying dilemma for nato and the group of experts is the lack of a common threat perception within the new , larger alliance .
and this threat assessment gap does n't just exist between newer and older members , it is also evident between european members and the us .
while the us wants nato to focus much more on counter-terrorism efforts outside nato territory , many european members are deeply skeptical about such a global military role as exemplified by the debate over the afghanistan mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group of experts visited moscow to engage russia as well flexibility needed for nato and the group of experts , this means the new concept must try and square the circle .
" the strategy will have to be flexible , " says tanner .
it will have to take into account different threat perceptions and various contingencies , both inside nato 's traditional transatlantic realm of influence and beyond .
to do just that , to ensure that nato can act in classical military fashion against an outside aggressor and at the same time can engage in counter-terrorism activities and state-building measures in asia or africa could be easier on paper than in practice .
especially in times of tight budgets and with nato members like greece on the brink of financial collapse .
despite these steep challenges , nato is indispensable , argue the experts .
" nato is needed for the security of our people , defending our democracy and promoting peace and stability in this very unpredictable , very uncertain and very complex world , " says ronis .
" nato 's big advantage today is that it has the ability to act in a robust environment , " argues tanner .
" it can use force if necessary .
and it is actually the only organization which has this capability with a certain projection of power . "
to harness that unique power , a convincing new strategy laid out by the panel of experts would be a good start , says kaiser : " it should n't be too long , it should n't be some bland lowest common denominator , but be sharp in defining the threats to modern society and what modern societies have to do in order to deal with these new threats . "

" according to the information available to us so far , google has for years penetrated private networks , apparently illegally , " aigner said in a statement on saturday .
the " alarming incident " showed that google still lacks understanding for the need for privacy , according to the statement .
privacy breach google 's fleet of street view cars , photographing streets for its online map program , has been collecting more data than previously thought .
after reviewing a system in the cars that recorded names and addresses of wireless networks detected along the routes , google revealed that a programming error had led to small amounts of personal data to be collected from unsecured wi-fi networks .

" according to the information available to us so far , google has for years penetrated private networks , apparently illegally , " aigner said in a statement on saturday .
the " alarming incident " showed that google still lacks understanding for the need for privacy , according to the statement .
privacy breach google 's fleet of street view cars , photographing streets for its online map program , has been collecting more data than previously thought .
after reviewing a system in the cars that recorded names and addresses of wireless networks detected along the routes , google revealed that a programming error had led to small amounts of personal data to be collected from unsecured wi-fi networks .
" it 's now clear that we have been mistakenly collecting samples of payload data from open wi-fi networks , " google 's head of engineering alan eustace said in a blog posting .
the blog post did not specify what kinds of personal data had been collected but indicated it could be things such as email and web browsing history .
however , since the data had been collected by moving vehicles , only fragments of information were recorded .
google regretted its mistake and would look for a way to destroy the personal data .
" maintaining people 's trust is crucial to everything we do , and in this case we fell short , " said eustace in the blog post .
google reviewed its data collection methods in response to an inquiry from the data protection authority in hamburg .

but they did find corroboration for accusations of physical abuse and misuse of funds . former catholic bishop walter mixa has been cleared of allegations that he sexually abused children , prosecutors said friday .
but their investigation confirmed claims that he beat children while working at a children 's home .
he is also under investigation for improperly using funds meant for the home .
a special investigator , sebastian knott , told news agency dpa that about a dozen former residents of the home gave credible testimony regarding physical abuse by mixa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 15.05.2010 new nato strategy must square the circle between old and new threats großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's secretary general commissioned the strategy review by the expert panel for the first time since 1999 , nato is devising a new strategic concept .
the group of experts tasked with drafting the paper must tackle not only a changed security environment , but also different threat perceptions . it is merely 11 years , but in terms of the geopolitical developments that have occurred since nato last adapted its strategic concept , it was a different era .
while the cold war had come to an end with the fall of the berlin wall a decade earlier , it was still largely unclear what global trends and events would shape the next era .
the attacks of september 11 in 2001 brutally ended this interval , launching an era where islamic terrorism , asymetric threats , counterinsurgency warfare and failing states quickly became the new currency in the international debate on global security .
nato has repeatedly discussed what the changed geopolitcal landscape means for the venerable institution .
but it has n't - until now - framed and formalized the allliance 's response to these challenges in a revised doctrine .
to do just that , to develop a new strategic concept , was the task given to former us secretary of state madeleine albright and a group of international experts .
and it is n't just the world that has changed since nato 's last concept introduced in 1999 .
nato has changed itself , explains latvia 's foreign minister aivis ronis , who was part of the expert group until he resigned in early may after accepting the post as his country 's top diplomat .
new members " since many central and eastern european states , including the baltic countries , have joined nato in 2004 and of course have not participated in drafting the strategic concept of 1999 , for the first time in these open seminars and conferences central and eastern europeans could contribute to the common vision of nato and the transatlantic community regarding security , threats and challenges and global changes , " says ronis .
" this is an historic experience for the central and eastern european countries and especially for the baltic states . "
due to their recent history with and proximity to russia , many of these newer countries have a different view of nato 's main priorities than some of the alliance 's older and larger members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's new members bring new perspectives to the alliance " the strategy will have to cope with fears which exist in eastern europe primarily with regard to russia , i.e. article 5 -lrb- collective defense - ed . -rrb- , " says fred tanner , director of the geneva center for security policy , who served as a rapporteur on one of the seminars held by the group of experts .
" on the other hand of course you have other countries like france or the uk who have more of an interest to use nato together with the us outside of nato . "
the experts agree that , as latvia 's foreign minister puts it , there needs to be a synergy of territorial defense and the promotion of stability security outside of nato 's traditional realm of influence .
new and old threats but , karl kaiser , director of the program on transatlantic relations at the weatherhead center for international affairs at harvard university , argues that collective defense as laid out in article 5 of the nato treaty ca n't be the alliance 's raison d 'etre . " article 5 should not dissappear , " says kaiser who testified before the group of experts last year .
" of course if a country gets attacked , the others have to come to its assistance , but that is not the main reason for the alliance today .
the main reason is elsewhere .
so we have to reconcile the two , we have to have both , but we should n't put article 5 at the top anymore and do , as some of these countries want , exercizes looking at the potential of russian aggression . "
the underlying dilemma for nato and the group of experts is the lack of a common threat perception within the new , larger alliance .
and this threat assessment gap does n't just exist between newer and older members , it is also evident between european members and the us .
while the us wants nato to focus much more on counter-terrorism efforts outside nato territory , many european members are deeply skeptical about such a global military role as exemplified by the debate over the afghanistan mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group of experts visited moscow to engage russia as well flexibility needed for nato and the group of experts , this means the new concept must try and square the circle .
" the strategy will have to be flexible , " says tanner .
it will have to take into account different threat perceptions and various contingencies , both inside nato 's traditional transatlantic realm of influence and beyond .
to do just that , to ensure that nato can act in classical military fashion against an outside aggressor and at the same time can engage in counter-terrorism activities and state-building measures in asia or africa could be easier on paper than in practice .
especially in times of tight budgets and with nato members like greece on the brink of financial collapse .
despite these steep challenges , nato is indispensable , argue the experts .
" nato is needed for the security of our people , defending our democracy and promoting peace and stability in this very unpredictable , very uncertain and very complex world , " says ronis .
" nato 's big advantage today is that it has the ability to act in a robust environment , " argues tanner .
" it can use force if necessary .
and it is actually the only organization which has this capability with a certain projection of power . "
to harness that unique power , a convincing new strategy laid out by the panel of experts would be a good start , says kaiser : " it should n't be too long , it should n't be some bland lowest common denominator , but be sharp in defining the threats to modern society and what modern societies have to do in order to deal with these new threats .

in an interview with deutsche welle he spoke about the future of the eu , about integration , expansion and the bloc 's international role . polish prime minister donald tusk is the 2010 recipient of the charlemagne prize , an annual award that recognizes efforts in promoting european understanding .
tusk received the prize in aachen on may 13 , with the charlemagne judges praising him for steering poland away from nationalism and bringing the former soviet-bloc country into the heart of europe .
deutsche welle had a chance to speak with the prime minister about his vision for the future of the european union and the issues surrounding the bloc : integration , expansion of the eurozone , shared defense and its international presence .
deutsche welle : in the words of the judges , you are " a convinced and a convincing european . "
what is your vision of europe for europeans , and also its dealings with the rest of the world ?
donald tusk : for all those who understand the meaning of freedom , the meaning of human rights , the meaning of respect for tradition - for all those who have faith in themselves , in their own potential - europe is , first and foremost , the best model for europeans .
europe is understood as a union , the european union - but it is also a continuing dream and a continuing challenge .
sometimes , especially in the so-called old europe , i hear doubting voices , that europe is not proving itself ; that times of crisis have shown that the european union is not up to the challenges .
and we , the polish people , but also many other europeans , reply that it is precisely at such critical moments that the idea of europe , or the union of free people , who believe in their potential and in fundamental values , becomes the most attractive challenge .
and , as i have been repeating frequently over the last few weeks , the more difficult and painful our experiences , the more the doubting voices arise all around , the more we need to hold high the european flag , affirm the conviction that this is a phenomenal invention : the european family .
we must repeat this all the louder and raise the rallying cry all the higher .
bildunterschrift : the polish leader was praised for steering poland away from nationalism what should the model for the european union be ?
a europe of nation states , or the united states of europe ?
which should we aim for ?
i think that , very often , discussion about the future of europe is a discussion about banal , empty slogans .
a moment of historic reflection and common sense is enough to understand that nations will remain nations ; poles will feel polish .
and germans , german .
the french , french .
and so on .
this is as true about nations as it is about smaller ethnic groups .
we shall remain true to our religions .
we shall remain faithful to our customs , while at the same time being aware that europe needs to be an ever closer union ; it needs to think more effectively about its security , including energy security .
in the global world , a europe divided by conflicting interests and conflicting values does n't stand a chance .
but a europe that can rise above these differences while not negating them has a chance to become one of the key world powers , and that is our shared dream .
you say europe should be more integrated , and you talk about europe as a union of values and not merely a continent .
is further enlargement of the eu the way to steam ahead under the present circumstances ?
and , if so , should all the balkan countries and turkey become members of this united europe ?
the greatness of europe has also been based on the fact that europe has shown magnanimity and patience for those who wanted to participate – not in a mechanical , empty political union , but in a union which respects all these values , a union aware of what the foundations of europe are .
this is why i would direct the question about further enlargement of the european union equally to brussels , to the capitals of the european union , as well as to the candidate countries themselves .
right from the beginning , poland has been in favor of the process of the enlargement of the european union , without putting down any conditions of a political and organizational character .
these have , in any case , been included in the treaties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk and poland are set to take the eu presidency in just over a year nevertheless , we shall always be asking ourselves and other europeans , as well as those who want to join the union , do you share our system of values ?
do you want to participate in this union which takes responsibility for itself , where every person is ready to help another ?
and a union where solidarity or freedom are not mere empty slogans ?
we shall ask these questions also of the turks , ukrainians and all those who apply to become members .
but we have examples closer to home , in the sense of realistic possibilities , such as croatia or serbia .
and it appears that under no circumstances can europe become closed .
even , if for germany or for others , today 's experience of greece may be prompting us to think , let 's be careful with those who do n't live up to the crisis or who have not played by the book .
but is it really the case that the core european countries have always played by the book ?
is it really the case that some can point their finger and say , we are fit to be in -lsb- the union -rsb- , but you are not fit ?
everybody has to do their homework on this crisis , everybody , without any exceptions .
the eurozone is wobbly .
and even , possibly , falling apart at the seams .
although you are not obliged to , you want to help greece .
are you still keen for poland to join the common currency , to adopt the euro , as soon as possible ?
just as is the case for the european union , so it is for the eurozone : it should n't be a club for the countries which have joined , but then each one will do as it likes .
the eurozone can not afford for the grim experience of the recent months to be repeated ever again .
poland wants to become a member of the eurozone as soon as possible by fulfilling the criteria which have been agreed to by all .
today , we point our finger at the greeks or talk about possible problems for other mediterranean countries , but we all remember that even the most stable of the union 's members which also belong to the eurozone also have a case to answer when it comes to fulfilling the criteria and sticking to fiscal discipline .
in just over a year , poland will take over the presidency of the european union .
for six months , your hand will be at the helm of the eu .
what ideas will you be especially keen to ' sell ' to europe ?
what will matter to you the most ?
we live in the european union under the lisbon treaty .
this is not the time nor place to explain all the aspects of the treaty , and i am a sober and common-sense politician and i know well that the presidency is very important , but the european union has its powers that be .
poland has a positive role to play during its presidency , but my common sense prompts me to say that the decisions will not be mine to take .
i will be jointly responsible , and not the one who makes the decisions .
it has been just over a month since the death of president lech kaczynski and 95 outstanding poles .
it was a difficult time for poland , which also brought hope for a polish-russian reconciliation .
what can poland and russia , acting together , offer to europe ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent death of polish president lech kaczynski and many elites shook the country first of all , this greatest of tragedies that the world has seen , when it comes to the death toll of government elites , shook to the core our minds and our hearts .
a genuine sense of mourning was pervasive in poland .
but it did not shake the country .
everybody watched with admiration how poles and the polish nation coped with the turn of events .
and we are really trying to draw positive conclusions for the future from this tragedy .
also political ones .
also regarding improving relations between poland and russia , because they are the key to good relations between europe and russia .
such were my aims also before the catastrophe , but both my aims and the efforts of the russian leaders , which i appreciate , have acquired a sense of urgency precisely due to the catastrophe .
therefore , if this is to be the legacy of those who died in the crash near smolensk , then maybe the most important thing is that this legacy becomes a positive factor in furthering understanding - rather than conflicts - between nations .

in an interview with deutsche welle he spoke about the future of the eu , about integration , expansion and the bloc 's international role . polish prime minister donald tusk is the 2010 recipient of the charlemagne prize , an annual award that recognizes efforts in promoting european understanding .
tusk received the prize in aachen on may 13 , with the charlemagne judges praising him for steering poland away from nationalism and bringing the former soviet-bloc country into the heart of europe .
deutsche welle had a chance to speak with the prime minister about his vision for the future of the european union and the issues surrounding the bloc : integration , expansion of the eurozone , shared defense and its international presence .
deutsche welle : in the words of the judges , you are " a convinced and a convincing european . "
what is your vision of europe for europeans , and also its dealings with the rest of the world ?
donald tusk : for all those who understand the meaning of freedom , the meaning of human rights , the meaning of respect for tradition - for all those who have faith in themselves , in their own potential - europe is , first and foremost , the best model for europeans .
europe is understood as a union , the european union - but it is also a continuing dream and a continuing challenge .
sometimes , especially in the so-called old europe , i hear doubting voices , that europe is not proving itself ; that times of crisis have shown that the european union is not up to the challenges .
and we , the polish people , but also many other europeans , reply that it is precisely at such critical moments that the idea of europe , or the union of free people , who believe in their potential and in fundamental values , becomes the most attractive challenge .
and , as i have been repeating frequently over the last few weeks , the more difficult and painful our experiences , the more the doubting voices arise all around , the more we need to hold high the european flag , affirm the conviction that this is a phenomenal invention : the european family .
we must repeat this all the louder and raise the rallying cry all the higher .
bildunterschrift : the polish leader was praised for steering poland away from nationalism what should the model for the european union be ?
a europe of nation states , or the united states of europe ?
which should we aim for ?
i think that , very often , discussion about the future of europe is a discussion about banal , empty slogans .
a moment of historic reflection and common sense is enough to understand that nations will remain nations ; poles will feel polish .
and germans , german .
the french , french .
and so on .
this is as true about nations as it is about smaller ethnic groups .
we shall remain true to our religions .
we shall remain faithful to our customs , while at the same time being aware that europe needs to be an ever closer union ; it needs to think more effectively about its security , including energy security .
in the global world , a europe divided by conflicting interests and conflicting values does n't stand a chance .
but a europe that can rise above these differences while not negating them has a chance to become one of the key world powers , and that is our shared dream .
you say europe should be more integrated , and you talk about europe as a union of values and not merely a continent .
is further enlargement of the eu the way to steam ahead under the present circumstances ?
and , if so , should all the balkan countries and turkey become members of this united europe ?
the greatness of europe has also been based on the fact that europe has shown magnanimity and patience for those who wanted to participate – not in a mechanical , empty political union , but in a union which respects all these values , a union aware of what the foundations of europe are .
this is why i would direct the question about further enlargement of the european union equally to brussels , to the capitals of the european union , as well as to the candidate countries themselves .
right from the beginning , poland has been in favor of the process of the enlargement of the european union , without putting down any conditions of a political and organizational character .
these have , in any case , been included in the treaties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk and poland are set to take the eu presidency in just over a year nevertheless , we shall always be asking ourselves and other europeans , as well as those who want to join the union , do you share our system of values ?

and we , the polish people , but also many other europeans , reply that it is precisely at such critical moments that the idea of europe , or the union of free people , who believe in their potential and in fundamental values , becomes the most attractive challenge .
and , as i have been repeating frequently over the last few weeks , the more difficult and painful our experiences , the more the doubting voices arise all around , the more we need to hold high the european flag , affirm the conviction that this is a phenomenal invention : the european family .
we must repeat this all the louder and raise the rallying cry all the higher .
bildunterschrift : the polish leader was praised for steering poland away from nationalism what should the model for the european union be ?
a europe of nation states , or the united states of europe ?
which should we aim for ?
i think that , very often , discussion about the future of europe is a discussion about banal , empty slogans .
a moment of historic reflection and common sense is enough to understand that nations will remain nations ; poles will feel polish .
and germans , german .
the french , french .
and so on .
this is as true about nations as it is about smaller ethnic groups .
we shall remain true to our religions .
we shall remain faithful to our customs , while at the same time being aware that europe needs to be an ever closer union ; it needs to think more effectively about its security , including energy security .
in the global world , a europe divided by conflicting interests and conflicting values does n't stand a chance .
but a europe that can rise above these differences while not negating them has a chance to become one of the key world powers , and that is our shared dream .
you say europe should be more integrated , and you talk about europe as a union of values and not merely a continent .
is further enlargement of the eu the way to steam ahead under the present circumstances ?
and , if so , should all the balkan countries and turkey become members of this united europe ?
the greatness of europe has also been based on the fact that europe has shown magnanimity and patience for those who wanted to participate – not in a mechanical , empty political union , but in a union which respects all these values , a union aware of what the foundations of europe are .
this is why i would direct the question about further enlargement of the european union equally to brussels , to the capitals of the european union , as well as to the candidate countries themselves .
right from the beginning , poland has been in favor of the process of the enlargement of the european union , without putting down any conditions of a political and organizational character .
these have , in any case , been included in the treaties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk and poland are set to take the eu presidency in just over a year nevertheless , we shall always be asking ourselves and other europeans , as well as those who want to join the union , do you share our system of values ?
do you want to participate in this union which takes responsibility for itself , where every person is ready to help another ?
and a union where solidarity or freedom are not mere empty slogans ?
we shall ask these questions also of the turks , ukrainians and all those who apply to become members .
but we have examples closer to home , in the sense of realistic possibilities , such as croatia or serbia .
and it appears that under no circumstances can europe become closed .
even , if for germany or for others , today 's experience of greece may be prompting us to think , let 's be careful with those who do n't live up to the crisis or who have not played by the book .
but is it really the case that the core european countries have always played by the book ?
is it really the case that some can point their finger and say , we are fit to be in -lsb- the union -rsb- , but you are not fit ?
everybody has to do their homework on this crisis , everybody , without any exceptions .
the eurozone is wobbly .
and even , possibly , falling apart at the seams .
although you are not obliged to , you want to help greece .
are you still keen for poland to join the common currency , to adopt the euro , as soon as possible ?
just as is the case for the european union , so it is for the eurozone : it should n't be a club for the countries which have joined , but then each one will do as it likes .
the eurozone can not afford for the grim experience of the recent months to be repeated ever again .
poland wants to become a member of the eurozone as soon as possible by fulfilling the criteria which have been agreed to by all .
today , we point our finger at the greeks or talk about possible problems for other mediterranean countries , but we all remember that even the most stable of the union 's members which also belong to the eurozone also have a case to answer when it comes to fulfilling the criteria and sticking to fiscal discipline .
in just over a year , poland will take over the presidency of the european union .
for six months , your hand will be at the helm of the eu .
what ideas will you be especially keen to ' sell ' to europe ?
what will matter to you the most ?
we live in the european union under the lisbon treaty .
this is not the time nor place to explain all the aspects of the treaty , and i am a sober and common-sense politician and i know well that the presidency is very important , but the european union has its powers that be .
poland has a positive role to play during its presidency , but my common sense prompts me to say that the decisions will not be mine to take .
i will be jointly responsible , and not the one who makes the decisions .
it has been just over a month since the death of president lech kaczynski and 95 outstanding poles .
it was a difficult time for poland , which also brought hope for a polish-russian reconciliation .
what can poland and russia , acting together , offer to europe ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent death of polish president lech kaczynski and many elites shook the country first of all , this greatest of tragedies that the world has seen , when it comes to the death toll of government elites , shook to the core our minds and our hearts .
a genuine sense of mourning was pervasive in poland .
but it did not shake the country .
everybody watched with admiration how poles and the polish nation coped with the turn of events .
and we are really trying to draw positive conclusions for the future from this tragedy .
also political ones .
also regarding improving relations between poland and russia , because they are the key to good relations between europe and russia .
such were my aims also before the catastrophe , but both my aims and the efforts of the russian leaders , which i appreciate , have acquired a sense of urgency precisely due to the catastrophe .
therefore , if this is to be the legacy of those who died in the crash near smolensk , then maybe the most important thing is that this legacy becomes a positive factor in furthering understanding - rather than conflicts - between nations .

in an interview with deutsche welle he spoke about the future of the eu , about integration , expansion and the bloc 's international role . polish prime minister donald tusk is the 2010 recipient of the charlemagne prize , an annual award that recognizes efforts in promoting european understanding .
tusk received the prize in aachen on may 13 , with the charlemagne judges praising him for steering poland away from nationalism and bringing the former soviet-bloc country into the heart of europe .
deutsche welle had a chance to speak with the prime minister about his vision for the future of the european union and the issues surrounding the bloc : integration , expansion of the eurozone , shared defense and its international presence .
deutsche welle : in the words of the judges , you are " a convinced and a convincing european . "
what is your vision of europe for europeans , and also its dealings with the rest of the world ?
donald tusk : for all those who understand the meaning of freedom , the meaning of human rights , the meaning of respect for tradition - for all those who have faith in themselves , in their own potential - europe is , first and foremost , the best model for europeans .
europe is understood as a union , the european union - but it is also a continuing dream and a continuing challenge .

goals from arjen robben , ivica olic , franck ribery and bastian schweinsteiger allowed the bavarians to claim the second leg of a potential bundesliga , dfb-pokal and champions league treble .
although bayern were not at their free-flowing best , clinical second-half finishing from louis van gaal 's side saw them ease to a comfortable victory .
bremen , returning to berlin to defend the cup they won a year ago , had few answers to their opponents ' dominance , and the dismissal of their captain torsten frings was symptomatic of their frustration in the closing stages .
" the result was clearer than the game actually was .
we went 2-0 -lsb- ahead -rsb- at the perfect time , " bayern defender philipp lahm said after the game .
" we really want to get the treble . "
" i think it was one of the best games that we played this season , " said van gaal .
" i told my players that it was important to win , but also how we won . "
a full-strength bayern team took the initiative from the opening minutes , and never let go of it .
despite coach thomas schaaf 's clear instructions for his bremen players to double up on in-form arjen robben , the winger was at the heart of his side 's best work in the first half .
tim wiese in the bremen goal was called on as early as the third minute , tipping a long-range robben effort over the bar .
the dutchman then found himself on the left , playing in ivica olic , who failed to find the net from not more than five yards .
olic was heavily involved in the opening goal though .
the croatian striker 's flick hit the hand of per mertesacker just inside the penalty and , although the big german defender could have known little about it from such close range , the referee pointed to the spot .
wiese guessed the right way , but robben 's penalty was hit hard and low and found the corner , to give bayern a 35th-minute lead .
the floodgates open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's torsten frings , right , was sent off at the 77th minute mertesacker was unlucky again for the second goal shortly after half-time .
his attempt to head clear deflected into the path of olic , who poked home a classic predator 's finish .
with bremen pushing up to try and get something back , ribery put the game to bed in the 63rd minute .
the frenchman was played through by mark van bommel and finished coolly , before sliding on the wet turf by the corner flag in memorable celebration .
former bayern midfielder frings was shown a second yellow with 15 minutes to go , catching bastian schweinsteiger late as bayern played keep-ball in the closing stages , and barely waiting to see the referee produce the red before he left the pitch .
schweinsteiger relinquished himself from a disciplined midfield role in the final minutes , taking philipp lahm 's lofted ball on the chest and volleying inside the far corner of the net for bayern 's fourth .
" the first half was great , in the second , we scored the goals , " said bayern striker thomas mueller .
" such a result is like a dream . "
closer to the treble the scoreline was harsh on werder bremen , who came into the game on the back of some fine late-season bundesliga form .
they could have taken the lead inside the first ten minutes , joerg butt in the bayern goal making an excellent double-save after claudio pizarro got in .
pizarro was too often isolated up front though , mesut oezil and aaron hunt failing to get the cup holders ' passing game going in very wet conditions in berlin .
" bayern dominated the game and i can only congratulate them , " admitted bremen coach schaaf .
bayern must wish they could play at the olympic stadium every day .
on two consecutive saturdays , captain van bommel has now lifted domestic silverware in the capital .
bayern wrapped up the domestic title with a 3-1 win over hertha berlin last weekend , and , with the dfb-pokal now secured , travel to madrid next weekend knowing that victory over internazionale would see them complete an unprecedented treble .
with seemingly no instructions to take it easy before next week 's game , bayern players celebrated hard after the final whistle .
" if we win something , we must celebrate , " said van gaal .

goals from arjen robben , ivica olic , franck ribery and bastian schweinsteiger allowed the bavarians to claim the second leg of a potential bundesliga , dfb-pokal and champions league treble .
although bayern were not at their free-flowing best , clinical second-half finishing from louis van gaal 's side saw them ease to a comfortable victory .
bremen , returning to berlin to defend the cup they won a year ago , had few answers to their opponents ' dominance , and the dismissal of their captain torsten frings was symptomatic of their frustration in the closing stages .

" we really want to get the treble . "
" i think it was one of the best games that we played this season , " said van gaal .
" i told my players that it was important to win , but also how we won . "
a full-strength bayern team took the initiative from the opening minutes , and never let go of it .
despite coach thomas schaaf 's clear instructions for his bremen players to double up on in-form arjen robben , the winger was at the heart of his side 's best work in the first half .
tim wiese in the bremen goal was called on as early as the third minute , tipping a long-range robben effort over the bar .
the dutchman then found himself on the left , playing in ivica olic , who failed to find the net from not more than five yards .
olic was heavily involved in the opening goal though .
the croatian striker 's flick hit the hand of per mertesacker just inside the penalty and , although the big german defender could have known little about it from such close range , the referee pointed to the spot .
wiese guessed the right way , but robben 's penalty was hit hard and low and found the corner , to give bayern a 35th-minute lead .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.05.2010 german firms look for asian opportunities großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the asia-pacific conference of german business was held in singapore this week this year , asian economies are expected to grow by 7.5 percent and continue to grow over the next few years .
german businesses are capitalizing on that optimism in the asian market . although the financial crisis and problems with the euro are hanging over the economy in germany , there is a sense of optimism in asia . economies there are expecting several years of growth , and it is hoped this may boost german business , too .
more than 700 companies demonstrated their appetite for a slice of the asian market at this year 's asia-pacific conference for german business .
business opportunities in asia are nothing new - many german companies have been steadily investing in the region for decades .
martin brudermueller is a board member of chemical giant basf responsible for asia pacific .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basf is looking to build on opportunities in asia " it is very important that when operating in asia , most of the products are made on site , " said brudermueller .
" that 's why more than 60 percent of the products we sell here are also locally produced . "
although basf was founded in mannheim , they now have hundreds of production sites around the world , and around 50 of those are in asia .
basf said they are now concentrating on boosting their market share there .
" it should be kept in mind that of the 750-billion-euro -lrb- $ 931.9 billion -rrb- chemical market predicted for 2020 , 500 billion of that is in asia .
therefore , asia is the growth market for basf , " brudermueller said .
growth in troubled times basf is not the only german company to benefit from links to asian economies .
the precious metals and technology company heraeus can thank the region for an encouraging start to 2010 .
" business in america and europe is going backwards , as so many factories have closed down , " said heraeus ceo juergen heraeus .
the heraeus family business , which has its base in frankfurt , has now been in asia for 70 years .
over 40 percent of their production is based in the region .
" when the companies have customers in asia , it makes sense to expand business in asia - and here everything moves very quickly .
in one year here you can start up a factory and begin production , " heraeus added .
piracy problems while it may be quick to set up production in asia , this also means that counterfeiters can adapt and copy european products in no time at all .
technology theft is a big problem , and piracy is becoming an increasingly expensive issue to deal with .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german economic minister rainer bruederle attended the singapore conference michael schadlich , chairman of the german company dorma , says they are always on the lookout for pirated material .
" normally when this happens we shut down production , " he said .
" but we are fooling ourselves . "
" it 's a bit like lawn mowing : you mow the lawn on saturday but then one week later you need to do it all over again , " schadlich said .
attempts to combat piracy , despite costing companies thousands of euros , are considered a worthwhile investment .
piracy aside , german companies know they can do good business in asia .
the biggest winners are those firms who took their chances early with the asian market .

german businesses are capitalizing on that optimism in the asian market . although the financial crisis and problems with the euro are hanging over the economy in germany , there is a sense of optimism in asia . economies there are expecting several years of growth , and it is hoped this may boost german business , too .
more than 700 companies demonstrated their appetite for a slice of the asian market at this year 's asia-pacific conference for german business .
business opportunities in asia are nothing new - many german companies have been steadily investing in the region for decades .
martin brudermueller is a board member of chemical giant basf responsible for asia pacific .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basf is looking to build on opportunities in asia " it is very important that when operating in asia , most of the products are made on site , " said brudermueller .
" that 's why more than 60 percent of the products we sell here are also locally produced . "
although basf was founded in mannheim , they now have hundreds of production sites around the world , and around 50 of those are in asia .
basf said they are now concentrating on boosting their market share there .
" it should be kept in mind that of the 750-billion-euro -lrb- $ 931.9 billion -rrb- chemical market predicted for 2020 , 500 billion of that is in asia .
therefore , asia is the growth market for basf , " brudermueller said .
growth in troubled times basf is not the only german company to benefit from links to asian economies .
the precious metals and technology company heraeus can thank the region for an encouraging start to 2010 .
" business in america and europe is going backwards , as so many factories have closed down , " said heraeus ceo juergen heraeus .
the heraeus family business , which has its base in frankfurt , has now been in asia for 70 years .
over 40 percent of their production is based in the region .
" when the companies have customers in asia , it makes sense to expand business in asia - and here everything moves very quickly .
in one year here you can start up a factory and begin production , " heraeus added .
piracy problems while it may be quick to set up production in asia , this also means that counterfeiters can adapt and copy european products in no time at all .
technology theft is a big problem , and piracy is becoming an increasingly expensive issue to deal with .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german economic minister rainer bruederle attended the singapore conference michael schadlich , chairman of the german company dorma , says they are always on the lookout for pirated material .
" normally when this happens we shut down production , " he said .
" but we are fooling ourselves . "
" it 's a bit like lawn mowing : you mow the lawn on saturday but then one week later you need to do it all over again , " schadlich said .
attempts to combat piracy , despite costing companies thousands of euros , are considered a worthwhile investment .
piracy aside , german companies know they can do good business in asia .
the biggest winners are those firms who took their chances early with the asian market .
the others are still struggling to catch up .

although basf was founded in mannheim , they now have hundreds of production sites around the world , and around 50 of those are in asia .
basf said they are now concentrating on boosting their market share there .
" it should be kept in mind that of the 750-billion-euro -lrb- $ 931.9 billion -rrb- chemical market predicted for 2020 , 500 billion of that is in asia .
therefore , asia is the growth market for basf , " brudermueller said .
growth in troubled times basf is not the only german company to benefit from links to asian economies .
the precious metals and technology company heraeus can thank the region for an encouraging start to 2010 .
" business in america and europe is going backwards , as so many factories have closed down , " said heraeus ceo juergen heraeus .
the heraeus family business , which has its base in frankfurt , has now been in asia for 70 years .
over 40 percent of their production is based in the region .
" when the companies have customers in asia , it makes sense to expand business in asia - and here everything moves very quickly .
in one year here you can start up a factory and begin production , " heraeus added .
piracy problems while it may be quick to set up production in asia , this also means that counterfeiters can adapt and copy european products in no time at all .
technology theft is a big problem , and piracy is becoming an increasingly expensive issue to deal with .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german economic minister rainer bruederle attended the singapore conference michael schadlich , chairman of the german company dorma , says they are always on the lookout for pirated material .
" normally when this happens we shut down production , " he said .
" but we are fooling ourselves . "
" it 's a bit like lawn mowing : you mow the lawn on saturday but then one week later you need to do it all over again , " schadlich said .
attempts to combat piracy , despite costing companies thousands of euros , are considered a worthwhile investment .
piracy aside , german companies know they can do good business in asia .
the biggest winners are those firms who took their chances early with the asian market .
the others are still struggling to catch up .

goals from arjen robben , ivica olic , franck ribery and bastian schweinsteiger allowed the bavarians to claim the second leg of a potential bundesliga , dfb-pokal and champions league treble .
although bayern were not at their free-flowing best , clinical second-half finishing from louis van gaal 's side saw them ease to a comfortable victory .
bremen , returning to berlin to defend the cup they won a year ago , had few answers to their opponents ' dominance , and the dismissal of their captain torsten frings was symptomatic of their frustration in the closing stages .
" the result was clearer than the game actually was .
we went 2-0 -lsb- ahead -rsb- at the perfect time , " bayern defender philipp lahm said after the game .
" we really want to get the treble . "
" i think it was one of the best games that we played this season , " said van gaal .
" i told my players that it was important to win , but also how we won . "
a full-strength bayern team took the initiative from the opening minutes , and never let go of it .
despite coach thomas schaaf 's clear instructions for his bremen players to double up on in-form arjen robben , the winger was at the heart of his side 's best work in the first half .
tim wiese in the bremen goal was called on as early as the third minute , tipping a long-range robben effort over the bar .
the dutchman then found himself on the left , playing in ivica olic , who failed to find the net from not more than five yards .
olic was heavily involved in the opening goal though .
the croatian striker 's flick hit the hand of per mertesacker just inside the penalty and , although the big german defender could have known little about it from such close range , the referee pointed to the spot .
wiese guessed the right way , but robben 's penalty was hit hard and low and found the corner , to give bayern a 35th-minute lead .
the floodgates open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's torsten frings , right , was sent off at the 77th minute mertesacker was unlucky again for the second goal shortly after half-time .
his attempt to head clear deflected into the path of olic , who poked home a classic predator 's finish .
with bremen pushing up to try and get something back , ribery put the game to bed in the 63rd minute .
the frenchman was played through by mark van bommel and finished coolly , before sliding on the wet turf by the corner flag in memorable celebration .
former bayern midfielder frings was shown a second yellow with 15 minutes to go , catching bastian schweinsteiger late as bayern played keep-ball in the closing stages , and barely waiting to see the referee produce the red before he left the pitch .
schweinsteiger relinquished himself from a disciplined midfield role in the final minutes , taking philipp lahm 's lofted ball on the chest and volleying inside the far corner of the net for bayern 's fourth .
" the first half was great , in the second , we scored the goals , " said bayern striker thomas mueller .
" such a result is like a dream . "
closer to the treble the scoreline was harsh on werder bremen , who came into the game on the back of some fine late-season bundesliga form .
they could have taken the lead inside the first ten minutes , joerg butt in the bayern goal making an excellent double-save after claudio pizarro got in .
pizarro was too often isolated up front though , mesut oezil and aaron hunt failing to get the cup holders ' passing game going in very wet conditions in berlin .
" bayern dominated the game and i can only congratulate them , " admitted bremen coach schaaf .

but they did find corroboration for accusations of physical abuse and misuse of funds . former catholic bishop walter mixa has been cleared of allegations that he sexually abused children , prosecutors said friday .
but their investigation confirmed claims that he beat children while working at a children 's home .
he is also under investigation for improperly using funds meant for the home .
a special investigator , sebastian knott , told news agency dpa that about a dozen former residents of the home gave credible testimony regarding physical abuse by mixa .
mixa served as the parish priest of the southern town of schrobenhausen from 1975 to 1996 , and oversaw the board which administered the children 's home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mixa was head of this children 's home before becoming bishop the residents said that mixa punched children or beat them with sticks or belts , and allegedly beat one girl until she could not stand .
those claims will not be prosecuted because the time limit for pursuing them has passed .
the abuse allegedly took place in the 1970s , when the victims were between six and 15 years old .
" he often said sentences such as : ' satan is in you , i will drive him out of you , " ' said knott , quoting a man who had lived in the home as a child .
another witness said that beatings were sometimes accompanied by mixa shouting " child of god , take this punishment and repent . "
misuse of funds ?
knott said allegations that mixa had misused the home 's money could not be disproven .
" there are a few articles which mr. mixa had purchased , but which never turned up in the home , " knott said .
the total loss would add up to about 30,000 euros .
mixa , 69 , served as the bishop of augsburg until stepping down in april , after admitting that he had given some children " a cuff or two around the ear 20 years ago . "
in his resignation letter , he asked forgiveness from the victims and apologized for his behavior .
according to german media reports , mixa has been living at a clinic in switzerland since resigning. svs / dpa / kna / epd editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite the tough times , eu leaders are staying the course . at times in recent weeks it 's felt a bit like a contest : what new low will the euro sink to next ?
on friday , the common currency shared by 16 of the european union members sank to its lowest level in 18 months , briefly trading at $ 1.2358 .
as recently as last summer , the euro was pushing $ 1.50 .
the causes of the drastic decline in the euro 's value are not difficult to discern .

" what we need is a quantum leap in mutual surveillance of economic policies in europe , " trichet told spiegel .
" we need improved mechanisms to prevent and punish misconduct . "
part of the problem in the eurozone comes from countries ignoring the european stability and growth pact , which sets a budget deficit limit of three percent of a country 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
most eu countries have exceeded this limit , and greece is four times over the mark .
trichet called for " effective sanctions for breaches of the stability and growth pact . "
defending the euro in germany , chancellor angela merkel echoed some of trichet 's sentiments in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper and defended her own decisions to support a financial rescue package for greece .
" when the stability of the euro is threatened , we ca n't evade our responsibility , " merkel told the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" with our guarantee package from the entire eurozone for greece , we 're ensuring that the common currency remains stable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and trichet agree : eu nations need to do a better job of balancing the books she added that europe , as a whole , needed to get its public budgets in order and reduce debts in the years ahead .
merkel 's decision to back aid for greece was not popular with many germans , while the opposition in parliament criticized that her initial reluctance to send money to athens only exacerbated the situation in greece and made the financial bailout more expensive than it needed to be .
however , merkel maintained she just wanted to make sure all legal and economic bases had been covered , and reiterated her stance that sending help to greece was only done in the wider interest of the euro .
" we all know , if the euro fails , more failures will follow , " she said , adding that the only way to ensure the stability of the euro in the future was a convergence of financial policies in europe. mz / reuters / apn / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 15.05.2010 europe 's single currency down , but not out großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been dark days for the euro recently the euro has fallen in value to its lowest level in over a year as massive bailout packages to save greece and the eurozone fly out of eu coffers .
despite the tough times , eu leaders are staying the course . at times in recent weeks it 's felt a bit like a contest : what new low will the euro sink to next ?
on friday , the common currency shared by 16 of the european union members sank to its lowest level in 18 months , briefly trading at $ 1.2358 .
as recently as last summer , the euro was pushing $ 1.50 .
the causes of the drastic decline in the euro 's value are not difficult to discern .
budget deficit problems across europe - most notably in greece - and massive bailout packages designed to prop up ailing economies have caused financial markets to lose faith in the euro , causing some speculation that the existence of the euro itself was being threatened .
european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- president jean-claude trichet is n't sugarcoating the issue .
in an interview with the german magazine der spiegel , he said europe is in the most difficult situation since world war ii , possibly even since world war i.
' quantum leap ' in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet knows the euro has seen better days , but is confident things can be fixed despite the dire straits , however , trichet sees a way out of the crisis .
" what we need is a quantum leap in mutual surveillance of economic policies in europe , " trichet told spiegel .
" we need improved mechanisms to prevent and punish misconduct . "
part of the problem in the eurozone comes from countries ignoring the european stability and growth pact , which sets a budget deficit limit of three percent of a country 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
most eu countries have exceeded this limit , and greece is four times over the mark .
trichet called for " effective sanctions for breaches of the stability and growth pact . "
defending the euro in germany , chancellor angela merkel echoed some of trichet 's sentiments in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper and defended her own decisions to support a financial rescue package for greece .
" when the stability of the euro is threatened , we ca n't evade our responsibility , " merkel told the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" with our guarantee package from the entire eurozone for greece , we 're ensuring that the common currency remains stable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and trichet agree : eu nations need to do a better job of balancing the books she added that europe , as a whole , needed to get its public budgets in order and reduce debts in the years ahead .

" according to the information available to us so far , google has for years penetrated private networks , apparently illegally , " aigner said in a statement on saturday .
the " alarming incident " showed that google still lacks understanding for the need for privacy , according to the statement .
privacy breach google 's fleet of street view cars , photographing streets for its online map program , has been collecting more data than previously thought .
after reviewing a system in the cars that recorded names and addresses of wireless networks detected along the routes , google revealed that a programming error had led to small amounts of personal data to be collected from unsecured wi-fi networks .
" it 's now clear that we have been mistakenly collecting samples of payload data from open wi-fi networks , " google 's head of engineering alan eustace said in a blog posting .
the blog post did not specify what kinds of personal data had been collected but indicated it could be things such as email and web browsing history .
however , since the data had been collected by moving vehicles , only fragments of information were recorded .
google regretted its mistake and would look for a way to destroy the personal data .
" maintaining people 's trust is crucial to everything we do , and in this case we fell short , " said eustace in the blog post .
google reviewed its data collection methods in response to an inquiry from the data protection authority in hamburg .
the google street view service allows users to " walk " along panoramic street views in many countries , using images recorded by specially-outfitted cars .
the fleet of cars around the world has been halted for the time being as google attempts to fix the glitch .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : nato faces a changing world with new challenges nato and russia seek to bury past differences lightning-fast us-eu summit in lisbon aims to revive ties nato to withdraw from afghanistan by 2014 as summit begins , nato missile shield a test of turkey 's allegiance trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 15.05.2010 new nato strategy must square the circle between old and new threats großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's secretary general commissioned the strategy review by the expert panel for the first time since 1999 , nato is devising a new strategic concept .
the group of experts tasked with drafting the paper must tackle not only a changed security environment , but also different threat perceptions . it is merely 11 years , but in terms of the geopolitical developments that have occurred since nato last adapted its strategic concept , it was a different era .
while the cold war had come to an end with the fall of the berlin wall a decade earlier , it was still largely unclear what global trends and events would shape the next era .
the attacks of september 11 in 2001 brutally ended this interval , launching an era where islamic terrorism , asymetric threats , counterinsurgency warfare and failing states quickly became the new currency in the international debate on global security .
nato has repeatedly discussed what the changed geopolitcal landscape means for the venerable institution .
but it has n't - until now - framed and formalized the allliance 's response to these challenges in a revised doctrine .
to do just that , to develop a new strategic concept , was the task given to former us secretary of state madeleine albright and a group of international experts .
and it is n't just the world that has changed since nato 's last concept introduced in 1999 .
nato has changed itself , explains latvia 's foreign minister aivis ronis , who was part of the expert group until he resigned in early may after accepting the post as his country 's top diplomat .
new members " since many central and eastern european states , including the baltic countries , have joined nato in 2004 and of course have not participated in drafting the strategic concept of 1999 , for the first time in these open seminars and conferences central and eastern europeans could contribute to the common vision of nato and the transatlantic community regarding security , threats and challenges and global changes , " says ronis .
" this is an historic experience for the central and eastern european countries and especially for the baltic states . "
due to their recent history with and proximity to russia , many of these newer countries have a different view of nato 's main priorities than some of the alliance 's older and larger members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's new members bring new perspectives to the alliance " the strategy will have to cope with fears which exist in eastern europe primarily with regard to russia , i.e. article 5 -lrb- collective defense - ed . -rrb- , " says fred tanner , director of the geneva center for security policy , who served as a rapporteur on one of the seminars held by the group of experts .
" on the other hand of course you have other countries like france or the uk who have more of an interest to use nato together with the us outside of nato . "
the experts agree that , as latvia 's foreign minister puts it , there needs to be a synergy of territorial defense and the promotion of stability security outside of nato 's traditional realm of influence .
new and old threats but , karl kaiser , director of the program on transatlantic relations at the weatherhead center for international affairs at harvard university , argues that collective defense as laid out in article 5 of the nato treaty ca n't be the alliance 's raison d 'etre . " article 5 should not dissappear , " says kaiser who testified before the group of experts last year .
" of course if a country gets attacked , the others have to come to its assistance , but that is not the main reason for the alliance today .
the main reason is elsewhere .
so we have to reconcile the two , we have to have both , but we should n't put article 5 at the top anymore and do , as some of these countries want , exercizes looking at the potential of russian aggression . "
the underlying dilemma for nato and the group of experts is the lack of a common threat perception within the new , larger alliance .
and this threat assessment gap does n't just exist between newer and older members , it is also evident between european members and the us .
while the us wants nato to focus much more on counter-terrorism efforts outside nato territory , many european members are deeply skeptical about such a global military role as exemplified by the debate over the afghanistan mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group of experts visited moscow to engage russia as well flexibility needed for nato and the group of experts , this means the new concept must try and square the circle .
" the strategy will have to be flexible , " says tanner .
it will have to take into account different threat perceptions and various contingencies , both inside nato 's traditional transatlantic realm of influence and beyond .
to do just that , to ensure that nato can act in classical military fashion against an outside aggressor and at the same time can engage in counter-terrorism activities and state-building measures in asia or africa could be easier on paper than in practice .
especially in times of tight budgets and with nato members like greece on the brink of financial collapse .
despite these steep challenges , nato is indispensable , argue the experts .
" nato is needed for the security of our people , defending our democracy and promoting peace and stability in this very unpredictable , very uncertain and very complex world , " says ronis .
" nato 's big advantage today is that it has the ability to act in a robust environment , " argues tanner .
" it can use force if necessary .
and it is actually the only organization which has this capability with a certain projection of power . "
to harness that unique power , a convincing new strategy laid out by the panel of experts would be a good start , says kaiser : " it should n't be too long , it should n't be some bland lowest common denominator , but be sharp in defining the threats to modern society and what modern societies have to do in order to deal with these new threats .

while the cold war had come to an end with the fall of the berlin wall a decade earlier , it was still largely unclear what global trends and events would shape the next era .
the attacks of september 11 in 2001 brutally ended this interval , launching an era where islamic terrorism , asymetric threats , counterinsurgency warfare and failing states quickly became the new currency in the international debate on global security .
nato has repeatedly discussed what the changed geopolitcal landscape means for the venerable institution .
but it has n't - until now - framed and formalized the allliance 's response to these challenges in a revised doctrine .
to do just that , to develop a new strategic concept , was the task given to former us secretary of state madeleine albright and a group of international experts .
and it is n't just the world that has changed since nato 's last concept introduced in 1999 .
nato has changed itself , explains latvia 's foreign minister aivis ronis , who was part of the expert group until he resigned in early may after accepting the post as his country 's top diplomat .
new members " since many central and eastern european states , including the baltic countries , have joined nato in 2004 and of course have not participated in drafting the strategic concept of 1999 , for the first time in these open seminars and conferences central and eastern europeans could contribute to the common vision of nato and the transatlantic community regarding security , threats and challenges and global changes , " says ronis .

" on the other hand of course you have other countries like france or the uk who have more of an interest to use nato together with the us outside of nato . "
the experts agree that , as latvia 's foreign minister puts it , there needs to be a synergy of territorial defense and the promotion of stability security outside of nato 's traditional realm of influence .
new and old threats but , karl kaiser , director of the program on transatlantic relations at the weatherhead center for international affairs at harvard university , argues that collective defense as laid out in article 5 of the nato treaty ca n't be the alliance 's raison d 'etre . " article 5 should not dissappear , " says kaiser who testified before the group of experts last year .
" of course if a country gets attacked , the others have to come to its assistance , but that is not the main reason for the alliance today .
the main reason is elsewhere .
so we have to reconcile the two , we have to have both , but we should n't put article 5 at the top anymore and do , as some of these countries want , exercizes looking at the potential of russian aggression . "
the underlying dilemma for nato and the group of experts is the lack of a common threat perception within the new , larger alliance .
and this threat assessment gap does n't just exist between newer and older members , it is also evident between european members and the us .
while the us wants nato to focus much more on counter-terrorism efforts outside nato territory , many european members are deeply skeptical about such a global military role as exemplified by the debate over the afghanistan mission .

it will have to take into account different threat perceptions and various contingencies , both inside nato 's traditional transatlantic realm of influence and beyond .
to do just that , to ensure that nato can act in classical military fashion against an outside aggressor and at the same time can engage in counter-terrorism activities and state-building measures in asia or africa could be easier on paper than in practice .

goals from arjen robben , ivica olic , franck ribery and bastian schweinsteiger allowed the bavarians to claim the second leg of a potential bundesliga , dfb-pokal and champions league treble .
although bayern were not at their free-flowing best , clinical second-half finishing from louis van gaal 's side saw them ease to a comfortable victory .
bremen , returning to berlin to defend the cup they won a year ago , had few answers to their opponents ' dominance , and the dismissal of their captain torsten frings was symptomatic of their frustration in the closing stages .
" the result was clearer than the game actually was .
we went 2-0 -lsb- ahead -rsb- at the perfect time , " bayern defender philipp lahm said after the game .
" we really want to get the treble . "
" i think it was one of the best games that we played this season , " said van gaal .
" i told my players that it was important to win , but also how we won . "
a full-strength bayern team took the initiative from the opening minutes , and never let go of it .
despite coach thomas schaaf 's clear instructions for his bremen players to double up on in-form arjen robben , the winger was at the heart of his side 's best work in the first half .
tim wiese in the bremen goal was called on as early as the third minute , tipping a long-range robben effort over the bar .
the dutchman then found himself on the left , playing in ivica olic , who failed to find the net from not more than five yards .
olic was heavily involved in the opening goal though .
the croatian striker 's flick hit the hand of per mertesacker just inside the penalty and , although the big german defender could have known little about it from such close range , the referee pointed to the spot .
wiese guessed the right way , but robben 's penalty was hit hard and low and found the corner , to give bayern a 35th-minute lead .
the floodgates open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's torsten frings , right , was sent off at the 77th minute mertesacker was unlucky again for the second goal shortly after half-time .
his attempt to head clear deflected into the path of olic , who poked home a classic predator 's finish .
with bremen pushing up to try and get something back , ribery put the game to bed in the 63rd minute .
the frenchman was played through by mark van bommel and finished coolly , before sliding on the wet turf by the corner flag in memorable celebration .
former bayern midfielder frings was shown a second yellow with 15 minutes to go , catching bastian schweinsteiger late as bayern played keep-ball in the closing stages , and barely waiting to see the referee produce the red before he left the pitch .
schweinsteiger relinquished himself from a disciplined midfield role in the final minutes , taking philipp lahm 's lofted ball on the chest and volleying inside the far corner of the net for bayern 's fourth .
" the first half was great , in the second , we scored the goals , " said bayern striker thomas mueller .
" such a result is like a dream . "
closer to the treble the scoreline was harsh on werder bremen , who came into the game on the back of some fine late-season bundesliga form .
they could have taken the lead inside the first ten minutes , joerg butt in the bayern goal making an excellent double-save after claudio pizarro got in .
pizarro was too often isolated up front though , mesut oezil and aaron hunt failing to get the cup holders ' passing game going in very wet conditions in berlin .
" bayern dominated the game and i can only congratulate them , " admitted bremen coach schaaf .
bayern must wish they could play at the olympic stadium every day .
on two consecutive saturdays , captain van bommel has now lifted domestic silverware in the capital .
bayern wrapped up the domestic title with a 3-1 win over hertha berlin last weekend , and , with the dfb-pokal now secured , travel to madrid next weekend knowing that victory over internazionale would see them complete an unprecedented treble .
with seemingly no instructions to take it easy before next week 's game , bayern players celebrated hard after the final whistle .
" if we win something , we must celebrate , " said van gaal .

due to their recent history with and proximity to russia , many of these newer countries have a different view of nato 's main priorities than some of the alliance 's older and larger members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's new members bring new perspectives to the alliance " the strategy will have to cope with fears which exist in eastern europe primarily with regard to russia , i.e. article 5 -lrb- collective defense - ed . -rrb- , " says fred tanner , director of the geneva center for security policy , who served as a rapporteur on one of the seminars held by the group of experts .
" on the other hand of course you have other countries like france or the uk who have more of an interest to use nato together with the us outside of nato . "
the experts agree that , as latvia 's foreign minister puts it , there needs to be a synergy of territorial defense and the promotion of stability security outside of nato 's traditional realm of influence .
new and old threats but , karl kaiser , director of the program on transatlantic relations at the weatherhead center for international affairs at harvard university , argues that collective defense as laid out in article 5 of the nato treaty ca n't be the alliance 's raison d 'etre . " article 5 should not dissappear , " says kaiser who testified before the group of experts last year .
" of course if a country gets attacked , the others have to come to its assistance , but that is not the main reason for the alliance today .
the main reason is elsewhere .
so we have to reconcile the two , we have to have both , but we should n't put article 5 at the top anymore and do , as some of these countries want , exercizes looking at the potential of russian aggression . "
the underlying dilemma for nato and the group of experts is the lack of a common threat perception within the new , larger alliance .
and this threat assessment gap does n't just exist between newer and older members , it is also evident between european members and the us .
while the us wants nato to focus much more on counter-terrorism efforts outside nato territory , many european members are deeply skeptical about such a global military role as exemplified by the debate over the afghanistan mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group of experts visited moscow to engage russia as well flexibility needed for nato and the group of experts , this means the new concept must try and square the circle .
" the strategy will have to be flexible , " says tanner .
it will have to take into account different threat perceptions and various contingencies , both inside nato 's traditional transatlantic realm of influence and beyond .
to do just that , to ensure that nato can act in classical military fashion against an outside aggressor and at the same time can engage in counter-terrorism activities and state-building measures in asia or africa could be easier on paper than in practice .
especially in times of tight budgets and with nato members like greece on the brink of financial collapse .
despite these steep challenges , nato is indispensable , argue the experts .
" nato is needed for the security of our people , defending our democracy and promoting peace and stability in this very unpredictable , very uncertain and very complex world , " says ronis .
" nato 's big advantage today is that it has the ability to act in a robust environment , " argues tanner .
" it can use force if necessary .
and it is actually the only organization which has this capability with a certain projection of power . "
to harness that unique power , a convincing new strategy laid out by the panel of experts would be a good start , says kaiser : " it should n't be too long , it should n't be some bland lowest common denominator , but be sharp in defining the threats to modern society and what modern societies have to do in order to deal with these new threats . "

goals from arjen robben , ivica olic , franck ribery and bastian schweinsteiger allowed the bavarians to claim the second leg of a potential bundesliga , dfb-pokal and champions league treble .
although bayern were not at their free-flowing best , clinical second-half finishing from louis van gaal 's side saw them ease to a comfortable victory .
bremen , returning to berlin to defend the cup they won a year ago , had few answers to their opponents ' dominance , and the dismissal of their captain torsten frings was symptomatic of their frustration in the closing stages .
" the result was clearer than the game actually was .
we went 2-0 -lsb- ahead -rsb- at the perfect time , " bayern defender philipp lahm said after the game .
" we really want to get the treble . "
" i think it was one of the best games that we played this season , " said van gaal .
" i told my players that it was important to win , but also how we won . "
a full-strength bayern team took the initiative from the opening minutes , and never let go of it .
despite coach thomas schaaf 's clear instructions for his bremen players to double up on in-form arjen robben , the winger was at the heart of his side 's best work in the first half .
tim wiese in the bremen goal was called on as early as the third minute , tipping a long-range robben effort over the bar .
the dutchman then found himself on the left , playing in ivica olic , who failed to find the net from not more than five yards .
olic was heavily involved in the opening goal though .
the croatian striker 's flick hit the hand of per mertesacker just inside the penalty and , although the big german defender could have known little about it from such close range , the referee pointed to the spot .
wiese guessed the right way , but robben 's penalty was hit hard and low and found the corner , to give bayern a 35th-minute lead .
the floodgates open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's torsten frings , right , was sent off at the 77th minute mertesacker was unlucky again for the second goal shortly after half-time .
his attempt to head clear deflected into the path of olic , who poked home a classic predator 's finish .
with bremen pushing up to try and get something back , ribery put the game to bed in the 63rd minute .
the frenchman was played through by mark van bommel and finished coolly , before sliding on the wet turf by the corner flag in memorable celebration .
former bayern midfielder frings was shown a second yellow with 15 minutes to go , catching bastian schweinsteiger late as bayern played keep-ball in the closing stages , and barely waiting to see the referee produce the red before he left the pitch .
schweinsteiger relinquished himself from a disciplined midfield role in the final minutes , taking philipp lahm 's lofted ball on the chest and volleying inside the far corner of the net for bayern 's fourth .
" the first half was great , in the second , we scored the goals , " said bayern striker thomas mueller .
" such a result is like a dream . "
closer to the treble the scoreline was harsh on werder bremen , who came into the game on the back of some fine late-season bundesliga form .
they could have taken the lead inside the first ten minutes , joerg butt in the bayern goal making an excellent double-save after claudio pizarro got in .
pizarro was too often isolated up front though , mesut oezil and aaron hunt failing to get the cup holders ' passing game going in very wet conditions in berlin .
" bayern dominated the game and i can only congratulate them , " admitted bremen coach schaaf .
bayern must wish they could play at the olympic stadium every day .

a full-strength bayern team took the initiative from the opening minutes , and never let go of it .
despite coach thomas schaaf 's clear instructions for his bremen players to double up on in-form arjen robben , the winger was at the heart of his side 's best work in the first half .
tim wiese in the bremen goal was called on as early as the third minute , tipping a long-range robben effort over the bar .
the dutchman then found himself on the left , playing in ivica olic , who failed to find the net from not more than five yards .
olic was heavily involved in the opening goal though .
the croatian striker 's flick hit the hand of per mertesacker just inside the penalty and , although the big german defender could have known little about it from such close range , the referee pointed to the spot .
wiese guessed the right way , but robben 's penalty was hit hard and low and found the corner , to give bayern a 35th-minute lead .
the floodgates open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's torsten frings , right , was sent off at the 77th minute mertesacker was unlucky again for the second goal shortly after half-time .
his attempt to head clear deflected into the path of olic , who poked home a classic predator 's finish .
with bremen pushing up to try and get something back , ribery put the game to bed in the 63rd minute .
the frenchman was played through by mark van bommel and finished coolly , before sliding on the wet turf by the corner flag in memorable celebration .
former bayern midfielder frings was shown a second yellow with 15 minutes to go , catching bastian schweinsteiger late as bayern played keep-ball in the closing stages , and barely waiting to see the referee produce the red before he left the pitch .
schweinsteiger relinquished himself from a disciplined midfield role in the final minutes , taking philipp lahm 's lofted ball on the chest and volleying inside the far corner of the net for bayern 's fourth .
" the first half was great , in the second , we scored the goals , " said bayern striker thomas mueller .
" such a result is like a dream . "
closer to the treble the scoreline was harsh on werder bremen , who came into the game on the back of some fine late-season bundesliga form .
they could have taken the lead inside the first ten minutes , joerg butt in the bayern goal making an excellent double-save after claudio pizarro got in .
pizarro was too often isolated up front though , mesut oezil and aaron hunt failing to get the cup holders ' passing game going in very wet conditions in berlin .
" bayern dominated the game and i can only congratulate them , " admitted bremen coach schaaf .
bayern must wish they could play at the olympic stadium every day .
on two consecutive saturdays , captain van bommel has now lifted domestic silverware in the capital .
bayern wrapped up the domestic title with a 3-1 win over hertha berlin last weekend , and , with the dfb-pokal now secured , travel to madrid next weekend knowing that victory over internazionale would see them complete an unprecedented treble .
with seemingly no instructions to take it easy before next week 's game , bayern players celebrated hard after the final whistle .
" if we win something , we must celebrate , " said van gaal .

but they did find corroboration for accusations of physical abuse and misuse of funds . former catholic bishop walter mixa has been cleared of allegations that he sexually abused children , prosecutors said friday .
but their investigation confirmed claims that he beat children while working at a children 's home .
he is also under investigation for improperly using funds meant for the home .
a special investigator , sebastian knott , told news agency dpa that about a dozen former residents of the home gave credible testimony regarding physical abuse by mixa .
mixa served as the parish priest of the southern town of schrobenhausen from 1975 to 1996 , and oversaw the board which administered the children 's home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mixa was head of this children 's home before becoming bishop the residents said that mixa punched children or beat them with sticks or belts , and allegedly beat one girl until she could not stand .
those claims will not be prosecuted because the time limit for pursuing them has passed .
the abuse allegedly took place in the 1970s , when the victims were between six and 15 years old .
" he often said sentences such as : ' satan is in you , i will drive him out of you , " ' said knott , quoting a man who had lived in the home as a child .
another witness said that beatings were sometimes accompanied by mixa shouting " child of god , take this punishment and repent . "
misuse of funds ?
knott said allegations that mixa had misused the home 's money could not be disproven .
" there are a few articles which mr. mixa had purchased , but which never turned up in the home , " knott said .
the total loss would add up to about 30,000 euros .
mixa , 69 , served as the bishop of augsburg until stepping down in april , after admitting that he had given some children " a cuff or two around the ear 20 years ago . "
in his resignation letter , he asked forgiveness from the victims and apologized for his behavior .
according to german media reports , mixa has been living at a clinic in switzerland since resigning. svs / dpa / kna / epd editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german businesses are capitalizing on that optimism in the asian market . although the financial crisis and problems with the euro are hanging over the economy in germany , there is a sense of optimism in asia . economies there are expecting several years of growth , and it is hoped this may boost german business , too .
more than 700 companies demonstrated their appetite for a slice of the asian market at this year 's asia-pacific conference for german business .
business opportunities in asia are nothing new - many german companies have been steadily investing in the region for decades .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basf is looking to build on opportunities in asia " it is very important that when operating in asia , most of the products are made on site , " said brudermueller .
" that 's why more than 60 percent of the products we sell here are also locally produced . "
although basf was founded in mannheim , they now have hundreds of production sites around the world , and around 50 of those are in asia .

therefore , asia is the growth market for basf , " brudermueller said .

over 40 percent of their production is based in the region .
" when the companies have customers in asia , it makes sense to expand business in asia - and here everything moves very quickly .
in one year here you can start up a factory and begin production , " heraeus added .
piracy problems while it may be quick to set up production in asia , this also means that counterfeiters can adapt and copy european products in no time at all .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 15.05.2010 new nato strategy must square the circle between old and new threats großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's secretary general commissioned the strategy review by the expert panel for the first time since 1999 , nato is devising a new strategic concept .
the group of experts tasked with drafting the paper must tackle not only a changed security environment , but also different threat perceptions . it is merely 11 years , but in terms of the geopolitical developments that have occurred since nato last adapted its strategic concept , it was a different era .
while the cold war had come to an end with the fall of the berlin wall a decade earlier , it was still largely unclear what global trends and events would shape the next era .
the attacks of september 11 in 2001 brutally ended this interval , launching an era where islamic terrorism , asymetric threats , counterinsurgency warfare and failing states quickly became the new currency in the international debate on global security .
nato has repeatedly discussed what the changed geopolitcal landscape means for the venerable institution .
but it has n't - until now - framed and formalized the allliance 's response to these challenges in a revised doctrine .
to do just that , to develop a new strategic concept , was the task given to former us secretary of state madeleine albright and a group of international experts .
and it is n't just the world that has changed since nato 's last concept introduced in 1999 .
nato has changed itself , explains latvia 's foreign minister aivis ronis , who was part of the expert group until he resigned in early may after accepting the post as his country 's top diplomat .
new members " since many central and eastern european states , including the baltic countries , have joined nato in 2004 and of course have not participated in drafting the strategic concept of 1999 , for the first time in these open seminars and conferences central and eastern europeans could contribute to the common vision of nato and the transatlantic community regarding security , threats and challenges and global changes , " says ronis .
" this is an historic experience for the central and eastern european countries and especially for the baltic states . "
due to their recent history with and proximity to russia , many of these newer countries have a different view of nato 's main priorities than some of the alliance 's older and larger members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's new members bring new perspectives to the alliance " the strategy will have to cope with fears which exist in eastern europe primarily with regard to russia , i.e. article 5 -lrb- collective defense - ed . -rrb- , " says fred tanner , director of the geneva center for security policy , who served as a rapporteur on one of the seminars held by the group of experts .
" on the other hand of course you have other countries like france or the uk who have more of an interest to use nato together with the us outside of nato . "
the experts agree that , as latvia 's foreign minister puts it , there needs to be a synergy of territorial defense and the promotion of stability security outside of nato 's traditional realm of influence .
new and old threats but , karl kaiser , director of the program on transatlantic relations at the weatherhead center for international affairs at harvard university , argues that collective defense as laid out in article 5 of the nato treaty ca n't be the alliance 's raison d 'etre . " article 5 should not dissappear , " says kaiser who testified before the group of experts last year .
" of course if a country gets attacked , the others have to come to its assistance , but that is not the main reason for the alliance today .
the main reason is elsewhere .
so we have to reconcile the two , we have to have both , but we should n't put article 5 at the top anymore and do , as some of these countries want , exercizes looking at the potential of russian aggression . "
the underlying dilemma for nato and the group of experts is the lack of a common threat perception within the new , larger alliance .
and this threat assessment gap does n't just exist between newer and older members , it is also evident between european members and the us .
while the us wants nato to focus much more on counter-terrorism efforts outside nato territory , many european members are deeply skeptical about such a global military role as exemplified by the debate over the afghanistan mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group of experts visited moscow to engage russia as well flexibility needed for nato and the group of experts , this means the new concept must try and square the circle .
" the strategy will have to be flexible , " says tanner .
it will have to take into account different threat perceptions and various contingencies , both inside nato 's traditional transatlantic realm of influence and beyond .
to do just that , to ensure that nato can act in classical military fashion against an outside aggressor and at the same time can engage in counter-terrorism activities and state-building measures in asia or africa could be easier on paper than in practice .
especially in times of tight budgets and with nato members like greece on the brink of financial collapse .
despite these steep challenges , nato is indispensable , argue the experts .
" nato is needed for the security of our people , defending our democracy and promoting peace and stability in this very unpredictable , very uncertain and very complex world , " says ronis .
" nato 's big advantage today is that it has the ability to act in a robust environment , " argues tanner .
" it can use force if necessary .
and it is actually the only organization which has this capability with a certain projection of power . "
to harness that unique power , a convincing new strategy laid out by the panel of experts would be a good start , says kaiser : " it should n't be too long , it should n't be some bland lowest common denominator , but be sharp in defining the threats to modern society and what modern societies have to do in order to deal with these new threats .

in an interview with deutsche welle he spoke about the future of the eu , about integration , expansion and the bloc 's international role . polish prime minister donald tusk is the 2010 recipient of the charlemagne prize , an annual award that recognizes efforts in promoting european understanding .
tusk received the prize in aachen on may 13 , with the charlemagne judges praising him for steering poland away from nationalism and bringing the former soviet-bloc country into the heart of europe .
deutsche welle had a chance to speak with the prime minister about his vision for the future of the european union and the issues surrounding the bloc : integration , expansion of the eurozone , shared defense and its international presence .
deutsche welle : in the words of the judges , you are " a convinced and a convincing european . "
what is your vision of europe for europeans , and also its dealings with the rest of the world ?
donald tusk : for all those who understand the meaning of freedom , the meaning of human rights , the meaning of respect for tradition - for all those who have faith in themselves , in their own potential - europe is , first and foremost , the best model for europeans .
europe is understood as a union , the european union - but it is also a continuing dream and a continuing challenge .
sometimes , especially in the so-called old europe , i hear doubting voices , that europe is not proving itself ; that times of crisis have shown that the european union is not up to the challenges .
and we , the polish people , but also many other europeans , reply that it is precisely at such critical moments that the idea of europe , or the union of free people , who believe in their potential and in fundamental values , becomes the most attractive challenge .
and , as i have been repeating frequently over the last few weeks , the more difficult and painful our experiences , the more the doubting voices arise all around , the more we need to hold high the european flag , affirm the conviction that this is a phenomenal invention : the european family .
we must repeat this all the louder and raise the rallying cry all the higher .
bildunterschrift : the polish leader was praised for steering poland away from nationalism what should the model for the european union be ?
a europe of nation states , or the united states of europe ?
which should we aim for ?
i think that , very often , discussion about the future of europe is a discussion about banal , empty slogans .
a moment of historic reflection and common sense is enough to understand that nations will remain nations ; poles will feel polish .
and germans , german .
the french , french .
and so on .
this is as true about nations as it is about smaller ethnic groups .
we shall remain true to our religions .
we shall remain faithful to our customs , while at the same time being aware that europe needs to be an ever closer union ; it needs to think more effectively about its security , including energy security .
in the global world , a europe divided by conflicting interests and conflicting values does n't stand a chance .
but a europe that can rise above these differences while not negating them has a chance to become one of the key world powers , and that is our shared dream .
you say europe should be more integrated , and you talk about europe as a union of values and not merely a continent .
is further enlargement of the eu the way to steam ahead under the present circumstances ?
and , if so , should all the balkan countries and turkey become members of this united europe ?
the greatness of europe has also been based on the fact that europe has shown magnanimity and patience for those who wanted to participate – not in a mechanical , empty political union , but in a union which respects all these values , a union aware of what the foundations of europe are .
this is why i would direct the question about further enlargement of the european union equally to brussels , to the capitals of the european union , as well as to the candidate countries themselves .
right from the beginning , poland has been in favor of the process of the enlargement of the european union , without putting down any conditions of a political and organizational character .
these have , in any case , been included in the treaties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk and poland are set to take the eu presidency in just over a year nevertheless , we shall always be asking ourselves and other europeans , as well as those who want to join the union , do you share our system of values ?
do you want to participate in this union which takes responsibility for itself , where every person is ready to help another ?
and a union where solidarity or freedom are not mere empty slogans ?
we shall ask these questions also of the turks , ukrainians and all those who apply to become members .
but we have examples closer to home , in the sense of realistic possibilities , such as croatia or serbia .
and it appears that under no circumstances can europe become closed .
even , if for germany or for others , today 's experience of greece may be prompting us to think , let 's be careful with those who do n't live up to the crisis or who have not played by the book .
but is it really the case that the core european countries have always played by the book ?
is it really the case that some can point their finger and say , we are fit to be in -lsb- the union -rsb- , but you are not fit ?
everybody has to do their homework on this crisis , everybody , without any exceptions .
the eurozone is wobbly .
and even , possibly , falling apart at the seams .
although you are not obliged to , you want to help greece .
are you still keen for poland to join the common currency , to adopt the euro , as soon as possible ?
just as is the case for the european union , so it is for the eurozone : it should n't be a club for the countries which have joined , but then each one will do as it likes .
the eurozone can not afford for the grim experience of the recent months to be repeated ever again .
poland wants to become a member of the eurozone as soon as possible by fulfilling the criteria which have been agreed to by all .
today , we point our finger at the greeks or talk about possible problems for other mediterranean countries , but we all remember that even the most stable of the union 's members which also belong to the eurozone also have a case to answer when it comes to fulfilling the criteria and sticking to fiscal discipline .
in just over a year , poland will take over the presidency of the european union .
for six months , your hand will be at the helm of the eu .
what ideas will you be especially keen to ' sell ' to europe ?
what will matter to you the most ?
we live in the european union under the lisbon treaty .
this is not the time nor place to explain all the aspects of the treaty , and i am a sober and common-sense politician and i know well that the presidency is very important , but the european union has its powers that be .
poland has a positive role to play during its presidency , but my common sense prompts me to say that the decisions will not be mine to take .
i will be jointly responsible , and not the one who makes the decisions .
it has been just over a month since the death of president lech kaczynski and 95 outstanding poles .
it was a difficult time for poland , which also brought hope for a polish-russian reconciliation .
what can poland and russia , acting together , offer to europe ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent death of polish president lech kaczynski and many elites shook the country first of all , this greatest of tragedies that the world has seen , when it comes to the death toll of government elites , shook to the core our minds and our hearts .
a genuine sense of mourning was pervasive in poland .
but it did not shake the country .
everybody watched with admiration how poles and the polish nation coped with the turn of events .
and we are really trying to draw positive conclusions for the future from this tragedy .
also political ones .
also regarding improving relations between poland and russia , because they are the key to good relations between europe and russia .
such were my aims also before the catastrophe , but both my aims and the efforts of the russian leaders , which i appreciate , have acquired a sense of urgency precisely due to the catastrophe .
therefore , if this is to be the legacy of those who died in the crash near smolensk , then maybe the most important thing is that this legacy becomes a positive factor in furthering understanding - rather than conflicts - between nations .

nato has changed itself , explains latvia 's foreign minister aivis ronis , who was part of the expert group until he resigned in early may after accepting the post as his country 's top diplomat .
new members " since many central and eastern european states , including the baltic countries , have joined nato in 2004 and of course have not participated in drafting the strategic concept of 1999 , for the first time in these open seminars and conferences central and eastern europeans could contribute to the common vision of nato and the transatlantic community regarding security , threats and challenges and global changes , " says ronis .
" this is an historic experience for the central and eastern european countries and especially for the baltic states . "
due to their recent history with and proximity to russia , many of these newer countries have a different view of nato 's main priorities than some of the alliance 's older and larger members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's new members bring new perspectives to the alliance " the strategy will have to cope with fears which exist in eastern europe primarily with regard to russia , i.e. article 5 -lrb- collective defense - ed . -rrb- , " says fred tanner , director of the geneva center for security policy , who served as a rapporteur on one of the seminars held by the group of experts .
" on the other hand of course you have other countries like france or the uk who have more of an interest to use nato together with the us outside of nato . "
the experts agree that , as latvia 's foreign minister puts it , there needs to be a synergy of territorial defense and the promotion of stability security outside of nato 's traditional realm of influence .
new and old threats but , karl kaiser , director of the program on transatlantic relations at the weatherhead center for international affairs at harvard university , argues that collective defense as laid out in article 5 of the nato treaty ca n't be the alliance 's raison d 'etre . " article 5 should not dissappear , " says kaiser who testified before the group of experts last year .
" of course if a country gets attacked , the others have to come to its assistance , but that is not the main reason for the alliance today .
the main reason is elsewhere .
so we have to reconcile the two , we have to have both , but we should n't put article 5 at the top anymore and do , as some of these countries want , exercizes looking at the potential of russian aggression . "
the underlying dilemma for nato and the group of experts is the lack of a common threat perception within the new , larger alliance .
and this threat assessment gap does n't just exist between newer and older members , it is also evident between european members and the us .
while the us wants nato to focus much more on counter-terrorism efforts outside nato territory , many european members are deeply skeptical about such a global military role as exemplified by the debate over the afghanistan mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group of experts visited moscow to engage russia as well flexibility needed for nato and the group of experts , this means the new concept must try and square the circle .
" the strategy will have to be flexible , " says tanner .
it will have to take into account different threat perceptions and various contingencies , both inside nato 's traditional transatlantic realm of influence and beyond .
to do just that , to ensure that nato can act in classical military fashion against an outside aggressor and at the same time can engage in counter-terrorism activities and state-building measures in asia or africa could be easier on paper than in practice .
especially in times of tight budgets and with nato members like greece on the brink of financial collapse .
despite these steep challenges , nato is indispensable , argue the experts .
" nato is needed for the security of our people , defending our democracy and promoting peace and stability in this very unpredictable , very uncertain and very complex world , " says ronis .
" nato 's big advantage today is that it has the ability to act in a robust environment , " argues tanner .
" it can use force if necessary .
and it is actually the only organization which has this capability with a certain projection of power . "
to harness that unique power , a convincing new strategy laid out by the panel of experts would be a good start , says kaiser : " it should n't be too long , it should n't be some bland lowest common denominator , but be sharp in defining the threats to modern society and what modern societies have to do in order to deal with these new threats . "

" according to the information available to us so far , google has for years penetrated private networks , apparently illegally , " aigner said in a statement on saturday .
the " alarming incident " showed that google still lacks understanding for the need for privacy , according to the statement .
privacy breach google 's fleet of street view cars , photographing streets for its online map program , has been collecting more data than previously thought .
after reviewing a system in the cars that recorded names and addresses of wireless networks detected along the routes , google revealed that a programming error had led to small amounts of personal data to be collected from unsecured wi-fi networks .
" it 's now clear that we have been mistakenly collecting samples of payload data from open wi-fi networks , " google 's head of engineering alan eustace said in a blog posting .
the blog post did not specify what kinds of personal data had been collected but indicated it could be things such as email and web browsing history .
however , since the data had been collected by moving vehicles , only fragments of information were recorded .
google regretted its mistake and would look for a way to destroy the personal data .
" maintaining people 's trust is crucial to everything we do , and in this case we fell short , " said eustace in the blog post .
google reviewed its data collection methods in response to an inquiry from the data protection authority in hamburg .
the google street view service allows users to " walk " along panoramic street views in many countries , using images recorded by specially-outfitted cars .
the fleet of cars around the world has been halted for the time being as google attempts to fix the glitch .

goals from arjen robben , ivica olic , franck ribery and bastian schweinsteiger allowed the bavarians to claim the second leg of a potential bundesliga , dfb-pokal and champions league treble .
although bayern were not at their free-flowing best , clinical second-half finishing from louis van gaal 's side saw them ease to a comfortable victory .
bremen , returning to berlin to defend the cup they won a year ago , had few answers to their opponents ' dominance , and the dismissal of their captain torsten frings was symptomatic of their frustration in the closing stages .
" the result was clearer than the game actually was .
we went 2-0 -lsb- ahead -rsb- at the perfect time , " bayern defender philipp lahm said after the game .
" we really want to get the treble . "
" i think it was one of the best games that we played this season , " said van gaal .
" i told my players that it was important to win , but also how we won . "
a full-strength bayern team took the initiative from the opening minutes , and never let go of it .
despite coach thomas schaaf 's clear instructions for his bremen players to double up on in-form arjen robben , the winger was at the heart of his side 's best work in the first half .
tim wiese in the bremen goal was called on as early as the third minute , tipping a long-range robben effort over the bar .
the dutchman then found himself on the left , playing in ivica olic , who failed to find the net from not more than five yards .
olic was heavily involved in the opening goal though .
the croatian striker 's flick hit the hand of per mertesacker just inside the penalty and , although the big german defender could have known little about it from such close range , the referee pointed to the spot .
wiese guessed the right way , but robben 's penalty was hit hard and low and found the corner , to give bayern a 35th-minute lead .
the floodgates open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's torsten frings , right , was sent off at the 77th minute mertesacker was unlucky again for the second goal shortly after half-time .
his attempt to head clear deflected into the path of olic , who poked home a classic predator 's finish .
with bremen pushing up to try and get something back , ribery put the game to bed in the 63rd minute .
the frenchman was played through by mark van bommel and finished coolly , before sliding on the wet turf by the corner flag in memorable celebration .
former bayern midfielder frings was shown a second yellow with 15 minutes to go , catching bastian schweinsteiger late as bayern played keep-ball in the closing stages , and barely waiting to see the referee produce the red before he left the pitch .
schweinsteiger relinquished himself from a disciplined midfield role in the final minutes , taking philipp lahm 's lofted ball on the chest and volleying inside the far corner of the net for bayern 's fourth .
" the first half was great , in the second , we scored the goals , " said bayern striker thomas mueller .
" such a result is like a dream . "
closer to the treble the scoreline was harsh on werder bremen , who came into the game on the back of some fine late-season bundesliga form .
they could have taken the lead inside the first ten minutes , joerg butt in the bayern goal making an excellent double-save after claudio pizarro got in .
pizarro was too often isolated up front though , mesut oezil and aaron hunt failing to get the cup holders ' passing game going in very wet conditions in berlin .
" bayern dominated the game and i can only congratulate them , " admitted bremen coach schaaf .
bayern must wish they could play at the olympic stadium every day .
on two consecutive saturdays , captain van bommel has now lifted domestic silverware in the capital .
bayern wrapped up the domestic title with a 3-1 win over hertha berlin last weekend , and , with the dfb-pokal now secured , travel to madrid next weekend knowing that victory over internazionale would see them complete an unprecedented treble .
with seemingly no instructions to take it easy before next week 's game , bayern players celebrated hard after the final whistle .
" if we win something , we must celebrate , " said van gaal .

in an interview with deutsche welle he spoke about the future of the eu , about integration , expansion and the bloc 's international role . polish prime minister donald tusk is the 2010 recipient of the charlemagne prize , an annual award that recognizes efforts in promoting european understanding .
tusk received the prize in aachen on may 13 , with the charlemagne judges praising him for steering poland away from nationalism and bringing the former soviet-bloc country into the heart of europe .
deutsche welle had a chance to speak with the prime minister about his vision for the future of the european union and the issues surrounding the bloc : integration , expansion of the eurozone , shared defense and its international presence .
deutsche welle : in the words of the judges , you are " a convinced and a convincing european . "
what is your vision of europe for europeans , and also its dealings with the rest of the world ?
donald tusk : for all those who understand the meaning of freedom , the meaning of human rights , the meaning of respect for tradition - for all those who have faith in themselves , in their own potential - europe is , first and foremost , the best model for europeans .
europe is understood as a union , the european union - but it is also a continuing dream and a continuing challenge .
sometimes , especially in the so-called old europe , i hear doubting voices , that europe is not proving itself ; that times of crisis have shown that the european union is not up to the challenges .
and we , the polish people , but also many other europeans , reply that it is precisely at such critical moments that the idea of europe , or the union of free people , who believe in their potential and in fundamental values , becomes the most attractive challenge .
and , as i have been repeating frequently over the last few weeks , the more difficult and painful our experiences , the more the doubting voices arise all around , the more we need to hold high the european flag , affirm the conviction that this is a phenomenal invention : the european family .
we must repeat this all the louder and raise the rallying cry all the higher .
bildunterschrift : the polish leader was praised for steering poland away from nationalism what should the model for the european union be ?
a europe of nation states , or the united states of europe ?
which should we aim for ?
i think that , very often , discussion about the future of europe is a discussion about banal , empty slogans .
a moment of historic reflection and common sense is enough to understand that nations will remain nations ; poles will feel polish .
and germans , german .
the french , french .
and so on .
this is as true about nations as it is about smaller ethnic groups .
we shall remain true to our religions .
we shall remain faithful to our customs , while at the same time being aware that europe needs to be an ever closer union ; it needs to think more effectively about its security , including energy security .
in the global world , a europe divided by conflicting interests and conflicting values does n't stand a chance .
but a europe that can rise above these differences while not negating them has a chance to become one of the key world powers , and that is our shared dream .
you say europe should be more integrated , and you talk about europe as a union of values and not merely a continent .
is further enlargement of the eu the way to steam ahead under the present circumstances ?
and , if so , should all the balkan countries and turkey become members of this united europe ?
the greatness of europe has also been based on the fact that europe has shown magnanimity and patience for those who wanted to participate – not in a mechanical , empty political union , but in a union which respects all these values , a union aware of what the foundations of europe are .
this is why i would direct the question about further enlargement of the european union equally to brussels , to the capitals of the european union , as well as to the candidate countries themselves .
right from the beginning , poland has been in favor of the process of the enlargement of the european union , without putting down any conditions of a political and organizational character .
these have , in any case , been included in the treaties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk and poland are set to take the eu presidency in just over a year nevertheless , we shall always be asking ourselves and other europeans , as well as those who want to join the union , do you share our system of values ?
do you want to participate in this union which takes responsibility for itself , where every person is ready to help another ?
and a union where solidarity or freedom are not mere empty slogans ?
we shall ask these questions also of the turks , ukrainians and all those who apply to become members .
but we have examples closer to home , in the sense of realistic possibilities , such as croatia or serbia .
and it appears that under no circumstances can europe become closed .
even , if for germany or for others , today 's experience of greece may be prompting us to think , let 's be careful with those who do n't live up to the crisis or who have not played by the book .
but is it really the case that the core european countries have always played by the book ?
is it really the case that some can point their finger and say , we are fit to be in -lsb- the union -rsb- , but you are not fit ?
everybody has to do their homework on this crisis , everybody , without any exceptions .
the eurozone is wobbly .
and even , possibly , falling apart at the seams .
although you are not obliged to , you want to help greece .
are you still keen for poland to join the common currency , to adopt the euro , as soon as possible ?
just as is the case for the european union , so it is for the eurozone : it should n't be a club for the countries which have joined , but then each one will do as it likes .
the eurozone can not afford for the grim experience of the recent months to be repeated ever again .
poland wants to become a member of the eurozone as soon as possible by fulfilling the criteria which have been agreed to by all .
today , we point our finger at the greeks or talk about possible problems for other mediterranean countries , but we all remember that even the most stable of the union 's members which also belong to the eurozone also have a case to answer when it comes to fulfilling the criteria and sticking to fiscal discipline .
in just over a year , poland will take over the presidency of the european union .
for six months , your hand will be at the helm of the eu .
what ideas will you be especially keen to ' sell ' to europe ?

we live in the european union under the lisbon treaty .
this is not the time nor place to explain all the aspects of the treaty , and i am a sober and common-sense politician and i know well that the presidency is very important , but the european union has its powers that be .
poland has a positive role to play during its presidency , but my common sense prompts me to say that the decisions will not be mine to take .
i will be jointly responsible , and not the one who makes the decisions .
it has been just over a month since the death of president lech kaczynski and 95 outstanding poles .
it was a difficult time for poland , which also brought hope for a polish-russian reconciliation .
what can poland and russia , acting together , offer to europe ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent death of polish president lech kaczynski and many elites shook the country first of all , this greatest of tragedies that the world has seen , when it comes to the death toll of government elites , shook to the core our minds and our hearts .
a genuine sense of mourning was pervasive in poland .
but it did not shake the country .
everybody watched with admiration how poles and the polish nation coped with the turn of events .
and we are really trying to draw positive conclusions for the future from this tragedy .
also political ones .
also regarding improving relations between poland and russia , because they are the key to good relations between europe and russia .
such were my aims also before the catastrophe , but both my aims and the efforts of the russian leaders , which i appreciate , have acquired a sense of urgency precisely due to the catastrophe .
therefore , if this is to be the legacy of those who died in the crash near smolensk , then maybe the most important thing is that this legacy becomes a positive factor in furthering understanding - rather than conflicts - between nations .

but they did find corroboration for accusations of physical abuse and misuse of funds . former catholic bishop walter mixa has been cleared of allegations that he sexually abused children , prosecutors said friday .
but their investigation confirmed claims that he beat children while working at a children 's home .
he is also under investigation for improperly using funds meant for the home .
a special investigator , sebastian knott , told news agency dpa that about a dozen former residents of the home gave credible testimony regarding physical abuse by mixa .
mixa served as the parish priest of the southern town of schrobenhausen from 1975 to 1996 , and oversaw the board which administered the children 's home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mixa was head of this children 's home before becoming bishop the residents said that mixa punched children or beat them with sticks or belts , and allegedly beat one girl until she could not stand .

the abuse allegedly took place in the 1970s , when the victims were between six and 15 years old .
" he often said sentences such as : ' satan is in you , i will drive him out of you , " ' said knott , quoting a man who had lived in the home as a child .
another witness said that beatings were sometimes accompanied by mixa shouting " child of god , take this punishment and repent . "
misuse of funds ?
knott said allegations that mixa had misused the home 's money could not be disproven .
" there are a few articles which mr. mixa had purchased , but which never turned up in the home , " knott said .
the total loss would add up to about 30,000 euros .
mixa , 69 , served as the bishop of augsburg until stepping down in april , after admitting that he had given some children " a cuff or two around the ear 20 years ago . "
in his resignation letter , he asked forgiveness from the victims and apologized for his behavior .

" probably i ca n't live there any more , " said vilks , who was not home at the time .
" the damage is rather minor ; part of the front is blackened and some windows were broken , " scanie district police spokeswoman sofie oesterheim told news agency agence france-presse .
" the fire went out by itself . "
police found glass bottles containing petrol in the house and are treating the attack as arson .
string of attacks the incident comes just days after vilks was beaten while giving a lecture at uppsala university in sweden .
vilks , who depicted the prophet muhammad with the body of a dog for swedish daily nerikes allehanda in 2007 , has been targeted by muslim extremists ever since .
an al-qaida organization has offered $ 100,000 -lrb- 80,900 euros -rrb- to anyone who would murder vilks .
danish cartoonist kurt westergaard , who showed muhammad with a bomb-shaped turban in a danish newspaper in 2005 , has also been subject to attacks by outraged muslims , who believe any depiction of the prophet is blasphemous .
in january , a somali man was charged with terrorism and attempted murder for breaking into westergaard 's home .
westergaard 's and vilks ' cartoons have sparked outrage across the muslim world , with at least 50 people killed in riots in the middle east , africa and asia .

more than 700 companies demonstrated their appetite for a slice of the asian market at this year 's asia-pacific conference for german business .
business opportunities in asia are nothing new - many german companies have been steadily investing in the region for decades .
martin brudermueller is a board member of chemical giant basf responsible for asia pacific .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basf is looking to build on opportunities in asia " it is very important that when operating in asia , most of the products are made on site , " said brudermueller .
" that 's why more than 60 percent of the products we sell here are also locally produced . "
although basf was founded in mannheim , they now have hundreds of production sites around the world , and around 50 of those are in asia .
basf said they are now concentrating on boosting their market share there .
" it should be kept in mind that of the 750-billion-euro -lrb- $ 931.9 billion -rrb- chemical market predicted for 2020 , 500 billion of that is in asia .
therefore , asia is the growth market for basf , " brudermueller said .
growth in troubled times basf is not the only german company to benefit from links to asian economies .
the precious metals and technology company heraeus can thank the region for an encouraging start to 2010 .
" business in america and europe is going backwards , as so many factories have closed down , " said heraeus ceo juergen heraeus .
the heraeus family business , which has its base in frankfurt , has now been in asia for 70 years .
over 40 percent of their production is based in the region .
" when the companies have customers in asia , it makes sense to expand business in asia - and here everything moves very quickly .
in one year here you can start up a factory and begin production , " heraeus added .
piracy problems while it may be quick to set up production in asia , this also means that counterfeiters can adapt and copy european products in no time at all .
technology theft is a big problem , and piracy is becoming an increasingly expensive issue to deal with .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german economic minister rainer bruederle attended the singapore conference michael schadlich , chairman of the german company dorma , says they are always on the lookout for pirated material .
" normally when this happens we shut down production , " he said .
" but we are fooling ourselves . "
" it 's a bit like lawn mowing : you mow the lawn on saturday but then one week later you need to do it all over again , " schadlich said .
attempts to combat piracy , despite costing companies thousands of euros , are considered a worthwhile investment .
piracy aside , german companies know they can do good business in asia .
the biggest winners are those firms who took their chances early with the asian market .
the others are still struggling to catch up .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 15.05.2010 polish prime minister calls for europe to become a closer union großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk won the charlemagne prize on thursday polish prime minister donald tusk has won the 2010 charlemagne prize in aachen .
in an interview with deutsche welle he spoke about the future of the eu , about integration , expansion and the bloc 's international role . polish prime minister donald tusk is the 2010 recipient of the charlemagne prize , an annual award that recognizes efforts in promoting european understanding .
tusk received the prize in aachen on may 13 , with the charlemagne judges praising him for steering poland away from nationalism and bringing the former soviet-bloc country into the heart of europe .
deutsche welle had a chance to speak with the prime minister about his vision for the future of the european union and the issues surrounding the bloc : integration , expansion of the eurozone , shared defense and its international presence .
deutsche welle : in the words of the judges , you are " a convinced and a convincing european . "
what is your vision of europe for europeans , and also its dealings with the rest of the world ?
donald tusk : for all those who understand the meaning of freedom , the meaning of human rights , the meaning of respect for tradition - for all those who have faith in themselves , in their own potential - europe is , first and foremost , the best model for europeans .
europe is understood as a union , the european union - but it is also a continuing dream and a continuing challenge .
sometimes , especially in the so-called old europe , i hear doubting voices , that europe is not proving itself ; that times of crisis have shown that the european union is not up to the challenges .
and we , the polish people , but also many other europeans , reply that it is precisely at such critical moments that the idea of europe , or the union of free people , who believe in their potential and in fundamental values , becomes the most attractive challenge .
and , as i have been repeating frequently over the last few weeks , the more difficult and painful our experiences , the more the doubting voices arise all around , the more we need to hold high the european flag , affirm the conviction that this is a phenomenal invention : the european family .
we must repeat this all the louder and raise the rallying cry all the higher .
bildunterschrift : the polish leader was praised for steering poland away from nationalism what should the model for the european union be ?
a europe of nation states , or the united states of europe ?
which should we aim for ?
i think that , very often , discussion about the future of europe is a discussion about banal , empty slogans .
a moment of historic reflection and common sense is enough to understand that nations will remain nations ; poles will feel polish .
and germans , german .
the french , french .
and so on .
this is as true about nations as it is about smaller ethnic groups .
we shall remain true to our religions .
we shall remain faithful to our customs , while at the same time being aware that europe needs to be an ever closer union ; it needs to think more effectively about its security , including energy security .
in the global world , a europe divided by conflicting interests and conflicting values does n't stand a chance .
but a europe that can rise above these differences while not negating them has a chance to become one of the key world powers , and that is our shared dream .
you say europe should be more integrated , and you talk about europe as a union of values and not merely a continent .
is further enlargement of the eu the way to steam ahead under the present circumstances ?
and , if so , should all the balkan countries and turkey become members of this united europe ?
the greatness of europe has also been based on the fact that europe has shown magnanimity and patience for those who wanted to participate – not in a mechanical , empty political union , but in a union which respects all these values , a union aware of what the foundations of europe are .
this is why i would direct the question about further enlargement of the european union equally to brussels , to the capitals of the european union , as well as to the candidate countries themselves .
right from the beginning , poland has been in favor of the process of the enlargement of the european union , without putting down any conditions of a political and organizational character .
these have , in any case , been included in the treaties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk and poland are set to take the eu presidency in just over a year nevertheless , we shall always be asking ourselves and other europeans , as well as those who want to join the union , do you share our system of values ?
do you want to participate in this union which takes responsibility for itself , where every person is ready to help another ?
and a union where solidarity or freedom are not mere empty slogans ?
we shall ask these questions also of the turks , ukrainians and all those who apply to become members .
but we have examples closer to home , in the sense of realistic possibilities , such as croatia or serbia .
and it appears that under no circumstances can europe become closed .
even , if for germany or for others , today 's experience of greece may be prompting us to think , let 's be careful with those who do n't live up to the crisis or who have not played by the book .
but is it really the case that the core european countries have always played by the book ?
is it really the case that some can point their finger and say , we are fit to be in -lsb- the union -rsb- , but you are not fit ?
everybody has to do their homework on this crisis , everybody , without any exceptions .
the eurozone is wobbly .
and even , possibly , falling apart at the seams .
although you are not obliged to , you want to help greece .
are you still keen for poland to join the common currency , to adopt the euro , as soon as possible ?
just as is the case for the european union , so it is for the eurozone : it should n't be a club for the countries which have joined , but then each one will do as it likes .
the eurozone can not afford for the grim experience of the recent months to be repeated ever again .
poland wants to become a member of the eurozone as soon as possible by fulfilling the criteria which have been agreed to by all .
today , we point our finger at the greeks or talk about possible problems for other mediterranean countries , but we all remember that even the most stable of the union 's members which also belong to the eurozone also have a case to answer when it comes to fulfilling the criteria and sticking to fiscal discipline .
in just over a year , poland will take over the presidency of the european union .
for six months , your hand will be at the helm of the eu .
what ideas will you be especially keen to ' sell ' to europe ?
what will matter to you the most ?
we live in the european union under the lisbon treaty .
this is not the time nor place to explain all the aspects of the treaty , and i am a sober and common-sense politician and i know well that the presidency is very important , but the european union has its powers that be .
poland has a positive role to play during its presidency , but my common sense prompts me to say that the decisions will not be mine to take .
i will be jointly responsible , and not the one who makes the decisions .
it has been just over a month since the death of president lech kaczynski and 95 outstanding poles .
it was a difficult time for poland , which also brought hope for a polish-russian reconciliation .
what can poland and russia , acting together , offer to europe ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent death of polish president lech kaczynski and many elites shook the country first of all , this greatest of tragedies that the world has seen , when it comes to the death toll of government elites , shook to the core our minds and our hearts .
a genuine sense of mourning was pervasive in poland .
but it did not shake the country .
everybody watched with admiration how poles and the polish nation coped with the turn of events .
and we are really trying to draw positive conclusions for the future from this tragedy .
also political ones .
also regarding improving relations between poland and russia , because they are the key to good relations between europe and russia .
such were my aims also before the catastrophe , but both my aims and the efforts of the russian leaders , which i appreciate , have acquired a sense of urgency precisely due to the catastrophe .
therefore , if this is to be the legacy of those who died in the crash near smolensk , then maybe the most important thing is that this legacy becomes a positive factor in furthering understanding - rather than conflicts - between nations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 15.05.2010 new nato strategy must square the circle between old and new threats großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's secretary general commissioned the strategy review by the expert panel for the first time since 1999 , nato is devising a new strategic concept .
the group of experts tasked with drafting the paper must tackle not only a changed security environment , but also different threat perceptions . it is merely 11 years , but in terms of the geopolitical developments that have occurred since nato last adapted its strategic concept , it was a different era .
while the cold war had come to an end with the fall of the berlin wall a decade earlier , it was still largely unclear what global trends and events would shape the next era .
the attacks of september 11 in 2001 brutally ended this interval , launching an era where islamic terrorism , asymetric threats , counterinsurgency warfare and failing states quickly became the new currency in the international debate on global security .
nato has repeatedly discussed what the changed geopolitcal landscape means for the venerable institution .
but it has n't - until now - framed and formalized the allliance 's response to these challenges in a revised doctrine .
to do just that , to develop a new strategic concept , was the task given to former us secretary of state madeleine albright and a group of international experts .
and it is n't just the world that has changed since nato 's last concept introduced in 1999 .
nato has changed itself , explains latvia 's foreign minister aivis ronis , who was part of the expert group until he resigned in early may after accepting the post as his country 's top diplomat .
new members " since many central and eastern european states , including the baltic countries , have joined nato in 2004 and of course have not participated in drafting the strategic concept of 1999 , for the first time in these open seminars and conferences central and eastern europeans could contribute to the common vision of nato and the transatlantic community regarding security , threats and challenges and global changes , " says ronis .
" this is an historic experience for the central and eastern european countries and especially for the baltic states . "
due to their recent history with and proximity to russia , many of these newer countries have a different view of nato 's main priorities than some of the alliance 's older and larger members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's new members bring new perspectives to the alliance " the strategy will have to cope with fears which exist in eastern europe primarily with regard to russia , i.e. article 5 -lrb- collective defense - ed . -rrb- , " says fred tanner , director of the geneva center for security policy , who served as a rapporteur on one of the seminars held by the group of experts .
" on the other hand of course you have other countries like france or the uk who have more of an interest to use nato together with the us outside of nato . "
the experts agree that , as latvia 's foreign minister puts it , there needs to be a synergy of territorial defense and the promotion of stability security outside of nato 's traditional realm of influence .
new and old threats but , karl kaiser , director of the program on transatlantic relations at the weatherhead center for international affairs at harvard university , argues that collective defense as laid out in article 5 of the nato treaty ca n't be the alliance 's raison d 'etre . " article 5 should not dissappear , " says kaiser who testified before the group of experts last year .
" of course if a country gets attacked , the others have to come to its assistance , but that is not the main reason for the alliance today .
the main reason is elsewhere .
so we have to reconcile the two , we have to have both , but we should n't put article 5 at the top anymore and do , as some of these countries want , exercizes looking at the potential of russian aggression . "
the underlying dilemma for nato and the group of experts is the lack of a common threat perception within the new , larger alliance .
and this threat assessment gap does n't just exist between newer and older members , it is also evident between european members and the us .
while the us wants nato to focus much more on counter-terrorism efforts outside nato territory , many european members are deeply skeptical about such a global military role as exemplified by the debate over the afghanistan mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group of experts visited moscow to engage russia as well flexibility needed for nato and the group of experts , this means the new concept must try and square the circle .
" the strategy will have to be flexible , " says tanner .
it will have to take into account different threat perceptions and various contingencies , both inside nato 's traditional transatlantic realm of influence and beyond .
to do just that , to ensure that nato can act in classical military fashion against an outside aggressor and at the same time can engage in counter-terrorism activities and state-building measures in asia or africa could be easier on paper than in practice .
especially in times of tight budgets and with nato members like greece on the brink of financial collapse .
despite these steep challenges , nato is indispensable , argue the experts .
" nato is needed for the security of our people , defending our democracy and promoting peace and stability in this very unpredictable , very uncertain and very complex world , " says ronis .
" nato 's big advantage today is that it has the ability to act in a robust environment , " argues tanner .
" it can use force if necessary .
and it is actually the only organization which has this capability with a certain projection of power . "
to harness that unique power , a convincing new strategy laid out by the panel of experts would be a good start , says kaiser : " it should n't be too long , it should n't be some bland lowest common denominator , but be sharp in defining the threats to modern society and what modern societies have to do in order to deal with these new threats .

" according to the information available to us so far , google has for years penetrated private networks , apparently illegally , " aigner said in a statement on saturday .
the " alarming incident " showed that google still lacks understanding for the need for privacy , according to the statement .
privacy breach google 's fleet of street view cars , photographing streets for its online map program , has been collecting more data than previously thought .
after reviewing a system in the cars that recorded names and addresses of wireless networks detected along the routes , google revealed that a programming error had led to small amounts of personal data to be collected from unsecured wi-fi networks .
" it 's now clear that we have been mistakenly collecting samples of payload data from open wi-fi networks , " google 's head of engineering alan eustace said in a blog posting .
the blog post did not specify what kinds of personal data had been collected but indicated it could be things such as email and web browsing history .
however , since the data had been collected by moving vehicles , only fragments of information were recorded .
google regretted its mistake and would look for a way to destroy the personal data .
" maintaining people 's trust is crucial to everything we do , and in this case we fell short , " said eustace in the blog post .
google reviewed its data collection methods in response to an inquiry from the data protection authority in hamburg .
the google street view service allows users to " walk " along panoramic street views in many countries , using images recorded by specially-outfitted cars .
the fleet of cars around the world has been halted for the time being as google attempts to fix the glitch .

" according to the information available to us so far , google has for years penetrated private networks , apparently illegally , " aigner said in a statement on saturday .
the " alarming incident " showed that google still lacks understanding for the need for privacy , according to the statement .
privacy breach google 's fleet of street view cars , photographing streets for its online map program , has been collecting more data than previously thought .
after reviewing a system in the cars that recorded names and addresses of wireless networks detected along the routes , google revealed that a programming error had led to small amounts of personal data to be collected from unsecured wi-fi networks .
" it 's now clear that we have been mistakenly collecting samples of payload data from open wi-fi networks , " google 's head of engineering alan eustace said in a blog posting .
the blog post did not specify what kinds of personal data had been collected but indicated it could be things such as email and web browsing history .
however , since the data had been collected by moving vehicles , only fragments of information were recorded .
google regretted its mistake and would look for a way to destroy the personal data .
" maintaining people 's trust is crucial to everything we do , and in this case we fell short , " said eustace in the blog post .
google reviewed its data collection methods in response to an inquiry from the data protection authority in hamburg .

goals from arjen robben , ivica olic , franck ribery and bastian schweinsteiger allowed the bavarians to claim the second leg of a potential bundesliga , dfb-pokal and champions league treble .
although bayern were not at their free-flowing best , clinical second-half finishing from louis van gaal 's side saw them ease to a comfortable victory .
bremen , returning to berlin to defend the cup they won a year ago , had few answers to their opponents ' dominance , and the dismissal of their captain torsten frings was symptomatic of their frustration in the closing stages .
" the result was clearer than the game actually was .
we went 2-0 -lsb- ahead -rsb- at the perfect time , " bayern defender philipp lahm said after the game .
" we really want to get the treble . "
" i think it was one of the best games that we played this season , " said van gaal .
" i told my players that it was important to win , but also how we won . "
a full-strength bayern team took the initiative from the opening minutes , and never let go of it .
despite coach thomas schaaf 's clear instructions for his bremen players to double up on in-form arjen robben , the winger was at the heart of his side 's best work in the first half .
tim wiese in the bremen goal was called on as early as the third minute , tipping a long-range robben effort over the bar .
the dutchman then found himself on the left , playing in ivica olic , who failed to find the net from not more than five yards .
olic was heavily involved in the opening goal though .
the croatian striker 's flick hit the hand of per mertesacker just inside the penalty and , although the big german defender could have known little about it from such close range , the referee pointed to the spot .
wiese guessed the right way , but robben 's penalty was hit hard and low and found the corner , to give bayern a 35th-minute lead .
the floodgates open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's torsten frings , right , was sent off at the 77th minute mertesacker was unlucky again for the second goal shortly after half-time .
his attempt to head clear deflected into the path of olic , who poked home a classic predator 's finish .
with bremen pushing up to try and get something back , ribery put the game to bed in the 63rd minute .
the frenchman was played through by mark van bommel and finished coolly , before sliding on the wet turf by the corner flag in memorable celebration .
former bayern midfielder frings was shown a second yellow with 15 minutes to go , catching bastian schweinsteiger late as bayern played keep-ball in the closing stages , and barely waiting to see the referee produce the red before he left the pitch .
schweinsteiger relinquished himself from a disciplined midfield role in the final minutes , taking philipp lahm 's lofted ball on the chest and volleying inside the far corner of the net for bayern 's fourth .
" the first half was great , in the second , we scored the goals , " said bayern striker thomas mueller .
" such a result is like a dream . "
closer to the treble the scoreline was harsh on werder bremen , who came into the game on the back of some fine late-season bundesliga form .
they could have taken the lead inside the first ten minutes , joerg butt in the bayern goal making an excellent double-save after claudio pizarro got in .
pizarro was too often isolated up front though , mesut oezil and aaron hunt failing to get the cup holders ' passing game going in very wet conditions in berlin .
" bayern dominated the game and i can only congratulate them , " admitted bremen coach schaaf .
bayern must wish they could play at the olympic stadium every day .
on two consecutive saturdays , captain van bommel has now lifted domestic silverware in the capital .
bayern wrapped up the domestic title with a 3-1 win over hertha berlin last weekend , and , with the dfb-pokal now secured , travel to madrid next weekend knowing that victory over internazionale would see them complete an unprecedented treble .
with seemingly no instructions to take it easy before next week 's game , bayern players celebrated hard after the final whistle .

goals from arjen robben , ivica olic , franck ribery and bastian schweinsteiger allowed the bavarians to claim the second leg of a potential bundesliga , dfb-pokal and champions league treble .
although bayern were not at their free-flowing best , clinical second-half finishing from louis van gaal 's side saw them ease to a comfortable victory .
bremen , returning to berlin to defend the cup they won a year ago , had few answers to their opponents ' dominance , and the dismissal of their captain torsten frings was symptomatic of their frustration in the closing stages .
" the result was clearer than the game actually was .
we went 2-0 -lsb- ahead -rsb- at the perfect time , " bayern defender philipp lahm said after the game .
" we really want to get the treble . "
" i think it was one of the best games that we played this season , " said van gaal .
" i told my players that it was important to win , but also how we won . "
a full-strength bayern team took the initiative from the opening minutes , and never let go of it .
despite coach thomas schaaf 's clear instructions for his bremen players to double up on in-form arjen robben , the winger was at the heart of his side 's best work in the first half .
tim wiese in the bremen goal was called on as early as the third minute , tipping a long-range robben effort over the bar .
the dutchman then found himself on the left , playing in ivica olic , who failed to find the net from not more than five yards .
olic was heavily involved in the opening goal though .
the croatian striker 's flick hit the hand of per mertesacker just inside the penalty and , although the big german defender could have known little about it from such close range , the referee pointed to the spot .
wiese guessed the right way , but robben 's penalty was hit hard and low and found the corner , to give bayern a 35th-minute lead .
the floodgates open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's torsten frings , right , was sent off at the 77th minute mertesacker was unlucky again for the second goal shortly after half-time .
his attempt to head clear deflected into the path of olic , who poked home a classic predator 's finish .
with bremen pushing up to try and get something back , ribery put the game to bed in the 63rd minute .
the frenchman was played through by mark van bommel and finished coolly , before sliding on the wet turf by the corner flag in memorable celebration .
former bayern midfielder frings was shown a second yellow with 15 minutes to go , catching bastian schweinsteiger late as bayern played keep-ball in the closing stages , and barely waiting to see the referee produce the red before he left the pitch .
schweinsteiger relinquished himself from a disciplined midfield role in the final minutes , taking philipp lahm 's lofted ball on the chest and volleying inside the far corner of the net for bayern 's fourth .
" the first half was great , in the second , we scored the goals , " said bayern striker thomas mueller .
" such a result is like a dream . "
closer to the treble the scoreline was harsh on werder bremen , who came into the game on the back of some fine late-season bundesliga form .
they could have taken the lead inside the first ten minutes , joerg butt in the bayern goal making an excellent double-save after claudio pizarro got in .
pizarro was too often isolated up front though , mesut oezil and aaron hunt failing to get the cup holders ' passing game going in very wet conditions in berlin .
" bayern dominated the game and i can only congratulate them , " admitted bremen coach schaaf .
bayern must wish they could play at the olympic stadium every day .
on two consecutive saturdays , captain van bommel has now lifted domestic silverware in the capital .
bayern wrapped up the domestic title with a 3-1 win over hertha berlin last weekend , and , with the dfb-pokal now secured , travel to madrid next weekend knowing that victory over internazionale would see them complete an unprecedented treble .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 15.05.2010 europe 's single currency down , but not out großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been dark days for the euro recently the euro has fallen in value to its lowest level in over a year as massive bailout packages to save greece and the eurozone fly out of eu coffers .
despite the tough times , eu leaders are staying the course . at times in recent weeks it 's felt a bit like a contest : what new low will the euro sink to next ?
on friday , the common currency shared by 16 of the european union members sank to its lowest level in 18 months , briefly trading at $ 1.2358 .
as recently as last summer , the euro was pushing $ 1.50 .
the causes of the drastic decline in the euro 's value are not difficult to discern .
budget deficit problems across europe - most notably in greece - and massive bailout packages designed to prop up ailing economies have caused financial markets to lose faith in the euro , causing some speculation that the existence of the euro itself was being threatened .
european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- president jean-claude trichet is n't sugarcoating the issue .
in an interview with the german magazine der spiegel , he said europe is in the most difficult situation since world war ii , possibly even since world war i.
' quantum leap ' in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet knows the euro has seen better days , but is confident things can be fixed despite the dire straits , however , trichet sees a way out of the crisis .
" what we need is a quantum leap in mutual surveillance of economic policies in europe , " trichet told spiegel .
" we need improved mechanisms to prevent and punish misconduct . "
part of the problem in the eurozone comes from countries ignoring the european stability and growth pact , which sets a budget deficit limit of three percent of a country 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
most eu countries have exceeded this limit , and greece is four times over the mark .
trichet called for " effective sanctions for breaches of the stability and growth pact . "
defending the euro in germany , chancellor angela merkel echoed some of trichet 's sentiments in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper and defended her own decisions to support a financial rescue package for greece .
" when the stability of the euro is threatened , we ca n't evade our responsibility , " merkel told the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" with our guarantee package from the entire eurozone for greece , we 're ensuring that the common currency remains stable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and trichet agree : eu nations need to do a better job of balancing the books she added that europe , as a whole , needed to get its public budgets in order and reduce debts in the years ahead .
merkel 's decision to back aid for greece was not popular with many germans , while the opposition in parliament criticized that her initial reluctance to send money to athens only exacerbated the situation in greece and made the financial bailout more expensive than it needed to be .
however , merkel maintained she just wanted to make sure all legal and economic bases had been covered , and reiterated her stance that sending help to greece was only done in the wider interest of the euro .
" we all know , if the euro fails , more failures will follow , " she said , adding that the only way to ensure the stability of the euro in the future was a convergence of financial policies in europe. mz / reuters / apn / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german businesses are capitalizing on that optimism in the asian market . although the financial crisis and problems with the euro are hanging over the economy in germany , there is a sense of optimism in asia . economies there are expecting several years of growth , and it is hoped this may boost german business , too .
more than 700 companies demonstrated their appetite for a slice of the asian market at this year 's asia-pacific conference for german business .
business opportunities in asia are nothing new - many german companies have been steadily investing in the region for decades .
martin brudermueller is a board member of chemical giant basf responsible for asia pacific .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basf is looking to build on opportunities in asia " it is very important that when operating in asia , most of the products are made on site , " said brudermueller .
" that 's why more than 60 percent of the products we sell here are also locally produced . "
although basf was founded in mannheim , they now have hundreds of production sites around the world , and around 50 of those are in asia .
basf said they are now concentrating on boosting their market share there .
" it should be kept in mind that of the 750-billion-euro -lrb- $ 931.9 billion -rrb- chemical market predicted for 2020 , 500 billion of that is in asia .
therefore , asia is the growth market for basf , " brudermueller said .
growth in troubled times basf is not the only german company to benefit from links to asian economies .
the precious metals and technology company heraeus can thank the region for an encouraging start to 2010 .
" business in america and europe is going backwards , as so many factories have closed down , " said heraeus ceo juergen heraeus .
the heraeus family business , which has its base in frankfurt , has now been in asia for 70 years .
over 40 percent of their production is based in the region .
" when the companies have customers in asia , it makes sense to expand business in asia - and here everything moves very quickly .
in one year here you can start up a factory and begin production , " heraeus added .
piracy problems while it may be quick to set up production in asia , this also means that counterfeiters can adapt and copy european products in no time at all .
technology theft is a big problem , and piracy is becoming an increasingly expensive issue to deal with .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german economic minister rainer bruederle attended the singapore conference michael schadlich , chairman of the german company dorma , says they are always on the lookout for pirated material .
" normally when this happens we shut down production , " he said .
" but we are fooling ourselves . "
" it 's a bit like lawn mowing : you mow the lawn on saturday but then one week later you need to do it all over again , " schadlich said .
attempts to combat piracy , despite costing companies thousands of euros , are considered a worthwhile investment .
piracy aside , german companies know they can do good business in asia .
the biggest winners are those firms who took their chances early with the asian market .
the others are still struggling to catch up .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 15.05.2010 europe 's single currency down , but not out großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been dark days for the euro recently the euro has fallen in value to its lowest level in over a year as massive bailout packages to save greece and the eurozone fly out of eu coffers .
despite the tough times , eu leaders are staying the course . at times in recent weeks it 's felt a bit like a contest : what new low will the euro sink to next ?
on friday , the common currency shared by 16 of the european union members sank to its lowest level in 18 months , briefly trading at $ 1.2358 .
as recently as last summer , the euro was pushing $ 1.50 .
the causes of the drastic decline in the euro 's value are not difficult to discern .
budget deficit problems across europe - most notably in greece - and massive bailout packages designed to prop up ailing economies have caused financial markets to lose faith in the euro , causing some speculation that the existence of the euro itself was being threatened .
european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- president jean-claude trichet is n't sugarcoating the issue .
in an interview with the german magazine der spiegel , he said europe is in the most difficult situation since world war ii , possibly even since world war i.
' quantum leap ' in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet knows the euro has seen better days , but is confident things can be fixed despite the dire straits , however , trichet sees a way out of the crisis .
" what we need is a quantum leap in mutual surveillance of economic policies in europe , " trichet told spiegel .
" we need improved mechanisms to prevent and punish misconduct . "
part of the problem in the eurozone comes from countries ignoring the european stability and growth pact , which sets a budget deficit limit of three percent of a country 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
most eu countries have exceeded this limit , and greece is four times over the mark .
trichet called for " effective sanctions for breaches of the stability and growth pact . "
defending the euro in germany , chancellor angela merkel echoed some of trichet 's sentiments in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper and defended her own decisions to support a financial rescue package for greece .
" when the stability of the euro is threatened , we ca n't evade our responsibility , " merkel told the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" with our guarantee package from the entire eurozone for greece , we 're ensuring that the common currency remains stable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and trichet agree : eu nations need to do a better job of balancing the books she added that europe , as a whole , needed to get its public budgets in order and reduce debts in the years ahead .
merkel 's decision to back aid for greece was not popular with many germans , while the opposition in parliament criticized that her initial reluctance to send money to athens only exacerbated the situation in greece and made the financial bailout more expensive than it needed to be .
however , merkel maintained she just wanted to make sure all legal and economic bases had been covered , and reiterated her stance that sending help to greece was only done in the wider interest of the euro .
" we all know , if the euro fails , more failures will follow , " she said , adding that the only way to ensure the stability of the euro in the future was a convergence of financial policies in europe. mz / reuters / apn / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de ackermann interview sparks debate on greek rescue deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann told german public television that he doubted greece could pay off its debt .

german businesses are capitalizing on that optimism in the asian market . although the financial crisis and problems with the euro are hanging over the economy in germany , there is a sense of optimism in asia . economies there are expecting several years of growth , and it is hoped this may boost german business , too .
more than 700 companies demonstrated their appetite for a slice of the asian market at this year 's asia-pacific conference for german business .
business opportunities in asia are nothing new - many german companies have been steadily investing in the region for decades .
martin brudermueller is a board member of chemical giant basf responsible for asia pacific .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basf is looking to build on opportunities in asia " it is very important that when operating in asia , most of the products are made on site , " said brudermueller .
" that 's why more than 60 percent of the products we sell here are also locally produced . "
although basf was founded in mannheim , they now have hundreds of production sites around the world , and around 50 of those are in asia .
basf said they are now concentrating on boosting their market share there .
" it should be kept in mind that of the 750-billion-euro -lrb- $ 931.9 billion -rrb- chemical market predicted for 2020 , 500 billion of that is in asia .
therefore , asia is the growth market for basf , " brudermueller said .
growth in troubled times basf is not the only german company to benefit from links to asian economies .
the precious metals and technology company heraeus can thank the region for an encouraging start to 2010 .
" business in america and europe is going backwards , as so many factories have closed down , " said heraeus ceo juergen heraeus .
the heraeus family business , which has its base in frankfurt , has now been in asia for 70 years .
over 40 percent of their production is based in the region .
" when the companies have customers in asia , it makes sense to expand business in asia - and here everything moves very quickly .
in one year here you can start up a factory and begin production , " heraeus added .
piracy problems while it may be quick to set up production in asia , this also means that counterfeiters can adapt and copy european products in no time at all .
technology theft is a big problem , and piracy is becoming an increasingly expensive issue to deal with .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german economic minister rainer bruederle attended the singapore conference michael schadlich , chairman of the german company dorma , says they are always on the lookout for pirated material .
" normally when this happens we shut down production , " he said .
" but we are fooling ourselves . "
" it 's a bit like lawn mowing : you mow the lawn on saturday but then one week later you need to do it all over again , " schadlich said .
attempts to combat piracy , despite costing companies thousands of euros , are considered a worthwhile investment .
piracy aside , german companies know they can do good business in asia .
the biggest winners are those firms who took their chances early with the asian market .
the others are still struggling to catch up .

technology theft is a big problem , and piracy is becoming an increasingly expensive issue to deal with .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german economic minister rainer bruederle attended the singapore conference michael schadlich , chairman of the german company dorma , says they are always on the lookout for pirated material .
" normally when this happens we shut down production , " he said .
" but we are fooling ourselves . "
" it 's a bit like lawn mowing : you mow the lawn on saturday but then one week later you need to do it all over again , " schadlich said .
attempts to combat piracy , despite costing companies thousands of euros , are considered a worthwhile investment .
piracy aside , german companies know they can do good business in asia .
the biggest winners are those firms who took their chances early with the asian market .
the others are still struggling to catch up .

" according to the information available to us so far , google has for years penetrated private networks , apparently illegally , " aigner said in a statement on saturday .
the " alarming incident " showed that google still lacks understanding for the need for privacy , according to the statement .
privacy breach google 's fleet of street view cars , photographing streets for its online map program , has been collecting more data than previously thought .
after reviewing a system in the cars that recorded names and addresses of wireless networks detected along the routes , google revealed that a programming error had led to small amounts of personal data to be collected from unsecured wi-fi networks .
" it 's now clear that we have been mistakenly collecting samples of payload data from open wi-fi networks , " google 's head of engineering alan eustace said in a blog posting .
the blog post did not specify what kinds of personal data had been collected but indicated it could be things such as email and web browsing history .
however , since the data had been collected by moving vehicles , only fragments of information were recorded .
google regretted its mistake and would look for a way to destroy the personal data .
" maintaining people 's trust is crucial to everything we do , and in this case we fell short , " said eustace in the blog post .
google reviewed its data collection methods in response to an inquiry from the data protection authority in hamburg .
the google street view service allows users to " walk " along panoramic street views in many countries , using images recorded by specially-outfitted cars .
the fleet of cars around the world has been halted for the time being as google attempts to fix the glitch .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : nato faces a changing world with new challenges nato and russia seek to bury past differences lightning-fast us-eu summit in lisbon aims to revive ties nato to withdraw from afghanistan by 2014 as summit begins , nato missile shield a test of turkey 's allegiance trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 15.05.2010 new nato strategy must square the circle between old and new threats großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's secretary general commissioned the strategy review by the expert panel for the first time since 1999 , nato is devising a new strategic concept .
the group of experts tasked with drafting the paper must tackle not only a changed security environment , but also different threat perceptions . it is merely 11 years , but in terms of the geopolitical developments that have occurred since nato last adapted its strategic concept , it was a different era .
while the cold war had come to an end with the fall of the berlin wall a decade earlier , it was still largely unclear what global trends and events would shape the next era .
the attacks of september 11 in 2001 brutally ended this interval , launching an era where islamic terrorism , asymetric threats , counterinsurgency warfare and failing states quickly became the new currency in the international debate on global security .
nato has repeatedly discussed what the changed geopolitcal landscape means for the venerable institution .
but it has n't - until now - framed and formalized the allliance 's response to these challenges in a revised doctrine .
to do just that , to develop a new strategic concept , was the task given to former us secretary of state madeleine albright and a group of international experts .
and it is n't just the world that has changed since nato 's last concept introduced in 1999 .
nato has changed itself , explains latvia 's foreign minister aivis ronis , who was part of the expert group until he resigned in early may after accepting the post as his country 's top diplomat .
new members " since many central and eastern european states , including the baltic countries , have joined nato in 2004 and of course have not participated in drafting the strategic concept of 1999 , for the first time in these open seminars and conferences central and eastern europeans could contribute to the common vision of nato and the transatlantic community regarding security , threats and challenges and global changes , " says ronis .
" this is an historic experience for the central and eastern european countries and especially for the baltic states . "
due to their recent history with and proximity to russia , many of these newer countries have a different view of nato 's main priorities than some of the alliance 's older and larger members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's new members bring new perspectives to the alliance " the strategy will have to cope with fears which exist in eastern europe primarily with regard to russia , i.e. article 5 -lrb- collective defense - ed . -rrb- , " says fred tanner , director of the geneva center for security policy , who served as a rapporteur on one of the seminars held by the group of experts .
" on the other hand of course you have other countries like france or the uk who have more of an interest to use nato together with the us outside of nato . "
the experts agree that , as latvia 's foreign minister puts it , there needs to be a synergy of territorial defense and the promotion of stability security outside of nato 's traditional realm of influence .
new and old threats but , karl kaiser , director of the program on transatlantic relations at the weatherhead center for international affairs at harvard university , argues that collective defense as laid out in article 5 of the nato treaty ca n't be the alliance 's raison d 'etre . " article 5 should not dissappear , " says kaiser who testified before the group of experts last year .
" of course if a country gets attacked , the others have to come to its assistance , but that is not the main reason for the alliance today .
the main reason is elsewhere .
so we have to reconcile the two , we have to have both , but we should n't put article 5 at the top anymore and do , as some of these countries want , exercizes looking at the potential of russian aggression . "
the underlying dilemma for nato and the group of experts is the lack of a common threat perception within the new , larger alliance .
and this threat assessment gap does n't just exist between newer and older members , it is also evident between european members and the us .
while the us wants nato to focus much more on counter-terrorism efforts outside nato territory , many european members are deeply skeptical about such a global military role as exemplified by the debate over the afghanistan mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group of experts visited moscow to engage russia as well flexibility needed for nato and the group of experts , this means the new concept must try and square the circle .
" the strategy will have to be flexible , " says tanner .
it will have to take into account different threat perceptions and various contingencies , both inside nato 's traditional transatlantic realm of influence and beyond .
to do just that , to ensure that nato can act in classical military fashion against an outside aggressor and at the same time can engage in counter-terrorism activities and state-building measures in asia or africa could be easier on paper than in practice .
especially in times of tight budgets and with nato members like greece on the brink of financial collapse .
despite these steep challenges , nato is indispensable , argue the experts .
" nato is needed for the security of our people , defending our democracy and promoting peace and stability in this very unpredictable , very uncertain and very complex world , " says ronis .
" nato 's big advantage today is that it has the ability to act in a robust environment , " argues tanner .
" it can use force if necessary .
and it is actually the only organization which has this capability with a certain projection of power . "
to harness that unique power , a convincing new strategy laid out by the panel of experts would be a good start , says kaiser : " it should n't be too long , it should n't be some bland lowest common denominator , but be sharp in defining the threats to modern society and what modern societies have to do in order to deal with these new threats .

the group of experts tasked with drafting the paper must tackle not only a changed security environment , but also different threat perceptions . it is merely 11 years , but in terms of the geopolitical developments that have occurred since nato last adapted its strategic concept , it was a different era .
while the cold war had come to an end with the fall of the berlin wall a decade earlier , it was still largely unclear what global trends and events would shape the next era .
the attacks of september 11 in 2001 brutally ended this interval , launching an era where islamic terrorism , asymetric threats , counterinsurgency warfare and failing states quickly became the new currency in the international debate on global security .
nato has repeatedly discussed what the changed geopolitcal landscape means for the venerable institution .
but it has n't - until now - framed and formalized the allliance 's response to these challenges in a revised doctrine .
to do just that , to develop a new strategic concept , was the task given to former us secretary of state madeleine albright and a group of international experts .
and it is n't just the world that has changed since nato 's last concept introduced in 1999 .
nato has changed itself , explains latvia 's foreign minister aivis ronis , who was part of the expert group until he resigned in early may after accepting the post as his country 's top diplomat .
new members " since many central and eastern european states , including the baltic countries , have joined nato in 2004 and of course have not participated in drafting the strategic concept of 1999 , for the first time in these open seminars and conferences central and eastern europeans could contribute to the common vision of nato and the transatlantic community regarding security , threats and challenges and global changes , " says ronis .
" this is an historic experience for the central and eastern european countries and especially for the baltic states . "
due to their recent history with and proximity to russia , many of these newer countries have a different view of nato 's main priorities than some of the alliance 's older and larger members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's new members bring new perspectives to the alliance " the strategy will have to cope with fears which exist in eastern europe primarily with regard to russia , i.e. article 5 -lrb- collective defense - ed . -rrb- , " says fred tanner , director of the geneva center for security policy , who served as a rapporteur on one of the seminars held by the group of experts .
" on the other hand of course you have other countries like france or the uk who have more of an interest to use nato together with the us outside of nato . "

the group of experts tasked with drafting the paper must tackle not only a changed security environment , but also different threat perceptions . it is merely 11 years , but in terms of the geopolitical developments that have occurred since nato last adapted its strategic concept , it was a different era .
while the cold war had come to an end with the fall of the berlin wall a decade earlier , it was still largely unclear what global trends and events would shape the next era .
the attacks of september 11 in 2001 brutally ended this interval , launching an era where islamic terrorism , asymetric threats , counterinsurgency warfare and failing states quickly became the new currency in the international debate on global security .
nato has repeatedly discussed what the changed geopolitcal landscape means for the venerable institution .
but it has n't - until now - framed and formalized the allliance 's response to these challenges in a revised doctrine .
to do just that , to develop a new strategic concept , was the task given to former us secretary of state madeleine albright and a group of international experts .
and it is n't just the world that has changed since nato 's last concept introduced in 1999 .
nato has changed itself , explains latvia 's foreign minister aivis ronis , who was part of the expert group until he resigned in early may after accepting the post as his country 's top diplomat .
new members " since many central and eastern european states , including the baltic countries , have joined nato in 2004 and of course have not participated in drafting the strategic concept of 1999 , for the first time in these open seminars and conferences central and eastern europeans could contribute to the common vision of nato and the transatlantic community regarding security , threats and challenges and global changes , " says ronis .
" this is an historic experience for the central and eastern european countries and especially for the baltic states . "
due to their recent history with and proximity to russia , many of these newer countries have a different view of nato 's main priorities than some of the alliance 's older and larger members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's new members bring new perspectives to the alliance " the strategy will have to cope with fears which exist in eastern europe primarily with regard to russia , i.e. article 5 -lrb- collective defense - ed . -rrb- , " says fred tanner , director of the geneva center for security policy , who served as a rapporteur on one of the seminars held by the group of experts .
" on the other hand of course you have other countries like france or the uk who have more of an interest to use nato together with the us outside of nato . "
the experts agree that , as latvia 's foreign minister puts it , there needs to be a synergy of territorial defense and the promotion of stability security outside of nato 's traditional realm of influence .
new and old threats but , karl kaiser , director of the program on transatlantic relations at the weatherhead center for international affairs at harvard university , argues that collective defense as laid out in article 5 of the nato treaty ca n't be the alliance 's raison d 'etre . " article 5 should not dissappear , " says kaiser who testified before the group of experts last year .
" of course if a country gets attacked , the others have to come to its assistance , but that is not the main reason for the alliance today .
the main reason is elsewhere .
so we have to reconcile the two , we have to have both , but we should n't put article 5 at the top anymore and do , as some of these countries want , exercizes looking at the potential of russian aggression . "
the underlying dilemma for nato and the group of experts is the lack of a common threat perception within the new , larger alliance .
and this threat assessment gap does n't just exist between newer and older members , it is also evident between european members and the us .
while the us wants nato to focus much more on counter-terrorism efforts outside nato territory , many european members are deeply skeptical about such a global military role as exemplified by the debate over the afghanistan mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group of experts visited moscow to engage russia as well flexibility needed for nato and the group of experts , this means the new concept must try and square the circle .
" the strategy will have to be flexible , " says tanner .
it will have to take into account different threat perceptions and various contingencies , both inside nato 's traditional transatlantic realm of influence and beyond .
to do just that , to ensure that nato can act in classical military fashion against an outside aggressor and at the same time can engage in counter-terrorism activities and state-building measures in asia or africa could be easier on paper than in practice .
especially in times of tight budgets and with nato members like greece on the brink of financial collapse .
despite these steep challenges , nato is indispensable , argue the experts .
" nato is needed for the security of our people , defending our democracy and promoting peace and stability in this very unpredictable , very uncertain and very complex world , " says ronis .
" nato 's big advantage today is that it has the ability to act in a robust environment , " argues tanner .
" it can use force if necessary .
and it is actually the only organization which has this capability with a certain projection of power . "
to harness that unique power , a convincing new strategy laid out by the panel of experts would be a good start , says kaiser : " it should n't be too long , it should n't be some bland lowest common denominator , but be sharp in defining the threats to modern society and what modern societies have to do in order to deal with these new threats .
