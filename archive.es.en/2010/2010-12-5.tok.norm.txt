program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de christmas -pipe- 05.12.2010 racism controversy dampens holland 's sinterklaas tradition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. nicholas brings treats to kids in many european countries on december 6 children across europe eagerly await the arrival of st. nicholas on december 6 .
but in holland , the tradition has racist implications that the dutch are n't quite willing to give up . for the dutch , sinterklaasavond -lrb- st. nicholas eve -rrb- on december 5 is the biggest celebration of the year - bigger than christmas .
that evening , families gather and exchange presents , and children leave out their shoes in the hopes that sinterklaas will have fill them with candy by the next morning . what seems like a harmless holiday devoted to gifts , candy , and children , has a catch : sinterklaas ' helpers , the zwarte pieten or " black peters , " are portrayed according to degrading racial stereotypes . they 're typically dressed in 19th-century moorish outfits , curly afro wigs , and painted red lips .
it is common for both adults and children to dress up as zwarte piet , complete with their faces painted black . " zwarte piet is a person who is happy , who is the assistant of st. nicholas , the first person who has contact with children and speaks with children , " said bert jansen , a schoolteacher in rotterdam who has organized the rotterdam sinterklaas parade for 10 years and also walks in the parade as the chief zwarte piet . indeed , nowadays the zwarte pieten are friendly characters that are clever and mischievous , and adored by children .
yet in the original sinterklaas story , the zwarte pieten were slaves .
gradually , the tale evolved and they became sinterklaas ' helpers , but they were portrayed as being stupid and spoke broken dutch with a surinamese accent .
they were also frightening figures : it was their job to punish misbehaved children by beating them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zwarte piet help bring sweets to kids that have been good in an effort to tone down any racist implication , the story now says zwarte piet is black because they 're covered in chimney soot .
however , some say that explanation is unconvincing . " that just does n't work for someone who is a grown-up .
where did the afro come from ? " commented ama van dantzig , a resident of amsterdam whose mother is ghanian and father dutch . questioning the tradition the proposal to eliminate zwarte piet from the celebration altogether has arisen from time to time , but not yet taken hold . " personally , i think it is an invented tradition and sinterklaas can stay , but the zwarte pieten have to go , " said artwell cain , director of the national institute for the study of dutch slavery and its legacy -lrb- ninsee -rrb- .
" it is an affront to people of the african diaspora in the netherlands , and it is not proper in this age . " the question is even more urgent today as the netherlands is focusing more on integration efforts and the right-wing party for freedom - led by controversial figure geert wilders - is the third largest party in the parliament . at a time when there is pressure for minorities to integrate into dutch society , a tradition like zwarte piet sends the wrong message , cain said . " if you are developing this sense of belonging and then this tradition of zwarte piet is running around , it diminishes your confidence in what you are as a dutch person , " cain said .
" you become something like an ambiguous citizen .
you question yourself : ' why do i have to enjoy this ?
why do i have to be confronted openly with this form of racism ? " ' others see zwarte piet as an essential dutch tradition that is enjoyed by all children and families , regardless of race or ethnic background . " everyone is happy about zwarte piet , and if you are from holland or you come from morocco or somalia , every child puts his shoe by the door or chimney in the hope that zwarte piet puts a present in his shoe ; everyone does it , " said peter boelhouwer , an event organizer who has managed the sinterklaas parade in the hague for the past 10 years . a 19th-century creation although celebrations around sinterklaas date back to the 16th century , they were usually spontaneous , wild celebrations in the street , said john helsloot , a researcher at the meertens institute who specializes in sinterklaas traditions .
the current story of sinterklaas and zwarte piet dates back to 1850 , when jan schenkman , a schoolteacher from amsterdam , published an illustrated children 's book that introduced many elements of the sinterklaas story that caught on , including the zwarte pieten . the book was quite popular among the bourgeois and there was a readiness to adopt the festival , helsloot said .
from there , it slowly evolved into the celebration that exists today . it 's not uncommon for st. nicholas figures to have a devilish companion - such a figure exists in both austrian and swiss traditions - but the netherlands is the only place where he is imagined as a black man .
it is difficult to say why this particular story emerged here , but helsloot suggested that it could be tied to the dutch abolishment of slavery in 1863 . " you can see that racism was stronger even after the abolishment of slavery , " helsloot said .
" zwarte piet was part of this general idea of foreign people , black people as frightening , and that people should be punished by frightening figures . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the zwarte pieten are seen as sinterklaas ' helpers goodbye to zwarte piet ? if lasting changes are to be made to the zwarte pieten , it seems they will have to be organic rather than imposed by a political organization .
in 2006 , the dutch programme foundation encouraged people to paint their faces with rainbow colors , but the effort failed and the next year the usual zwarte piet black face returned . though that 's not to say change is n't possible .
" with more and more people like me who become dutch and do n't find it necessary that the zwarte pieten stay black , it can change , but slowly , " said sueli brodin , a resident of maastricht who is japanese-french and has lived in the netherlands for 19 years .
" it has to happen naturally because society is changing . " helsloot also could see a future where children smear their faces with black ink rather than paint their whole faces black to lose the racial association and show instead that zwarte piet is actually covered in chimney soot . still others say zwarte piet must be taken out of the tradition completely . " i think it can happen , but it is completely tied to the question of racism in general and how we are conscious about how racism affects the whole of society , " said max van lingen , a representative of the international socialists who works on anti-racism campaigns .
" this is not something that will happen within the next five years ; it really is a long battle . " van dantzig is not as optimistic .
" the people around me are highly educated , internationally-oriented people and the dutch in that group do n't understand the big deal with zwarte piet , and they are the future change makers if you ask me , " she said .
" they are very protective of zwarte piet and it will be difficult to change it . " author : rebecca farivar editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the satellites were supposed to complete the russian navigation system glonass , a rival to the american gps . russia has lost three of its satellites intended to complete a new navigation system to rival the american gps network .
the satellites are believed to have crashed into the pacific ocean after the rocket carrying them failed to reach orbit .
the satellites were carried by a proton-m rocket which took off from russia 's baikonur space center in kazakhstan early on sunday .
later , a second-stage booster rocket failed , leading to the upper-stage rocket with the satellites probably falling into the pacific not far from the hawaiian islands , russian space industry official said .
the loss of the three satellites weighing around 1.4 tons is estimated to cost russia several hundred million euros .
glonass launch not affected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glanoss is intended to rival the us gps navigation system the russian defense ministry played down the significance of the loss , saying the incident would not affect the rollout of the new glonass-m positioning system .
" there are currently 26 satellites in the glonass constellation , including two emergency satellites .
this allows a complete coverage of the territory , " a ministry statement said .
" the russian space industry 's capacity enables us to react rapidly to what 's happened , " it said .
officials insist the system would be fully operational next year .
the glonass system dates back to soviet times when development started in 1976 .
the network is intended to be an alternative to the us global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- and was supposed to be in place by the end of january 2011 in order to lessen moscow 's dependence on gps .
the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- is developing its own galileo system to rival both gps and glonass .

ahead of a national it summit on tuesday , both german chancellor angela merkel and justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger have demanded binding rules for the use of private data online .
" we have to decide this in a broad discussion in society , " merkel said in her weekly video blog on saturday .
" the internet can not be a lawless space without rules .
but we also have to be careful not to curtail the opportunities that the internet offers . "
leutheusser-schnarrenberger told the monday edition of the hamburger abendblatt daily that any law or regulation should n't be limited to only certain websites .
" the debates about social networks like facebook or internet services like google street view have shown that our data protection jurisdiction has to be fundamentally reworked , " she wrote .
in order to better protect individuals , leutheusser-schnarrenberger called for opt-in options and a right of objection to be part of any new legislation on the matter .
social networks such as facebook could be forced to implement higher levels of data protection on their sites .
as a particular danger , the justice minister mentioned companies creating profiles of individual internet users .

with reference to the recent wikileaks release of classified us cables , kauder also lashed out at how sloppily washington handled the sensitive data .
he told the sunday edition of mass circulation daily bild that the us needed to improve data protection .
" it is shocking when you find out that more than 2 million people in the united states had access to this sensitive data , " kauder told the paper .
" it 's irresponsible and not in the interest of the us either . "
the comments over the weekend came ahead of the country 's fifth national it summit on tuesday where a group of experts from politics , business and science will discuss problems and controversies caused by new technology and the internet .
both merkel and leutheusser-schnarrenberger are expected to attend the summit , along with interior minister thomas de maiziere and other high-profile politicians .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the zwarte pieten are seen as sinterklaas ' helpers goodbye to zwarte piet ? if lasting changes are to be made to the zwarte pieten , it seems they will have to be organic rather than imposed by a political organization .
in 2006 , the dutch programme foundation encouraged people to paint their faces with rainbow colors , but the effort failed and the next year the usual zwarte piet black face returned . though that 's not to say change is n't possible .
" with more and more people like me who become dutch and do n't find it necessary that the zwarte pieten stay black , it can change , but slowly , " said sueli brodin , a resident of maastricht who is japanese-french and has lived in the netherlands for 19 years .
" it has to happen naturally because society is changing . " helsloot also could see a future where children smear their faces with black ink rather than paint their whole faces black to lose the racial association and show instead that zwarte piet is actually covered in chimney soot . still others say zwarte piet must be taken out of the tradition completely . " i think it can happen , but it is completely tied to the question of racism in general and how we are conscious about how racism affects the whole of society , " said max van lingen , a representative of the international socialists who works on anti-racism campaigns .
" this is not something that will happen within the next five years ; it really is a long battle . " van dantzig is not as optimistic .
" the people around me are highly educated , internationally-oriented people and the dutch in that group do n't understand the big deal with zwarte piet , and they are the future change makers if you ask me , " she said .
" they are very protective of zwarte piet and it will be difficult to change it . " author : rebecca farivar editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the satellites were supposed to complete the russian navigation system glonass , a rival to the american gps . russia has lost three of its satellites intended to complete a new navigation system to rival the american gps network .
the satellites are believed to have crashed into the pacific ocean after the rocket carrying them failed to reach orbit .
the satellites were carried by a proton-m rocket which took off from russia 's baikonur space center in kazakhstan early on sunday .
later , a second-stage booster rocket failed , leading to the upper-stage rocket with the satellites probably falling into the pacific not far from the hawaiian islands , russian space industry official said .
the loss of the three satellites weighing around 1.4 tons is estimated to cost russia several hundred million euros .
glonass launch not affected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glanoss is intended to rival the us gps navigation system the russian defense ministry played down the significance of the loss , saying the incident would not affect the rollout of the new glonass-m positioning system .
" there are currently 26 satellites in the glonass constellation , including two emergency satellites .
this allows a complete coverage of the territory , " a ministry statement said .
" the russian space industry 's capacity enables us to react rapidly to what 's happened , " it said .
officials insist the system would be fully operational next year .
the glonass system dates back to soviet times when development started in 1976 .
the network is intended to be an alternative to the us global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- and was supposed to be in place by the end of january 2011 in order to lessen moscow 's dependence on gps .
the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- is developing its own galileo system to rival both gps and glonass .

" the government is absolutely determined this will not happen again , " the minister said , addng that madrid would prevent the strikers from walking out over christmas and afterwards . traffic controllers told journalists that the military compelled them to work “ at gunpoint ” in palma de mallorca control tower , but spaniards generally showed little understanding for the strikers who earn an average of 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 267,000 dollars -rrb- a year . spanish airport authorities aena says that 4,052 flights have been scheduled for sunday and that of 296 controllers down to work , 286 are at their posts , enabling airports to " operate fully . " bildunterschrift : the walkout created chaos at spanish airports state of emergency handing over control of airspace to the military on saturday , the spanish government declared the first state of emergency since the death of dictator francisco franco in 1975 . spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero ordered the takeover after some 70 percent of air traffic controllers left their posts or failed to turn up for work on friday . the walkouts came as the country headed into one of its busiest long weekends .
the coming monday and wednesday are state holidays and many people plan to take tuesday off for a five-day weekend . blackmail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government placed the military in command of the skies the unofficial strike came just hours after the cabinet agreed to a package of changes to how the country 's airports are operated .
the government stipulated that the maximum time air traffic controllers could work in a year was 1,670 hours , and announced a plan to sell 49 percent of aena .
the controllers have been locked in a dispute with aena and the transport ministry over the changes for months . by putting the military in charge , the government had upped the ante .
as a consequence , any air traffic controllers who failed to show up for work could have been charged and prosecuted under military law , facing up to 10 years in prison . " if a controller does not show up to his workplace , he will be placed immediately in custody accused of a crime which could mean serious prison sentences , " perez rubalcaba said .
' a popular revolt ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the action stranded some 250,000 passengers in spain union leaders maintained they had not been striking .
but camila cela , head of the usca air traffic controllers ' union , told reuters that " this is a popular revolt . " jorge ontiveros , a spokesman for the syndicate union of air controllers , told the afp news agency that the working hours stipulation would mean that time taken off for paternity leave or sick days would not count towards the maximum hours . " we have reached our limit mentally with the new decree approved this morning obliging us to work more hours , " he said .
" we took the decision individually , which then spread to other colleagues because they can not carry on like this .
in this situation we can not control planes , " he said . the cabinet 's decision on friday was part of an effort to rein in costs , raise money , calm the markets and avoid the kind of debt crisis that greece and ireland have seen in the last year . authors : holly fox , andreas illmer -lrb- afp , dpa , reuters -rrb- editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

koehler , who has been out of the media spotlight since stepping down in may , urged tehran to release the journalists and enable them to join their families for the christmas holidays .
herzog , president from 1994 to 1999 , said a " great cultural nation like iran should exercise justice " and grant the two their freedom .
he noted that " particularly in the koran , the idea of mercy plays an important role . "

every state must " accept freedom and free reporting by journalists , therefore i appeal to the iranian government to release the two reporters before christmas , " scheel added .
von weizsaecker , germany 's president from 1984 to 1994 , described iran as a " significant country with a great , independent culture -lsb- ... -rsb- and a distinct self-confidence , " also including a plea for tehran not to take revenge on the journalists .
tehran responds to german appeal the two - a reporter and a photographer - were arrested on october 10 while interviewing the son of sakineh mohammadi-ashtiani , an iranian woman sentenced to death by stoning for adultery .

" they entered the country on tourist visas and worked as journalists , " he said , adding however , that the two were not facing charges of espionage as earlier reports had suggested .
mashaie also said he was optimistic that the german request for the detained to be allowed to celebrate christmas with their families would be granted .

the internet can not be a lawless space without rules , chancellor angela merkel has warned . the german government on the weekend pushed for improved protection of personal data on the internet .
ahead of a national it summit on tuesday , both german chancellor angela merkel and justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger have demanded binding rules for the use of private data online .
" we have to decide this in a broad discussion in society , " merkel said in her weekly video blog on saturday .
" the internet can not be a lawless space without rules .
but we also have to be careful not to curtail the opportunities that the internet offers . "
leutheusser-schnarrenberger told the monday edition of the hamburger abendblatt daily that any law or regulation should n't be limited to only certain websites .
" the debates about social networks like facebook or internet services like google street view have shown that our data protection jurisdiction has to be fundamentally reworked , " she wrote .
in order to better protect individuals , leutheusser-schnarrenberger called for opt-in options and a right of objection to be part of any new legislation on the matter .
social networks such as facebook could be forced to implement higher levels of data protection on their sites .
as a particular danger , the justice minister mentioned companies creating profiles of individual internet users .
wikileaks affair ' shocking ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kauder says the us has to better protect sensitive data volker kauder , parliamentary leader of merkel 's christian democrats , said everybody should have the right to find out exactly what kind of personal information and data is stored on the web - and should have the right to have that data deleted anytime .
with reference to the recent wikileaks release of classified us cables , kauder also lashed out at how sloppily washington handled the sensitive data .
he told the sunday edition of mass circulation daily bild that the us needed to improve data protection .
" it is shocking when you find out that more than 2 million people in the united states had access to this sensitive data , " kauder told the paper .
" it 's irresponsible and not in the interest of the us either . "
the comments over the weekend came ahead of the country 's fifth national it summit on tuesday where a group of experts from politics , business and science will discuss problems and controversies caused by new technology and the internet .
both merkel and leutheusser-schnarrenberger are expected to attend the summit , along with interior minister thomas de maiziere and other high-profile politicians .

" the government is absolutely determined this will not happen again , " the minister said , addng that madrid would prevent the strikers from walking out over christmas and afterwards . traffic controllers told journalists that the military compelled them to work “ at gunpoint ” in palma de mallorca control tower , but spaniards generally showed little understanding for the strikers who earn an average of 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 267,000 dollars -rrb- a year . spanish airport authorities aena says that 4,052 flights have been scheduled for sunday and that of 296 controllers down to work , 286 are at their posts , enabling airports to " operate fully . " bildunterschrift : the walkout created chaos at spanish airports state of emergency handing over control of airspace to the military on saturday , the spanish government declared the first state of emergency since the death of dictator francisco franco in 1975 . spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero ordered the takeover after some 70 percent of air traffic controllers left their posts or failed to turn up for work on friday . the walkouts came as the country headed into one of its busiest long weekends .
the coming monday and wednesday are state holidays and many people plan to take tuesday off for a five-day weekend . blackmail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government placed the military in command of the skies the unofficial strike came just hours after the cabinet agreed to a package of changes to how the country 's airports are operated .
the government stipulated that the maximum time air traffic controllers could work in a year was 1,670 hours , and announced a plan to sell 49 percent of aena .
the controllers have been locked in a dispute with aena and the transport ministry over the changes for months . by putting the military in charge , the government had upped the ante .
as a consequence , any air traffic controllers who failed to show up for work could have been charged and prosecuted under military law , facing up to 10 years in prison . " if a controller does not show up to his workplace , he will be placed immediately in custody accused of a crime which could mean serious prison sentences , " perez rubalcaba said .
' a popular revolt ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the action stranded some 250,000 passengers in spain union leaders maintained they had not been striking .
but camila cela , head of the usca air traffic controllers ' union , told reuters that " this is a popular revolt . " jorge ontiveros , a spokesman for the syndicate union of air controllers , told the afp news agency that the working hours stipulation would mean that time taken off for paternity leave or sick days would not count towards the maximum hours . " we have reached our limit mentally with the new decree approved this morning obliging us to work more hours , " he said .
" we took the decision individually , which then spread to other colleagues because they can not carry on like this .
in this situation we can not control planes , " he said . the cabinet 's decision on friday was part of an effort to rein in costs , raise money , calm the markets and avoid the kind of debt crisis that greece and ireland have seen in the last year . authors : holly fox , andreas illmer -lrb- afp , dpa , reuters -rrb- editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the joint plea appeared in the mass circulation weekly bild am sonntag , the paper for which the two reporters were working .
koehler , who has been out of the media spotlight since stepping down in may , urged tehran to release the journalists and enable them to join their families for the christmas holidays .
herzog , president from 1994 to 1999 , said a " great cultural nation like iran should exercise justice " and grant the two their freedom .
he noted that " particularly in the koran , the idea of mercy plays an important role . "

every state must " accept freedom and free reporting by journalists , therefore i appeal to the iranian government to release the two reporters before christmas , " scheel added .
von weizsaecker , germany 's president from 1984 to 1994 , described iran as a " significant country with a great , independent culture -lsb- ... -rsb- and a distinct self-confidence , " also including a plea for tehran not to take revenge on the journalists .
tehran responds to german appeal the two - a reporter and a photographer - were arrested on october 10 while interviewing the son of sakineh mohammadi-ashtiani , an iranian woman sentenced to death by stoning for adultery .
" they broke the law , " esfandiar rahim mashaie , a senior aide to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung weekly on sunday .
" they entered the country on tourist visas and worked as journalists , " he said , adding however , that the two were not facing charges of espionage as earlier reports had suggested .

" the government is absolutely determined this will not happen again , " the minister said , addng that madrid would prevent the strikers from walking out over christmas and afterwards . traffic controllers told journalists that the military compelled them to work “ at gunpoint ” in palma de mallorca control tower , but spaniards generally showed little understanding for the strikers who earn an average of 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 267,000 dollars -rrb- a year . spanish airport authorities aena says that 4,052 flights have been scheduled for sunday and that of 296 controllers down to work , 286 are at their posts , enabling airports to " operate fully . " bildunterschrift : the walkout created chaos at spanish airports state of emergency handing over control of airspace to the military on saturday , the spanish government declared the first state of emergency since the death of dictator francisco franco in 1975 . spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero ordered the takeover after some 70 percent of air traffic controllers left their posts or failed to turn up for work on friday . the walkouts came as the country headed into one of its busiest long weekends .
the coming monday and wednesday are state holidays and many people plan to take tuesday off for a five-day weekend . blackmail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government placed the military in command of the skies the unofficial strike came just hours after the cabinet agreed to a package of changes to how the country 's airports are operated .
the government stipulated that the maximum time air traffic controllers could work in a year was 1,670 hours , and announced a plan to sell 49 percent of aena .
the controllers have been locked in a dispute with aena and the transport ministry over the changes for months . by putting the military in charge , the government had upped the ante .
as a consequence , any air traffic controllers who failed to show up for work could have been charged and prosecuted under military law , facing up to 10 years in prison . " if a controller does not show up to his workplace , he will be placed immediately in custody accused of a crime which could mean serious prison sentences , " perez rubalcaba said .
' a popular revolt ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the action stranded some 250,000 passengers in spain union leaders maintained they had not been striking .
but camila cela , head of the usca air traffic controllers ' union , told reuters that " this is a popular revolt . " jorge ontiveros , a spokesman for the syndicate union of air controllers , told the afp news agency that the working hours stipulation would mean that time taken off for paternity leave or sick days would not count towards the maximum hours . " we have reached our limit mentally with the new decree approved this morning obliging us to work more hours , " he said .
" we took the decision individually , which then spread to other colleagues because they can not carry on like this .
in this situation we can not control planes , " he said . the cabinet 's decision on friday was part of an effort to rein in costs , raise money , calm the markets and avoid the kind of debt crisis that greece and ireland have seen in the last year . authors : holly fox , andreas illmer -lrb- afp , dpa , reuters -rrb- editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the 65th minute , cologne substitute martin lanig brought his side back into the game but eventually the team had to concede defeat to leverkusen .
leverkusen are now third in the table , only one point behind second-place mainz .

the team beat nuremberg 2-0 and are now 10 points clear of second-place mainz .
in heavy snow , mats hummels and robert lewandowski helped dortmund get their 13th win of the season from a total of 15 matches so far .
second-place mainz blew their chance to close the gap on saturday as they suffered a 2-1 defeat at the hands of frankfurt .
dortmund are now 10 points clear of mainz , which means they already have secured the so-called " autumn championship " - the number one spot before the season goes into winter break .
there are still two matches to be played before the break but it 's now impossible for mainz to catch up with dortmund .

leverkusen took the lead 21 minutes into the match when striker patrick helmes put the ball into the net after a bad clearance by nuremberg keeper faryd mondragon .
however , it took only six minutes for cologne to equalize .
pedro geromel headed the ball into the box after a free kick by germany international lukas podolski .
in the second half hosts leverkusen again went ahead with tranquillo barnetta and stefan reinartz both scoring within six minutes of each other .
in the 65th minute , cologne substitute martin lanig brought his side back into the game but eventually the team had to concede defeat to leverkusen .
leverkusen are now third in the table , only one point behind second-place mainz .
pundits say leverkusen might be the only team still able to challenge dortmund for this season 's title .
after their disappointing 2-0 loss to schalke on saturday , last season 's champions bayern munich were back in the headlines on sunday when coach louis van gaal conceded his side may have already lost the bundesliga title race to dortmund .
bayern are trailing borussia dortmund by 17 points .

the internet can not be a lawless space without rules , chancellor angela merkel has warned . the german government on the weekend pushed for improved protection of personal data on the internet .
ahead of a national it summit on tuesday , both german chancellor angela merkel and justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger have demanded binding rules for the use of private data online .
" we have to decide this in a broad discussion in society , " merkel said in her weekly video blog on saturday .
" the internet can not be a lawless space without rules .
but we also have to be careful not to curtail the opportunities that the internet offers . "
leutheusser-schnarrenberger told the monday edition of the hamburger abendblatt daily that any law or regulation should n't be limited to only certain websites .
" the debates about social networks like facebook or internet services like google street view have shown that our data protection jurisdiction has to be fundamentally reworked , " she wrote .
in order to better protect individuals , leutheusser-schnarrenberger called for opt-in options and a right of objection to be part of any new legislation on the matter .
social networks such as facebook could be forced to implement higher levels of data protection on their sites .
as a particular danger , the justice minister mentioned companies creating profiles of individual internet users .
wikileaks affair ' shocking ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kauder says the us has to better protect sensitive data volker kauder , parliamentary leader of merkel 's christian democrats , said everybody should have the right to find out exactly what kind of personal information and data is stored on the web - and should have the right to have that data deleted anytime .
with reference to the recent wikileaks release of classified us cables , kauder also lashed out at how sloppily washington handled the sensitive data .
he told the sunday edition of mass circulation daily bild that the us needed to improve data protection .
" it is shocking when you find out that more than 2 million people in the united states had access to this sensitive data , " kauder told the paper .
" it 's irresponsible and not in the interest of the us either . "
the comments over the weekend came ahead of the country 's fifth national it summit on tuesday where a group of experts from politics , business and science will discuss problems and controversies caused by new technology and the internet .
both merkel and leutheusser-schnarrenberger are expected to attend the summit , along with interior minister thomas de maiziere and other high-profile politicians .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de christmas -pipe- 05.12.2010 racism controversy dampens holland 's sinterklaas tradition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. nicholas brings treats to kids in many european countries on december 6 children across europe eagerly await the arrival of st. nicholas on december 6 .
but in holland , the tradition has racist implications that the dutch are n't quite willing to give up . for the dutch , sinterklaasavond -lrb- st. nicholas eve -rrb- on december 5 is the biggest celebration of the year - bigger than christmas .
that evening , families gather and exchange presents , and children leave out their shoes in the hopes that sinterklaas will have fill them with candy by the next morning . what seems like a harmless holiday devoted to gifts , candy , and children , has a catch : sinterklaas ' helpers , the zwarte pieten or " black peters , " are portrayed according to degrading racial stereotypes . they 're typically dressed in 19th-century moorish outfits , curly afro wigs , and painted red lips .
it is common for both adults and children to dress up as zwarte piet , complete with their faces painted black . " zwarte piet is a person who is happy , who is the assistant of st. nicholas , the first person who has contact with children and speaks with children , " said bert jansen , a schoolteacher in rotterdam who has organized the rotterdam sinterklaas parade for 10 years and also walks in the parade as the chief zwarte piet . indeed , nowadays the zwarte pieten are friendly characters that are clever and mischievous , and adored by children .
yet in the original sinterklaas story , the zwarte pieten were slaves .
gradually , the tale evolved and they became sinterklaas ' helpers , but they were portrayed as being stupid and spoke broken dutch with a surinamese accent .
they were also frightening figures : it was their job to punish misbehaved children by beating them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zwarte piet help bring sweets to kids that have been good in an effort to tone down any racist implication , the story now says zwarte piet is black because they 're covered in chimney soot .
however , some say that explanation is unconvincing . " that just does n't work for someone who is a grown-up .
where did the afro come from ? " commented ama van dantzig , a resident of amsterdam whose mother is ghanian and father dutch . questioning the tradition the proposal to eliminate zwarte piet from the celebration altogether has arisen from time to time , but not yet taken hold . " personally , i think it is an invented tradition and sinterklaas can stay , but the zwarte pieten have to go , " said artwell cain , director of the national institute for the study of dutch slavery and its legacy -lrb- ninsee -rrb- .
" it is an affront to people of the african diaspora in the netherlands , and it is not proper in this age . " the question is even more urgent today as the netherlands is focusing more on integration efforts and the right-wing party for freedom - led by controversial figure geert wilders - is the third largest party in the parliament . at a time when there is pressure for minorities to integrate into dutch society , a tradition like zwarte piet sends the wrong message , cain said . " if you are developing this sense of belonging and then this tradition of zwarte piet is running around , it diminishes your confidence in what you are as a dutch person , " cain said .
" you become something like an ambiguous citizen .
you question yourself : ' why do i have to enjoy this ?
why do i have to be confronted openly with this form of racism ? " ' others see zwarte piet as an essential dutch tradition that is enjoyed by all children and families , regardless of race or ethnic background . " everyone is happy about zwarte piet , and if you are from holland or you come from morocco or somalia , every child puts his shoe by the door or chimney in the hope that zwarte piet puts a present in his shoe ; everyone does it , " said peter boelhouwer , an event organizer who has managed the sinterklaas parade in the hague for the past 10 years . a 19th-century creation although celebrations around sinterklaas date back to the 16th century , they were usually spontaneous , wild celebrations in the street , said john helsloot , a researcher at the meertens institute who specializes in sinterklaas traditions .
the current story of sinterklaas and zwarte piet dates back to 1850 , when jan schenkman , a schoolteacher from amsterdam , published an illustrated children 's book that introduced many elements of the sinterklaas story that caught on , including the zwarte pieten . the book was quite popular among the bourgeois and there was a readiness to adopt the festival , helsloot said .
from there , it slowly evolved into the celebration that exists today . it 's not uncommon for st. nicholas figures to have a devilish companion - such a figure exists in both austrian and swiss traditions - but the netherlands is the only place where he is imagined as a black man .
it is difficult to say why this particular story emerged here , but helsloot suggested that it could be tied to the dutch abolishment of slavery in 1863 . " you can see that racism was stronger even after the abolishment of slavery , " helsloot said .
" zwarte piet was part of this general idea of foreign people , black people as frightening , and that people should be punished by frightening figures . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the zwarte pieten are seen as sinterklaas ' helpers goodbye to zwarte piet ? if lasting changes are to be made to the zwarte pieten , it seems they will have to be organic rather than imposed by a political organization .
in 2006 , the dutch programme foundation encouraged people to paint their faces with rainbow colors , but the effort failed and the next year the usual zwarte piet black face returned . though that 's not to say change is n't possible .
" with more and more people like me who become dutch and do n't find it necessary that the zwarte pieten stay black , it can change , but slowly , " said sueli brodin , a resident of maastricht who is japanese-french and has lived in the netherlands for 19 years .
" it has to happen naturally because society is changing . " helsloot also could see a future where children smear their faces with black ink rather than paint their whole faces black to lose the racial association and show instead that zwarte piet is actually covered in chimney soot . still others say zwarte piet must be taken out of the tradition completely . " i think it can happen , but it is completely tied to the question of racism in general and how we are conscious about how racism affects the whole of society , " said max van lingen , a representative of the international socialists who works on anti-racism campaigns .
" this is not something that will happen within the next five years ; it really is a long battle . " van dantzig is not as optimistic .
" the people around me are highly educated , internationally-oriented people and the dutch in that group do n't understand the big deal with zwarte piet , and they are the future change makers if you ask me , " she said .
" they are very protective of zwarte piet and it will be difficult to change it . " author : rebecca farivar editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the satellites were supposed to complete the russian navigation system glonass , a rival to the american gps . russia has lost three of its satellites intended to complete a new navigation system to rival the american gps network .
the satellites are believed to have crashed into the pacific ocean after the rocket carrying them failed to reach orbit .
the satellites were carried by a proton-m rocket which took off from russia 's baikonur space center in kazakhstan early on sunday .
later , a second-stage booster rocket failed , leading to the upper-stage rocket with the satellites probably falling into the pacific not far from the hawaiian islands , russian space industry official said .
the loss of the three satellites weighing around 1.4 tons is estimated to cost russia several hundred million euros .
glonass launch not affected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glanoss is intended to rival the us gps navigation system the russian defense ministry played down the significance of the loss , saying the incident would not affect the rollout of the new glonass-m positioning system .
" there are currently 26 satellites in the glonass constellation , including two emergency satellites .
this allows a complete coverage of the territory , " a ministry statement said .
" the russian space industry 's capacity enables us to react rapidly to what 's happened , " it said .
officials insist the system would be fully operational next year .
the glonass system dates back to soviet times when development started in 1976 .
the network is intended to be an alternative to the us global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- and was supposed to be in place by the end of january 2011 in order to lessen moscow 's dependence on gps .
the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- is developing its own galileo system to rival both gps and glonass .

koehler , who has been out of the media spotlight since stepping down in may , urged tehran to release the journalists and enable them to join their families for the christmas holidays .
herzog , president from 1994 to 1999 , said a " great cultural nation like iran should exercise justice " and grant the two their freedom .
he noted that " particularly in the koran , the idea of mercy plays an important role . "
' accept freedom and free reporting ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the paper itself has also appealed for the reporters ' release scheel , who was in office from 1974 to 1979 , pointed to his own age , 92 , to note that he had experienced " what it means not to be able to freely express one 's opinion " - an apparent reference to the nazi regime of his youth .
every state must " accept freedom and free reporting by journalists , therefore i appeal to the iranian government to release the two reporters before christmas , " scheel added .
von weizsaecker , germany 's president from 1984 to 1994 , described iran as a " significant country with a great , independent culture -lsb- ... -rsb- and a distinct self-confidence , " also including a plea for tehran not to take revenge on the journalists .
tehran responds to german appeal the two - a reporter and a photographer - were arrested on october 10 while interviewing the son of sakineh mohammadi-ashtiani , an iranian woman sentenced to death by stoning for adultery .
" they broke the law , " esfandiar rahim mashaie , a senior aide to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung weekly on sunday .
" they entered the country on tourist visas and worked as journalists , " he said , adding however , that the two were not facing charges of espionage as earlier reports had suggested .
mashaie also said he was optimistic that the german request for the detained to be allowed to celebrate christmas with their families would be granted .

but in holland , the tradition has racist implications that the dutch are n't quite willing to give up . for the dutch , sinterklaasavond -lrb- st. nicholas eve -rrb- on december 5 is the biggest celebration of the year - bigger than christmas .
that evening , families gather and exchange presents , and children leave out their shoes in the hopes that sinterklaas will have fill them with candy by the next morning . what seems like a harmless holiday devoted to gifts , candy , and children , has a catch : sinterklaas ' helpers , the zwarte pieten or " black peters , " are portrayed according to degrading racial stereotypes . they 're typically dressed in 19th-century moorish outfits , curly afro wigs , and painted red lips .
it is common for both adults and children to dress up as zwarte piet , complete with their faces painted black . " zwarte piet is a person who is happy , who is the assistant of st. nicholas , the first person who has contact with children and speaks with children , " said bert jansen , a schoolteacher in rotterdam who has organized the rotterdam sinterklaas parade for 10 years and also walks in the parade as the chief zwarte piet . indeed , nowadays the zwarte pieten are friendly characters that are clever and mischievous , and adored by children .
yet in the original sinterklaas story , the zwarte pieten were slaves .
gradually , the tale evolved and they became sinterklaas ' helpers , but they were portrayed as being stupid and spoke broken dutch with a surinamese accent .
they were also frightening figures : it was their job to punish misbehaved children by beating them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zwarte piet help bring sweets to kids that have been good in an effort to tone down any racist implication , the story now says zwarte piet is black because they 're covered in chimney soot .
however , some say that explanation is unconvincing . " that just does n't work for someone who is a grown-up .
where did the afro come from ? " commented ama van dantzig , a resident of amsterdam whose mother is ghanian and father dutch . questioning the tradition the proposal to eliminate zwarte piet from the celebration altogether has arisen from time to time , but not yet taken hold . " personally , i think it is an invented tradition and sinterklaas can stay , but the zwarte pieten have to go , " said artwell cain , director of the national institute for the study of dutch slavery and its legacy -lrb- ninsee -rrb- .
" it is an affront to people of the african diaspora in the netherlands , and it is not proper in this age . " the question is even more urgent today as the netherlands is focusing more on integration efforts and the right-wing party for freedom - led by controversial figure geert wilders - is the third largest party in the parliament . at a time when there is pressure for minorities to integrate into dutch society , a tradition like zwarte piet sends the wrong message , cain said . " if you are developing this sense of belonging and then this tradition of zwarte piet is running around , it diminishes your confidence in what you are as a dutch person , " cain said .
" you become something like an ambiguous citizen .
you question yourself : ' why do i have to enjoy this ?
why do i have to be confronted openly with this form of racism ? " ' others see zwarte piet as an essential dutch tradition that is enjoyed by all children and families , regardless of race or ethnic background . " everyone is happy about zwarte piet , and if you are from holland or you come from morocco or somalia , every child puts his shoe by the door or chimney in the hope that zwarte piet puts a present in his shoe ; everyone does it , " said peter boelhouwer , an event organizer who has managed the sinterklaas parade in the hague for the past 10 years . a 19th-century creation although celebrations around sinterklaas date back to the 16th century , they were usually spontaneous , wild celebrations in the street , said john helsloot , a researcher at the meertens institute who specializes in sinterklaas traditions .
the current story of sinterklaas and zwarte piet dates back to 1850 , when jan schenkman , a schoolteacher from amsterdam , published an illustrated children 's book that introduced many elements of the sinterklaas story that caught on , including the zwarte pieten . the book was quite popular among the bourgeois and there was a readiness to adopt the festival , helsloot said .
from there , it slowly evolved into the celebration that exists today . it 's not uncommon for st. nicholas figures to have a devilish companion - such a figure exists in both austrian and swiss traditions - but the netherlands is the only place where he is imagined as a black man .
it is difficult to say why this particular story emerged here , but helsloot suggested that it could be tied to the dutch abolishment of slavery in 1863 . " you can see that racism was stronger even after the abolishment of slavery , " helsloot said .
" zwarte piet was part of this general idea of foreign people , black people as frightening , and that people should be punished by frightening figures . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the zwarte pieten are seen as sinterklaas ' helpers goodbye to zwarte piet ? if lasting changes are to be made to the zwarte pieten , it seems they will have to be organic rather than imposed by a political organization .
in 2006 , the dutch programme foundation encouraged people to paint their faces with rainbow colors , but the effort failed and the next year the usual zwarte piet black face returned . though that 's not to say change is n't possible .
" with more and more people like me who become dutch and do n't find it necessary that the zwarte pieten stay black , it can change , but slowly , " said sueli brodin , a resident of maastricht who is japanese-french and has lived in the netherlands for 19 years .
" it has to happen naturally because society is changing . " helsloot also could see a future where children smear their faces with black ink rather than paint their whole faces black to lose the racial association and show instead that zwarte piet is actually covered in chimney soot . still others say zwarte piet must be taken out of the tradition completely . " i think it can happen , but it is completely tied to the question of racism in general and how we are conscious about how racism affects the whole of society , " said max van lingen , a representative of the international socialists who works on anti-racism campaigns .
" this is not something that will happen within the next five years ; it really is a long battle . " van dantzig is not as optimistic .
" the people around me are highly educated , internationally-oriented people and the dutch in that group do n't understand the big deal with zwarte piet , and they are the future change makers if you ask me , " she said .
" they are very protective of zwarte piet and it will be difficult to change it . " author : rebecca farivar editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ahead of a national it summit on tuesday , both german chancellor angela merkel and justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger have demanded binding rules for the use of private data online .
" we have to decide this in a broad discussion in society , " merkel said in her weekly video blog on saturday .
" the internet can not be a lawless space without rules .
but we also have to be careful not to curtail the opportunities that the internet offers . "
leutheusser-schnarrenberger told the monday edition of the hamburger abendblatt daily that any law or regulation should n't be limited to only certain websites .
" the debates about social networks like facebook or internet services like google street view have shown that our data protection jurisdiction has to be fundamentally reworked , " she wrote .
in order to better protect individuals , leutheusser-schnarrenberger called for opt-in options and a right of objection to be part of any new legislation on the matter .
social networks such as facebook could be forced to implement higher levels of data protection on their sites .

" the government is absolutely determined this will not happen again , " the minister said , addng that madrid would prevent the strikers from walking out over christmas and afterwards . traffic controllers told journalists that the military compelled them to work “ at gunpoint ” in palma de mallorca control tower , but spaniards generally showed little understanding for the strikers who earn an average of 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 267,000 dollars -rrb- a year . spanish airport authorities aena says that 4,052 flights have been scheduled for sunday and that of 296 controllers down to work , 286 are at their posts , enabling airports to " operate fully . " bildunterschrift : the walkout created chaos at spanish airports state of emergency handing over control of airspace to the military on saturday , the spanish government declared the first state of emergency since the death of dictator francisco franco in 1975 . spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero ordered the takeover after some 70 percent of air traffic controllers left their posts or failed to turn up for work on friday . the walkouts came as the country headed into one of its busiest long weekends .
the coming monday and wednesday are state holidays and many people plan to take tuesday off for a five-day weekend . blackmail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government placed the military in command of the skies the unofficial strike came just hours after the cabinet agreed to a package of changes to how the country 's airports are operated .
the government stipulated that the maximum time air traffic controllers could work in a year was 1,670 hours , and announced a plan to sell 49 percent of aena .
the controllers have been locked in a dispute with aena and the transport ministry over the changes for months . by putting the military in charge , the government had upped the ante .
as a consequence , any air traffic controllers who failed to show up for work could have been charged and prosecuted under military law , facing up to 10 years in prison . " if a controller does not show up to his workplace , he will be placed immediately in custody accused of a crime which could mean serious prison sentences , " perez rubalcaba said .
' a popular revolt ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the action stranded some 250,000 passengers in spain union leaders maintained they had not been striking .
but camila cela , head of the usca air traffic controllers ' union , told reuters that " this is a popular revolt . " jorge ontiveros , a spokesman for the syndicate union of air controllers , told the afp news agency that the working hours stipulation would mean that time taken off for paternity leave or sick days would not count towards the maximum hours . " we have reached our limit mentally with the new decree approved this morning obliging us to work more hours , " he said .
" we took the decision individually , which then spread to other colleagues because they can not carry on like this .
in this situation we can not control planes , " he said . the cabinet 's decision on friday was part of an effort to rein in costs , raise money , calm the markets and avoid the kind of debt crisis that greece and ireland have seen in the last year . authors : holly fox , andreas illmer -lrb- afp , dpa , reuters -rrb- editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de christmas -pipe- 05.12.2010 racism controversy dampens holland 's sinterklaas tradition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. nicholas brings treats to kids in many european countries on december 6 children across europe eagerly await the arrival of st. nicholas on december 6 .
but in holland , the tradition has racist implications that the dutch are n't quite willing to give up . for the dutch , sinterklaasavond -lrb- st. nicholas eve -rrb- on december 5 is the biggest celebration of the year - bigger than christmas .
that evening , families gather and exchange presents , and children leave out their shoes in the hopes that sinterklaas will have fill them with candy by the next morning . what seems like a harmless holiday devoted to gifts , candy , and children , has a catch : sinterklaas ' helpers , the zwarte pieten or " black peters , " are portrayed according to degrading racial stereotypes . they 're typically dressed in 19th-century moorish outfits , curly afro wigs , and painted red lips .
it is common for both adults and children to dress up as zwarte piet , complete with their faces painted black . " zwarte piet is a person who is happy , who is the assistant of st. nicholas , the first person who has contact with children and speaks with children , " said bert jansen , a schoolteacher in rotterdam who has organized the rotterdam sinterklaas parade for 10 years and also walks in the parade as the chief zwarte piet . indeed , nowadays the zwarte pieten are friendly characters that are clever and mischievous , and adored by children .
yet in the original sinterklaas story , the zwarte pieten were slaves .
gradually , the tale evolved and they became sinterklaas ' helpers , but they were portrayed as being stupid and spoke broken dutch with a surinamese accent .
they were also frightening figures : it was their job to punish misbehaved children by beating them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zwarte piet help bring sweets to kids that have been good in an effort to tone down any racist implication , the story now says zwarte piet is black because they 're covered in chimney soot .
however , some say that explanation is unconvincing . " that just does n't work for someone who is a grown-up .
where did the afro come from ? " commented ama van dantzig , a resident of amsterdam whose mother is ghanian and father dutch . questioning the tradition the proposal to eliminate zwarte piet from the celebration altogether has arisen from time to time , but not yet taken hold . " personally , i think it is an invented tradition and sinterklaas can stay , but the zwarte pieten have to go , " said artwell cain , director of the national institute for the study of dutch slavery and its legacy -lrb- ninsee -rrb- .
" it is an affront to people of the african diaspora in the netherlands , and it is not proper in this age . " the question is even more urgent today as the netherlands is focusing more on integration efforts and the right-wing party for freedom - led by controversial figure geert wilders - is the third largest party in the parliament . at a time when there is pressure for minorities to integrate into dutch society , a tradition like zwarte piet sends the wrong message , cain said . " if you are developing this sense of belonging and then this tradition of zwarte piet is running around , it diminishes your confidence in what you are as a dutch person , " cain said .
" you become something like an ambiguous citizen .
you question yourself : ' why do i have to enjoy this ?
why do i have to be confronted openly with this form of racism ? " ' others see zwarte piet as an essential dutch tradition that is enjoyed by all children and families , regardless of race or ethnic background . " everyone is happy about zwarte piet , and if you are from holland or you come from morocco or somalia , every child puts his shoe by the door or chimney in the hope that zwarte piet puts a present in his shoe ; everyone does it , " said peter boelhouwer , an event organizer who has managed the sinterklaas parade in the hague for the past 10 years . a 19th-century creation although celebrations around sinterklaas date back to the 16th century , they were usually spontaneous , wild celebrations in the street , said john helsloot , a researcher at the meertens institute who specializes in sinterklaas traditions .
the current story of sinterklaas and zwarte piet dates back to 1850 , when jan schenkman , a schoolteacher from amsterdam , published an illustrated children 's book that introduced many elements of the sinterklaas story that caught on , including the zwarte pieten . the book was quite popular among the bourgeois and there was a readiness to adopt the festival , helsloot said .
from there , it slowly evolved into the celebration that exists today . it 's not uncommon for st. nicholas figures to have a devilish companion - such a figure exists in both austrian and swiss traditions - but the netherlands is the only place where he is imagined as a black man .
it is difficult to say why this particular story emerged here , but helsloot suggested that it could be tied to the dutch abolishment of slavery in 1863 . " you can see that racism was stronger even after the abolishment of slavery , " helsloot said .
" zwarte piet was part of this general idea of foreign people , black people as frightening , and that people should be punished by frightening figures . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the zwarte pieten are seen as sinterklaas ' helpers goodbye to zwarte piet ? if lasting changes are to be made to the zwarte pieten , it seems they will have to be organic rather than imposed by a political organization .
in 2006 , the dutch programme foundation encouraged people to paint their faces with rainbow colors , but the effort failed and the next year the usual zwarte piet black face returned . though that 's not to say change is n't possible .
" with more and more people like me who become dutch and do n't find it necessary that the zwarte pieten stay black , it can change , but slowly , " said sueli brodin , a resident of maastricht who is japanese-french and has lived in the netherlands for 19 years .
" it has to happen naturally because society is changing . " helsloot also could see a future where children smear their faces with black ink rather than paint their whole faces black to lose the racial association and show instead that zwarte piet is actually covered in chimney soot . still others say zwarte piet must be taken out of the tradition completely . " i think it can happen , but it is completely tied to the question of racism in general and how we are conscious about how racism affects the whole of society , " said max van lingen , a representative of the international socialists who works on anti-racism campaigns .
" this is not something that will happen within the next five years ; it really is a long battle . " van dantzig is not as optimistic .
" the people around me are highly educated , internationally-oriented people and the dutch in that group do n't understand the big deal with zwarte piet , and they are the future change makers if you ask me , " she said .
" they are very protective of zwarte piet and it will be difficult to change it . " author : rebecca farivar editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the internet can not be a lawless space without rules , chancellor angela merkel has warned . the german government on the weekend pushed for improved protection of personal data on the internet .
ahead of a national it summit on tuesday , both german chancellor angela merkel and justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger have demanded binding rules for the use of private data online .
" we have to decide this in a broad discussion in society , " merkel said in her weekly video blog on saturday .
" the internet can not be a lawless space without rules .
but we also have to be careful not to curtail the opportunities that the internet offers . "
leutheusser-schnarrenberger told the monday edition of the hamburger abendblatt daily that any law or regulation should n't be limited to only certain websites .
" the debates about social networks like facebook or internet services like google street view have shown that our data protection jurisdiction has to be fundamentally reworked , " she wrote .
in order to better protect individuals , leutheusser-schnarrenberger called for opt-in options and a right of objection to be part of any new legislation on the matter .
social networks such as facebook could be forced to implement higher levels of data protection on their sites .
as a particular danger , the justice minister mentioned companies creating profiles of individual internet users .
wikileaks affair ' shocking ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kauder says the us has to better protect sensitive data volker kauder , parliamentary leader of merkel 's christian democrats , said everybody should have the right to find out exactly what kind of personal information and data is stored on the web - and should have the right to have that data deleted anytime .
with reference to the recent wikileaks release of classified us cables , kauder also lashed out at how sloppily washington handled the sensitive data .
he told the sunday edition of mass circulation daily bild that the us needed to improve data protection .
" it is shocking when you find out that more than 2 million people in the united states had access to this sensitive data , " kauder told the paper .
" it 's irresponsible and not in the interest of the us either . "
the comments over the weekend came ahead of the country 's fifth national it summit on tuesday where a group of experts from politics , business and science will discuss problems and controversies caused by new technology and the internet .
both merkel and leutheusser-schnarrenberger are expected to attend the summit , along with interior minister thomas de maiziere and other high-profile politicians .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 05.12.2010 madrid street drinkers test neighbors ' patience großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drinking outdoors means avoiding the markups in a bar tough economic times and a desire for freedom have driven young spaniards out of the bars and onto the streets .
rambunctious revelers are subjecting local residents to noise levels of up to three times the legal limit . the la latina neighborhood of madrid 's old town is famous for its high concentration of tapas bars .
however , they are shunned by thousands of young drinkers who gather instead in the scenic plazas and winding streets of the city center . it 's a phenomenon spain has fittingly dubbed botellon , or " big bottle . " " this is one of the typical places in madrid to go out , " said elena , a biology student in her early 20s , while drinking rum and coke outside with a group of friends on a sunday night .
" there are people with guitars and there 's a great atmosphere .
it 's nice , really the true madrid . " sitting cross-legged in a raucous circle , the five students said that when they go out , they gravitate to the pavement , where they feel less inhibited .
as midnight neared on sunday in this densely populated area , the group got progressively louder . " no , you really do n't think about the neighbors , " elena said , her friends shouting and yelling around her .
" sometimes you try to be quiet , but it 's difficult .
but neighbors can call the police so it 's better not to be screaming . " fines go uncollected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people do n't want to be told what to do , where to drink and how much to pay the municipal police can fine street drinkers up to 360 euros -lrb- around $ 475 -rrb- .
they have issued 22,000 fines since january , though only a fraction of them are actually enforced .
also , offenders can choose to attend a talk about alcohol addiction instead of paying up . a police car drove past elena and her friends , but ignored them and continued on to the next botellon spot , next to a 17-century church at plaza de la cebada .
there , a small group of women in their late 20s sat quietly sharing a liter of beer . two of them were unemployed - like over 40 percent of young spaniards .
they explained that they were simply looking for cheaper nights out . arif , a 24-year-old immigrant from bangladesh , was on-hand to supply precisely that .
he was one of half a dozen men laden with plastic bags who were working the square that night .
he said in broken spanish that he had no papers to work legally , but managed to earn enough money selling drinks to pay for food and rent . business was going well that night - not surprising , considering a beer from arif cost just one euro , compared to four euros in one of the many bars in this upwardly mobile district .
but , with his illegal status , it 's also high risk job .
arif and the other vendors vanished seconds later , when police entered the square . the freedom to choose the two officers half-heartedly emptied a bottle of beer on to the pavement , dished out some warnings , and the square cleared in a matter of seconds as drinkers picked up their bags and ambled off . five minutes later , the police left and the square filled up once more . " i think it 's a policy of persecuting young people to force them into habits sanctioned by the authorities , " said nacho , a 24-year-old engineering student who had resumed drinking whiskey and coke out of a plastic cup .
" they are forcing us to go to the bars they want , at the times they want , to pay the prices they want - we ca n't pay those prices .
we 'd prefer to meet up in an environment we have control over . " nacho said most young spaniards ca n't afford their own homes .
the high cost of living , low wages and a stagnant , unsubsidized rental market mean the plaza is a good , non-commercial meeting place for many . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outdoor parties can reach volume levels deemed unhealthy unhealthy noise levels the botellon is making nights unbearable for residents who have the misfortune to live in the zones where people chose to congregate . " it 's difficult to avoid the botellon in my neighborhood , " explained esteban benito , the vice-president of a residents ' association in chueca , a district famous for its gay nightlife .
" many people have chronic problems getting to sleep - they take sleeping pills or sleep with ear plugs , but nothing can shut out the racket . " half a million madrid residents suffer from noise pollution exceeding 65 decibels , the maximum limit recommended by the world health organization .
the situation in chueca is particularly acute . " people come with powerful sound systems and dance on top of their cars , " said benito .
" they see this as a zone of freedom , but they do n't think about the freedom of those people trying to get to sleep . " benito said residents were at breaking point , sick to death of the noise - which is sometimes triple the legal decibel limit - and the mess drinkers leave behind .
he also warned of an epidemic of out-of-control , underage drinking and said the law is far too lax . ' a game of cat and mouse ' the municipal police charged with stamping out the botellon acknowledged that it is a mammoth task . " we have done a lot of work but the magnificent weather here is not in our favor , " said rosa maria duran , deputy inspector general for madrid .
" it 's a bit like a game of cat and mouse .
we have certain permanent positions where we stop botellon from starting up but now we have the new phenomenon of botellin , or ' little bottle . '
young people are spreading out throughout the district . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neighbors are n't happy about the mess left behind by outdoor drinkers duran highlighted her force 's prevention work in schools but added that they had not given up .
she expressed her hope that the next generation would find different ways of having fun . and it may not be entirely wishful thinking .
a regional health survey has recorded that teenage drinking is down in madrid . benito was doubtful about these statistics .
but his campaigning has started to bear fruit .
madrid 's municipal authorities have now upped fines to 600 euros for drinkers guilty of noise pollution . in the plaza , nacho and his friends had agreed that young people could drink more responsibly and should respect the neighbors - but they were adamant that prohibition would never work . author : hazel healy editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the government is absolutely determined this will not happen again , " the minister said , addng that madrid would prevent the strikers from walking out over christmas and afterwards . traffic controllers told journalists that the military compelled them to work “ at gunpoint ” in palma de mallorca control tower , but spaniards generally showed little understanding for the strikers who earn an average of 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 267,000 dollars -rrb- a year . spanish airport authorities aena says that 4,052 flights have been scheduled for sunday and that of 296 controllers down to work , 286 are at their posts , enabling airports to " operate fully . " bildunterschrift : the walkout created chaos at spanish airports state of emergency handing over control of airspace to the military on saturday , the spanish government declared the first state of emergency since the death of dictator francisco franco in 1975 . spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero ordered the takeover after some 70 percent of air traffic controllers left their posts or failed to turn up for work on friday . the walkouts came as the country headed into one of its busiest long weekends .
the coming monday and wednesday are state holidays and many people plan to take tuesday off for a five-day weekend . blackmail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government placed the military in command of the skies the unofficial strike came just hours after the cabinet agreed to a package of changes to how the country 's airports are operated .
the government stipulated that the maximum time air traffic controllers could work in a year was 1,670 hours , and announced a plan to sell 49 percent of aena .
the controllers have been locked in a dispute with aena and the transport ministry over the changes for months . by putting the military in charge , the government had upped the ante .
as a consequence , any air traffic controllers who failed to show up for work could have been charged and prosecuted under military law , facing up to 10 years in prison . " if a controller does not show up to his workplace , he will be placed immediately in custody accused of a crime which could mean serious prison sentences , " perez rubalcaba said .
' a popular revolt ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the action stranded some 250,000 passengers in spain union leaders maintained they had not been striking .
but camila cela , head of the usca air traffic controllers ' union , told reuters that " this is a popular revolt . " jorge ontiveros , a spokesman for the syndicate union of air controllers , told the afp news agency that the working hours stipulation would mean that time taken off for paternity leave or sick days would not count towards the maximum hours . " we have reached our limit mentally with the new decree approved this morning obliging us to work more hours , " he said .
" we took the decision individually , which then spread to other colleagues because they can not carry on like this .
in this situation we can not control planes , " he said . the cabinet 's decision on friday was part of an effort to rein in costs , raise money , calm the markets and avoid the kind of debt crisis that greece and ireland have seen in the last year . authors : holly fox , andreas illmer -lrb- afp , dpa , reuters -rrb- editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the internet can not be a lawless space without rules , chancellor angela merkel has warned . the german government on the weekend pushed for improved protection of personal data on the internet .
ahead of a national it summit on tuesday , both german chancellor angela merkel and justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger have demanded binding rules for the use of private data online .
" we have to decide this in a broad discussion in society , " merkel said in her weekly video blog on saturday .
" the internet can not be a lawless space without rules .
but we also have to be careful not to curtail the opportunities that the internet offers . "
leutheusser-schnarrenberger told the monday edition of the hamburger abendblatt daily that any law or regulation should n't be limited to only certain websites .
" the debates about social networks like facebook or internet services like google street view have shown that our data protection jurisdiction has to be fundamentally reworked , " she wrote .
in order to better protect individuals , leutheusser-schnarrenberger called for opt-in options and a right of objection to be part of any new legislation on the matter .
social networks such as facebook could be forced to implement higher levels of data protection on their sites .
as a particular danger , the justice minister mentioned companies creating profiles of individual internet users .
wikileaks affair ' shocking ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kauder says the us has to better protect sensitive data volker kauder , parliamentary leader of merkel 's christian democrats , said everybody should have the right to find out exactly what kind of personal information and data is stored on the web - and should have the right to have that data deleted anytime .
with reference to the recent wikileaks release of classified us cables , kauder also lashed out at how sloppily washington handled the sensitive data .
he told the sunday edition of mass circulation daily bild that the us needed to improve data protection .
" it is shocking when you find out that more than 2 million people in the united states had access to this sensitive data , " kauder told the paper .
" it 's irresponsible and not in the interest of the us either . "
the comments over the weekend came ahead of the country 's fifth national it summit on tuesday where a group of experts from politics , business and science will discuss problems and controversies caused by new technology and the internet .
both merkel and leutheusser-schnarrenberger are expected to attend the summit , along with interior minister thomas de maiziere and other high-profile politicians .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de christmas -pipe- 05.12.2010 racism controversy dampens holland 's sinterklaas tradition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. nicholas brings treats to kids in many european countries on december 6 children across europe eagerly await the arrival of st. nicholas on december 6 .
but in holland , the tradition has racist implications that the dutch are n't quite willing to give up . for the dutch , sinterklaasavond -lrb- st. nicholas eve -rrb- on december 5 is the biggest celebration of the year - bigger than christmas .
that evening , families gather and exchange presents , and children leave out their shoes in the hopes that sinterklaas will have fill them with candy by the next morning . what seems like a harmless holiday devoted to gifts , candy , and children , has a catch : sinterklaas ' helpers , the zwarte pieten or " black peters , " are portrayed according to degrading racial stereotypes . they 're typically dressed in 19th-century moorish outfits , curly afro wigs , and painted red lips .
it is common for both adults and children to dress up as zwarte piet , complete with their faces painted black . " zwarte piet is a person who is happy , who is the assistant of st. nicholas , the first person who has contact with children and speaks with children , " said bert jansen , a schoolteacher in rotterdam who has organized the rotterdam sinterklaas parade for 10 years and also walks in the parade as the chief zwarte piet . indeed , nowadays the zwarte pieten are friendly characters that are clever and mischievous , and adored by children .
yet in the original sinterklaas story , the zwarte pieten were slaves .
gradually , the tale evolved and they became sinterklaas ' helpers , but they were portrayed as being stupid and spoke broken dutch with a surinamese accent .
they were also frightening figures : it was their job to punish misbehaved children by beating them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zwarte piet help bring sweets to kids that have been good in an effort to tone down any racist implication , the story now says zwarte piet is black because they 're covered in chimney soot .
however , some say that explanation is unconvincing . " that just does n't work for someone who is a grown-up .
where did the afro come from ? " commented ama van dantzig , a resident of amsterdam whose mother is ghanian and father dutch . questioning the tradition the proposal to eliminate zwarte piet from the celebration altogether has arisen from time to time , but not yet taken hold . " personally , i think it is an invented tradition and sinterklaas can stay , but the zwarte pieten have to go , " said artwell cain , director of the national institute for the study of dutch slavery and its legacy -lrb- ninsee -rrb- .
" it is an affront to people of the african diaspora in the netherlands , and it is not proper in this age . " the question is even more urgent today as the netherlands is focusing more on integration efforts and the right-wing party for freedom - led by controversial figure geert wilders - is the third largest party in the parliament . at a time when there is pressure for minorities to integrate into dutch society , a tradition like zwarte piet sends the wrong message , cain said . " if you are developing this sense of belonging and then this tradition of zwarte piet is running around , it diminishes your confidence in what you are as a dutch person , " cain said .
" you become something like an ambiguous citizen .
you question yourself : ' why do i have to enjoy this ?
why do i have to be confronted openly with this form of racism ? " ' others see zwarte piet as an essential dutch tradition that is enjoyed by all children and families , regardless of race or ethnic background . " everyone is happy about zwarte piet , and if you are from holland or you come from morocco or somalia , every child puts his shoe by the door or chimney in the hope that zwarte piet puts a present in his shoe ; everyone does it , " said peter boelhouwer , an event organizer who has managed the sinterklaas parade in the hague for the past 10 years . a 19th-century creation although celebrations around sinterklaas date back to the 16th century , they were usually spontaneous , wild celebrations in the street , said john helsloot , a researcher at the meertens institute who specializes in sinterklaas traditions .
the current story of sinterklaas and zwarte piet dates back to 1850 , when jan schenkman , a schoolteacher from amsterdam , published an illustrated children 's book that introduced many elements of the sinterklaas story that caught on , including the zwarte pieten . the book was quite popular among the bourgeois and there was a readiness to adopt the festival , helsloot said .
from there , it slowly evolved into the celebration that exists today . it 's not uncommon for st. nicholas figures to have a devilish companion - such a figure exists in both austrian and swiss traditions - but the netherlands is the only place where he is imagined as a black man .
it is difficult to say why this particular story emerged here , but helsloot suggested that it could be tied to the dutch abolishment of slavery in 1863 . " you can see that racism was stronger even after the abolishment of slavery , " helsloot said .
" zwarte piet was part of this general idea of foreign people , black people as frightening , and that people should be punished by frightening figures . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the zwarte pieten are seen as sinterklaas ' helpers goodbye to zwarte piet ? if lasting changes are to be made to the zwarte pieten , it seems they will have to be organic rather than imposed by a political organization .
in 2006 , the dutch programme foundation encouraged people to paint their faces with rainbow colors , but the effort failed and the next year the usual zwarte piet black face returned . though that 's not to say change is n't possible .
" with more and more people like me who become dutch and do n't find it necessary that the zwarte pieten stay black , it can change , but slowly , " said sueli brodin , a resident of maastricht who is japanese-french and has lived in the netherlands for 19 years .
" it has to happen naturally because society is changing . " helsloot also could see a future where children smear their faces with black ink rather than paint their whole faces black to lose the racial association and show instead that zwarte piet is actually covered in chimney soot . still others say zwarte piet must be taken out of the tradition completely . " i think it can happen , but it is completely tied to the question of racism in general and how we are conscious about how racism affects the whole of society , " said max van lingen , a representative of the international socialists who works on anti-racism campaigns .
" this is not something that will happen within the next five years ; it really is a long battle . " van dantzig is not as optimistic .
" the people around me are highly educated , internationally-oriented people and the dutch in that group do n't understand the big deal with zwarte piet , and they are the future change makers if you ask me , " she said .

the satellites were supposed to complete the russian navigation system glonass , a rival to the american gps . russia has lost three of its satellites intended to complete a new navigation system to rival the american gps network .
the satellites are believed to have crashed into the pacific ocean after the rocket carrying them failed to reach orbit .
the satellites were carried by a proton-m rocket which took off from russia 's baikonur space center in kazakhstan early on sunday .
later , a second-stage booster rocket failed , leading to the upper-stage rocket with the satellites probably falling into the pacific not far from the hawaiian islands , russian space industry official said .
the loss of the three satellites weighing around 1.4 tons is estimated to cost russia several hundred million euros .
glonass launch not affected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glanoss is intended to rival the us gps navigation system the russian defense ministry played down the significance of the loss , saying the incident would not affect the rollout of the new glonass-m positioning system .

this allows a complete coverage of the territory , " a ministry statement said .
" the russian space industry 's capacity enables us to react rapidly to what 's happened , " it said .
officials insist the system would be fully operational next year .
the glonass system dates back to soviet times when development started in 1976 .
the network is intended to be an alternative to the us global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- and was supposed to be in place by the end of january 2011 in order to lessen moscow 's dependence on gps .
the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- is developing its own galileo system to rival both gps and glonass .

glonass launch not affected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glanoss is intended to rival the us gps navigation system the russian defense ministry played down the significance of the loss , saying the incident would not affect the rollout of the new glonass-m positioning system .
" there are currently 26 satellites in the glonass constellation , including two emergency satellites .
this allows a complete coverage of the territory , " a ministry statement said .
" the russian space industry 's capacity enables us to react rapidly to what 's happened , " it said .
officials insist the system would be fully operational next year .
the glonass system dates back to soviet times when development started in 1976 .
the network is intended to be an alternative to the us global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- and was supposed to be in place by the end of january 2011 in order to lessen moscow 's dependence on gps .
the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- is developing its own galileo system to rival both gps and glonass .

but in holland , the tradition has racist implications that the dutch are n't quite willing to give up . for the dutch , sinterklaasavond -lrb- st. nicholas eve -rrb- on december 5 is the biggest celebration of the year - bigger than christmas .
that evening , families gather and exchange presents , and children leave out their shoes in the hopes that sinterklaas will have fill them with candy by the next morning . what seems like a harmless holiday devoted to gifts , candy , and children , has a catch : sinterklaas ' helpers , the zwarte pieten or " black peters , " are portrayed according to degrading racial stereotypes . they 're typically dressed in 19th-century moorish outfits , curly afro wigs , and painted red lips .
it is common for both adults and children to dress up as zwarte piet , complete with their faces painted black . " zwarte piet is a person who is happy , who is the assistant of st. nicholas , the first person who has contact with children and speaks with children , " said bert jansen , a schoolteacher in rotterdam who has organized the rotterdam sinterklaas parade for 10 years and also walks in the parade as the chief zwarte piet . indeed , nowadays the zwarte pieten are friendly characters that are clever and mischievous , and adored by children .
yet in the original sinterklaas story , the zwarte pieten were slaves .
gradually , the tale evolved and they became sinterklaas ' helpers , but they were portrayed as being stupid and spoke broken dutch with a surinamese accent .
they were also frightening figures : it was their job to punish misbehaved children by beating them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zwarte piet help bring sweets to kids that have been good in an effort to tone down any racist implication , the story now says zwarte piet is black because they 're covered in chimney soot .
however , some say that explanation is unconvincing . " that just does n't work for someone who is a grown-up .
where did the afro come from ? " commented ama van dantzig , a resident of amsterdam whose mother is ghanian and father dutch . questioning the tradition the proposal to eliminate zwarte piet from the celebration altogether has arisen from time to time , but not yet taken hold . " personally , i think it is an invented tradition and sinterklaas can stay , but the zwarte pieten have to go , " said artwell cain , director of the national institute for the study of dutch slavery and its legacy -lrb- ninsee -rrb- .
" it is an affront to people of the african diaspora in the netherlands , and it is not proper in this age . " the question is even more urgent today as the netherlands is focusing more on integration efforts and the right-wing party for freedom - led by controversial figure geert wilders - is the third largest party in the parliament . at a time when there is pressure for minorities to integrate into dutch society , a tradition like zwarte piet sends the wrong message , cain said . " if you are developing this sense of belonging and then this tradition of zwarte piet is running around , it diminishes your confidence in what you are as a dutch person , " cain said .
" you become something like an ambiguous citizen .
you question yourself : ' why do i have to enjoy this ?
why do i have to be confronted openly with this form of racism ? " ' others see zwarte piet as an essential dutch tradition that is enjoyed by all children and families , regardless of race or ethnic background . " everyone is happy about zwarte piet , and if you are from holland or you come from morocco or somalia , every child puts his shoe by the door or chimney in the hope that zwarte piet puts a present in his shoe ; everyone does it , " said peter boelhouwer , an event organizer who has managed the sinterklaas parade in the hague for the past 10 years . a 19th-century creation although celebrations around sinterklaas date back to the 16th century , they were usually spontaneous , wild celebrations in the street , said john helsloot , a researcher at the meertens institute who specializes in sinterklaas traditions .
the current story of sinterklaas and zwarte piet dates back to 1850 , when jan schenkman , a schoolteacher from amsterdam , published an illustrated children 's book that introduced many elements of the sinterklaas story that caught on , including the zwarte pieten . the book was quite popular among the bourgeois and there was a readiness to adopt the festival , helsloot said .
from there , it slowly evolved into the celebration that exists today . it 's not uncommon for st. nicholas figures to have a devilish companion - such a figure exists in both austrian and swiss traditions - but the netherlands is the only place where he is imagined as a black man .
it is difficult to say why this particular story emerged here , but helsloot suggested that it could be tied to the dutch abolishment of slavery in 1863 . " you can see that racism was stronger even after the abolishment of slavery , " helsloot said .
" zwarte piet was part of this general idea of foreign people , black people as frightening , and that people should be punished by frightening figures . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the zwarte pieten are seen as sinterklaas ' helpers goodbye to zwarte piet ? if lasting changes are to be made to the zwarte pieten , it seems they will have to be organic rather than imposed by a political organization .
in 2006 , the dutch programme foundation encouraged people to paint their faces with rainbow colors , but the effort failed and the next year the usual zwarte piet black face returned . though that 's not to say change is n't possible .
" with more and more people like me who become dutch and do n't find it necessary that the zwarte pieten stay black , it can change , but slowly , " said sueli brodin , a resident of maastricht who is japanese-french and has lived in the netherlands for 19 years .
" it has to happen naturally because society is changing . " helsloot also could see a future where children smear their faces with black ink rather than paint their whole faces black to lose the racial association and show instead that zwarte piet is actually covered in chimney soot . still others say zwarte piet must be taken out of the tradition completely . " i think it can happen , but it is completely tied to the question of racism in general and how we are conscious about how racism affects the whole of society , " said max van lingen , a representative of the international socialists who works on anti-racism campaigns .
" this is not something that will happen within the next five years ; it really is a long battle . " van dantzig is not as optimistic .
" the people around me are highly educated , internationally-oriented people and the dutch in that group do n't understand the big deal with zwarte piet , and they are the future change makers if you ask me , " she said .
" they are very protective of zwarte piet and it will be difficult to change it . " author : rebecca farivar editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

every state must " accept freedom and free reporting by journalists , therefore i appeal to the iranian government to release the two reporters before christmas , " scheel added .
von weizsaecker , germany 's president from 1984 to 1994 , described iran as a " significant country with a great , independent culture -lsb- ... -rsb- and a distinct self-confidence , " also including a plea for tehran not to take revenge on the journalists .

" they broke the law , " esfandiar rahim mashaie , a senior aide to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung weekly on sunday .
" they entered the country on tourist visas and worked as journalists , " he said , adding however , that the two were not facing charges of espionage as earlier reports had suggested .
mashaie also said he was optimistic that the german request for the detained to be allowed to celebrate christmas with their families would be granted .

but in holland , the tradition has racist implications that the dutch are n't quite willing to give up . for the dutch , sinterklaasavond -lrb- st. nicholas eve -rrb- on december 5 is the biggest celebration of the year - bigger than christmas .
that evening , families gather and exchange presents , and children leave out their shoes in the hopes that sinterklaas will have fill them with candy by the next morning . what seems like a harmless holiday devoted to gifts , candy , and children , has a catch : sinterklaas ' helpers , the zwarte pieten or " black peters , " are portrayed according to degrading racial stereotypes . they 're typically dressed in 19th-century moorish outfits , curly afro wigs , and painted red lips .
it is common for both adults and children to dress up as zwarte piet , complete with their faces painted black . " zwarte piet is a person who is happy , who is the assistant of st. nicholas , the first person who has contact with children and speaks with children , " said bert jansen , a schoolteacher in rotterdam who has organized the rotterdam sinterklaas parade for 10 years and also walks in the parade as the chief zwarte piet . indeed , nowadays the zwarte pieten are friendly characters that are clever and mischievous , and adored by children .
yet in the original sinterklaas story , the zwarte pieten were slaves .
gradually , the tale evolved and they became sinterklaas ' helpers , but they were portrayed as being stupid and spoke broken dutch with a surinamese accent .
they were also frightening figures : it was their job to punish misbehaved children by beating them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zwarte piet help bring sweets to kids that have been good in an effort to tone down any racist implication , the story now says zwarte piet is black because they 're covered in chimney soot .
however , some say that explanation is unconvincing . " that just does n't work for someone who is a grown-up .
where did the afro come from ? " commented ama van dantzig , a resident of amsterdam whose mother is ghanian and father dutch . questioning the tradition the proposal to eliminate zwarte piet from the celebration altogether has arisen from time to time , but not yet taken hold . " personally , i think it is an invented tradition and sinterklaas can stay , but the zwarte pieten have to go , " said artwell cain , director of the national institute for the study of dutch slavery and its legacy -lrb- ninsee -rrb- .
" it is an affront to people of the african diaspora in the netherlands , and it is not proper in this age . " the question is even more urgent today as the netherlands is focusing more on integration efforts and the right-wing party for freedom - led by controversial figure geert wilders - is the third largest party in the parliament . at a time when there is pressure for minorities to integrate into dutch society , a tradition like zwarte piet sends the wrong message , cain said . " if you are developing this sense of belonging and then this tradition of zwarte piet is running around , it diminishes your confidence in what you are as a dutch person , " cain said .
" you become something like an ambiguous citizen .
you question yourself : ' why do i have to enjoy this ?
why do i have to be confronted openly with this form of racism ? " ' others see zwarte piet as an essential dutch tradition that is enjoyed by all children and families , regardless of race or ethnic background . " everyone is happy about zwarte piet , and if you are from holland or you come from morocco or somalia , every child puts his shoe by the door or chimney in the hope that zwarte piet puts a present in his shoe ; everyone does it , " said peter boelhouwer , an event organizer who has managed the sinterklaas parade in the hague for the past 10 years . a 19th-century creation although celebrations around sinterklaas date back to the 16th century , they were usually spontaneous , wild celebrations in the street , said john helsloot , a researcher at the meertens institute who specializes in sinterklaas traditions .
the current story of sinterklaas and zwarte piet dates back to 1850 , when jan schenkman , a schoolteacher from amsterdam , published an illustrated children 's book that introduced many elements of the sinterklaas story that caught on , including the zwarte pieten . the book was quite popular among the bourgeois and there was a readiness to adopt the festival , helsloot said .
from there , it slowly evolved into the celebration that exists today . it 's not uncommon for st. nicholas figures to have a devilish companion - such a figure exists in both austrian and swiss traditions - but the netherlands is the only place where he is imagined as a black man .
it is difficult to say why this particular story emerged here , but helsloot suggested that it could be tied to the dutch abolishment of slavery in 1863 . " you can see that racism was stronger even after the abolishment of slavery , " helsloot said .
" zwarte piet was part of this general idea of foreign people , black people as frightening , and that people should be punished by frightening figures . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the zwarte pieten are seen as sinterklaas ' helpers goodbye to zwarte piet ? if lasting changes are to be made to the zwarte pieten , it seems they will have to be organic rather than imposed by a political organization .
in 2006 , the dutch programme foundation encouraged people to paint their faces with rainbow colors , but the effort failed and the next year the usual zwarte piet black face returned . though that 's not to say change is n't possible .
" with more and more people like me who become dutch and do n't find it necessary that the zwarte pieten stay black , it can change , but slowly , " said sueli brodin , a resident of maastricht who is japanese-french and has lived in the netherlands for 19 years .
" it has to happen naturally because society is changing . " helsloot also could see a future where children smear their faces with black ink rather than paint their whole faces black to lose the racial association and show instead that zwarte piet is actually covered in chimney soot . still others say zwarte piet must be taken out of the tradition completely . " i think it can happen , but it is completely tied to the question of racism in general and how we are conscious about how racism affects the whole of society , " said max van lingen , a representative of the international socialists who works on anti-racism campaigns .
" this is not something that will happen within the next five years ; it really is a long battle . " van dantzig is not as optimistic .
" the people around me are highly educated , internationally-oriented people and the dutch in that group do n't understand the big deal with zwarte piet , and they are the future change makers if you ask me , " she said .

but in holland , the tradition has racist implications that the dutch are n't quite willing to give up . for the dutch , sinterklaasavond -lrb- st. nicholas eve -rrb- on december 5 is the biggest celebration of the year - bigger than christmas .
that evening , families gather and exchange presents , and children leave out their shoes in the hopes that sinterklaas will have fill them with candy by the next morning . what seems like a harmless holiday devoted to gifts , candy , and children , has a catch : sinterklaas ' helpers , the zwarte pieten or " black peters , " are portrayed according to degrading racial stereotypes . they 're typically dressed in 19th-century moorish outfits , curly afro wigs , and painted red lips .
it is common for both adults and children to dress up as zwarte piet , complete with their faces painted black . " zwarte piet is a person who is happy , who is the assistant of st. nicholas , the first person who has contact with children and speaks with children , " said bert jansen , a schoolteacher in rotterdam who has organized the rotterdam sinterklaas parade for 10 years and also walks in the parade as the chief zwarte piet . indeed , nowadays the zwarte pieten are friendly characters that are clever and mischievous , and adored by children .
yet in the original sinterklaas story , the zwarte pieten were slaves .
gradually , the tale evolved and they became sinterklaas ' helpers , but they were portrayed as being stupid and spoke broken dutch with a surinamese accent .
they were also frightening figures : it was their job to punish misbehaved children by beating them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zwarte piet help bring sweets to kids that have been good in an effort to tone down any racist implication , the story now says zwarte piet is black because they 're covered in chimney soot .
however , some say that explanation is unconvincing . " that just does n't work for someone who is a grown-up .
where did the afro come from ? " commented ama van dantzig , a resident of amsterdam whose mother is ghanian and father dutch . questioning the tradition the proposal to eliminate zwarte piet from the celebration altogether has arisen from time to time , but not yet taken hold . " personally , i think it is an invented tradition and sinterklaas can stay , but the zwarte pieten have to go , " said artwell cain , director of the national institute for the study of dutch slavery and its legacy -lrb- ninsee -rrb- .
" it is an affront to people of the african diaspora in the netherlands , and it is not proper in this age . " the question is even more urgent today as the netherlands is focusing more on integration efforts and the right-wing party for freedom - led by controversial figure geert wilders - is the third largest party in the parliament . at a time when there is pressure for minorities to integrate into dutch society , a tradition like zwarte piet sends the wrong message , cain said . " if you are developing this sense of belonging and then this tradition of zwarte piet is running around , it diminishes your confidence in what you are as a dutch person , " cain said .
" you become something like an ambiguous citizen .
you question yourself : ' why do i have to enjoy this ?
why do i have to be confronted openly with this form of racism ? " ' others see zwarte piet as an essential dutch tradition that is enjoyed by all children and families , regardless of race or ethnic background . " everyone is happy about zwarte piet , and if you are from holland or you come from morocco or somalia , every child puts his shoe by the door or chimney in the hope that zwarte piet puts a present in his shoe ; everyone does it , " said peter boelhouwer , an event organizer who has managed the sinterklaas parade in the hague for the past 10 years . a 19th-century creation although celebrations around sinterklaas date back to the 16th century , they were usually spontaneous , wild celebrations in the street , said john helsloot , a researcher at the meertens institute who specializes in sinterklaas traditions .
the current story of sinterklaas and zwarte piet dates back to 1850 , when jan schenkman , a schoolteacher from amsterdam , published an illustrated children 's book that introduced many elements of the sinterklaas story that caught on , including the zwarte pieten . the book was quite popular among the bourgeois and there was a readiness to adopt the festival , helsloot said .
from there , it slowly evolved into the celebration that exists today . it 's not uncommon for st. nicholas figures to have a devilish companion - such a figure exists in both austrian and swiss traditions - but the netherlands is the only place where he is imagined as a black man .
it is difficult to say why this particular story emerged here , but helsloot suggested that it could be tied to the dutch abolishment of slavery in 1863 . " you can see that racism was stronger even after the abolishment of slavery , " helsloot said .
" zwarte piet was part of this general idea of foreign people , black people as frightening , and that people should be punished by frightening figures . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the zwarte pieten are seen as sinterklaas ' helpers goodbye to zwarte piet ? if lasting changes are to be made to the zwarte pieten , it seems they will have to be organic rather than imposed by a political organization .
in 2006 , the dutch programme foundation encouraged people to paint their faces with rainbow colors , but the effort failed and the next year the usual zwarte piet black face returned . though that 's not to say change is n't possible .
" with more and more people like me who become dutch and do n't find it necessary that the zwarte pieten stay black , it can change , but slowly , " said sueli brodin , a resident of maastricht who is japanese-french and has lived in the netherlands for 19 years .
" it has to happen naturally because society is changing . " helsloot also could see a future where children smear their faces with black ink rather than paint their whole faces black to lose the racial association and show instead that zwarte piet is actually covered in chimney soot . still others say zwarte piet must be taken out of the tradition completely . " i think it can happen , but it is completely tied to the question of racism in general and how we are conscious about how racism affects the whole of society , " said max van lingen , a representative of the international socialists who works on anti-racism campaigns .
" this is not something that will happen within the next five years ; it really is a long battle . " van dantzig is not as optimistic .

in heavy snow , mats hummels and robert lewandowski helped dortmund get their 13th win of the season from a total of 15 matches so far .
second-place mainz blew their chance to close the gap on saturday as they suffered a 2-1 defeat at the hands of frankfurt .
dortmund are now 10 points clear of mainz , which means they already have secured the so-called " autumn championship " - the number one spot before the season goes into winter break .

leverkusen took the lead 21 minutes into the match when striker patrick helmes put the ball into the net after a bad clearance by nuremberg keeper faryd mondragon .
however , it took only six minutes for cologne to equalize .
pedro geromel headed the ball into the box after a free kick by germany international lukas podolski .
in the second half hosts leverkusen again went ahead with tranquillo barnetta and stefan reinartz both scoring within six minutes of each other .
in the 65th minute , cologne substitute martin lanig brought his side back into the game but eventually the team had to concede defeat to leverkusen .
leverkusen are now third in the table , only one point behind second-place mainz .
pundits say leverkusen might be the only team still able to challenge dortmund for this season 's title .
after their disappointing 2-0 loss to schalke on saturday , last season 's champions bayern munich were back in the headlines on sunday when coach louis van gaal conceded his side may have already lost the bundesliga title race to dortmund .
bayern are trailing borussia dortmund by 17 points .

the internet can not be a lawless space without rules , chancellor angela merkel has warned . the german government on the weekend pushed for improved protection of personal data on the internet .
ahead of a national it summit on tuesday , both german chancellor angela merkel and justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger have demanded binding rules for the use of private data online .
" we have to decide this in a broad discussion in society , " merkel said in her weekly video blog on saturday .
" the internet can not be a lawless space without rules .
but we also have to be careful not to curtail the opportunities that the internet offers . "
leutheusser-schnarrenberger told the monday edition of the hamburger abendblatt daily that any law or regulation should n't be limited to only certain websites .
" the debates about social networks like facebook or internet services like google street view have shown that our data protection jurisdiction has to be fundamentally reworked , " she wrote .
in order to better protect individuals , leutheusser-schnarrenberger called for opt-in options and a right of objection to be part of any new legislation on the matter .
social networks such as facebook could be forced to implement higher levels of data protection on their sites .
as a particular danger , the justice minister mentioned companies creating profiles of individual internet users .
wikileaks affair ' shocking ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kauder says the us has to better protect sensitive data volker kauder , parliamentary leader of merkel 's christian democrats , said everybody should have the right to find out exactly what kind of personal information and data is stored on the web - and should have the right to have that data deleted anytime .
with reference to the recent wikileaks release of classified us cables , kauder also lashed out at how sloppily washington handled the sensitive data .
he told the sunday edition of mass circulation daily bild that the us needed to improve data protection .
" it is shocking when you find out that more than 2 million people in the united states had access to this sensitive data , " kauder told the paper .
" it 's irresponsible and not in the interest of the us either . "
the comments over the weekend came ahead of the country 's fifth national it summit on tuesday where a group of experts from politics , business and science will discuss problems and controversies caused by new technology and the internet .
both merkel and leutheusser-schnarrenberger are expected to attend the summit , along with interior minister thomas de maiziere and other high-profile politicians .

" we have to decide this in a broad discussion in society , " merkel said in her weekly video blog on saturday .
" the internet can not be a lawless space without rules .

leutheusser-schnarrenberger told the monday edition of the hamburger abendblatt daily that any law or regulation should n't be limited to only certain websites .
" the debates about social networks like facebook or internet services like google street view have shown that our data protection jurisdiction has to be fundamentally reworked , " she wrote .

the satellites were supposed to complete the russian navigation system glonass , a rival to the american gps . russia has lost three of its satellites intended to complete a new navigation system to rival the american gps network .
the satellites are believed to have crashed into the pacific ocean after the rocket carrying them failed to reach orbit .
the satellites were carried by a proton-m rocket which took off from russia 's baikonur space center in kazakhstan early on sunday .
later , a second-stage booster rocket failed , leading to the upper-stage rocket with the satellites probably falling into the pacific not far from the hawaiian islands , russian space industry official said .
the loss of the three satellites weighing around 1.4 tons is estimated to cost russia several hundred million euros .
glonass launch not affected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glanoss is intended to rival the us gps navigation system the russian defense ministry played down the significance of the loss , saying the incident would not affect the rollout of the new glonass-m positioning system .
" there are currently 26 satellites in the glonass constellation , including two emergency satellites .
this allows a complete coverage of the territory , " a ministry statement said .
" the russian space industry 's capacity enables us to react rapidly to what 's happened , " it said .
officials insist the system would be fully operational next year .
the glonass system dates back to soviet times when development started in 1976 .
the network is intended to be an alternative to the us global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- and was supposed to be in place by the end of january 2011 in order to lessen moscow 's dependence on gps .
the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- is developing its own galileo system to rival both gps and glonass .

the satellites were supposed to complete the russian navigation system glonass , a rival to the american gps . russia has lost three of its satellites intended to complete a new navigation system to rival the american gps network .
the satellites are believed to have crashed into the pacific ocean after the rocket carrying them failed to reach orbit .
the satellites were carried by a proton-m rocket which took off from russia 's baikonur space center in kazakhstan early on sunday .
later , a second-stage booster rocket failed , leading to the upper-stage rocket with the satellites probably falling into the pacific not far from the hawaiian islands , russian space industry official said .
the loss of the three satellites weighing around 1.4 tons is estimated to cost russia several hundred million euros .
glonass launch not affected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glanoss is intended to rival the us gps navigation system the russian defense ministry played down the significance of the loss , saying the incident would not affect the rollout of the new glonass-m positioning system .
" there are currently 26 satellites in the glonass constellation , including two emergency satellites .
this allows a complete coverage of the territory , " a ministry statement said .
" the russian space industry 's capacity enables us to react rapidly to what 's happened , " it said .
officials insist the system would be fully operational next year .
the glonass system dates back to soviet times when development started in 1976 .
the network is intended to be an alternative to the us global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- and was supposed to be in place by the end of january 2011 in order to lessen moscow 's dependence on gps .
the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- is developing its own galileo system to rival both gps and glonass .

beating nuremberg on sunday they are now lonely at the top , 10 points clear of mainz . dortmund on sunday extended their lead at the top of the table taking a big step towards their first bundesliga title in nine years .
the team beat nuremberg 2-0 and are now 10 points clear of second-place mainz .
in heavy snow , mats hummels and robert lewandowski helped dortmund get their 13th win of the season from a total of 15 matches so far .
second-place mainz blew their chance to close the gap on saturday as they suffered a 2-1 defeat at the hands of frankfurt .
dortmund are now 10 points clear of mainz , which means they already have secured the so-called " autumn championship " - the number one spot before the season goes into winter break .
there are still two matches to be played before the break but it 's now impossible for mainz to catch up with dortmund .
leverkusen strong in third place bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmes -lrb- left -rrb- opened scoring for leverkusen earlier on sunday , bayer leverkusen beat visitors cologne 3-2 in a game played in snow and freezing temperatures .
leverkusen took the lead 21 minutes into the match when striker patrick helmes put the ball into the net after a bad clearance by nuremberg keeper faryd mondragon .
however , it took only six minutes for cologne to equalize .
pedro geromel headed the ball into the box after a free kick by germany international lukas podolski .
in the second half hosts leverkusen again went ahead with tranquillo barnetta and stefan reinartz both scoring within six minutes of each other .
in the 65th minute , cologne substitute martin lanig brought his side back into the game but eventually the team had to concede defeat to leverkusen .
leverkusen are now third in the table , only one point behind second-place mainz .
pundits say leverkusen might be the only team still able to challenge dortmund for this season 's title .
after their disappointing 2-0 loss to schalke on saturday , last season 's champions bayern munich were back in the headlines on sunday when coach louis van gaal conceded his side may have already lost the bundesliga title race to dortmund .
bayern are trailing borussia dortmund by 17 points .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 05.12.2010 madrid street drinkers test neighbors ' patience großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drinking outdoors means avoiding the markups in a bar tough economic times and a desire for freedom have driven young spaniards out of the bars and onto the streets .
rambunctious revelers are subjecting local residents to noise levels of up to three times the legal limit . the la latina neighborhood of madrid 's old town is famous for its high concentration of tapas bars .
however , they are shunned by thousands of young drinkers who gather instead in the scenic plazas and winding streets of the city center . it 's a phenomenon spain has fittingly dubbed botellon , or " big bottle . " " this is one of the typical places in madrid to go out , " said elena , a biology student in her early 20s , while drinking rum and coke outside with a group of friends on a sunday night .
" there are people with guitars and there 's a great atmosphere .
it 's nice , really the true madrid . " sitting cross-legged in a raucous circle , the five students said that when they go out , they gravitate to the pavement , where they feel less inhibited .
as midnight neared on sunday in this densely populated area , the group got progressively louder . " no , you really do n't think about the neighbors , " elena said , her friends shouting and yelling around her .
" sometimes you try to be quiet , but it 's difficult .
but neighbors can call the police so it 's better not to be screaming . " fines go uncollected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people do n't want to be told what to do , where to drink and how much to pay the municipal police can fine street drinkers up to 360 euros -lrb- around $ 475 -rrb- .
they have issued 22,000 fines since january , though only a fraction of them are actually enforced .
also , offenders can choose to attend a talk about alcohol addiction instead of paying up . a police car drove past elena and her friends , but ignored them and continued on to the next botellon spot , next to a 17-century church at plaza de la cebada .
there , a small group of women in their late 20s sat quietly sharing a liter of beer . two of them were unemployed - like over 40 percent of young spaniards .
they explained that they were simply looking for cheaper nights out . arif , a 24-year-old immigrant from bangladesh , was on-hand to supply precisely that .
he was one of half a dozen men laden with plastic bags who were working the square that night .
he said in broken spanish that he had no papers to work legally , but managed to earn enough money selling drinks to pay for food and rent . business was going well that night - not surprising , considering a beer from arif cost just one euro , compared to four euros in one of the many bars in this upwardly mobile district .
but , with his illegal status , it 's also high risk job .
arif and the other vendors vanished seconds later , when police entered the square . the freedom to choose the two officers half-heartedly emptied a bottle of beer on to the pavement , dished out some warnings , and the square cleared in a matter of seconds as drinkers picked up their bags and ambled off . five minutes later , the police left and the square filled up once more . " i think it 's a policy of persecuting young people to force them into habits sanctioned by the authorities , " said nacho , a 24-year-old engineering student who had resumed drinking whiskey and coke out of a plastic cup .
" they are forcing us to go to the bars they want , at the times they want , to pay the prices they want - we ca n't pay those prices .
we 'd prefer to meet up in an environment we have control over . " nacho said most young spaniards ca n't afford their own homes .
the high cost of living , low wages and a stagnant , unsubsidized rental market mean the plaza is a good , non-commercial meeting place for many . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outdoor parties can reach volume levels deemed unhealthy unhealthy noise levels the botellon is making nights unbearable for residents who have the misfortune to live in the zones where people chose to congregate . " it 's difficult to avoid the botellon in my neighborhood , " explained esteban benito , the vice-president of a residents ' association in chueca , a district famous for its gay nightlife .
" many people have chronic problems getting to sleep - they take sleeping pills or sleep with ear plugs , but nothing can shut out the racket . " half a million madrid residents suffer from noise pollution exceeding 65 decibels , the maximum limit recommended by the world health organization .
the situation in chueca is particularly acute . " people come with powerful sound systems and dance on top of their cars , " said benito .
" they see this as a zone of freedom , but they do n't think about the freedom of those people trying to get to sleep . " benito said residents were at breaking point , sick to death of the noise - which is sometimes triple the legal decibel limit - and the mess drinkers leave behind .
he also warned of an epidemic of out-of-control , underage drinking and said the law is far too lax . ' a game of cat and mouse ' the municipal police charged with stamping out the botellon acknowledged that it is a mammoth task . " we have done a lot of work but the magnificent weather here is not in our favor , " said rosa maria duran , deputy inspector general for madrid .
" it 's a bit like a game of cat and mouse .
we have certain permanent positions where we stop botellon from starting up but now we have the new phenomenon of botellin , or ' little bottle . '
young people are spreading out throughout the district . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neighbors are n't happy about the mess left behind by outdoor drinkers duran highlighted her force 's prevention work in schools but added that they had not given up .
she expressed her hope that the next generation would find different ways of having fun . and it may not be entirely wishful thinking .
a regional health survey has recorded that teenage drinking is down in madrid . benito was doubtful about these statistics .
but his campaigning has started to bear fruit .
madrid 's municipal authorities have now upped fines to 600 euros for drinkers guilty of noise pollution . in the plaza , nacho and his friends had agreed that young people could drink more responsibly and should respect the neighbors - but they were adamant that prohibition would never work . author : hazel healy editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

rambunctious revelers are subjecting local residents to noise levels of up to three times the legal limit . the la latina neighborhood of madrid 's old town is famous for its high concentration of tapas bars .
however , they are shunned by thousands of young drinkers who gather instead in the scenic plazas and winding streets of the city center . it 's a phenomenon spain has fittingly dubbed botellon , or " big bottle . " " this is one of the typical places in madrid to go out , " said elena , a biology student in her early 20s , while drinking rum and coke outside with a group of friends on a sunday night .
" there are people with guitars and there 's a great atmosphere .
it 's nice , really the true madrid . " sitting cross-legged in a raucous circle , the five students said that when they go out , they gravitate to the pavement , where they feel less inhibited .
as midnight neared on sunday in this densely populated area , the group got progressively louder . " no , you really do n't think about the neighbors , " elena said , her friends shouting and yelling around her .
" sometimes you try to be quiet , but it 's difficult .
but neighbors can call the police so it 's better not to be screaming . " fines go uncollected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people do n't want to be told what to do , where to drink and how much to pay the municipal police can fine street drinkers up to 360 euros -lrb- around $ 475 -rrb- .
they have issued 22,000 fines since january , though only a fraction of them are actually enforced .
also , offenders can choose to attend a talk about alcohol addiction instead of paying up . a police car drove past elena and her friends , but ignored them and continued on to the next botellon spot , next to a 17-century church at plaza de la cebada .
there , a small group of women in their late 20s sat quietly sharing a liter of beer . two of them were unemployed - like over 40 percent of young spaniards .
they explained that they were simply looking for cheaper nights out . arif , a 24-year-old immigrant from bangladesh , was on-hand to supply precisely that .
he was one of half a dozen men laden with plastic bags who were working the square that night .
he said in broken spanish that he had no papers to work legally , but managed to earn enough money selling drinks to pay for food and rent . business was going well that night - not surprising , considering a beer from arif cost just one euro , compared to four euros in one of the many bars in this upwardly mobile district .
but , with his illegal status , it 's also high risk job .
arif and the other vendors vanished seconds later , when police entered the square . the freedom to choose the two officers half-heartedly emptied a bottle of beer on to the pavement , dished out some warnings , and the square cleared in a matter of seconds as drinkers picked up their bags and ambled off . five minutes later , the police left and the square filled up once more . " i think it 's a policy of persecuting young people to force them into habits sanctioned by the authorities , " said nacho , a 24-year-old engineering student who had resumed drinking whiskey and coke out of a plastic cup .
" they are forcing us to go to the bars they want , at the times they want , to pay the prices they want - we ca n't pay those prices .
we 'd prefer to meet up in an environment we have control over . " nacho said most young spaniards ca n't afford their own homes .
the high cost of living , low wages and a stagnant , unsubsidized rental market mean the plaza is a good , non-commercial meeting place for many . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outdoor parties can reach volume levels deemed unhealthy unhealthy noise levels the botellon is making nights unbearable for residents who have the misfortune to live in the zones where people chose to congregate . " it 's difficult to avoid the botellon in my neighborhood , " explained esteban benito , the vice-president of a residents ' association in chueca , a district famous for its gay nightlife .
" many people have chronic problems getting to sleep - they take sleeping pills or sleep with ear plugs , but nothing can shut out the racket . " half a million madrid residents suffer from noise pollution exceeding 65 decibels , the maximum limit recommended by the world health organization .
the situation in chueca is particularly acute . " people come with powerful sound systems and dance on top of their cars , " said benito .
" they see this as a zone of freedom , but they do n't think about the freedom of those people trying to get to sleep . " benito said residents were at breaking point , sick to death of the noise - which is sometimes triple the legal decibel limit - and the mess drinkers leave behind .
he also warned of an epidemic of out-of-control , underage drinking and said the law is far too lax . ' a game of cat and mouse ' the municipal police charged with stamping out the botellon acknowledged that it is a mammoth task . " we have done a lot of work but the magnificent weather here is not in our favor , " said rosa maria duran , deputy inspector general for madrid .
" it 's a bit like a game of cat and mouse .
we have certain permanent positions where we stop botellon from starting up but now we have the new phenomenon of botellin , or ' little bottle . '
young people are spreading out throughout the district . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neighbors are n't happy about the mess left behind by outdoor drinkers duran highlighted her force 's prevention work in schools but added that they had not given up .
she expressed her hope that the next generation would find different ways of having fun . and it may not be entirely wishful thinking .
a regional health survey has recorded that teenage drinking is down in madrid . benito was doubtful about these statistics .
but his campaigning has started to bear fruit .
madrid 's municipal authorities have now upped fines to 600 euros for drinkers guilty of noise pollution . in the plaza , nacho and his friends had agreed that young people could drink more responsibly and should respect the neighbors - but they were adamant that prohibition would never work . author : hazel healy editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the internet can not be a lawless space without rules , chancellor angela merkel has warned . the german government on the weekend pushed for improved protection of personal data on the internet .
ahead of a national it summit on tuesday , both german chancellor angela merkel and justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger have demanded binding rules for the use of private data online .
" we have to decide this in a broad discussion in society , " merkel said in her weekly video blog on saturday .
" the internet can not be a lawless space without rules .
but we also have to be careful not to curtail the opportunities that the internet offers . "
leutheusser-schnarrenberger told the monday edition of the hamburger abendblatt daily that any law or regulation should n't be limited to only certain websites .
" the debates about social networks like facebook or internet services like google street view have shown that our data protection jurisdiction has to be fundamentally reworked , " she wrote .
in order to better protect individuals , leutheusser-schnarrenberger called for opt-in options and a right of objection to be part of any new legislation on the matter .
social networks such as facebook could be forced to implement higher levels of data protection on their sites .
as a particular danger , the justice minister mentioned companies creating profiles of individual internet users .
wikileaks affair ' shocking ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kauder says the us has to better protect sensitive data volker kauder , parliamentary leader of merkel 's christian democrats , said everybody should have the right to find out exactly what kind of personal information and data is stored on the web - and should have the right to have that data deleted anytime .
with reference to the recent wikileaks release of classified us cables , kauder also lashed out at how sloppily washington handled the sensitive data .
he told the sunday edition of mass circulation daily bild that the us needed to improve data protection .
" it is shocking when you find out that more than 2 million people in the united states had access to this sensitive data , " kauder told the paper .
" it 's irresponsible and not in the interest of the us either . "
the comments over the weekend came ahead of the country 's fifth national it summit on tuesday where a group of experts from politics , business and science will discuss problems and controversies caused by new technology and the internet .
both merkel and leutheusser-schnarrenberger are expected to attend the summit , along with interior minister thomas de maiziere and other high-profile politicians .

the satellites were supposed to complete the russian navigation system glonass , a rival to the american gps . russia has lost three of its satellites intended to complete a new navigation system to rival the american gps network .
the satellites are believed to have crashed into the pacific ocean after the rocket carrying them failed to reach orbit .
the satellites were carried by a proton-m rocket which took off from russia 's baikonur space center in kazakhstan early on sunday .
later , a second-stage booster rocket failed , leading to the upper-stage rocket with the satellites probably falling into the pacific not far from the hawaiian islands , russian space industry official said .
the loss of the three satellites weighing around 1.4 tons is estimated to cost russia several hundred million euros .
glonass launch not affected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glanoss is intended to rival the us gps navigation system the russian defense ministry played down the significance of the loss , saying the incident would not affect the rollout of the new glonass-m positioning system .
" there are currently 26 satellites in the glonass constellation , including two emergency satellites .
this allows a complete coverage of the territory , " a ministry statement said .
" the russian space industry 's capacity enables us to react rapidly to what 's happened , " it said .
officials insist the system would be fully operational next year .
the glonass system dates back to soviet times when development started in 1976 .
the network is intended to be an alternative to the us global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- and was supposed to be in place by the end of january 2011 in order to lessen moscow 's dependence on gps .
the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- is developing its own galileo system to rival both gps and glonass .

the internet can not be a lawless space without rules , chancellor angela merkel has warned . the german government on the weekend pushed for improved protection of personal data on the internet .
ahead of a national it summit on tuesday , both german chancellor angela merkel and justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger have demanded binding rules for the use of private data online .
" we have to decide this in a broad discussion in society , " merkel said in her weekly video blog on saturday .
" the internet can not be a lawless space without rules .
but we also have to be careful not to curtail the opportunities that the internet offers . "
leutheusser-schnarrenberger told the monday edition of the hamburger abendblatt daily that any law or regulation should n't be limited to only certain websites .
" the debates about social networks like facebook or internet services like google street view have shown that our data protection jurisdiction has to be fundamentally reworked , " she wrote .
in order to better protect individuals , leutheusser-schnarrenberger called for opt-in options and a right of objection to be part of any new legislation on the matter .
social networks such as facebook could be forced to implement higher levels of data protection on their sites .
as a particular danger , the justice minister mentioned companies creating profiles of individual internet users .
wikileaks affair ' shocking ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kauder says the us has to better protect sensitive data volker kauder , parliamentary leader of merkel 's christian democrats , said everybody should have the right to find out exactly what kind of personal information and data is stored on the web - and should have the right to have that data deleted anytime .
with reference to the recent wikileaks release of classified us cables , kauder also lashed out at how sloppily washington handled the sensitive data .
he told the sunday edition of mass circulation daily bild that the us needed to improve data protection .
" it is shocking when you find out that more than 2 million people in the united states had access to this sensitive data , " kauder told the paper .
" it 's irresponsible and not in the interest of the us either . "
the comments over the weekend came ahead of the country 's fifth national it summit on tuesday where a group of experts from politics , business and science will discuss problems and controversies caused by new technology and the internet .
both merkel and leutheusser-schnarrenberger are expected to attend the summit , along with interior minister thomas de maiziere and other high-profile politicians .

pedro geromel headed the ball into the box after a free kick by germany international lukas podolski .
in the second half hosts leverkusen again went ahead with tranquillo barnetta and stefan reinartz both scoring within six minutes of each other .
in the 65th minute , cologne substitute martin lanig brought his side back into the game but eventually the team had to concede defeat to leverkusen .
leverkusen are now third in the table , only one point behind second-place mainz .
pundits say leverkusen might be the only team still able to challenge dortmund for this season 's title .
after their disappointing 2-0 loss to schalke on saturday , last season 's champions bayern munich were back in the headlines on sunday when coach louis van gaal conceded his side may have already lost the bundesliga title race to dortmund .

the daily sueddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- reported on saturday , december 4 , that hsh nordbank had already informed police of possible wrong-doing , after indications of corruption turned up during a smaller-scale investigation conducted months ago .
the bank is suspected of bribing turkish justices to avoid compensation payments in a long-running case with a turkish ship owner .
the sz quoted " board sources " and leaked internal documents which disclosed police were called in to scrutinize the bank 's dealings with prevent , a security firm .
the weekly news magazine der spiegel claimed the board was " well aware " of a large sum - 3.5 million euros -lrb- $ 4.6 million -rrb- - paid to prevent to conduct " off-the-record talks over its network with political and business figures and break the perceived bias . "
embattled bank hsh nordbank was rocked by scandal earlier this year after allegations emerged that it had spied on workers and government officials in hamburg and schleswig holstein , the bank 's two main stakeholders .
the bank 's chief executive , dirk jens nonnenmacher , was asked last month to leave over the affair .
he had also been investigated by prosecutors for risky investments that led to the bank losing millions of euros .

" the government is absolutely determined this will not happen again , " the minister said , addng that madrid would prevent the strikers from walking out over christmas and afterwards . traffic controllers told journalists that the military compelled them to work “ at gunpoint ” in palma de mallorca control tower , but spaniards generally showed little understanding for the strikers who earn an average of 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 267,000 dollars -rrb- a year . spanish airport authorities aena says that 4,052 flights have been scheduled for sunday and that of 296 controllers down to work , 286 are at their posts , enabling airports to " operate fully . " bildunterschrift : the walkout created chaos at spanish airports state of emergency handing over control of airspace to the military on saturday , the spanish government declared the first state of emergency since the death of dictator francisco franco in 1975 . spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero ordered the takeover after some 70 percent of air traffic controllers left their posts or failed to turn up for work on friday . the walkouts came as the country headed into one of its busiest long weekends .
the coming monday and wednesday are state holidays and many people plan to take tuesday off for a five-day weekend . blackmail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government placed the military in command of the skies the unofficial strike came just hours after the cabinet agreed to a package of changes to how the country 's airports are operated .
the government stipulated that the maximum time air traffic controllers could work in a year was 1,670 hours , and announced a plan to sell 49 percent of aena .
the controllers have been locked in a dispute with aena and the transport ministry over the changes for months . by putting the military in charge , the government had upped the ante .
as a consequence , any air traffic controllers who failed to show up for work could have been charged and prosecuted under military law , facing up to 10 years in prison . " if a controller does not show up to his workplace , he will be placed immediately in custody accused of a crime which could mean serious prison sentences , " perez rubalcaba said .
' a popular revolt ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the action stranded some 250,000 passengers in spain union leaders maintained they had not been striking .
but camila cela , head of the usca air traffic controllers ' union , told reuters that " this is a popular revolt . " jorge ontiveros , a spokesman for the syndicate union of air controllers , told the afp news agency that the working hours stipulation would mean that time taken off for paternity leave or sick days would not count towards the maximum hours . " we have reached our limit mentally with the new decree approved this morning obliging us to work more hours , " he said .
" we took the decision individually , which then spread to other colleagues because they can not carry on like this .
in this situation we can not control planes , " he said . the cabinet 's decision on friday was part of an effort to rein in costs , raise money , calm the markets and avoid the kind of debt crisis that greece and ireland have seen in the last year . authors : holly fox , andreas illmer -lrb- afp , dpa , reuters -rrb- editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de christmas -pipe- 05.12.2010 racism controversy dampens holland 's sinterklaas tradition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. nicholas brings treats to kids in many european countries on december 6 children across europe eagerly await the arrival of st. nicholas on december 6 .
but in holland , the tradition has racist implications that the dutch are n't quite willing to give up . for the dutch , sinterklaasavond -lrb- st. nicholas eve -rrb- on december 5 is the biggest celebration of the year - bigger than christmas .
that evening , families gather and exchange presents , and children leave out their shoes in the hopes that sinterklaas will have fill them with candy by the next morning . what seems like a harmless holiday devoted to gifts , candy , and children , has a catch : sinterklaas ' helpers , the zwarte pieten or " black peters , " are portrayed according to degrading racial stereotypes . they 're typically dressed in 19th-century moorish outfits , curly afro wigs , and painted red lips .
it is common for both adults and children to dress up as zwarte piet , complete with their faces painted black . " zwarte piet is a person who is happy , who is the assistant of st. nicholas , the first person who has contact with children and speaks with children , " said bert jansen , a schoolteacher in rotterdam who has organized the rotterdam sinterklaas parade for 10 years and also walks in the parade as the chief zwarte piet . indeed , nowadays the zwarte pieten are friendly characters that are clever and mischievous , and adored by children .
yet in the original sinterklaas story , the zwarte pieten were slaves .
gradually , the tale evolved and they became sinterklaas ' helpers , but they were portrayed as being stupid and spoke broken dutch with a surinamese accent .
they were also frightening figures : it was their job to punish misbehaved children by beating them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zwarte piet help bring sweets to kids that have been good in an effort to tone down any racist implication , the story now says zwarte piet is black because they 're covered in chimney soot .
however , some say that explanation is unconvincing . " that just does n't work for someone who is a grown-up .
where did the afro come from ? " commented ama van dantzig , a resident of amsterdam whose mother is ghanian and father dutch . questioning the tradition the proposal to eliminate zwarte piet from the celebration altogether has arisen from time to time , but not yet taken hold . " personally , i think it is an invented tradition and sinterklaas can stay , but the zwarte pieten have to go , " said artwell cain , director of the national institute for the study of dutch slavery and its legacy -lrb- ninsee -rrb- .
" it is an affront to people of the african diaspora in the netherlands , and it is not proper in this age . " the question is even more urgent today as the netherlands is focusing more on integration efforts and the right-wing party for freedom - led by controversial figure geert wilders - is the third largest party in the parliament . at a time when there is pressure for minorities to integrate into dutch society , a tradition like zwarte piet sends the wrong message , cain said . " if you are developing this sense of belonging and then this tradition of zwarte piet is running around , it diminishes your confidence in what you are as a dutch person , " cain said .
" you become something like an ambiguous citizen .
you question yourself : ' why do i have to enjoy this ?
why do i have to be confronted openly with this form of racism ? " ' others see zwarte piet as an essential dutch tradition that is enjoyed by all children and families , regardless of race or ethnic background . " everyone is happy about zwarte piet , and if you are from holland or you come from morocco or somalia , every child puts his shoe by the door or chimney in the hope that zwarte piet puts a present in his shoe ; everyone does it , " said peter boelhouwer , an event organizer who has managed the sinterklaas parade in the hague for the past 10 years . a 19th-century creation although celebrations around sinterklaas date back to the 16th century , they were usually spontaneous , wild celebrations in the street , said john helsloot , a researcher at the meertens institute who specializes in sinterklaas traditions .
the current story of sinterklaas and zwarte piet dates back to 1850 , when jan schenkman , a schoolteacher from amsterdam , published an illustrated children 's book that introduced many elements of the sinterklaas story that caught on , including the zwarte pieten . the book was quite popular among the bourgeois and there was a readiness to adopt the festival , helsloot said .
from there , it slowly evolved into the celebration that exists today . it 's not uncommon for st. nicholas figures to have a devilish companion - such a figure exists in both austrian and swiss traditions - but the netherlands is the only place where he is imagined as a black man .
it is difficult to say why this particular story emerged here , but helsloot suggested that it could be tied to the dutch abolishment of slavery in 1863 . " you can see that racism was stronger even after the abolishment of slavery , " helsloot said .
" zwarte piet was part of this general idea of foreign people , black people as frightening , and that people should be punished by frightening figures . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the zwarte pieten are seen as sinterklaas ' helpers goodbye to zwarte piet ? if lasting changes are to be made to the zwarte pieten , it seems they will have to be organic rather than imposed by a political organization .
in 2006 , the dutch programme foundation encouraged people to paint their faces with rainbow colors , but the effort failed and the next year the usual zwarte piet black face returned . though that 's not to say change is n't possible .
" with more and more people like me who become dutch and do n't find it necessary that the zwarte pieten stay black , it can change , but slowly , " said sueli brodin , a resident of maastricht who is japanese-french and has lived in the netherlands for 19 years .
" it has to happen naturally because society is changing . " helsloot also could see a future where children smear their faces with black ink rather than paint their whole faces black to lose the racial association and show instead that zwarte piet is actually covered in chimney soot . still others say zwarte piet must be taken out of the tradition completely . " i think it can happen , but it is completely tied to the question of racism in general and how we are conscious about how racism affects the whole of society , " said max van lingen , a representative of the international socialists who works on anti-racism campaigns .
" this is not something that will happen within the next five years ; it really is a long battle . " van dantzig is not as optimistic .
" the people around me are highly educated , internationally-oriented people and the dutch in that group do n't understand the big deal with zwarte piet , and they are the future change makers if you ask me , " she said .
" they are very protective of zwarte piet and it will be difficult to change it . " author : rebecca farivar editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the satellites were carried by a proton-m rocket which took off from russia 's baikonur space center in kazakhstan early on sunday .
later , a second-stage booster rocket failed , leading to the upper-stage rocket with the satellites probably falling into the pacific not far from the hawaiian islands , russian space industry official said .
the loss of the three satellites weighing around 1.4 tons is estimated to cost russia several hundred million euros .
glonass launch not affected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glanoss is intended to rival the us gps navigation system the russian defense ministry played down the significance of the loss , saying the incident would not affect the rollout of the new glonass-m positioning system .
" there are currently 26 satellites in the glonass constellation , including two emergency satellites .
this allows a complete coverage of the territory , " a ministry statement said .
" the russian space industry 's capacity enables us to react rapidly to what 's happened , " it said .
officials insist the system would be fully operational next year .
the glonass system dates back to soviet times when development started in 1976 .
the network is intended to be an alternative to the us global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- and was supposed to be in place by the end of january 2011 in order to lessen moscow 's dependence on gps .
the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- is developing its own galileo system to rival both gps and glonass .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 05.12.2010 madrid street drinkers test neighbors ' patience großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drinking outdoors means avoiding the markups in a bar tough economic times and a desire for freedom have driven young spaniards out of the bars and onto the streets .
rambunctious revelers are subjecting local residents to noise levels of up to three times the legal limit . the la latina neighborhood of madrid 's old town is famous for its high concentration of tapas bars .
however , they are shunned by thousands of young drinkers who gather instead in the scenic plazas and winding streets of the city center . it 's a phenomenon spain has fittingly dubbed botellon , or " big bottle . " " this is one of the typical places in madrid to go out , " said elena , a biology student in her early 20s , while drinking rum and coke outside with a group of friends on a sunday night .
" there are people with guitars and there 's a great atmosphere .
it 's nice , really the true madrid . " sitting cross-legged in a raucous circle , the five students said that when they go out , they gravitate to the pavement , where they feel less inhibited .
as midnight neared on sunday in this densely populated area , the group got progressively louder . " no , you really do n't think about the neighbors , " elena said , her friends shouting and yelling around her .
" sometimes you try to be quiet , but it 's difficult .
but neighbors can call the police so it 's better not to be screaming . " fines go uncollected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people do n't want to be told what to do , where to drink and how much to pay the municipal police can fine street drinkers up to 360 euros -lrb- around $ 475 -rrb- .
they have issued 22,000 fines since january , though only a fraction of them are actually enforced .
also , offenders can choose to attend a talk about alcohol addiction instead of paying up . a police car drove past elena and her friends , but ignored them and continued on to the next botellon spot , next to a 17-century church at plaza de la cebada .
there , a small group of women in their late 20s sat quietly sharing a liter of beer . two of them were unemployed - like over 40 percent of young spaniards .
they explained that they were simply looking for cheaper nights out . arif , a 24-year-old immigrant from bangladesh , was on-hand to supply precisely that .
he was one of half a dozen men laden with plastic bags who were working the square that night .
he said in broken spanish that he had no papers to work legally , but managed to earn enough money selling drinks to pay for food and rent . business was going well that night - not surprising , considering a beer from arif cost just one euro , compared to four euros in one of the many bars in this upwardly mobile district .
but , with his illegal status , it 's also high risk job .
arif and the other vendors vanished seconds later , when police entered the square . the freedom to choose the two officers half-heartedly emptied a bottle of beer on to the pavement , dished out some warnings , and the square cleared in a matter of seconds as drinkers picked up their bags and ambled off . five minutes later , the police left and the square filled up once more . " i think it 's a policy of persecuting young people to force them into habits sanctioned by the authorities , " said nacho , a 24-year-old engineering student who had resumed drinking whiskey and coke out of a plastic cup .
" they are forcing us to go to the bars they want , at the times they want , to pay the prices they want - we ca n't pay those prices .
we 'd prefer to meet up in an environment we have control over . " nacho said most young spaniards ca n't afford their own homes .
the high cost of living , low wages and a stagnant , unsubsidized rental market mean the plaza is a good , non-commercial meeting place for many . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outdoor parties can reach volume levels deemed unhealthy unhealthy noise levels the botellon is making nights unbearable for residents who have the misfortune to live in the zones where people chose to congregate . " it 's difficult to avoid the botellon in my neighborhood , " explained esteban benito , the vice-president of a residents ' association in chueca , a district famous for its gay nightlife .
" many people have chronic problems getting to sleep - they take sleeping pills or sleep with ear plugs , but nothing can shut out the racket . " half a million madrid residents suffer from noise pollution exceeding 65 decibels , the maximum limit recommended by the world health organization .
the situation in chueca is particularly acute . " people come with powerful sound systems and dance on top of their cars , " said benito .
" they see this as a zone of freedom , but they do n't think about the freedom of those people trying to get to sleep . " benito said residents were at breaking point , sick to death of the noise - which is sometimes triple the legal decibel limit - and the mess drinkers leave behind .
he also warned of an epidemic of out-of-control , underage drinking and said the law is far too lax . ' a game of cat and mouse ' the municipal police charged with stamping out the botellon acknowledged that it is a mammoth task . " we have done a lot of work but the magnificent weather here is not in our favor , " said rosa maria duran , deputy inspector general for madrid .
" it 's a bit like a game of cat and mouse .
we have certain permanent positions where we stop botellon from starting up but now we have the new phenomenon of botellin , or ' little bottle . '
young people are spreading out throughout the district . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neighbors are n't happy about the mess left behind by outdoor drinkers duran highlighted her force 's prevention work in schools but added that they had not given up .
she expressed her hope that the next generation would find different ways of having fun . and it may not be entirely wishful thinking .
a regional health survey has recorded that teenage drinking is down in madrid . benito was doubtful about these statistics .
but his campaigning has started to bear fruit .
madrid 's municipal authorities have now upped fines to 600 euros for drinkers guilty of noise pollution . in the plaza , nacho and his friends had agreed that young people could drink more responsibly and should respect the neighbors - but they were adamant that prohibition would never work . author : hazel healy editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the government is absolutely determined this will not happen again , " the minister said , addng that madrid would prevent the strikers from walking out over christmas and afterwards . traffic controllers told journalists that the military compelled them to work “ at gunpoint ” in palma de mallorca control tower , but spaniards generally showed little understanding for the strikers who earn an average of 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 267,000 dollars -rrb- a year . spanish airport authorities aena says that 4,052 flights have been scheduled for sunday and that of 296 controllers down to work , 286 are at their posts , enabling airports to " operate fully . " bildunterschrift : the walkout created chaos at spanish airports state of emergency handing over control of airspace to the military on saturday , the spanish government declared the first state of emergency since the death of dictator francisco franco in 1975 . spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero ordered the takeover after some 70 percent of air traffic controllers left their posts or failed to turn up for work on friday . the walkouts came as the country headed into one of its busiest long weekends .
the coming monday and wednesday are state holidays and many people plan to take tuesday off for a five-day weekend . blackmail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government placed the military in command of the skies the unofficial strike came just hours after the cabinet agreed to a package of changes to how the country 's airports are operated .
the government stipulated that the maximum time air traffic controllers could work in a year was 1,670 hours , and announced a plan to sell 49 percent of aena .
the controllers have been locked in a dispute with aena and the transport ministry over the changes for months . by putting the military in charge , the government had upped the ante .
as a consequence , any air traffic controllers who failed to show up for work could have been charged and prosecuted under military law , facing up to 10 years in prison . " if a controller does not show up to his workplace , he will be placed immediately in custody accused of a crime which could mean serious prison sentences , " perez rubalcaba said .
' a popular revolt ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the action stranded some 250,000 passengers in spain union leaders maintained they had not been striking .
but camila cela , head of the usca air traffic controllers ' union , told reuters that " this is a popular revolt . " jorge ontiveros , a spokesman for the syndicate union of air controllers , told the afp news agency that the working hours stipulation would mean that time taken off for paternity leave or sick days would not count towards the maximum hours . " we have reached our limit mentally with the new decree approved this morning obliging us to work more hours , " he said .
" we took the decision individually , which then spread to other colleagues because they can not carry on like this .
in this situation we can not control planes , " he said . the cabinet 's decision on friday was part of an effort to rein in costs , raise money , calm the markets and avoid the kind of debt crisis that greece and ireland have seen in the last year . authors : holly fox , andreas illmer -lrb- afp , dpa , reuters -rrb- editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

beating nuremberg on sunday they are now lonely at the top , 10 points clear of mainz . dortmund on sunday extended their lead at the top of the table taking a big step towards their first bundesliga title in nine years .
the team beat nuremberg 2-0 and are now 10 points clear of second-place mainz .
in heavy snow , mats hummels and robert lewandowski helped dortmund get their 13th win of the season from a total of 15 matches so far .
second-place mainz blew their chance to close the gap on saturday as they suffered a 2-1 defeat at the hands of frankfurt .
dortmund are now 10 points clear of mainz , which means they already have secured the so-called " autumn championship " - the number one spot before the season goes into winter break .
there are still two matches to be played before the break but it 's now impossible for mainz to catch up with dortmund .
leverkusen strong in third place bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmes -lrb- left -rrb- opened scoring for leverkusen earlier on sunday , bayer leverkusen beat visitors cologne 3-2 in a game played in snow and freezing temperatures .
leverkusen took the lead 21 minutes into the match when striker patrick helmes put the ball into the net after a bad clearance by nuremberg keeper faryd mondragon .
however , it took only six minutes for cologne to equalize .
pedro geromel headed the ball into the box after a free kick by germany international lukas podolski .
in the second half hosts leverkusen again went ahead with tranquillo barnetta and stefan reinartz both scoring within six minutes of each other .
in the 65th minute , cologne substitute martin lanig brought his side back into the game but eventually the team had to concede defeat to leverkusen .
leverkusen are now third in the table , only one point behind second-place mainz .
pundits say leverkusen might be the only team still able to challenge dortmund for this season 's title .
after their disappointing 2-0 loss to schalke on saturday , last season 's champions bayern munich were back in the headlines on sunday when coach louis van gaal conceded his side may have already lost the bundesliga title race to dortmund .
bayern are trailing borussia dortmund by 17 points .

but in holland , the tradition has racist implications that the dutch are n't quite willing to give up . for the dutch , sinterklaasavond -lrb- st. nicholas eve -rrb- on december 5 is the biggest celebration of the year - bigger than christmas .
that evening , families gather and exchange presents , and children leave out their shoes in the hopes that sinterklaas will have fill them with candy by the next morning . what seems like a harmless holiday devoted to gifts , candy , and children , has a catch : sinterklaas ' helpers , the zwarte pieten or " black peters , " are portrayed according to degrading racial stereotypes . they 're typically dressed in 19th-century moorish outfits , curly afro wigs , and painted red lips .
it is common for both adults and children to dress up as zwarte piet , complete with their faces painted black . " zwarte piet is a person who is happy , who is the assistant of st. nicholas , the first person who has contact with children and speaks with children , " said bert jansen , a schoolteacher in rotterdam who has organized the rotterdam sinterklaas parade for 10 years and also walks in the parade as the chief zwarte piet . indeed , nowadays the zwarte pieten are friendly characters that are clever and mischievous , and adored by children .
yet in the original sinterklaas story , the zwarte pieten were slaves .
gradually , the tale evolved and they became sinterklaas ' helpers , but they were portrayed as being stupid and spoke broken dutch with a surinamese accent .
they were also frightening figures : it was their job to punish misbehaved children by beating them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zwarte piet help bring sweets to kids that have been good in an effort to tone down any racist implication , the story now says zwarte piet is black because they 're covered in chimney soot .
however , some say that explanation is unconvincing . " that just does n't work for someone who is a grown-up .
where did the afro come from ? " commented ama van dantzig , a resident of amsterdam whose mother is ghanian and father dutch . questioning the tradition the proposal to eliminate zwarte piet from the celebration altogether has arisen from time to time , but not yet taken hold . " personally , i think it is an invented tradition and sinterklaas can stay , but the zwarte pieten have to go , " said artwell cain , director of the national institute for the study of dutch slavery and its legacy -lrb- ninsee -rrb- .
" it is an affront to people of the african diaspora in the netherlands , and it is not proper in this age . " the question is even more urgent today as the netherlands is focusing more on integration efforts and the right-wing party for freedom - led by controversial figure geert wilders - is the third largest party in the parliament . at a time when there is pressure for minorities to integrate into dutch society , a tradition like zwarte piet sends the wrong message , cain said . " if you are developing this sense of belonging and then this tradition of zwarte piet is running around , it diminishes your confidence in what you are as a dutch person , " cain said .
" you become something like an ambiguous citizen .
you question yourself : ' why do i have to enjoy this ?
why do i have to be confronted openly with this form of racism ? " ' others see zwarte piet as an essential dutch tradition that is enjoyed by all children and families , regardless of race or ethnic background . " everyone is happy about zwarte piet , and if you are from holland or you come from morocco or somalia , every child puts his shoe by the door or chimney in the hope that zwarte piet puts a present in his shoe ; everyone does it , " said peter boelhouwer , an event organizer who has managed the sinterklaas parade in the hague for the past 10 years . a 19th-century creation although celebrations around sinterklaas date back to the 16th century , they were usually spontaneous , wild celebrations in the street , said john helsloot , a researcher at the meertens institute who specializes in sinterklaas traditions .
the current story of sinterklaas and zwarte piet dates back to 1850 , when jan schenkman , a schoolteacher from amsterdam , published an illustrated children 's book that introduced many elements of the sinterklaas story that caught on , including the zwarte pieten . the book was quite popular among the bourgeois and there was a readiness to adopt the festival , helsloot said .
from there , it slowly evolved into the celebration that exists today . it 's not uncommon for st. nicholas figures to have a devilish companion - such a figure exists in both austrian and swiss traditions - but the netherlands is the only place where he is imagined as a black man .
it is difficult to say why this particular story emerged here , but helsloot suggested that it could be tied to the dutch abolishment of slavery in 1863 . " you can see that racism was stronger even after the abolishment of slavery , " helsloot said .
" zwarte piet was part of this general idea of foreign people , black people as frightening , and that people should be punished by frightening figures . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the zwarte pieten are seen as sinterklaas ' helpers goodbye to zwarte piet ? if lasting changes are to be made to the zwarte pieten , it seems they will have to be organic rather than imposed by a political organization .
in 2006 , the dutch programme foundation encouraged people to paint their faces with rainbow colors , but the effort failed and the next year the usual zwarte piet black face returned . though that 's not to say change is n't possible .
" with more and more people like me who become dutch and do n't find it necessary that the zwarte pieten stay black , it can change , but slowly , " said sueli brodin , a resident of maastricht who is japanese-french and has lived in the netherlands for 19 years .
" it has to happen naturally because society is changing . " helsloot also could see a future where children smear their faces with black ink rather than paint their whole faces black to lose the racial association and show instead that zwarte piet is actually covered in chimney soot . still others say zwarte piet must be taken out of the tradition completely . " i think it can happen , but it is completely tied to the question of racism in general and how we are conscious about how racism affects the whole of society , " said max van lingen , a representative of the international socialists who works on anti-racism campaigns .
" this is not something that will happen within the next five years ; it really is a long battle . " van dantzig is not as optimistic .
" the people around me are highly educated , internationally-oriented people and the dutch in that group do n't understand the big deal with zwarte piet , and they are the future change makers if you ask me , " she said .

the internet can not be a lawless space without rules , chancellor angela merkel has warned . the german government on the weekend pushed for improved protection of personal data on the internet .
ahead of a national it summit on tuesday , both german chancellor angela merkel and justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger have demanded binding rules for the use of private data online .
" we have to decide this in a broad discussion in society , " merkel said in her weekly video blog on saturday .
" the internet can not be a lawless space without rules .
but we also have to be careful not to curtail the opportunities that the internet offers . "
leutheusser-schnarrenberger told the monday edition of the hamburger abendblatt daily that any law or regulation should n't be limited to only certain websites .
" the debates about social networks like facebook or internet services like google street view have shown that our data protection jurisdiction has to be fundamentally reworked , " she wrote .
in order to better protect individuals , leutheusser-schnarrenberger called for opt-in options and a right of objection to be part of any new legislation on the matter .
social networks such as facebook could be forced to implement higher levels of data protection on their sites .
as a particular danger , the justice minister mentioned companies creating profiles of individual internet users .
wikileaks affair ' shocking ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kauder says the us has to better protect sensitive data volker kauder , parliamentary leader of merkel 's christian democrats , said everybody should have the right to find out exactly what kind of personal information and data is stored on the web - and should have the right to have that data deleted anytime .
with reference to the recent wikileaks release of classified us cables , kauder also lashed out at how sloppily washington handled the sensitive data .
he told the sunday edition of mass circulation daily bild that the us needed to improve data protection .
" it is shocking when you find out that more than 2 million people in the united states had access to this sensitive data , " kauder told the paper .
" it 's irresponsible and not in the interest of the us either . "
the comments over the weekend came ahead of the country 's fifth national it summit on tuesday where a group of experts from politics , business and science will discuss problems and controversies caused by new technology and the internet .
both merkel and leutheusser-schnarrenberger are expected to attend the summit , along with interior minister thomas de maiziere and other high-profile politicians .

the internet can not be a lawless space without rules , chancellor angela merkel has warned . the german government on the weekend pushed for improved protection of personal data on the internet .
ahead of a national it summit on tuesday , both german chancellor angela merkel and justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger have demanded binding rules for the use of private data online .
" we have to decide this in a broad discussion in society , " merkel said in her weekly video blog on saturday .
" the internet can not be a lawless space without rules .
but we also have to be careful not to curtail the opportunities that the internet offers . "
leutheusser-schnarrenberger told the monday edition of the hamburger abendblatt daily that any law or regulation should n't be limited to only certain websites .
" the debates about social networks like facebook or internet services like google street view have shown that our data protection jurisdiction has to be fundamentally reworked , " she wrote .
in order to better protect individuals , leutheusser-schnarrenberger called for opt-in options and a right of objection to be part of any new legislation on the matter .
social networks such as facebook could be forced to implement higher levels of data protection on their sites .
as a particular danger , the justice minister mentioned companies creating profiles of individual internet users .
wikileaks affair ' shocking ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kauder says the us has to better protect sensitive data volker kauder , parliamentary leader of merkel 's christian democrats , said everybody should have the right to find out exactly what kind of personal information and data is stored on the web - and should have the right to have that data deleted anytime .
with reference to the recent wikileaks release of classified us cables , kauder also lashed out at how sloppily washington handled the sensitive data .
he told the sunday edition of mass circulation daily bild that the us needed to improve data protection .
" it is shocking when you find out that more than 2 million people in the united states had access to this sensitive data , " kauder told the paper .
" it 's irresponsible and not in the interest of the us either . "
the comments over the weekend came ahead of the country 's fifth national it summit on tuesday where a group of experts from politics , business and science will discuss problems and controversies caused by new technology and the internet .
both merkel and leutheusser-schnarrenberger are expected to attend the summit , along with interior minister thomas de maiziere and other high-profile politicians .

beating nuremberg on sunday they are now lonely at the top , 10 points clear of mainz . dortmund on sunday extended their lead at the top of the table taking a big step towards their first bundesliga title in nine years .
the team beat nuremberg 2-0 and are now 10 points clear of second-place mainz .
in heavy snow , mats hummels and robert lewandowski helped dortmund get their 13th win of the season from a total of 15 matches so far .
second-place mainz blew their chance to close the gap on saturday as they suffered a 2-1 defeat at the hands of frankfurt .
dortmund are now 10 points clear of mainz , which means they already have secured the so-called " autumn championship " - the number one spot before the season goes into winter break .
there are still two matches to be played before the break but it 's now impossible for mainz to catch up with dortmund .

leverkusen took the lead 21 minutes into the match when striker patrick helmes put the ball into the net after a bad clearance by nuremberg keeper faryd mondragon .
however , it took only six minutes for cologne to equalize .
pedro geromel headed the ball into the box after a free kick by germany international lukas podolski .
in the second half hosts leverkusen again went ahead with tranquillo barnetta and stefan reinartz both scoring within six minutes of each other .
in the 65th minute , cologne substitute martin lanig brought his side back into the game but eventually the team had to concede defeat to leverkusen .
leverkusen are now third in the table , only one point behind second-place mainz .
pundits say leverkusen might be the only team still able to challenge dortmund for this season 's title .
