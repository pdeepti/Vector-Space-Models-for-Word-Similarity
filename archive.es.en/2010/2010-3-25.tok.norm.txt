meanwhile , activists say the church should take more responsibility for its wayward leaders .
either way , the situation surrounding sexual abuse scandals in the catholic church is like a modern-day hydra myth - no sooner is one scandal addressed than another rises up to take its place .
with europe 's catholics still reeling from a series of alleged child-molestation cover-ups , news broke in the united states of a 1996 case that touches the upper echelons of church power .
failure to defrock in the latest case to hit headlines , the new york times reported on thursday that pope benedict xvi ignored allegations of child sex abuse back in the 1990s .
at the time , he was head of the congregation of the doctrine of the faith , the vatican body that judges cases of sexual abuse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victims recently took to the streets of the vatican to protest the paper reported that the pope - then cardinal joseph ratzinger - failed to defrock rev. lawrence murphy , a priest in milwaukee who had been accused of sexually abusing some 200 deaf boys , despite the fact that he was aware of the allegations .
murphy worked from 1950 to 1977 at a school for the deaf and died in 1998 .
a spokesman for the vatican , federico lombardi , argued that rome was n't informed of the case until 20 years after it happened , and said that in the end the church did n't take action against murphy because he had confessed the acts and because he was very ill and close to the end of his life .
records uncovered by the times show that three different bishops were aware of the accusations , but that the case was not brought to trial .
still , lombardi told news service reuters that the church is eager to see abusive priests brought to justice .
church calls in professional help this is a feeling shared by christoph heckeley , a spokesman for the archbishopric of cologne , germany .
the catholic church in germany has had a directive for the past eight years that urges prosecution in sex abuse cases , heckeley told deutsche welle .
" since 2002 we have a directive from the german bishops conference that says what you have to do in case sexual abuse is suspected , " heckeley said .
people with complaints are referred to professionals - psychologists , doctors and legal experts - who are hired by each bishopric , and are qualified to advise people who want to come forward with sex abuse allegations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abuse allegedly took place at some german jesuit schools " our aim is to listen to the victims and help them get justice , even when the cases are years or decades old .
they need somebody to listen to them , and the most important thing is that they get justice , " he said .
the response from the church will differ case by case , but the church " urgently advises " victims to take perpetrators to court .
unfortunately , heckeley said , victims often do n't want to do this because it can be too upsetting to their families , and " can destroy their entire social environment - it can traumatize them a second time .
you have to be careful . "
prosecution is a right , not an obligation while there is a right to prosecute , there is no obligation to do so - a situation that is currently under hot debate .
still , heckeley said experts recommend caution , since " the dangers -lrb- of forced prosecution -rrb- could outweigh the risks . "
no matter what shape the case takes in federal court , allegations of abuse are always looked into by a church tribunal out of rome .
yet in the murphy case , ratzinger 's deputy at the time advised a secret disciplinary trial at first .
he later reversed that decision , and in 1998 , murphy appealed directly to ratzinger for clemency , shortly before he died .
all the calls for openness , trials and apologies are well and good , victims-rights advocates say , but they do n't go far enough .
what is missing on the part of the church is a departure from the secrecy , and a willingness to admit its own cover-ups .
last week , following revelations of pedophilia that rocked the irish catholic church , the pope issued a long-awaited apology to victims of child sex abuse in ireland .
he acknowledged " serious mistakes " on the part of the church , as well as the sense of betrayal in the church felt by victims and their families .
victims ' groups start protests but irish victims ' groups felt that the apology fell short of their demands ; they called for the church to acknowledge its role in covering up abuse .
maeve lewis , executive director of irish victims ' rights group one in four , told bbc news , " we are really disappointed that there is no acknowledgement that the cover-up and the policy of cover-up in the church went right to the the vatican . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope finally addressed the cases of abuse in ireland and in germany , victims-rights advocates were incensed that the apology failed to mention cases of church pedophilia in munich that have dominated headlines for weeks .
the church has had to contend with cover-up allegations in that city while ratzinger was the city 's archbishop from 1977 to 1981 .
on thursday members of the us activist organization snap - survivor network of those abused by priests - launched a demonstration in the vatican , holding up signs that said " stop the secrecy now . "
they demanded that pope benedict open up all files on pedophile catholic clerics worldwide , and called for all " predator priests " to be defrocked .
the group has also protested in germany , austria , and the netherlands , all countries recently hit by church sex abuse scandals .
one official 's stance " i would ask the pope if he would please open up the files from the congregation of the doctrine of the faith and turn over all the information to the police , " barbara blaine , the president of snap , told reuters news service .
a trickle of acknowledgements have begun , and some say a wave may be coming .
earlier this month , the german church 's representative responsible for dealing with cases of abuse , bishop stephan ackermann , also acknowledged severe failures .
" where there was no will toward explanation and where the person who committed the crime was simply moved to a new post , we have to admit , in a whole array of cases , that there was a cover-up , " he told the rhein zeitung newspaper .
and this week , german news magazine focus reported that archbishop zollitsch , the leader of the german roman catholic church , also admitted cases of child sex abuse were known and covered up .
" yes , we did have that , " he said .
many see the catholic church as so damaged by these allegations that it will be hard for the institution to regain its footing .
" we can only survive this situation with openness and honesty , " says the cologne archbishopric 's heckeley .
" we have to try to win people 's trust that way . "

a spokesman for the vatican , federico lombardi , argued that rome was n't informed of the case until 20 years after it happened , and said that in the end the church did n't take action against murphy because he had confessed the acts and because he was very ill and close to the end of his life .
records uncovered by the times show that three different bishops were aware of the accusations , but that the case was not brought to trial .
still , lombardi told news service reuters that the church is eager to see abusive priests brought to justice .
church calls in professional help this is a feeling shared by christoph heckeley , a spokesman for the archbishopric of cologne , germany .
the catholic church in germany has had a directive for the past eight years that urges prosecution in sex abuse cases , heckeley told deutsche welle .
" since 2002 we have a directive from the german bishops conference that says what you have to do in case sexual abuse is suspected , " heckeley said .
people with complaints are referred to professionals - psychologists , doctors and legal experts - who are hired by each bishopric , and are qualified to advise people who want to come forward with sex abuse allegations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abuse allegedly took place at some german jesuit schools " our aim is to listen to the victims and help them get justice , even when the cases are years or decades old .
they need somebody to listen to them , and the most important thing is that they get justice , " he said .
the response from the church will differ case by case , but the church " urgently advises " victims to take perpetrators to court .
unfortunately , heckeley said , victims often do n't want to do this because it can be too upsetting to their families , and " can destroy their entire social environment - it can traumatize them a second time .
you have to be careful . "
prosecution is a right , not an obligation while there is a right to prosecute , there is no obligation to do so - a situation that is currently under hot debate .
still , heckeley said experts recommend caution , since " the dangers -lrb- of forced prosecution -rrb- could outweigh the risks . "
no matter what shape the case takes in federal court , allegations of abuse are always looked into by a church tribunal out of rome .
yet in the murphy case , ratzinger 's deputy at the time advised a secret disciplinary trial at first .
he later reversed that decision , and in 1998 , murphy appealed directly to ratzinger for clemency , shortly before he died .
all the calls for openness , trials and apologies are well and good , victims-rights advocates say , but they do n't go far enough .
what is missing on the part of the church is a departure from the secrecy , and a willingness to admit its own cover-ups .
last week , following revelations of pedophilia that rocked the irish catholic church , the pope issued a long-awaited apology to victims of child sex abuse in ireland .
he acknowledged " serious mistakes " on the part of the church , as well as the sense of betrayal in the church felt by victims and their families .
victims ' groups start protests but irish victims ' groups felt that the apology fell short of their demands ; they called for the church to acknowledge its role in covering up abuse .
maeve lewis , executive director of irish victims ' rights group one in four , told bbc news , " we are really disappointed that there is no acknowledgement that the cover-up and the policy of cover-up in the church went right to the the vatican . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope finally addressed the cases of abuse in ireland and in germany , victims-rights advocates were incensed that the apology failed to mention cases of church pedophilia in munich that have dominated headlines for weeks .
the church has had to contend with cover-up allegations in that city while ratzinger was the city 's archbishop from 1977 to 1981 .
on thursday members of the us activist organization snap - survivor network of those abused by priests - launched a demonstration in the vatican , holding up signs that said " stop the secrecy now . "
they demanded that pope benedict open up all files on pedophile catholic clerics worldwide , and called for all " predator priests " to be defrocked .
the group has also protested in germany , austria , and the netherlands , all countries recently hit by church sex abuse scandals .
one official 's stance " i would ask the pope if he would please open up the files from the congregation of the doctrine of the faith and turn over all the information to the police , " barbara blaine , the president of snap , told reuters news service .
a trickle of acknowledgements have begun , and some say a wave may be coming .
earlier this month , the german church 's representative responsible for dealing with cases of abuse , bishop stephan ackermann , also acknowledged severe failures .
" where there was no will toward explanation and where the person who committed the crime was simply moved to a new post , we have to admit , in a whole array of cases , that there was a cover-up , " he told the rhein zeitung newspaper .
and this week , german news magazine focus reported that archbishop zollitsch , the leader of the german roman catholic church , also admitted cases of child sex abuse were known and covered up .
" yes , we did have that , " he said .
many see the catholic church as so damaged by these allegations that it will be hard for the institution to regain its footing .
" we can only survive this situation with openness and honesty , " says the cologne archbishopric 's heckeley .
" we have to try to win people 's trust that way . "

meanwhile , activists say the church should take more responsibility for its wayward leaders .
either way , the situation surrounding sexual abuse scandals in the catholic church is like a modern-day hydra myth - no sooner is one scandal addressed than another rises up to take its place .
with europe 's catholics still reeling from a series of alleged child-molestation cover-ups , news broke in the united states of a 1996 case that touches the upper echelons of church power .
failure to defrock in the latest case to hit headlines , the new york times reported on thursday that pope benedict xvi ignored allegations of child sex abuse back in the 1990s .
at the time , he was head of the congregation of the doctrine of the faith , the vatican body that judges cases of sexual abuse .

newsweekly der spiegel reported thursday that the german foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- sent an e-mail describing the attack and the possible numbers killed .
" many civilians were killed -lrb- numbers vary between 50 and 100 -rrb- , " the e-mail read .
a government spokesman described the e-mail as an " unconfirmed preliminary report . "
he said the e-mail has already been handed over , along with other related documents , to the parliamentary inquiry , and that all of these documents confirm merkel 's stance that civilian casualties were never ruled out .
who knew what when ?
while merkel never claimed that civilians were not killed , it was days before she first spoke to parliament about the airstrike .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the civilian deaths and the government 's response have stirred controvery in germany much of the parliamentary inquiry is focused on who knew what about the bombing and when they knew it .
franz-josef jung , defense minister at the time of the airstrike , stepped down in november over an alleged cover-up of civilian deaths .
he had originally said that no civilians had been killed .
a nato report ultimately found that 142 civilians were killed in the bombing of the two oil tankers , which had been hijacked by taliban insurgents but then got stuck crossing a river bed .
the strike was ordered by a german colonel and carried out by nato aircraft . the bnd e-mail explained the high number of civilian casualties by saying that afghan citizens had taken the " opportunity " to siphon off fuel for their own use .
testifying to the parliamentary inquiry on thursday , jung once again denied that he had suppressed evidence .
the opposition in parliament has reserved the right to call merkel as a witness in the inquiry , although no date has been set. hf / afp / apn editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with their bundesliga and champions league campaigns still on course , bayern face a punishing end-of-season run . it took something special for bayern munich to beat schalke in their own backyard to reach the german cup final on wednesday night .
dutch international arjen robben looked to be going nowhere when he took off with the ball just inside the schalke half before racing down the right-wing to the corner flag .
one electric injection of pace and direction later , with three defenders flailing in his wake , robben was suddenly in the penalty area lashing a left-footed shot beyond schalke keeper manuel neuer to win the semi-final in style .
although bayern had the lion 's share of possession and the early chances in this tense and sometimes bad tempered meeting , robben 's 112th minute winner was the only flash of real class in the whole game .
and despite having eight minutes to save the tie after the bayern winger scored , it was clear schalke were out as soon as the dutchman 's shot hit the back of the net .
neither team had produced anything as decisive in nearly two hours of soccer .
robben 's act of individual brilliance was a worthy match winner , but the dutchman 's tenth goal of the season certainly put a thick layer of gloss on a rather dull bayern performance .
schalke 's overwhelming emphasis on defense , along with the terrible state of the turf in the veltins arena , gradually sapped bayern 's strength and creativity .
but even the bavarians ' early attempts on goal were far from polished .
energetic robben the exception as bayern labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben stood out from the lethargic pack on wednesday robben was the exception throughout , tirelessly chasing and making runs at schalke defenders .
no-one else , not even the late substitute franck ribery , looked able to summon that kind of energy , which could be a matter of concern in the coming weeks .
" we 're still involved in three competitions and that is emotionally not all that easy for the players , " bayern coach louis van gaal said after wednesday 's semifinal win .
" but we want to be involved in all three competitions , so we will have to come to terms with that . "
with league matches against main title rivals schalke and bayer leverkusen on the horizon , and a make-or-break champions league tie over two legs against manchester united , bayern 's season will likely be decided by the end of april - for better or worse .
the concern settling over munich is that the squad may not be deep enough to survive three consecutive title races .
loan deals force coach 's hand over rising stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal 's faith in young players is being put to the test luke faron , a bayern munich expert with theoffside.com , believes that bayern are beginning to feel the effects of loaning a number of players out to other clubs and promoting youngsters to a first team involved in not only a bundesliga title fight and a lengthy german cup campaign but also european matches of the highest standard .
" loaning brazilian defender breno to nuremberg was a necessary step in continuing his development and in getting the young center back some playing time , " faron told deutsche welle .
loaning left back edson braafheid to celtic was a bit surprising , said faron .
combined with breno 's move , it meant holger badstuber would be the only true reserve center back , in addition to starting at left back .
" with center backs van buyten and demichelis suffering injuries , badstuber had to move back inside and the pressure on the youngster has been intense . "
faron believes that van gaal has been forced to test the faith he had in the young players he brought into replenish the senior side in january , but says the coach has so far - on the whole - been justified in his decisions .
" diego contento and david alaba have both performed admirably in their champions league debuts , " said faron .
" alaba had a very bad final five minutes in frankfurt last weekend and perhaps that showed the limits of the wisdom of playing a 17-year-old natural midfielder out of position in a highly competitive match . "
he said contento had had his hands full with jefferson farfan on wednesday , but that he had coped with the task well enough .
if any player was showing fatigue , said faron , it was forward thomas mueller " it 's a big adjustment for a young player like mueller who has n't even played a full season in the bundesliga before .
add in the champions league and the german cup and the fact he also just made his national team debut , and it 's easy to understand why . "
success from continuity makes coach reluctant to change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the league campaign did not start well under van gaal another factor which is contributing to bayern 's lethargy at this point in the season is van gaal 's commitment to continuity .
when he assumed control at the beginning of the season , it took the dutch coach at least ten matches of tinkering before he settled on his preferred line-up - ten matches during which bayern seemed rudderless and the coach 's credentials were questioned .
once the coach found his formula in november , however , an impressive winning streak began and van gaal has not looked back .
as a result , the dutchman risks wearing out his preferred starting 11 .
as bayern enter a run of decisive matches , time will tell if the squad 's mix of youngsters and stars can maintain top performance .
luke faron believes the bavarian giants have what it takes , regardless of tired legs .
" bayern have a chance against manchester united , but they have to be considered underdogs , " he said . " munich 's defense has not performed at the level necessary to progress further in the competition , though wednesday night 's performance in the cup might be the start of a turnaround . "
the big test , says faron , begins a week from saturday , when bayern face schalke , man united and bayer leverkusen all away from home , within a seven day period .
but thereafter , prospects seem bright .
" after the match in leverkusen they have an exceptionally easy schedule in the league for the last month of the campaign . in addition , they 're getting key players like gomez and demichelis back from injury and that should help during the run-in . i believe bayern will prevail in the bundesliga regardless of how far they progress in the champions league .

one electric injection of pace and direction later , with three defenders flailing in his wake , robben was suddenly in the penalty area lashing a left-footed shot beyond schalke keeper manuel neuer to win the semi-final in style .
although bayern had the lion 's share of possession and the early chances in this tense and sometimes bad tempered meeting , robben 's 112th minute winner was the only flash of real class in the whole game .
and despite having eight minutes to save the tie after the bayern winger scored , it was clear schalke were out as soon as the dutchman 's shot hit the back of the net .
neither team had produced anything as decisive in nearly two hours of soccer .
robben 's act of individual brilliance was a worthy match winner , but the dutchman 's tenth goal of the season certainly put a thick layer of gloss on a rather dull bayern performance .
schalke 's overwhelming emphasis on defense , along with the terrible state of the turf in the veltins arena , gradually sapped bayern 's strength and creativity .
but even the bavarians ' early attempts on goal were far from polished .
energetic robben the exception as bayern labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben stood out from the lethargic pack on wednesday robben was the exception throughout , tirelessly chasing and making runs at schalke defenders .
no-one else , not even the late substitute franck ribery , looked able to summon that kind of energy , which could be a matter of concern in the coming weeks .
" we 're still involved in three competitions and that is emotionally not all that easy for the players , " bayern coach louis van gaal said after wednesday 's semifinal win .
" but we want to be involved in all three competitions , so we will have to come to terms with that . "
with league matches against main title rivals schalke and bayer leverkusen on the horizon , and a make-or-break champions league tie over two legs against manchester united , bayern 's season will likely be decided by the end of april - for better or worse .
the concern settling over munich is that the squad may not be deep enough to survive three consecutive title races .
loan deals force coach 's hand over rising stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal 's faith in young players is being put to the test luke faron , a bayern munich expert with theoffside.com , believes that bayern are beginning to feel the effects of loaning a number of players out to other clubs and promoting youngsters to a first team involved in not only a bundesliga title fight and a lengthy german cup campaign but also european matches of the highest standard .
" loaning brazilian defender breno to nuremberg was a necessary step in continuing his development and in getting the young center back some playing time , " faron told deutsche welle .
loaning left back edson braafheid to celtic was a bit surprising , said faron .
combined with breno 's move , it meant holger badstuber would be the only true reserve center back , in addition to starting at left back .
" with center backs van buyten and demichelis suffering injuries , badstuber had to move back inside and the pressure on the youngster has been intense . "
faron believes that van gaal has been forced to test the faith he had in the young players he brought into replenish the senior side in january , but says the coach has so far - on the whole - been justified in his decisions .
" diego contento and david alaba have both performed admirably in their champions league debuts , " said faron .
" alaba had a very bad final five minutes in frankfurt last weekend and perhaps that showed the limits of the wisdom of playing a 17-year-old natural midfielder out of position in a highly competitive match . "
he said contento had had his hands full with jefferson farfan on wednesday , but that he had coped with the task well enough .
if any player was showing fatigue , said faron , it was forward thomas mueller " it 's a big adjustment for a young player like mueller who has n't even played a full season in the bundesliga before .
add in the champions league and the german cup and the fact he also just made his national team debut , and it 's easy to understand why . "
success from continuity makes coach reluctant to change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the league campaign did not start well under van gaal another factor which is contributing to bayern 's lethargy at this point in the season is van gaal 's commitment to continuity .
when he assumed control at the beginning of the season , it took the dutch coach at least ten matches of tinkering before he settled on his preferred line-up - ten matches during which bayern seemed rudderless and the coach 's credentials were questioned .
once the coach found his formula in november , however , an impressive winning streak began and van gaal has not looked back .
as a result , the dutchman risks wearing out his preferred starting 11 .
as bayern enter a run of decisive matches , time will tell if the squad 's mix of youngsters and stars can maintain top performance .
luke faron believes the bavarian giants have what it takes , regardless of tired legs .
" bayern have a chance against manchester united , but they have to be considered underdogs , " he said . " munich 's defense has not performed at the level necessary to progress further in the competition , though wednesday night 's performance in the cup might be the start of a turnaround . "
the big test , says faron , begins a week from saturday , when bayern face schalke , man united and bayer leverkusen all away from home , within a seven day period .
but thereafter , prospects seem bright .
" after the match in leverkusen they have an exceptionally easy schedule in the league for the last month of the campaign . in addition , they 're getting key players like gomez and demichelis back from injury and that should help during the run-in . i believe bayern will prevail in the bundesliga regardless of how far they progress in the champions league .

as iran continues to develop its nuclear program , analysts fear that an arms race in the middle east could begin .
if sanctions continue to fail , these analysts say that military action is necessary to prevent this . as world powers negotiate on how to deal with iran 's continuing development of its nuclear program , concerns about a nuclear arms race in the middle east , prompted by iran 's determination to build nuclear weapons , are mounting .
officials from the united states , russia , france , britain , germany and china participated in a conference call yesterday to discuss how to handle iran 's flaunting of international demands to cease nuclear work .
these countries , while attempting to deter iran from continued nuclear development by offering tehran incentives to allow more oversight of its program , are also threatening sanctions if tehran does not stop work toward producing weapons grade uranium . iran , which has faced sanctions from the united nations three times , says it is developing its nuclear program for peaceful purposes and has refused to allow inspectors from the international atomic energy agency access to its nuclear facilities .
it is party to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty , but repeatedly has been found non-compliant .
there is growing fear that iran will not stop work toward a weapon unless drastic action is taken .
middle east experts said that if iran continues on its current path , a nuclear arms race in the region could ensue . ' ' turkey , algeria , egypt , and saudi arabia are all potential candidates to develop nuclear weapons , " abdulaziz sager , chairman of the gulf research center in dubai , told deutsche welle .
' ' and they will say , if -lsb- nuclear weapon development -rsb- is permitted in iran , why ca n't we develop weapons as well ? "
a threat beyond israel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has called for the destruction of israel .
a nuclear-armed iran is widely seen as a direct threat to israel , as iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has pledged to ' ' wipe israel off the map . "
israel has not ruled out preemptive strikes against suspected nuclear sites inside iran if development continues .
but iran 's possession of a nuclear weapon has implications for other countries in the region as well , mustafa alani , senior advisor and program director at the gulf research center says .
' ' the question is not whether iran uses the bomb against other countries in the middle east , " alani told deutsche welle .
' ' but the question is whether iran has control of the region , and the political consequences of a dominant iran . "
the political balance of power in the middle east at the current time is relatively stable .
israel has a dominant military and nuclear weapons , as well as the backing of the united states .
economic power is diversified , as a number of states have thriving oil industries .
the region is also politically stable , with the exception of iraq , which is trying to sustain a functioning government in the wake of the iraq war .
a nuclear-armed and increasingly belligerent iran would dramatically alter this balance .
ahmadinejad would hold disproportionate clout , and if recent belligerent statements toward israel are to be believed , seems to be willing to use it .
preemption vs. nuclear war in the past , analysts have told deutsche welle that israel is unlikely to carry out unilateral military action against iran , as any action is not likely to destroy iran 's entire nuclear infrastructure .
last month , chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff admiral mike mullen told congress ' ' no strike , however effective , will be in and of itself decisive . "
however , the gulf center 's sager says that if economic sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a convoy of israeli military armored vehicles on the gaza strip. continue to fail , preemptive military action to stop iran from acquiring nuclear weapons is needed .
the power iran would have would be too great and too much of a risk to the region . ' ' if i had to chose between living with iran as a constant threat , or a military strike with limited retaliation , i can more easily live with the military option , " he said .
' ' we have already lived through wars , and no countries were erased from the map . "

as iran continues to develop its nuclear program , analysts fear that an arms race in the middle east could begin .
if sanctions continue to fail , these analysts say that military action is necessary to prevent this . as world powers negotiate on how to deal with iran 's continuing development of its nuclear program , concerns about a nuclear arms race in the middle east , prompted by iran 's determination to build nuclear weapons , are mounting .
officials from the united states , russia , france , britain , germany and china participated in a conference call yesterday to discuss how to handle iran 's flaunting of international demands to cease nuclear work .
these countries , while attempting to deter iran from continued nuclear development by offering tehran incentives to allow more oversight of its program , are also threatening sanctions if tehran does not stop work toward producing weapons grade uranium . iran , which has faced sanctions from the united nations three times , says it is developing its nuclear program for peaceful purposes and has refused to allow inspectors from the international atomic energy agency access to its nuclear facilities .
it is party to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty , but repeatedly has been found non-compliant .
there is growing fear that iran will not stop work toward a weapon unless drastic action is taken .
middle east experts said that if iran continues on its current path , a nuclear arms race in the region could ensue . ' ' turkey , algeria , egypt , and saudi arabia are all potential candidates to develop nuclear weapons , " abdulaziz sager , chairman of the gulf research center in dubai , told deutsche welle .
' ' and they will say , if -lsb- nuclear weapon development -rsb- is permitted in iran , why ca n't we develop weapons as well ? "
a threat beyond israel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has called for the destruction of israel .
a nuclear-armed iran is widely seen as a direct threat to israel , as iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has pledged to ' ' wipe israel off the map . "
israel has not ruled out preemptive strikes against suspected nuclear sites inside iran if development continues .
but iran 's possession of a nuclear weapon has implications for other countries in the region as well , mustafa alani , senior advisor and program director at the gulf research center says .
' ' the question is not whether iran uses the bomb against other countries in the middle east , " alani told deutsche welle .
' ' but the question is whether iran has control of the region , and the political consequences of a dominant iran . "
the political balance of power in the middle east at the current time is relatively stable .
israel has a dominant military and nuclear weapons , as well as the backing of the united states .
economic power is diversified , as a number of states have thriving oil industries .
the region is also politically stable , with the exception of iraq , which is trying to sustain a functioning government in the wake of the iraq war .
a nuclear-armed and increasingly belligerent iran would dramatically alter this balance .
ahmadinejad would hold disproportionate clout , and if recent belligerent statements toward israel are to be believed , seems to be willing to use it .
preemption vs. nuclear war in the past , analysts have told deutsche welle that israel is unlikely to carry out unilateral military action against iran , as any action is not likely to destroy iran 's entire nuclear infrastructure .
last month , chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff admiral mike mullen told congress ' ' no strike , however effective , will be in and of itself decisive . "
however , the gulf center 's sager says that if economic sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a convoy of israeli military armored vehicles on the gaza strip. continue to fail , preemptive military action to stop iran from acquiring nuclear weapons is needed .
the power iran would have would be too great and too much of a risk to the region . ' ' if i had to chose between living with iran as a constant threat , or a military strike with limited retaliation , i can more easily live with the military option , " he said .
' ' we have already lived through wars , and no countries were erased from the map . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 25.03.2010 tired bayern need to dig deep as their chase for three titles intensifies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's fatigue was evident again at schalke bayern munich reached the german cup final on wednesday night after beating schalke .
with their bundesliga and champions league campaigns still on course , bayern face a punishing end-of-season run . it took something special for bayern munich to beat schalke in their own backyard to reach the german cup final on wednesday night .
dutch international arjen robben looked to be going nowhere when he took off with the ball just inside the schalke half before racing down the right-wing to the corner flag .
one electric injection of pace and direction later , with three defenders flailing in his wake , robben was suddenly in the penalty area lashing a left-footed shot beyond schalke keeper manuel neuer to win the semi-final in style .
although bayern had the lion 's share of possession and the early chances in this tense and sometimes bad tempered meeting , robben 's 112th minute winner was the only flash of real class in the whole game .
and despite having eight minutes to save the tie after the bayern winger scored , it was clear schalke were out as soon as the dutchman 's shot hit the back of the net .
neither team had produced anything as decisive in nearly two hours of soccer .
robben 's act of individual brilliance was a worthy match winner , but the dutchman 's tenth goal of the season certainly put a thick layer of gloss on a rather dull bayern performance .
schalke 's overwhelming emphasis on defense , along with the terrible state of the turf in the veltins arena , gradually sapped bayern 's strength and creativity .
but even the bavarians ' early attempts on goal were far from polished .
energetic robben the exception as bayern labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben stood out from the lethargic pack on wednesday robben was the exception throughout , tirelessly chasing and making runs at schalke defenders .
no-one else , not even the late substitute franck ribery , looked able to summon that kind of energy , which could be a matter of concern in the coming weeks .
" we 're still involved in three competitions and that is emotionally not all that easy for the players , " bayern coach louis van gaal said after wednesday 's semifinal win .
" but we want to be involved in all three competitions , so we will have to come to terms with that . "
with league matches against main title rivals schalke and bayer leverkusen on the horizon , and a make-or-break champions league tie over two legs against manchester united , bayern 's season will likely be decided by the end of april - for better or worse .
the concern settling over munich is that the squad may not be deep enough to survive three consecutive title races .
loan deals force coach 's hand over rising stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal 's faith in young players is being put to the test luke faron , a bayern munich expert with theoffside.com , believes that bayern are beginning to feel the effects of loaning a number of players out to other clubs and promoting youngsters to a first team involved in not only a bundesliga title fight and a lengthy german cup campaign but also european matches of the highest standard .
" loaning brazilian defender breno to nuremberg was a necessary step in continuing his development and in getting the young center back some playing time , " faron told deutsche welle .
loaning left back edson braafheid to celtic was a bit surprising , said faron .
combined with breno 's move , it meant holger badstuber would be the only true reserve center back , in addition to starting at left back .
" with center backs van buyten and demichelis suffering injuries , badstuber had to move back inside and the pressure on the youngster has been intense . "
faron believes that van gaal has been forced to test the faith he had in the young players he brought into replenish the senior side in january , but says the coach has so far - on the whole - been justified in his decisions .
" diego contento and david alaba have both performed admirably in their champions league debuts , " said faron .
" alaba had a very bad final five minutes in frankfurt last weekend and perhaps that showed the limits of the wisdom of playing a 17-year-old natural midfielder out of position in a highly competitive match . "
he said contento had had his hands full with jefferson farfan on wednesday , but that he had coped with the task well enough .
if any player was showing fatigue , said faron , it was forward thomas mueller " it 's a big adjustment for a young player like mueller who has n't even played a full season in the bundesliga before .
add in the champions league and the german cup and the fact he also just made his national team debut , and it 's easy to understand why . "
success from continuity makes coach reluctant to change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the league campaign did not start well under van gaal another factor which is contributing to bayern 's lethargy at this point in the season is van gaal 's commitment to continuity .

with their bundesliga and champions league campaigns still on course , bayern face a punishing end-of-season run . it took something special for bayern munich to beat schalke in their own backyard to reach the german cup final on wednesday night .
dutch international arjen robben looked to be going nowhere when he took off with the ball just inside the schalke half before racing down the right-wing to the corner flag .
one electric injection of pace and direction later , with three defenders flailing in his wake , robben was suddenly in the penalty area lashing a left-footed shot beyond schalke keeper manuel neuer to win the semi-final in style .
although bayern had the lion 's share of possession and the early chances in this tense and sometimes bad tempered meeting , robben 's 112th minute winner was the only flash of real class in the whole game .
and despite having eight minutes to save the tie after the bayern winger scored , it was clear schalke were out as soon as the dutchman 's shot hit the back of the net .
neither team had produced anything as decisive in nearly two hours of soccer .
robben 's act of individual brilliance was a worthy match winner , but the dutchman 's tenth goal of the season certainly put a thick layer of gloss on a rather dull bayern performance .
schalke 's overwhelming emphasis on defense , along with the terrible state of the turf in the veltins arena , gradually sapped bayern 's strength and creativity .
but even the bavarians ' early attempts on goal were far from polished .
energetic robben the exception as bayern labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben stood out from the lethargic pack on wednesday robben was the exception throughout , tirelessly chasing and making runs at schalke defenders .
no-one else , not even the late substitute franck ribery , looked able to summon that kind of energy , which could be a matter of concern in the coming weeks .
" we 're still involved in three competitions and that is emotionally not all that easy for the players , " bayern coach louis van gaal said after wednesday 's semifinal win .
" but we want to be involved in all three competitions , so we will have to come to terms with that . "
with league matches against main title rivals schalke and bayer leverkusen on the horizon , and a make-or-break champions league tie over two legs against manchester united , bayern 's season will likely be decided by the end of april - for better or worse .
the concern settling over munich is that the squad may not be deep enough to survive three consecutive title races .
loan deals force coach 's hand over rising stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal 's faith in young players is being put to the test luke faron , a bayern munich expert with theoffside.com , believes that bayern are beginning to feel the effects of loaning a number of players out to other clubs and promoting youngsters to a first team involved in not only a bundesliga title fight and a lengthy german cup campaign but also european matches of the highest standard .
" loaning brazilian defender breno to nuremberg was a necessary step in continuing his development and in getting the young center back some playing time , " faron told deutsche welle .
loaning left back edson braafheid to celtic was a bit surprising , said faron .
combined with breno 's move , it meant holger badstuber would be the only true reserve center back , in addition to starting at left back .
" with center backs van buyten and demichelis suffering injuries , badstuber had to move back inside and the pressure on the youngster has been intense . "
faron believes that van gaal has been forced to test the faith he had in the young players he brought into replenish the senior side in january , but says the coach has so far - on the whole - been justified in his decisions .
" diego contento and david alaba have both performed admirably in their champions league debuts , " said faron .
" alaba had a very bad final five minutes in frankfurt last weekend and perhaps that showed the limits of the wisdom of playing a 17-year-old natural midfielder out of position in a highly competitive match . "
he said contento had had his hands full with jefferson farfan on wednesday , but that he had coped with the task well enough .
if any player was showing fatigue , said faron , it was forward thomas mueller " it 's a big adjustment for a young player like mueller who has n't even played a full season in the bundesliga before .
add in the champions league and the german cup and the fact he also just made his national team debut , and it 's easy to understand why . "
success from continuity makes coach reluctant to change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the league campaign did not start well under van gaal another factor which is contributing to bayern 's lethargy at this point in the season is van gaal 's commitment to continuity .
when he assumed control at the beginning of the season , it took the dutch coach at least ten matches of tinkering before he settled on his preferred line-up - ten matches during which bayern seemed rudderless and the coach 's credentials were questioned .

as iran continues to develop its nuclear program , analysts fear that an arms race in the middle east could begin .
if sanctions continue to fail , these analysts say that military action is necessary to prevent this . as world powers negotiate on how to deal with iran 's continuing development of its nuclear program , concerns about a nuclear arms race in the middle east , prompted by iran 's determination to build nuclear weapons , are mounting .
officials from the united states , russia , france , britain , germany and china participated in a conference call yesterday to discuss how to handle iran 's flaunting of international demands to cease nuclear work .
these countries , while attempting to deter iran from continued nuclear development by offering tehran incentives to allow more oversight of its program , are also threatening sanctions if tehran does not stop work toward producing weapons grade uranium . iran , which has faced sanctions from the united nations three times , says it is developing its nuclear program for peaceful purposes and has refused to allow inspectors from the international atomic energy agency access to its nuclear facilities .
it is party to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty , but repeatedly has been found non-compliant .
there is growing fear that iran will not stop work toward a weapon unless drastic action is taken .
middle east experts said that if iran continues on its current path , a nuclear arms race in the region could ensue . ' ' turkey , algeria , egypt , and saudi arabia are all potential candidates to develop nuclear weapons , " abdulaziz sager , chairman of the gulf research center in dubai , told deutsche welle .
' ' and they will say , if -lsb- nuclear weapon development -rsb- is permitted in iran , why ca n't we develop weapons as well ? "
a threat beyond israel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has called for the destruction of israel .
a nuclear-armed iran is widely seen as a direct threat to israel , as iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has pledged to ' ' wipe israel off the map . "
israel has not ruled out preemptive strikes against suspected nuclear sites inside iran if development continues .
but iran 's possession of a nuclear weapon has implications for other countries in the region as well , mustafa alani , senior advisor and program director at the gulf research center says .
' ' the question is not whether iran uses the bomb against other countries in the middle east , " alani told deutsche welle .
' ' but the question is whether iran has control of the region , and the political consequences of a dominant iran . "
the political balance of power in the middle east at the current time is relatively stable .
israel has a dominant military and nuclear weapons , as well as the backing of the united states .
economic power is diversified , as a number of states have thriving oil industries .
the region is also politically stable , with the exception of iraq , which is trying to sustain a functioning government in the wake of the iraq war .
a nuclear-armed and increasingly belligerent iran would dramatically alter this balance .
ahmadinejad would hold disproportionate clout , and if recent belligerent statements toward israel are to be believed , seems to be willing to use it .
preemption vs. nuclear war in the past , analysts have told deutsche welle that israel is unlikely to carry out unilateral military action against iran , as any action is not likely to destroy iran 's entire nuclear infrastructure .
last month , chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff admiral mike mullen told congress ' ' no strike , however effective , will be in and of itself decisive . "
however , the gulf center 's sager says that if economic sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a convoy of israeli military armored vehicles on the gaza strip. continue to fail , preemptive military action to stop iran from acquiring nuclear weapons is needed .
the power iran would have would be too great and too much of a risk to the region . ' ' if i had to chose between living with iran as a constant threat , or a military strike with limited retaliation , i can more easily live with the military option , " he said .
' ' we have already lived through wars , and no countries were erased from the map . "

a statement released by the company said his resignation was " due to differing views with the financial market stabilization fund -lrb- soffin -rrb- regarding the management of the company . "
soffin is the german government 's bank bailout fund , set up to stabilize the country 's banking sector .
the german weekly business magazine wirtschaftswoche reported that those disagreements were over salary levels , quoting an unnamed source close to the matter as saying , " wieandt wanted more money . "
a spokeswoman for soffin told the magazine , " there were disagreements over employee salaries .
soffin holds that a bank owned by the state ca n't be measured by the same standards as private banks . "
the government limits manager salaries at bailed-out banks to 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 667,800 -rrb- a year .
saved by the state munich-based hre is a prominent german victim of the global financial crisis and almost collapsed in september 2008 when its german-irish subsidiary depfa bank ran into a liquidity squeeze brought on by investment mistakes .
fearing a collapse of lehman brothers-like proportions , the german government intervened with loan guarantees and cash injections .
the company 's nationalization was completed late last year .

a statement released by the company said his resignation was " due to differing views with the financial market stabilization fund -lrb- soffin -rrb- regarding the management of the company . "
soffin is the german government 's bank bailout fund , set up to stabilize the country 's banking sector .
the german weekly business magazine wirtschaftswoche reported that those disagreements were over salary levels , quoting an unnamed source close to the matter as saying , " wieandt wanted more money . "
a spokeswoman for soffin told the magazine , " there were disagreements over employee salaries .
soffin holds that a bank owned by the state ca n't be measured by the same standards as private banks . "
the government limits manager salaries at bailed-out banks to 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 667,800 -rrb- a year .

the company 's nationalization was completed late last year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 25.03.2010 latest priest sex abuse scandal heats up responsibility debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as cardinal , ratzinger was informed but failed to act in the murphy case as the latest sexual abuse scandal in the catholic church gets uncomfortably close to the pope , questions of punishment versus apology in dealing with pedophile priests have once again emerged . the catholic church says the only way to face the burgeoning numbers of accusations is with complete honesty - and by urging victims to take legal action .
meanwhile , activists say the church should take more responsibility for its wayward leaders .
either way , the situation surrounding sexual abuse scandals in the catholic church is like a modern-day hydra myth - no sooner is one scandal addressed than another rises up to take its place .
with europe 's catholics still reeling from a series of alleged child-molestation cover-ups , news broke in the united states of a 1996 case that touches the upper echelons of church power .
failure to defrock in the latest case to hit headlines , the new york times reported on thursday that pope benedict xvi ignored allegations of child sex abuse back in the 1990s .
at the time , he was head of the congregation of the doctrine of the faith , the vatican body that judges cases of sexual abuse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victims recently took to the streets of the vatican to protest the paper reported that the pope - then cardinal joseph ratzinger - failed to defrock rev. lawrence murphy , a priest in milwaukee who had been accused of sexually abusing some 200 deaf boys , despite the fact that he was aware of the allegations .
murphy worked from 1950 to 1977 at a school for the deaf and died in 1998 .
a spokesman for the vatican , federico lombardi , argued that rome was n't informed of the case until 20 years after it happened , and said that in the end the church did n't take action against murphy because he had confessed the acts and because he was very ill and close to the end of his life .
records uncovered by the times show that three different bishops were aware of the accusations , but that the case was not brought to trial .
still , lombardi told news service reuters that the church is eager to see abusive priests brought to justice .
church calls in professional help this is a feeling shared by christoph heckeley , a spokesman for the archbishopric of cologne , germany .
the catholic church in germany has had a directive for the past eight years that urges prosecution in sex abuse cases , heckeley told deutsche welle .
" since 2002 we have a directive from the german bishops conference that says what you have to do in case sexual abuse is suspected , " heckeley said .
people with complaints are referred to professionals - psychologists , doctors and legal experts - who are hired by each bishopric , and are qualified to advise people who want to come forward with sex abuse allegations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abuse allegedly took place at some german jesuit schools " our aim is to listen to the victims and help them get justice , even when the cases are years or decades old .
they need somebody to listen to them , and the most important thing is that they get justice , " he said .
the response from the church will differ case by case , but the church " urgently advises " victims to take perpetrators to court .
unfortunately , heckeley said , victims often do n't want to do this because it can be too upsetting to their families , and " can destroy their entire social environment - it can traumatize them a second time .
you have to be careful . "
prosecution is a right , not an obligation while there is a right to prosecute , there is no obligation to do so - a situation that is currently under hot debate .
still , heckeley said experts recommend caution , since " the dangers -lrb- of forced prosecution -rrb- could outweigh the risks . "
no matter what shape the case takes in federal court , allegations of abuse are always looked into by a church tribunal out of rome .
yet in the murphy case , ratzinger 's deputy at the time advised a secret disciplinary trial at first .
he later reversed that decision , and in 1998 , murphy appealed directly to ratzinger for clemency , shortly before he died .
all the calls for openness , trials and apologies are well and good , victims-rights advocates say , but they do n't go far enough .
what is missing on the part of the church is a departure from the secrecy , and a willingness to admit its own cover-ups .
last week , following revelations of pedophilia that rocked the irish catholic church , the pope issued a long-awaited apology to victims of child sex abuse in ireland .
he acknowledged " serious mistakes " on the part of the church , as well as the sense of betrayal in the church felt by victims and their families .
victims ' groups start protests but irish victims ' groups felt that the apology fell short of their demands ; they called for the church to acknowledge its role in covering up abuse .
maeve lewis , executive director of irish victims ' rights group one in four , told bbc news , " we are really disappointed that there is no acknowledgement that the cover-up and the policy of cover-up in the church went right to the the vatican . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope finally addressed the cases of abuse in ireland and in germany , victims-rights advocates were incensed that the apology failed to mention cases of church pedophilia in munich that have dominated headlines for weeks .
the church has had to contend with cover-up allegations in that city while ratzinger was the city 's archbishop from 1977 to 1981 .
on thursday members of the us activist organization snap - survivor network of those abused by priests - launched a demonstration in the vatican , holding up signs that said " stop the secrecy now . "
they demanded that pope benedict open up all files on pedophile catholic clerics worldwide , and called for all " predator priests " to be defrocked .
the group has also protested in germany , austria , and the netherlands , all countries recently hit by church sex abuse scandals .
one official 's stance " i would ask the pope if he would please open up the files from the congregation of the doctrine of the faith and turn over all the information to the police , " barbara blaine , the president of snap , told reuters news service .
a trickle of acknowledgements have begun , and some say a wave may be coming .
earlier this month , the german church 's representative responsible for dealing with cases of abuse , bishop stephan ackermann , also acknowledged severe failures .
" where there was no will toward explanation and where the person who committed the crime was simply moved to a new post , we have to admit , in a whole array of cases , that there was a cover-up , " he told the rhein zeitung newspaper .
and this week , german news magazine focus reported that archbishop zollitsch , the leader of the german roman catholic church , also admitted cases of child sex abuse were known and covered up .
" yes , we did have that , " he said .
many see the catholic church as so damaged by these allegations that it will be hard for the institution to regain its footing .
" we can only survive this situation with openness and honesty , " says the cologne archbishopric 's heckeley .
" we have to try to win people 's trust that way . "

johannes krause told deutsche welle about his team 's efforts to analyze the ancient dna . the new report was published on the website of science journal " nature " on march 24 .
leipzig researchers johannes krause and svante pääbo of the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology co-authored the international project . deutsche welle : how did you find a bone fragment from the altai mountains ?
johannes krause : for several years , we 've been involved in a very productive collaboration with our colleagues in russia .
we received bones from them that we later identified as neanderthal bones , for example , thus showing that neanderthals lived in southern siberia , too - not just in europe .
and in recent years , we 've received other bone samples for genetic testing .
here in leipzig , we 've taken our neanderthal research to the genetic level , so we 've been examining the dna of ancient man -lrb- ... -rrb- to help us learn how prehistoric man is related to modern-day man or other forms of early man . the neaderthal has their own dna at least for portions of the genome , so they are n't our direct ancestors ; they 're more an extinct cousin of sorts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dna analysis of homonid species could shed light on their ties to modern man and during our search for new neanderthal bones , we stumbled upon these bones with dna that belonged neither to neanderthals nor modern man .
it constitutes a new form of prehistoric man that had never been discovered - something we had never seen from a genetic standpoint and that we could n't categorize as an existing form of prehistoric man .
everyone 's calling this a sensation - would you call it that ?
i think it 's a sensation because until now we had the potential to do genetic research on two different forms of man - now there 's a third .
so that 's pretty sensational , particularly as it ca n't be classified according to any existing form of prehistoric man .
unfortunately , we do n't have a complete skeleton - just the bone from a pinkie finger .
it 's a tiny fragment that ca n't tell us much about the morphology .
therefore we still do n't know what this prehistoric man looked like - did he perhaps look like a neanderthal , modern man or a homo erectus ?
so we lack quite a lot of information , but we now have the potential to study the dna of this prehistoric man ; we have the potential to examine the entire genome and genetic material from this prehistoric man and compare it to modern man and the neanderthals , for instance .
and through that , we can learn a lot .
for example , what kind of interactions occurred between these three species of prehistoric man ?
we could also show that they lived in the same place at the same time - that 's another sensation for us .
that means , we find neanderthal bones in a nearby cave , and in same layer in which we found the bones of the new human form , we find archaeological artifacts that appear to have come from modern man - ornaments and jewelry that are only associated with modern man .
so it looks as though these three forms of early man lived in the same place at the same time .
you can then imagine any number of scenarios where gene flow could have occurred between these three populations , and that is certainly something that 's very interesting to analyze on a genetic level .
is finding something like this an anthropologist 's dream come true ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian researchers discovered the fossil bone at a site in the altai mountains in siberia yes , this is probably a once-in-a-lifetime chance - discovering a new species or form of prehistoric man .
it 's certainly quite exciting for us .
of course , we should note that we 're not calling it a new species - we 're only talking about a new " form . "
so far , we 've only analyzed a tiny portion of the dna , and only when the entire genome or a large part of the genome has been analyzed will we be able to tell whether it 's something completely new or different , like modern man or the neanderthals , for instance .
and until then , we 're not going to talk about a new species .
but all signs indicate that we 're actually dealing with an entirely knew species of man here .
then what do you know already ; whose bones are they ?
so far , we can only say that this dna - the dna we 've studied so far from this prehistoric man - has about 1 million years between it and the dna of modern man .
so that means that these two forms , modern man and prehistoric man , spent at least 1 million years developing in very different ways .
based on our genetic tests , we can also say that modern man is more closely related to the neanderthals than he is to this new form of prehistoric man - we 're seeing two times as many differences between the dna of modern man and this new form than we do with modern man and the neanderthals .
this represents a completely different line that split off from modern man much earlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mitochondrial dna decoding showed differences between the ancestor and modern man do you know if it was a woman or a man ?
we 've named it " x woman . "
" x " stands for the unknown , since we ca n't classify it so easiliy , as i 'd mentioned . and " woman " because we examined the mitochondrial dna - the dna from the powerhouse of the cell - and that 's always passed down from the mother to the child .
so we 're looking at the female lineage , and so we adopted a feministic position .
but since we have yet to examine the entire genetic material , we still do n't know whether it 's a man or a woman .
and this process for examining the mitochrondrial dna - that 's something you developed ?
yes , my boss svante pääbo studied mitochrondrial dna from prehistoric man for the first time in the ' 90s - at the time , from neanderthals .
in recent years , we have refined these methods to help us obtain more information more quickly - and of a higher qualitative value .
but we 've really kicked this kind of research into high gear in recent years .
what 's next ?
what else do you plan to study - and what do you hope to find ?
we plan to study the entire genome - this prehistoric man 's entire genetic material .
we do n't just want to look at this tiny fraction , rather we will examine the entire genome to learn more about this prehistoric man and to see how he was related to modern man and to neanderthals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the neanderthals share many commonalities with modern man was there potential gene flow between these three populations ?
and what can we learn about phenotypical features - what color hair did he have ?
we 'll look at other kinds of features that we can reconstruct based on dna sequencing .
and who gets to keep the bone once you conclude your research ? whatever 's left of the bone will certainly be sent back to novosibirsk , to the museum responsible for the entire excavation .
that said , it 's not a spectacular bone - it 's only as large as cherry pit .
so it 's a very tiny fragment and it might not be all that interesting to look at .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian researchers discovered the fossil bone at a site in the altai mountains in siberia yes , this is probably a once-in-a-lifetime chance - discovering a new species or form of prehistoric man .
it 's certainly quite exciting for us .
of course , we should note that we 're not calling it a new species - we 're only talking about a new " form . "
so far , we 've only analyzed a tiny portion of the dna , and only when the entire genome or a large part of the genome has been analyzed will we be able to tell whether it 's something completely new or different , like modern man or the neanderthals , for instance .
and until then , we 're not going to talk about a new species .
but all signs indicate that we 're actually dealing with an entirely knew species of man here .
then what do you know already ; whose bones are they ?
so far , we can only say that this dna - the dna we 've studied so far from this prehistoric man - has about 1 million years between it and the dna of modern man .
so that means that these two forms , modern man and prehistoric man , spent at least 1 million years developing in very different ways .
based on our genetic tests , we can also say that modern man is more closely related to the neanderthals than he is to this new form of prehistoric man - we 're seeing two times as many differences between the dna of modern man and this new form than we do with modern man and the neanderthals .
this represents a completely different line that split off from modern man much earlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mitochondrial dna decoding showed differences between the ancestor and modern man do you know if it was a woman or a man ?
we 've named it " x woman . "
" x " stands for the unknown , since we ca n't classify it so easiliy , as i 'd mentioned . and " woman " because we examined the mitochondrial dna - the dna from the powerhouse of the cell - and that 's always passed down from the mother to the child .
so we 're looking at the female lineage , and so we adopted a feministic position .
but since we have yet to examine the entire genetic material , we still do n't know whether it 's a man or a woman .
and this process for examining the mitochrondrial dna - that 's something you developed ?
yes , my boss svante pääbo studied mitochrondrial dna from prehistoric man for the first time in the ' 90s - at the time , from neanderthals .
in recent years , we have refined these methods to help us obtain more information more quickly - and of a higher qualitative value .
but we 've really kicked this kind of research into high gear in recent years .
what 's next ?
what else do you plan to study - and what do you hope to find ?
we plan to study the entire genome - this prehistoric man 's entire genetic material .
we do n't just want to look at this tiny fraction , rather we will examine the entire genome to learn more about this prehistoric man and to see how he was related to modern man and to neanderthals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the neanderthals share many commonalities with modern man was there potential gene flow between these three populations ?
and what can we learn about phenotypical features - what color hair did he have ?
we 'll look at other kinds of features that we can reconstruct based on dna sequencing .
and who gets to keep the bone once you conclude your research ? whatever 's left of the bone will certainly be sent back to novosibirsk , to the museum responsible for the entire excavation .
that said , it 's not a spectacular bone - it 's only as large as cherry pit .
so it 's a very tiny fragment and it might not be all that interesting to look at .

" in turkey , we have german high schools - why should n't there be turkish high schools in germany ? "
erdogan asked in an interview with german weekly die zeit .
erdogan said that many of the almost three million people of turkish origin living in germany had problems with both languages , and offering education in turkish might also help their german .
" germany has not yet caught up with the times , " erdogan said .
" one must first have a firm command of one 's own language , that is to say , turkish , and that is unfortunately rarely the case . "
the federal government 's integration commissioner , maria boehmer , acknowledged the advantage pupils might gain if they could be fluent in two languages , but said learning german should take priority .
" only those who know german have a chance of social advancement , " boehmer , a christian democrat , told the daily berliner zeitung .
the head of the christian democratic party 's german-turkish forum in north-rhine westphalia was also skeptical .
" turkish secondary schools are a dead end for students , " buelent arslan told the daily koelner stadtanzeiger .
" to be successful in germany , a good level of german is essential , " arslan added .
tensions ahead of merkel visit the general secretary of the christian democrat 's bavarian sister party , the csu , said that erdogan was trying to use turkish people in germany to further his own political purposes .
" such demands are an affront in the run-up to his visit with our chancellor angela merkel , " alexander dobrindt told spiegel online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan will meet merkel next week in ankara chancellor angela merkel is due in ankara next monday for a two-day visit .
her relationship with erdogan is problematic , as germany does not favor full eu membership for turkey , calling for a ' privileged partnership ' instead .
turkey has repeatedly rejected anything but full membership in the bloc .
in berlin , which has the largest turkish community in germany , the council for education said the acquisition of turkish language was not necessarily conducive to integration .
it is the knowledge of german that counts , and often , turks in germany struggle to find skilled jobs because of a lack of good german , according to the council .
it also pointed out that there are already turkish grammar schools in germany , but they are privately funded .
some support erdogan 's comments found little support in the german media , but an editorial by daily sueddeutsche zeitung sees some merit in erdogan 's suggestion .
the newspaper pointed out that if more french schools were to be built in germany , it would be hailed as a symbol of franco-german friendship .
but germany seems to have a problem with the turkish language .
it does not " count for much " , according to sueddeutsche .
many companies are desperate to hire people with multiple language skills , so not giving turks the opportunity to study their language in-depth , was a " missed opportunity " , the paper claimed .
no dual citizenship erdogan also criticized the fact that germany does not allow dual citizenship unless the additional country is a member of the eu .
" i find it regrettable that germany is among the countries in the eu that does not allow dual citizenship , " he told die zeit .
a child of foreign parents can only obtain dual citizenship if one parent has lived in germany regularly for at least eight years .
but , at age 23 , the child needs to choose one nationality .
erdogan is no stranger to provocation .
in a speech in cologne in 2008 , erdogan said turks in germany can not be expected to ' assimilate ' and deny their turkish identity .
the comments were seen by many as a direct criticism of how germany treats people of turkish origin. svs / ng / dpa / apn / afp editor : matt hermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in turkey , we have german high schools - why should n't there be turkish high schools in germany ? "
erdogan asked in an interview with german weekly die zeit .
erdogan said that many of the almost three million people of turkish origin living in germany had problems with both languages , and offering education in turkish might also help their german .
" germany has not yet caught up with the times , " erdogan said .
" one must first have a firm command of one 's own language , that is to say , turkish , and that is unfortunately rarely the case . "
the federal government 's integration commissioner , maria boehmer , acknowledged the advantage pupils might gain if they could be fluent in two languages , but said learning german should take priority .
" only those who know german have a chance of social advancement , " boehmer , a christian democrat , told the daily berliner zeitung .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de research -pipe- 25.03.2010 german researchers decode unrecognized dna from ancient humanoid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists analyzed dna from a fossil finger found in siberia when researchers discovered a fossil finger in a siberian cave , they found an ancestor - and perhaps a new human species .
johannes krause told deutsche welle about his team 's efforts to analyze the ancient dna . the new report was published on the website of science journal " nature " on march 24 .
leipzig researchers johannes krause and svante pääbo of the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology co-authored the international project . deutsche welle : how did you find a bone fragment from the altai mountains ?
johannes krause : for several years , we 've been involved in a very productive collaboration with our colleagues in russia .
we received bones from them that we later identified as neanderthal bones , for example , thus showing that neanderthals lived in southern siberia , too - not just in europe .
and in recent years , we 've received other bone samples for genetic testing .
here in leipzig , we 've taken our neanderthal research to the genetic level , so we 've been examining the dna of ancient man -lrb- ... -rrb- to help us learn how prehistoric man is related to modern-day man or other forms of early man . the neaderthal has their own dna at least for portions of the genome , so they are n't our direct ancestors ; they 're more an extinct cousin of sorts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dna analysis of homonid species could shed light on their ties to modern man and during our search for new neanderthal bones , we stumbled upon these bones with dna that belonged neither to neanderthals nor modern man .
it constitutes a new form of prehistoric man that had never been discovered - something we had never seen from a genetic standpoint and that we could n't categorize as an existing form of prehistoric man .
everyone 's calling this a sensation - would you call it that ?
i think it 's a sensation because until now we had the potential to do genetic research on two different forms of man - now there 's a third .
so that 's pretty sensational , particularly as it ca n't be classified according to any existing form of prehistoric man .
unfortunately , we do n't have a complete skeleton - just the bone from a pinkie finger .
it 's a tiny fragment that ca n't tell us much about the morphology .
therefore we still do n't know what this prehistoric man looked like - did he perhaps look like a neanderthal , modern man or a homo erectus ?
so we lack quite a lot of information , but we now have the potential to study the dna of this prehistoric man ; we have the potential to examine the entire genome and genetic material from this prehistoric man and compare it to modern man and the neanderthals , for instance .
and through that , we can learn a lot .
for example , what kind of interactions occurred between these three species of prehistoric man ?
we could also show that they lived in the same place at the same time - that 's another sensation for us .
that means , we find neanderthal bones in a nearby cave , and in same layer in which we found the bones of the new human form , we find archaeological artifacts that appear to have come from modern man - ornaments and jewelry that are only associated with modern man .
so it looks as though these three forms of early man lived in the same place at the same time .
you can then imagine any number of scenarios where gene flow could have occurred between these three populations , and that is certainly something that 's very interesting to analyze on a genetic level .
is finding something like this an anthropologist 's dream come true ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian researchers discovered the fossil bone at a site in the altai mountains in siberia yes , this is probably a once-in-a-lifetime chance - discovering a new species or form of prehistoric man .
it 's certainly quite exciting for us .
of course , we should note that we 're not calling it a new species - we 're only talking about a new " form . "
so far , we 've only analyzed a tiny portion of the dna , and only when the entire genome or a large part of the genome has been analyzed will we be able to tell whether it 's something completely new or different , like modern man or the neanderthals , for instance .
and until then , we 're not going to talk about a new species .
but all signs indicate that we 're actually dealing with an entirely knew species of man here .
then what do you know already ; whose bones are they ?
so far , we can only say that this dna - the dna we 've studied so far from this prehistoric man - has about 1 million years between it and the dna of modern man .
so that means that these two forms , modern man and prehistoric man , spent at least 1 million years developing in very different ways .
based on our genetic tests , we can also say that modern man is more closely related to the neanderthals than he is to this new form of prehistoric man - we 're seeing two times as many differences between the dna of modern man and this new form than we do with modern man and the neanderthals .
this represents a completely different line that split off from modern man much earlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mitochondrial dna decoding showed differences between the ancestor and modern man do you know if it was a woman or a man ?
we 've named it " x woman . "
" x " stands for the unknown , since we ca n't classify it so easiliy , as i 'd mentioned . and " woman " because we examined the mitochondrial dna - the dna from the powerhouse of the cell - and that 's always passed down from the mother to the child .
so we 're looking at the female lineage , and so we adopted a feministic position .
but since we have yet to examine the entire genetic material , we still do n't know whether it 's a man or a woman .
and this process for examining the mitochrondrial dna - that 's something you developed ?
yes , my boss svante pääbo studied mitochrondrial dna from prehistoric man for the first time in the ' 90s - at the time , from neanderthals .
in recent years , we have refined these methods to help us obtain more information more quickly - and of a higher qualitative value .
but we 've really kicked this kind of research into high gear in recent years .
what 's next ?
what else do you plan to study - and what do you hope to find ?
we plan to study the entire genome - this prehistoric man 's entire genetic material .
we do n't just want to look at this tiny fraction , rather we will examine the entire genome to learn more about this prehistoric man and to see how he was related to modern man and to neanderthals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the neanderthals share many commonalities with modern man was there potential gene flow between these three populations ?
and what can we learn about phenotypical features - what color hair did he have ?
we 'll look at other kinds of features that we can reconstruct based on dna sequencing .
and who gets to keep the bone once you conclude your research ? whatever 's left of the bone will certainly be sent back to novosibirsk , to the museum responsible for the entire excavation .
that said , it 's not a spectacular bone - it 's only as large as cherry pit .
so it 's a very tiny fragment and it might not be all that interesting to look at .

johannes krause told deutsche welle about his team 's efforts to analyze the ancient dna . the new report was published on the website of science journal " nature " on march 24 .
leipzig researchers johannes krause and svante pääbo of the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology co-authored the international project . deutsche welle : how did you find a bone fragment from the altai mountains ?
johannes krause : for several years , we 've been involved in a very productive collaboration with our colleagues in russia .
we received bones from them that we later identified as neanderthal bones , for example , thus showing that neanderthals lived in southern siberia , too - not just in europe .
and in recent years , we 've received other bone samples for genetic testing .
here in leipzig , we 've taken our neanderthal research to the genetic level , so we 've been examining the dna of ancient man -lrb- ... -rrb- to help us learn how prehistoric man is related to modern-day man or other forms of early man . the neaderthal has their own dna at least for portions of the genome , so they are n't our direct ancestors ; they 're more an extinct cousin of sorts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dna analysis of homonid species could shed light on their ties to modern man and during our search for new neanderthal bones , we stumbled upon these bones with dna that belonged neither to neanderthals nor modern man .
it constitutes a new form of prehistoric man that had never been discovered - something we had never seen from a genetic standpoint and that we could n't categorize as an existing form of prehistoric man .
everyone 's calling this a sensation - would you call it that ?
i think it 's a sensation because until now we had the potential to do genetic research on two different forms of man - now there 's a third .
so that 's pretty sensational , particularly as it ca n't be classified according to any existing form of prehistoric man .
unfortunately , we do n't have a complete skeleton - just the bone from a pinkie finger .
it 's a tiny fragment that ca n't tell us much about the morphology .
therefore we still do n't know what this prehistoric man looked like - did he perhaps look like a neanderthal , modern man or a homo erectus ?
so we lack quite a lot of information , but we now have the potential to study the dna of this prehistoric man ; we have the potential to examine the entire genome and genetic material from this prehistoric man and compare it to modern man and the neanderthals , for instance .
and through that , we can learn a lot .
for example , what kind of interactions occurred between these three species of prehistoric man ?
we could also show that they lived in the same place at the same time - that 's another sensation for us .
that means , we find neanderthal bones in a nearby cave , and in same layer in which we found the bones of the new human form , we find archaeological artifacts that appear to have come from modern man - ornaments and jewelry that are only associated with modern man .
so it looks as though these three forms of early man lived in the same place at the same time .
you can then imagine any number of scenarios where gene flow could have occurred between these three populations , and that is certainly something that 's very interesting to analyze on a genetic level .
is finding something like this an anthropologist 's dream come true ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian researchers discovered the fossil bone at a site in the altai mountains in siberia yes , this is probably a once-in-a-lifetime chance - discovering a new species or form of prehistoric man .
it 's certainly quite exciting for us .
of course , we should note that we 're not calling it a new species - we 're only talking about a new " form . "
so far , we 've only analyzed a tiny portion of the dna , and only when the entire genome or a large part of the genome has been analyzed will we be able to tell whether it 's something completely new or different , like modern man or the neanderthals , for instance .
and until then , we 're not going to talk about a new species .
but all signs indicate that we 're actually dealing with an entirely knew species of man here .
then what do you know already ; whose bones are they ?
so far , we can only say that this dna - the dna we 've studied so far from this prehistoric man - has about 1 million years between it and the dna of modern man .
so that means that these two forms , modern man and prehistoric man , spent at least 1 million years developing in very different ways .
based on our genetic tests , we can also say that modern man is more closely related to the neanderthals than he is to this new form of prehistoric man - we 're seeing two times as many differences between the dna of modern man and this new form than we do with modern man and the neanderthals .
this represents a completely different line that split off from modern man much earlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mitochondrial dna decoding showed differences between the ancestor and modern man do you know if it was a woman or a man ?
we 've named it " x woman . "
" x " stands for the unknown , since we ca n't classify it so easiliy , as i 'd mentioned . and " woman " because we examined the mitochondrial dna - the dna from the powerhouse of the cell - and that 's always passed down from the mother to the child .
so we 're looking at the female lineage , and so we adopted a feministic position .
but since we have yet to examine the entire genetic material , we still do n't know whether it 's a man or a woman .
and this process for examining the mitochrondrial dna - that 's something you developed ?
yes , my boss svante pääbo studied mitochrondrial dna from prehistoric man for the first time in the ' 90s - at the time , from neanderthals .
in recent years , we have refined these methods to help us obtain more information more quickly - and of a higher qualitative value .
but we 've really kicked this kind of research into high gear in recent years .
what 's next ?
what else do you plan to study - and what do you hope to find ?
we plan to study the entire genome - this prehistoric man 's entire genetic material .
we do n't just want to look at this tiny fraction , rather we will examine the entire genome to learn more about this prehistoric man and to see how he was related to modern man and to neanderthals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the neanderthals share many commonalities with modern man was there potential gene flow between these three populations ?
and what can we learn about phenotypical features - what color hair did he have ?
we 'll look at other kinds of features that we can reconstruct based on dna sequencing .
and who gets to keep the bone once you conclude your research ? whatever 's left of the bone will certainly be sent back to novosibirsk , to the museum responsible for the entire excavation .
that said , it 's not a spectacular bone - it 's only as large as cherry pit .
so it 's a very tiny fragment and it might not be all that interesting to look at .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de research -pipe- 25.03.2010 german researchers decode unrecognized dna from ancient humanoid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists analyzed dna from a fossil finger found in siberia when researchers discovered a fossil finger in a siberian cave , they found an ancestor - and perhaps a new human species .
johannes krause told deutsche welle about his team 's efforts to analyze the ancient dna . the new report was published on the website of science journal " nature " on march 24 .
leipzig researchers johannes krause and svante pääbo of the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology co-authored the international project . deutsche welle : how did you find a bone fragment from the altai mountains ?
johannes krause : for several years , we 've been involved in a very productive collaboration with our colleagues in russia .
we received bones from them that we later identified as neanderthal bones , for example , thus showing that neanderthals lived in southern siberia , too - not just in europe .
and in recent years , we 've received other bone samples for genetic testing .
here in leipzig , we 've taken our neanderthal research to the genetic level , so we 've been examining the dna of ancient man -lrb- ... -rrb- to help us learn how prehistoric man is related to modern-day man or other forms of early man . the neaderthal has their own dna at least for portions of the genome , so they are n't our direct ancestors ; they 're more an extinct cousin of sorts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dna analysis of homonid species could shed light on their ties to modern man and during our search for new neanderthal bones , we stumbled upon these bones with dna that belonged neither to neanderthals nor modern man .
it constitutes a new form of prehistoric man that had never been discovered - something we had never seen from a genetic standpoint and that we could n't categorize as an existing form of prehistoric man .
everyone 's calling this a sensation - would you call it that ?
i think it 's a sensation because until now we had the potential to do genetic research on two different forms of man - now there 's a third .
so that 's pretty sensational , particularly as it ca n't be classified according to any existing form of prehistoric man .
unfortunately , we do n't have a complete skeleton - just the bone from a pinkie finger .
it 's a tiny fragment that ca n't tell us much about the morphology .
therefore we still do n't know what this prehistoric man looked like - did he perhaps look like a neanderthal , modern man or a homo erectus ?
so we lack quite a lot of information , but we now have the potential to study the dna of this prehistoric man ; we have the potential to examine the entire genome and genetic material from this prehistoric man and compare it to modern man and the neanderthals , for instance .
and through that , we can learn a lot .
for example , what kind of interactions occurred between these three species of prehistoric man ?
we could also show that they lived in the same place at the same time - that 's another sensation for us .
that means , we find neanderthal bones in a nearby cave , and in same layer in which we found the bones of the new human form , we find archaeological artifacts that appear to have come from modern man - ornaments and jewelry that are only associated with modern man .
so it looks as though these three forms of early man lived in the same place at the same time .
you can then imagine any number of scenarios where gene flow could have occurred between these three populations , and that is certainly something that 's very interesting to analyze on a genetic level .
is finding something like this an anthropologist 's dream come true ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian researchers discovered the fossil bone at a site in the altai mountains in siberia yes , this is probably a once-in-a-lifetime chance - discovering a new species or form of prehistoric man .
it 's certainly quite exciting for us .
of course , we should note that we 're not calling it a new species - we 're only talking about a new " form . "
so far , we 've only analyzed a tiny portion of the dna , and only when the entire genome or a large part of the genome has been analyzed will we be able to tell whether it 's something completely new or different , like modern man or the neanderthals , for instance .
and until then , we 're not going to talk about a new species .
but all signs indicate that we 're actually dealing with an entirely knew species of man here .
then what do you know already ; whose bones are they ?
so far , we can only say that this dna - the dna we 've studied so far from this prehistoric man - has about 1 million years between it and the dna of modern man .
so that means that these two forms , modern man and prehistoric man , spent at least 1 million years developing in very different ways .
based on our genetic tests , we can also say that modern man is more closely related to the neanderthals than he is to this new form of prehistoric man - we 're seeing two times as many differences between the dna of modern man and this new form than we do with modern man and the neanderthals .
this represents a completely different line that split off from modern man much earlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mitochondrial dna decoding showed differences between the ancestor and modern man do you know if it was a woman or a man ?
we 've named it " x woman . "
" x " stands for the unknown , since we ca n't classify it so easiliy , as i 'd mentioned . and " woman " because we examined the mitochondrial dna - the dna from the powerhouse of the cell - and that 's always passed down from the mother to the child .
so we 're looking at the female lineage , and so we adopted a feministic position .
but since we have yet to examine the entire genetic material , we still do n't know whether it 's a man or a woman .
and this process for examining the mitochrondrial dna - that 's something you developed ?
yes , my boss svante pääbo studied mitochrondrial dna from prehistoric man for the first time in the ' 90s - at the time , from neanderthals .
in recent years , we have refined these methods to help us obtain more information more quickly - and of a higher qualitative value .
but we 've really kicked this kind of research into high gear in recent years .
what 's next ?
what else do you plan to study - and what do you hope to find ?
we plan to study the entire genome - this prehistoric man 's entire genetic material .
we do n't just want to look at this tiny fraction , rather we will examine the entire genome to learn more about this prehistoric man and to see how he was related to modern man and to neanderthals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the neanderthals share many commonalities with modern man was there potential gene flow between these three populations ?
and what can we learn about phenotypical features - what color hair did he have ?
we 'll look at other kinds of features that we can reconstruct based on dna sequencing .
and who gets to keep the bone once you conclude your research ? whatever 's left of the bone will certainly be sent back to novosibirsk , to the museum responsible for the entire excavation .
that said , it 's not a spectacular bone - it 's only as large as cherry pit .
so it 's a very tiny fragment and it might not be all that interesting to look at .

but when those international couples divorce , those borders can make it even more complicated .
some eu nations want to change that . some 300,000 marriages between people from different european union countries take place every year - the romantic side of the increasing borderlessness of the 27-nation bloc .
but 140,000 mixed-nationality eu couples file for divorce every year , and many are faced with a legal maze created by divorce laws that vary from country to country across the eu . but ten eu countries - austria , bulgaria , france , greece , hungary , italy , luxembourg , romania , slovakia and spain - want to take advantage of a never-before-used 1997 treaty provision to simplify that process .
it allows for a subgroup of eu countries to develop a system of " enhanced cooperation . " the ten want to form their own pact harmonizing their divorce laws .
the countries need approval from eu justice ministers to draw up such a deal , but the idea would be to obligate couples to agree on a jurisdiction for their divorce proceedings .
if they can not agree , the divorce laws of the country where they last lived together would apply .
a boon or a burden ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reding says eu should work to simplify mixed-nationality divorce supporters of the idea say it would streamline mixed-nationality divorces , possibly reduce legal fees , and discourage " divorce shopping , " in which one spouse seeks out the jurisdiction that favors him or her .
" international couples can encounter arbitrary legal problems that turn the tragedy of divorce into a financial and emotional disaster … because national legal systems have so far failed to provide clear answers , " said eu justice commissioner viviane reding .
but critics of the proposal say it would create a " europe within europe . "
and value-laden family policy is an area the eu usually sidesteps .
divorce laws vary dramatically across the bloc .

" i think , the west should not directly interfere in iranian domestic affairs , " said kosten . " there has to be rhetorical support and a strict and direct condemnation of all violence against peaceful protests and any breach of international law by parts of the regime in iran .
also , measures like support for free internet use and technical support should be considered .
but direct support , through direct financial aid for example , would be danger for the opposition since they would be immediately charged and outlawed in iran . " meir javedanfar , a middle east analyst and the director for the middle east economic and political analysis -lrb- meepas -rrb- think-tank , agreed that the west should refrain from any direct involvement with the opposition . " if the west were to continue to pressure the iranian regime over human rights and the treatment of protestors , that would be acceptable involvement , " he said . " if the sanctions were to concentrate on the assets of the regime , government-backed companies and manufacturers of armoured vehicles which have been involved in the suppression of the opposition , this would also be acceptable .
but funding and agitation by the west would be counterproductive and would lead to the opposition being labelled as puppets of the west and would justify the hard-line crackdown . " nuclear standoff likely to continue under moderate regime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iran under mousavi would still pursue nuclear ambitions experts believe that the possibility of regime change - peaceful or not - is still within the opposition ’ s reach .
but even if future events result in a moderate leadership taking power in iran , the west 's problems regarding tehran 's nuclear ambitions wo n't just go away .
in fact , while a moderate leadership would be more inclined to engage in talks , the west 's ultimate goal - to prevent iran from having nuclear technology - would still be non-negotiable . " the rhetoric would change and maybe broader negotiations would be more likely , " kosten said .
" however , there is no way to prevent iran from pursuing its civil right to develop nuclear energy .
the islamic republic of iran would not give up this technology , be it ahmadinejad or mousavi as president . " " the pursuit of nuclear technology would continue regardless , " javedanfar added .
" maybe the west would have more success in negotiating with a moderate regime , maybe deals such as third-party enrichment would be agreed to under mousavi or another reformist leader but even regime change wo n't stop iran pursuing nuclear technology - or the option to make a bomb .
this is something even the shah was pursuing .

experts in kolkata on thursday said fishermen had confirmed this . the tiny island , which was about 3.5 kilometers long and 3 kilometers wide , was claimed by both bangladesh and india .
it had been a bone of contention between the two countries since the 1970s .
sugata hazra from the school of oceanographic studies at kolkata 's jadavpur university from the school of oceanographic studies said that " global warming and erosion were responsible for solving this point in the sometimes fractious relations between bangladesh and india . "
created by a cyclone , sunk by climage change the original source of the dispute in the sundarbans mangrove delta is thought to have been created by a cyclone only about 40 years ago .
the indian navy planted its national flag there in 1981 but there was never any permanent settlement despite years of negotiations .
hazra said that he believed the island had vanished in 1990 .
he added that lohachara , a larger island in the bay of bengal had also disappeared in 1996 , shortly after its 4,000 inhabitants fled .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de research -pipe- 25.03.2010 german researchers decode unrecognized dna from ancient humanoid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists analyzed dna from a fossil finger found in siberia when researchers discovered a fossil finger in a siberian cave , they found an ancestor - and perhaps a new human species .
johannes krause told deutsche welle about his team 's efforts to analyze the ancient dna . the new report was published on the website of science journal " nature " on march 24 .
leipzig researchers johannes krause and svante pääbo of the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology co-authored the international project . deutsche welle : how did you find a bone fragment from the altai mountains ?
johannes krause : for several years , we 've been involved in a very productive collaboration with our colleagues in russia .
we received bones from them that we later identified as neanderthal bones , for example , thus showing that neanderthals lived in southern siberia , too - not just in europe .
and in recent years , we 've received other bone samples for genetic testing .
here in leipzig , we 've taken our neanderthal research to the genetic level , so we 've been examining the dna of ancient man -lrb- ... -rrb- to help us learn how prehistoric man is related to modern-day man or other forms of early man . the neaderthal has their own dna at least for portions of the genome , so they are n't our direct ancestors ; they 're more an extinct cousin of sorts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dna analysis of homonid species could shed light on their ties to modern man and during our search for new neanderthal bones , we stumbled upon these bones with dna that belonged neither to neanderthals nor modern man .
it constitutes a new form of prehistoric man that had never been discovered - something we had never seen from a genetic standpoint and that we could n't categorize as an existing form of prehistoric man .
everyone 's calling this a sensation - would you call it that ?
i think it 's a sensation because until now we had the potential to do genetic research on two different forms of man - now there 's a third .
so that 's pretty sensational , particularly as it ca n't be classified according to any existing form of prehistoric man .
unfortunately , we do n't have a complete skeleton - just the bone from a pinkie finger .
it 's a tiny fragment that ca n't tell us much about the morphology .
therefore we still do n't know what this prehistoric man looked like - did he perhaps look like a neanderthal , modern man or a homo erectus ?
so we lack quite a lot of information , but we now have the potential to study the dna of this prehistoric man ; we have the potential to examine the entire genome and genetic material from this prehistoric man and compare it to modern man and the neanderthals , for instance .
and through that , we can learn a lot .
for example , what kind of interactions occurred between these three species of prehistoric man ?
we could also show that they lived in the same place at the same time - that 's another sensation for us .
that means , we find neanderthal bones in a nearby cave , and in same layer in which we found the bones of the new human form , we find archaeological artifacts that appear to have come from modern man - ornaments and jewelry that are only associated with modern man .
so it looks as though these three forms of early man lived in the same place at the same time .
you can then imagine any number of scenarios where gene flow could have occurred between these three populations , and that is certainly something that 's very interesting to analyze on a genetic level .
is finding something like this an anthropologist 's dream come true ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian researchers discovered the fossil bone at a site in the altai mountains in siberia yes , this is probably a once-in-a-lifetime chance - discovering a new species or form of prehistoric man .
it 's certainly quite exciting for us .
of course , we should note that we 're not calling it a new species - we 're only talking about a new " form . "
so far , we 've only analyzed a tiny portion of the dna , and only when the entire genome or a large part of the genome has been analyzed will we be able to tell whether it 's something completely new or different , like modern man or the neanderthals , for instance .
and until then , we 're not going to talk about a new species .
but all signs indicate that we 're actually dealing with an entirely knew species of man here .
then what do you know already ; whose bones are they ?
so far , we can only say that this dna - the dna we 've studied so far from this prehistoric man - has about 1 million years between it and the dna of modern man .
so that means that these two forms , modern man and prehistoric man , spent at least 1 million years developing in very different ways .
based on our genetic tests , we can also say that modern man is more closely related to the neanderthals than he is to this new form of prehistoric man - we 're seeing two times as many differences between the dna of modern man and this new form than we do with modern man and the neanderthals .
this represents a completely different line that split off from modern man much earlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mitochondrial dna decoding showed differences between the ancestor and modern man do you know if it was a woman or a man ?
we 've named it " x woman . "
" x " stands for the unknown , since we ca n't classify it so easiliy , as i 'd mentioned . and " woman " because we examined the mitochondrial dna - the dna from the powerhouse of the cell - and that 's always passed down from the mother to the child .
so we 're looking at the female lineage , and so we adopted a feministic position .
but since we have yet to examine the entire genetic material , we still do n't know whether it 's a man or a woman .
and this process for examining the mitochrondrial dna - that 's something you developed ?
yes , my boss svante pääbo studied mitochrondrial dna from prehistoric man for the first time in the ' 90s - at the time , from neanderthals .
in recent years , we have refined these methods to help us obtain more information more quickly - and of a higher qualitative value .
but we 've really kicked this kind of research into high gear in recent years .
what 's next ?
what else do you plan to study - and what do you hope to find ?
we plan to study the entire genome - this prehistoric man 's entire genetic material .
we do n't just want to look at this tiny fraction , rather we will examine the entire genome to learn more about this prehistoric man and to see how he was related to modern man and to neanderthals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the neanderthals share many commonalities with modern man was there potential gene flow between these three populations ?
and what can we learn about phenotypical features - what color hair did he have ?
we 'll look at other kinds of features that we can reconstruct based on dna sequencing .
and who gets to keep the bone once you conclude your research ? whatever 's left of the bone will certainly be sent back to novosibirsk , to the museum responsible for the entire excavation .
that said , it 's not a spectacular bone - it 's only as large as cherry pit .
so it 's a very tiny fragment and it might not be all that interesting to look at .

you can then imagine any number of scenarios where gene flow could have occurred between these three populations , and that is certainly something that 's very interesting to analyze on a genetic level .
is finding something like this an anthropologist 's dream come true ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian researchers discovered the fossil bone at a site in the altai mountains in siberia yes , this is probably a once-in-a-lifetime chance - discovering a new species or form of prehistoric man .
it 's certainly quite exciting for us .
of course , we should note that we 're not calling it a new species - we 're only talking about a new " form . "
so far , we 've only analyzed a tiny portion of the dna , and only when the entire genome or a large part of the genome has been analyzed will we be able to tell whether it 's something completely new or different , like modern man or the neanderthals , for instance .
and until then , we 're not going to talk about a new species .
but all signs indicate that we 're actually dealing with an entirely knew species of man here .
then what do you know already ; whose bones are they ?
so far , we can only say that this dna - the dna we 've studied so far from this prehistoric man - has about 1 million years between it and the dna of modern man .
so that means that these two forms , modern man and prehistoric man , spent at least 1 million years developing in very different ways .
based on our genetic tests , we can also say that modern man is more closely related to the neanderthals than he is to this new form of prehistoric man - we 're seeing two times as many differences between the dna of modern man and this new form than we do with modern man and the neanderthals .
this represents a completely different line that split off from modern man much earlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mitochondrial dna decoding showed differences between the ancestor and modern man do you know if it was a woman or a man ?
we 've named it " x woman . "
" x " stands for the unknown , since we ca n't classify it so easiliy , as i 'd mentioned . and " woman " because we examined the mitochondrial dna - the dna from the powerhouse of the cell - and that 's always passed down from the mother to the child .
so we 're looking at the female lineage , and so we adopted a feministic position .
but since we have yet to examine the entire genetic material , we still do n't know whether it 's a man or a woman .
and this process for examining the mitochrondrial dna - that 's something you developed ?
yes , my boss svante pääbo studied mitochrondrial dna from prehistoric man for the first time in the ' 90s - at the time , from neanderthals .
in recent years , we have refined these methods to help us obtain more information more quickly - and of a higher qualitative value .
but we 've really kicked this kind of research into high gear in recent years .
what 's next ?
what else do you plan to study - and what do you hope to find ?
we plan to study the entire genome - this prehistoric man 's entire genetic material .
we do n't just want to look at this tiny fraction , rather we will examine the entire genome to learn more about this prehistoric man and to see how he was related to modern man and to neanderthals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the neanderthals share many commonalities with modern man was there potential gene flow between these three populations ?
and what can we learn about phenotypical features - what color hair did he have ?
we 'll look at other kinds of features that we can reconstruct based on dna sequencing .
and who gets to keep the bone once you conclude your research ? whatever 's left of the bone will certainly be sent back to novosibirsk , to the museum responsible for the entire excavation .
that said , it 's not a spectacular bone - it 's only as large as cherry pit .
so it 's a very tiny fragment and it might not be all that interesting to look at .

johannes krause told deutsche welle about his team 's efforts to analyze the ancient dna . the new report was published on the website of science journal " nature " on march 24 .
leipzig researchers johannes krause and svante pääbo of the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology co-authored the international project . deutsche welle : how did you find a bone fragment from the altai mountains ?
johannes krause : for several years , we 've been involved in a very productive collaboration with our colleagues in russia .
we received bones from them that we later identified as neanderthal bones , for example , thus showing that neanderthals lived in southern siberia , too - not just in europe .
and in recent years , we 've received other bone samples for genetic testing .
here in leipzig , we 've taken our neanderthal research to the genetic level , so we 've been examining the dna of ancient man -lrb- ... -rrb- to help us learn how prehistoric man is related to modern-day man or other forms of early man . the neaderthal has their own dna at least for portions of the genome , so they are n't our direct ancestors ; they 're more an extinct cousin of sorts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dna analysis of homonid species could shed light on their ties to modern man and during our search for new neanderthal bones , we stumbled upon these bones with dna that belonged neither to neanderthals nor modern man .
it constitutes a new form of prehistoric man that had never been discovered - something we had never seen from a genetic standpoint and that we could n't categorize as an existing form of prehistoric man .
everyone 's calling this a sensation - would you call it that ?
i think it 's a sensation because until now we had the potential to do genetic research on two different forms of man - now there 's a third .
so that 's pretty sensational , particularly as it ca n't be classified according to any existing form of prehistoric man .
unfortunately , we do n't have a complete skeleton - just the bone from a pinkie finger .
it 's a tiny fragment that ca n't tell us much about the morphology .
therefore we still do n't know what this prehistoric man looked like - did he perhaps look like a neanderthal , modern man or a homo erectus ?
so we lack quite a lot of information , but we now have the potential to study the dna of this prehistoric man ; we have the potential to examine the entire genome and genetic material from this prehistoric man and compare it to modern man and the neanderthals , for instance .
and through that , we can learn a lot .
for example , what kind of interactions occurred between these three species of prehistoric man ?
we could also show that they lived in the same place at the same time - that 's another sensation for us .
that means , we find neanderthal bones in a nearby cave , and in same layer in which we found the bones of the new human form , we find archaeological artifacts that appear to have come from modern man - ornaments and jewelry that are only associated with modern man .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mitochondrial dna decoding showed differences between the ancestor and modern man do you know if it was a woman or a man ?
we 've named it " x woman . "
" x " stands for the unknown , since we ca n't classify it so easiliy , as i 'd mentioned . and " woman " because we examined the mitochondrial dna - the dna from the powerhouse of the cell - and that 's always passed down from the mother to the child .
so we 're looking at the female lineage , and so we adopted a feministic position .
but since we have yet to examine the entire genetic material , we still do n't know whether it 's a man or a woman .
and this process for examining the mitochrondrial dna - that 's something you developed ?
yes , my boss svante pääbo studied mitochrondrial dna from prehistoric man for the first time in the ' 90s - at the time , from neanderthals .
in recent years , we have refined these methods to help us obtain more information more quickly - and of a higher qualitative value .
but we 've really kicked this kind of research into high gear in recent years .
what 's next ?
what else do you plan to study - and what do you hope to find ?
we plan to study the entire genome - this prehistoric man 's entire genetic material .
we do n't just want to look at this tiny fraction , rather we will examine the entire genome to learn more about this prehistoric man and to see how he was related to modern man and to neanderthals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the neanderthals share many commonalities with modern man was there potential gene flow between these three populations ?
and what can we learn about phenotypical features - what color hair did he have ?
we 'll look at other kinds of features that we can reconstruct based on dna sequencing .
and who gets to keep the bone once you conclude your research ? whatever 's left of the bone will certainly be sent back to novosibirsk , to the museum responsible for the entire excavation .
that said , it 's not a spectacular bone - it 's only as large as cherry pit .

johannes krause told deutsche welle about his team 's efforts to analyze the ancient dna . the new report was published on the website of science journal " nature " on march 24 .
leipzig researchers johannes krause and svante pääbo of the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology co-authored the international project . deutsche welle : how did you find a bone fragment from the altai mountains ?
johannes krause : for several years , we 've been involved in a very productive collaboration with our colleagues in russia .
we received bones from them that we later identified as neanderthal bones , for example , thus showing that neanderthals lived in southern siberia , too - not just in europe .
and in recent years , we 've received other bone samples for genetic testing .
here in leipzig , we 've taken our neanderthal research to the genetic level , so we 've been examining the dna of ancient man -lrb- ... -rrb- to help us learn how prehistoric man is related to modern-day man or other forms of early man . the neaderthal has their own dna at least for portions of the genome , so they are n't our direct ancestors ; they 're more an extinct cousin of sorts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dna analysis of homonid species could shed light on their ties to modern man and during our search for new neanderthal bones , we stumbled upon these bones with dna that belonged neither to neanderthals nor modern man .
it constitutes a new form of prehistoric man that had never been discovered - something we had never seen from a genetic standpoint and that we could n't categorize as an existing form of prehistoric man .
everyone 's calling this a sensation - would you call it that ?
i think it 's a sensation because until now we had the potential to do genetic research on two different forms of man - now there 's a third .
so that 's pretty sensational , particularly as it ca n't be classified according to any existing form of prehistoric man .
unfortunately , we do n't have a complete skeleton - just the bone from a pinkie finger .
it 's a tiny fragment that ca n't tell us much about the morphology .
therefore we still do n't know what this prehistoric man looked like - did he perhaps look like a neanderthal , modern man or a homo erectus ?
so we lack quite a lot of information , but we now have the potential to study the dna of this prehistoric man ; we have the potential to examine the entire genome and genetic material from this prehistoric man and compare it to modern man and the neanderthals , for instance .
and through that , we can learn a lot .
for example , what kind of interactions occurred between these three species of prehistoric man ?
we could also show that they lived in the same place at the same time - that 's another sensation for us .
that means , we find neanderthal bones in a nearby cave , and in same layer in which we found the bones of the new human form , we find archaeological artifacts that appear to have come from modern man - ornaments and jewelry that are only associated with modern man .
so it looks as though these three forms of early man lived in the same place at the same time .
you can then imagine any number of scenarios where gene flow could have occurred between these three populations , and that is certainly something that 's very interesting to analyze on a genetic level .
is finding something like this an anthropologist 's dream come true ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian researchers discovered the fossil bone at a site in the altai mountains in siberia yes , this is probably a once-in-a-lifetime chance - discovering a new species or form of prehistoric man .
it 's certainly quite exciting for us .
of course , we should note that we 're not calling it a new species - we 're only talking about a new " form . "
so far , we 've only analyzed a tiny portion of the dna , and only when the entire genome or a large part of the genome has been analyzed will we be able to tell whether it 's something completely new or different , like modern man or the neanderthals , for instance .
and until then , we 're not going to talk about a new species .
but all signs indicate that we 're actually dealing with an entirely knew species of man here .
then what do you know already ; whose bones are they ?
so far , we can only say that this dna - the dna we 've studied so far from this prehistoric man - has about 1 million years between it and the dna of modern man .
so that means that these two forms , modern man and prehistoric man , spent at least 1 million years developing in very different ways .
based on our genetic tests , we can also say that modern man is more closely related to the neanderthals than he is to this new form of prehistoric man - we 're seeing two times as many differences between the dna of modern man and this new form than we do with modern man and the neanderthals .
this represents a completely different line that split off from modern man much earlier .

" i think , the west should not directly interfere in iranian domestic affairs , " said kosten . " there has to be rhetorical support and a strict and direct condemnation of all violence against peaceful protests and any breach of international law by parts of the regime in iran .
also , measures like support for free internet use and technical support should be considered .
but direct support , through direct financial aid for example , would be danger for the opposition since they would be immediately charged and outlawed in iran . " meir javedanfar , a middle east analyst and the director for the middle east economic and political analysis -lrb- meepas -rrb- think-tank , agreed that the west should refrain from any direct involvement with the opposition . " if the west were to continue to pressure the iranian regime over human rights and the treatment of protestors , that would be acceptable involvement , " he said . " if the sanctions were to concentrate on the assets of the regime , government-backed companies and manufacturers of armoured vehicles which have been involved in the suppression of the opposition , this would also be acceptable .
but funding and agitation by the west would be counterproductive and would lead to the opposition being labelled as puppets of the west and would justify the hard-line crackdown . " nuclear standoff likely to continue under moderate regime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iran under mousavi would still pursue nuclear ambitions experts believe that the possibility of regime change - peaceful or not - is still within the opposition ’ s reach .
but even if future events result in a moderate leadership taking power in iran , the west 's problems regarding tehran 's nuclear ambitions wo n't just go away .
in fact , while a moderate leadership would be more inclined to engage in talks , the west 's ultimate goal - to prevent iran from having nuclear technology - would still be non-negotiable . " the rhetoric would change and maybe broader negotiations would be more likely , " kosten said .
" however , there is no way to prevent iran from pursuing its civil right to develop nuclear energy .
the islamic republic of iran would not give up this technology , be it ahmadinejad or mousavi as president . " " the pursuit of nuclear technology would continue regardless , " javedanfar added .
" maybe the west would have more success in negotiating with a moderate regime , maybe deals such as third-party enrichment would be agreed to under mousavi or another reformist leader but even regime change wo n't stop iran pursuing nuclear technology - or the option to make a bomb .
this is something even the shah was pursuing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 25.03.2010 erdogan calls for turkish schools in germany and dual citizenship großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 2.7 million people of turkish origin live in germany suggestions by turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan for more turkish schools in germany have been largely rejected by german officials as detrimental to integration . german officials have rejected calls by turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan to introduce turkish schools in germany .
" in turkey , we have german high schools - why should n't there be turkish high schools in germany ? "
erdogan asked in an interview with german weekly die zeit .
erdogan said that many of the almost three million people of turkish origin living in germany had problems with both languages , and offering education in turkish might also help their german .
" germany has not yet caught up with the times , " erdogan said .
" one must first have a firm command of one 's own language , that is to say , turkish , and that is unfortunately rarely the case . "
the federal government 's integration commissioner , maria boehmer , acknowledged the advantage pupils might gain if they could be fluent in two languages , but said learning german should take priority .
" only those who know german have a chance of social advancement , " boehmer , a christian democrat , told the daily berliner zeitung .
the head of the christian democratic party 's german-turkish forum in north-rhine westphalia was also skeptical .
" turkish secondary schools are a dead end for students , " buelent arslan told the daily koelner stadtanzeiger .
" to be successful in germany , a good level of german is essential , " arslan added .
tensions ahead of merkel visit the general secretary of the christian democrat 's bavarian sister party , the csu , said that erdogan was trying to use turkish people in germany to further his own political purposes .
" such demands are an affront in the run-up to his visit with our chancellor angela merkel , " alexander dobrindt told spiegel online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan will meet merkel next week in ankara chancellor angela merkel is due in ankara next monday for a two-day visit .
her relationship with erdogan is problematic , as germany does not favor full eu membership for turkey , calling for a ' privileged partnership ' instead .
turkey has repeatedly rejected anything but full membership in the bloc .
in berlin , which has the largest turkish community in germany , the council for education said the acquisition of turkish language was not necessarily conducive to integration .
it is the knowledge of german that counts , and often , turks in germany struggle to find skilled jobs because of a lack of good german , according to the council .
it also pointed out that there are already turkish grammar schools in germany , but they are privately funded .
some support erdogan 's comments found little support in the german media , but an editorial by daily sueddeutsche zeitung sees some merit in erdogan 's suggestion .
the newspaper pointed out that if more french schools were to be built in germany , it would be hailed as a symbol of franco-german friendship .
but germany seems to have a problem with the turkish language .
it does not " count for much " , according to sueddeutsche .
many companies are desperate to hire people with multiple language skills , so not giving turks the opportunity to study their language in-depth , was a " missed opportunity " , the paper claimed .
no dual citizenship erdogan also criticized the fact that germany does not allow dual citizenship unless the additional country is a member of the eu .
" i find it regrettable that germany is among the countries in the eu that does not allow dual citizenship , " he told die zeit .
a child of foreign parents can only obtain dual citizenship if one parent has lived in germany regularly for at least eight years .
but , at age 23 , the child needs to choose one nationality .
erdogan is no stranger to provocation .
in a speech in cologne in 2008 , erdogan said turks in germany can not be expected to ' assimilate ' and deny their turkish identity .
the comments were seen by many as a direct criticism of how germany treats people of turkish origin. svs / ng / dpa / apn / afp editor : matt hermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in turkey , we have german high schools - why should n't there be turkish high schools in germany ? "
erdogan asked in an interview with german weekly die zeit .
erdogan said that many of the almost three million people of turkish origin living in germany had problems with both languages , and offering education in turkish might also help their german .
" germany has not yet caught up with the times , " erdogan said .
" one must first have a firm command of one 's own language , that is to say , turkish , and that is unfortunately rarely the case . "
the federal government 's integration commissioner , maria boehmer , acknowledged the advantage pupils might gain if they could be fluent in two languages , but said learning german should take priority .
" only those who know german have a chance of social advancement , " boehmer , a christian democrat , told the daily berliner zeitung .
the head of the christian democratic party 's german-turkish forum in north-rhine westphalia was also skeptical .
" turkish secondary schools are a dead end for students , " buelent arslan told the daily koelner stadtanzeiger .
" to be successful in germany , a good level of german is essential , " arslan added .
tensions ahead of merkel visit the general secretary of the christian democrat 's bavarian sister party , the csu , said that erdogan was trying to use turkish people in germany to further his own political purposes .

her relationship with erdogan is problematic , as germany does not favor full eu membership for turkey , calling for a ' privileged partnership ' instead .
turkey has repeatedly rejected anything but full membership in the bloc .
in berlin , which has the largest turkish community in germany , the council for education said the acquisition of turkish language was not necessarily conducive to integration .
it is the knowledge of german that counts , and often , turks in germany struggle to find skilled jobs because of a lack of good german , according to the council .
it also pointed out that there are already turkish grammar schools in germany , but they are privately funded .
some support erdogan 's comments found little support in the german media , but an editorial by daily sueddeutsche zeitung sees some merit in erdogan 's suggestion .
the newspaper pointed out that if more french schools were to be built in germany , it would be hailed as a symbol of franco-german friendship .
but germany seems to have a problem with the turkish language .
it does not " count for much " , according to sueddeutsche .
many companies are desperate to hire people with multiple language skills , so not giving turks the opportunity to study their language in-depth , was a " missed opportunity " , the paper claimed .
no dual citizenship erdogan also criticized the fact that germany does not allow dual citizenship unless the additional country is a member of the eu .
" i find it regrettable that germany is among the countries in the eu that does not allow dual citizenship , " he told die zeit .
a child of foreign parents can only obtain dual citizenship if one parent has lived in germany regularly for at least eight years .
but , at age 23 , the child needs to choose one nationality .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 25.03.2010 tired bayern need to dig deep as their chase for three titles intensifies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's fatigue was evident again at schalke bayern munich reached the german cup final on wednesday night after beating schalke .
with their bundesliga and champions league campaigns still on course , bayern face a punishing end-of-season run . it took something special for bayern munich to beat schalke in their own backyard to reach the german cup final on wednesday night .
dutch international arjen robben looked to be going nowhere when he took off with the ball just inside the schalke half before racing down the right-wing to the corner flag .
one electric injection of pace and direction later , with three defenders flailing in his wake , robben was suddenly in the penalty area lashing a left-footed shot beyond schalke keeper manuel neuer to win the semi-final in style .
although bayern had the lion 's share of possession and the early chances in this tense and sometimes bad tempered meeting , robben 's 112th minute winner was the only flash of real class in the whole game .
and despite having eight minutes to save the tie after the bayern winger scored , it was clear schalke were out as soon as the dutchman 's shot hit the back of the net .
neither team had produced anything as decisive in nearly two hours of soccer .
robben 's act of individual brilliance was a worthy match winner , but the dutchman 's tenth goal of the season certainly put a thick layer of gloss on a rather dull bayern performance .
schalke 's overwhelming emphasis on defense , along with the terrible state of the turf in the veltins arena , gradually sapped bayern 's strength and creativity .
but even the bavarians ' early attempts on goal were far from polished .
energetic robben the exception as bayern labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben stood out from the lethargic pack on wednesday robben was the exception throughout , tirelessly chasing and making runs at schalke defenders .
no-one else , not even the late substitute franck ribery , looked able to summon that kind of energy , which could be a matter of concern in the coming weeks .
" we 're still involved in three competitions and that is emotionally not all that easy for the players , " bayern coach louis van gaal said after wednesday 's semifinal win .
" but we want to be involved in all three competitions , so we will have to come to terms with that . "
with league matches against main title rivals schalke and bayer leverkusen on the horizon , and a make-or-break champions league tie over two legs against manchester united , bayern 's season will likely be decided by the end of april - for better or worse .
the concern settling over munich is that the squad may not be deep enough to survive three consecutive title races .
loan deals force coach 's hand over rising stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal 's faith in young players is being put to the test luke faron , a bayern munich expert with theoffside.com , believes that bayern are beginning to feel the effects of loaning a number of players out to other clubs and promoting youngsters to a first team involved in not only a bundesliga title fight and a lengthy german cup campaign but also european matches of the highest standard .
" loaning brazilian defender breno to nuremberg was a necessary step in continuing his development and in getting the young center back some playing time , " faron told deutsche welle .
loaning left back edson braafheid to celtic was a bit surprising , said faron .
combined with breno 's move , it meant holger badstuber would be the only true reserve center back , in addition to starting at left back .
" with center backs van buyten and demichelis suffering injuries , badstuber had to move back inside and the pressure on the youngster has been intense . "
faron believes that van gaal has been forced to test the faith he had in the young players he brought into replenish the senior side in january , but says the coach has so far - on the whole - been justified in his decisions .
" diego contento and david alaba have both performed admirably in their champions league debuts , " said faron .
" alaba had a very bad final five minutes in frankfurt last weekend and perhaps that showed the limits of the wisdom of playing a 17-year-old natural midfielder out of position in a highly competitive match . "
he said contento had had his hands full with jefferson farfan on wednesday , but that he had coped with the task well enough .
if any player was showing fatigue , said faron , it was forward thomas mueller " it 's a big adjustment for a young player like mueller who has n't even played a full season in the bundesliga before .
add in the champions league and the german cup and the fact he also just made his national team debut , and it 's easy to understand why . "
success from continuity makes coach reluctant to change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the league campaign did not start well under van gaal another factor which is contributing to bayern 's lethargy at this point in the season is van gaal 's commitment to continuity .
when he assumed control at the beginning of the season , it took the dutch coach at least ten matches of tinkering before he settled on his preferred line-up - ten matches during which bayern seemed rudderless and the coach 's credentials were questioned .
once the coach found his formula in november , however , an impressive winning streak began and van gaal has not looked back .
as a result , the dutchman risks wearing out his preferred starting 11 .
as bayern enter a run of decisive matches , time will tell if the squad 's mix of youngsters and stars can maintain top performance .
luke faron believes the bavarian giants have what it takes , regardless of tired legs .
" bayern have a chance against manchester united , but they have to be considered underdogs , " he said . " munich 's defense has not performed at the level necessary to progress further in the competition , though wednesday night 's performance in the cup might be the start of a turnaround . "
the big test , says faron , begins a week from saturday , when bayern face schalke , man united and bayer leverkusen all away from home , within a seven day period .
but thereafter , prospects seem bright .
" after the match in leverkusen they have an exceptionally easy schedule in the league for the last month of the campaign . in addition , they 're getting key players like gomez and demichelis back from injury and that should help during the run-in . i believe bayern will prevail in the bundesliga regardless of how far they progress in the champions league .

with their bundesliga and champions league campaigns still on course , bayern face a punishing end-of-season run . it took something special for bayern munich to beat schalke in their own backyard to reach the german cup final on wednesday night .
dutch international arjen robben looked to be going nowhere when he took off with the ball just inside the schalke half before racing down the right-wing to the corner flag .
one electric injection of pace and direction later , with three defenders flailing in his wake , robben was suddenly in the penalty area lashing a left-footed shot beyond schalke keeper manuel neuer to win the semi-final in style .
although bayern had the lion 's share of possession and the early chances in this tense and sometimes bad tempered meeting , robben 's 112th minute winner was the only flash of real class in the whole game .
and despite having eight minutes to save the tie after the bayern winger scored , it was clear schalke were out as soon as the dutchman 's shot hit the back of the net .
neither team had produced anything as decisive in nearly two hours of soccer .
robben 's act of individual brilliance was a worthy match winner , but the dutchman 's tenth goal of the season certainly put a thick layer of gloss on a rather dull bayern performance .
schalke 's overwhelming emphasis on defense , along with the terrible state of the turf in the veltins arena , gradually sapped bayern 's strength and creativity .
but even the bavarians ' early attempts on goal were far from polished .
energetic robben the exception as bayern labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben stood out from the lethargic pack on wednesday robben was the exception throughout , tirelessly chasing and making runs at schalke defenders .
no-one else , not even the late substitute franck ribery , looked able to summon that kind of energy , which could be a matter of concern in the coming weeks .
" we 're still involved in three competitions and that is emotionally not all that easy for the players , " bayern coach louis van gaal said after wednesday 's semifinal win .
" but we want to be involved in all three competitions , so we will have to come to terms with that . "
with league matches against main title rivals schalke and bayer leverkusen on the horizon , and a make-or-break champions league tie over two legs against manchester united , bayern 's season will likely be decided by the end of april - for better or worse .
the concern settling over munich is that the squad may not be deep enough to survive three consecutive title races .
loan deals force coach 's hand over rising stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal 's faith in young players is being put to the test luke faron , a bayern munich expert with theoffside.com , believes that bayern are beginning to feel the effects of loaning a number of players out to other clubs and promoting youngsters to a first team involved in not only a bundesliga title fight and a lengthy german cup campaign but also european matches of the highest standard .
" loaning brazilian defender breno to nuremberg was a necessary step in continuing his development and in getting the young center back some playing time , " faron told deutsche welle .
loaning left back edson braafheid to celtic was a bit surprising , said faron .
combined with breno 's move , it meant holger badstuber would be the only true reserve center back , in addition to starting at left back .
" with center backs van buyten and demichelis suffering injuries , badstuber had to move back inside and the pressure on the youngster has been intense . "
faron believes that van gaal has been forced to test the faith he had in the young players he brought into replenish the senior side in january , but says the coach has so far - on the whole - been justified in his decisions .
" diego contento and david alaba have both performed admirably in their champions league debuts , " said faron .
" alaba had a very bad final five minutes in frankfurt last weekend and perhaps that showed the limits of the wisdom of playing a 17-year-old natural midfielder out of position in a highly competitive match . "
he said contento had had his hands full with jefferson farfan on wednesday , but that he had coped with the task well enough .
if any player was showing fatigue , said faron , it was forward thomas mueller " it 's a big adjustment for a young player like mueller who has n't even played a full season in the bundesliga before .
add in the champions league and the german cup and the fact he also just made his national team debut , and it 's easy to understand why . "
success from continuity makes coach reluctant to change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the league campaign did not start well under van gaal another factor which is contributing to bayern 's lethargy at this point in the season is van gaal 's commitment to continuity .
when he assumed control at the beginning of the season , it took the dutch coach at least ten matches of tinkering before he settled on his preferred line-up - ten matches during which bayern seemed rudderless and the coach 's credentials were questioned .
once the coach found his formula in november , however , an impressive winning streak began and van gaal has not looked back .
as a result , the dutchman risks wearing out his preferred starting 11 .
as bayern enter a run of decisive matches , time will tell if the squad 's mix of youngsters and stars can maintain top performance .
luke faron believes the bavarian giants have what it takes , regardless of tired legs .
" bayern have a chance against manchester united , but they have to be considered underdogs , " he said . " munich 's defense has not performed at the level necessary to progress further in the competition , though wednesday night 's performance in the cup might be the start of a turnaround . "
the big test , says faron , begins a week from saturday , when bayern face schalke , man united and bayer leverkusen all away from home , within a seven day period .
but thereafter , prospects seem bright .
" after the match in leverkusen they have an exceptionally easy schedule in the league for the last month of the campaign . in addition , they 're getting key players like gomez and demichelis back from injury and that should help during the run-in . i believe bayern will prevail in the bundesliga regardless of how far they progress in the champions league .

but even the bavarians ' early attempts on goal were far from polished .
energetic robben the exception as bayern labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben stood out from the lethargic pack on wednesday robben was the exception throughout , tirelessly chasing and making runs at schalke defenders .
no-one else , not even the late substitute franck ribery , looked able to summon that kind of energy , which could be a matter of concern in the coming weeks .
" we 're still involved in three competitions and that is emotionally not all that easy for the players , " bayern coach louis van gaal said after wednesday 's semifinal win .
" but we want to be involved in all three competitions , so we will have to come to terms with that . "
with league matches against main title rivals schalke and bayer leverkusen on the horizon , and a make-or-break champions league tie over two legs against manchester united , bayern 's season will likely be decided by the end of april - for better or worse .
the concern settling over munich is that the squad may not be deep enough to survive three consecutive title races .
loan deals force coach 's hand over rising stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal 's faith in young players is being put to the test luke faron , a bayern munich expert with theoffside.com , believes that bayern are beginning to feel the effects of loaning a number of players out to other clubs and promoting youngsters to a first team involved in not only a bundesliga title fight and a lengthy german cup campaign but also european matches of the highest standard .
" loaning brazilian defender breno to nuremberg was a necessary step in continuing his development and in getting the young center back some playing time , " faron told deutsche welle .
loaning left back edson braafheid to celtic was a bit surprising , said faron .
combined with breno 's move , it meant holger badstuber would be the only true reserve center back , in addition to starting at left back .
" with center backs van buyten and demichelis suffering injuries , badstuber had to move back inside and the pressure on the youngster has been intense . "
faron believes that van gaal has been forced to test the faith he had in the young players he brought into replenish the senior side in january , but says the coach has so far - on the whole - been justified in his decisions .
" diego contento and david alaba have both performed admirably in their champions league debuts , " said faron .
" alaba had a very bad final five minutes in frankfurt last weekend and perhaps that showed the limits of the wisdom of playing a 17-year-old natural midfielder out of position in a highly competitive match . "
he said contento had had his hands full with jefferson farfan on wednesday , but that he had coped with the task well enough .
if any player was showing fatigue , said faron , it was forward thomas mueller " it 's a big adjustment for a young player like mueller who has n't even played a full season in the bundesliga before .
add in the champions league and the german cup and the fact he also just made his national team debut , and it 's easy to understand why . "
success from continuity makes coach reluctant to change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the league campaign did not start well under van gaal another factor which is contributing to bayern 's lethargy at this point in the season is van gaal 's commitment to continuity .
when he assumed control at the beginning of the season , it took the dutch coach at least ten matches of tinkering before he settled on his preferred line-up - ten matches during which bayern seemed rudderless and the coach 's credentials were questioned .
once the coach found his formula in november , however , an impressive winning streak began and van gaal has not looked back .
as a result , the dutchman risks wearing out his preferred starting 11 .
as bayern enter a run of decisive matches , time will tell if the squad 's mix of youngsters and stars can maintain top performance .
luke faron believes the bavarian giants have what it takes , regardless of tired legs .
" bayern have a chance against manchester united , but they have to be considered underdogs , " he said . " munich 's defense has not performed at the level necessary to progress further in the competition , though wednesday night 's performance in the cup might be the start of a turnaround . "
the big test , says faron , begins a week from saturday , when bayern face schalke , man united and bayer leverkusen all away from home , within a seven day period .
but thereafter , prospects seem bright .
" after the match in leverkusen they have an exceptionally easy schedule in the league for the last month of the campaign . in addition , they 're getting key players like gomez and demichelis back from injury and that should help during the run-in . i believe bayern will prevail in the bundesliga regardless of how far they progress in the champions league .

with their bundesliga and champions league campaigns still on course , bayern face a punishing end-of-season run . it took something special for bayern munich to beat schalke in their own backyard to reach the german cup final on wednesday night .
dutch international arjen robben looked to be going nowhere when he took off with the ball just inside the schalke half before racing down the right-wing to the corner flag .
one electric injection of pace and direction later , with three defenders flailing in his wake , robben was suddenly in the penalty area lashing a left-footed shot beyond schalke keeper manuel neuer to win the semi-final in style .
although bayern had the lion 's share of possession and the early chances in this tense and sometimes bad tempered meeting , robben 's 112th minute winner was the only flash of real class in the whole game .

when he assumed control at the beginning of the season , it took the dutch coach at least ten matches of tinkering before he settled on his preferred line-up - ten matches during which bayern seemed rudderless and the coach 's credentials were questioned .
once the coach found his formula in november , however , an impressive winning streak began and van gaal has not looked back .
as a result , the dutchman risks wearing out his preferred starting 11 .
as bayern enter a run of decisive matches , time will tell if the squad 's mix of youngsters and stars can maintain top performance .
luke faron believes the bavarian giants have what it takes , regardless of tired legs .
" bayern have a chance against manchester united , but they have to be considered underdogs , " he said . " munich 's defense has not performed at the level necessary to progress further in the competition , though wednesday night 's performance in the cup might be the start of a turnaround . "
the big test , says faron , begins a week from saturday , when bayern face schalke , man united and bayer leverkusen all away from home , within a seven day period .
but thereafter , prospects seem bright .
" after the match in leverkusen they have an exceptionally easy schedule in the league for the last month of the campaign . in addition , they 're getting key players like gomez and demichelis back from injury and that should help during the run-in . i believe bayern will prevail in the bundesliga regardless of how far they progress in the champions league .

with their bundesliga and champions league campaigns still on course , bayern face a punishing end-of-season run . it took something special for bayern munich to beat schalke in their own backyard to reach the german cup final on wednesday night .
dutch international arjen robben looked to be going nowhere when he took off with the ball just inside the schalke half before racing down the right-wing to the corner flag .
one electric injection of pace and direction later , with three defenders flailing in his wake , robben was suddenly in the penalty area lashing a left-footed shot beyond schalke keeper manuel neuer to win the semi-final in style .
although bayern had the lion 's share of possession and the early chances in this tense and sometimes bad tempered meeting , robben 's 112th minute winner was the only flash of real class in the whole game .
and despite having eight minutes to save the tie after the bayern winger scored , it was clear schalke were out as soon as the dutchman 's shot hit the back of the net .
neither team had produced anything as decisive in nearly two hours of soccer .
robben 's act of individual brilliance was a worthy match winner , but the dutchman 's tenth goal of the season certainly put a thick layer of gloss on a rather dull bayern performance .
schalke 's overwhelming emphasis on defense , along with the terrible state of the turf in the veltins arena , gradually sapped bayern 's strength and creativity .
but even the bavarians ' early attempts on goal were far from polished .
energetic robben the exception as bayern labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben stood out from the lethargic pack on wednesday robben was the exception throughout , tirelessly chasing and making runs at schalke defenders .
no-one else , not even the late substitute franck ribery , looked able to summon that kind of energy , which could be a matter of concern in the coming weeks .
" we 're still involved in three competitions and that is emotionally not all that easy for the players , " bayern coach louis van gaal said after wednesday 's semifinal win .
" but we want to be involved in all three competitions , so we will have to come to terms with that . "
with league matches against main title rivals schalke and bayer leverkusen on the horizon , and a make-or-break champions league tie over two legs against manchester united , bayern 's season will likely be decided by the end of april - for better or worse .
the concern settling over munich is that the squad may not be deep enough to survive three consecutive title races .
loan deals force coach 's hand over rising stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal 's faith in young players is being put to the test luke faron , a bayern munich expert with theoffside.com , believes that bayern are beginning to feel the effects of loaning a number of players out to other clubs and promoting youngsters to a first team involved in not only a bundesliga title fight and a lengthy german cup campaign but also european matches of the highest standard .
" loaning brazilian defender breno to nuremberg was a necessary step in continuing his development and in getting the young center back some playing time , " faron told deutsche welle .
loaning left back edson braafheid to celtic was a bit surprising , said faron .
combined with breno 's move , it meant holger badstuber would be the only true reserve center back , in addition to starting at left back .
" with center backs van buyten and demichelis suffering injuries , badstuber had to move back inside and the pressure on the youngster has been intense . "
faron believes that van gaal has been forced to test the faith he had in the young players he brought into replenish the senior side in january , but says the coach has so far - on the whole - been justified in his decisions .
" diego contento and david alaba have both performed admirably in their champions league debuts , " said faron .
" alaba had a very bad final five minutes in frankfurt last weekend and perhaps that showed the limits of the wisdom of playing a 17-year-old natural midfielder out of position in a highly competitive match . "
he said contento had had his hands full with jefferson farfan on wednesday , but that he had coped with the task well enough .
if any player was showing fatigue , said faron , it was forward thomas mueller " it 's a big adjustment for a young player like mueller who has n't even played a full season in the bundesliga before .
add in the champions league and the german cup and the fact he also just made his national team debut , and it 's easy to understand why . "
success from continuity makes coach reluctant to change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the league campaign did not start well under van gaal another factor which is contributing to bayern 's lethargy at this point in the season is van gaal 's commitment to continuity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 25.03.2010 latest priest sex abuse scandal heats up responsibility debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as cardinal , ratzinger was informed but failed to act in the murphy case as the latest sexual abuse scandal in the catholic church gets uncomfortably close to the pope , questions of punishment versus apology in dealing with pedophile priests have once again emerged . the catholic church says the only way to face the burgeoning numbers of accusations is with complete honesty - and by urging victims to take legal action .
meanwhile , activists say the church should take more responsibility for its wayward leaders .
either way , the situation surrounding sexual abuse scandals in the catholic church is like a modern-day hydra myth - no sooner is one scandal addressed than another rises up to take its place .
with europe 's catholics still reeling from a series of alleged child-molestation cover-ups , news broke in the united states of a 1996 case that touches the upper echelons of church power .
failure to defrock in the latest case to hit headlines , the new york times reported on thursday that pope benedict xvi ignored allegations of child sex abuse back in the 1990s .
at the time , he was head of the congregation of the doctrine of the faith , the vatican body that judges cases of sexual abuse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victims recently took to the streets of the vatican to protest the paper reported that the pope - then cardinal joseph ratzinger - failed to defrock rev. lawrence murphy , a priest in milwaukee who had been accused of sexually abusing some 200 deaf boys , despite the fact that he was aware of the allegations .
murphy worked from 1950 to 1977 at a school for the deaf and died in 1998 .
a spokesman for the vatican , federico lombardi , argued that rome was n't informed of the case until 20 years after it happened , and said that in the end the church did n't take action against murphy because he had confessed the acts and because he was very ill and close to the end of his life .
records uncovered by the times show that three different bishops were aware of the accusations , but that the case was not brought to trial .
still , lombardi told news service reuters that the church is eager to see abusive priests brought to justice .
church calls in professional help this is a feeling shared by christoph heckeley , a spokesman for the archbishopric of cologne , germany .
the catholic church in germany has had a directive for the past eight years that urges prosecution in sex abuse cases , heckeley told deutsche welle .
" since 2002 we have a directive from the german bishops conference that says what you have to do in case sexual abuse is suspected , " heckeley said .
people with complaints are referred to professionals - psychologists , doctors and legal experts - who are hired by each bishopric , and are qualified to advise people who want to come forward with sex abuse allegations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abuse allegedly took place at some german jesuit schools " our aim is to listen to the victims and help them get justice , even when the cases are years or decades old .
they need somebody to listen to them , and the most important thing is that they get justice , " he said .
the response from the church will differ case by case , but the church " urgently advises " victims to take perpetrators to court .
unfortunately , heckeley said , victims often do n't want to do this because it can be too upsetting to their families , and " can destroy their entire social environment - it can traumatize them a second time .
you have to be careful . "
prosecution is a right , not an obligation while there is a right to prosecute , there is no obligation to do so - a situation that is currently under hot debate .
still , heckeley said experts recommend caution , since " the dangers -lrb- of forced prosecution -rrb- could outweigh the risks . "
no matter what shape the case takes in federal court , allegations of abuse are always looked into by a church tribunal out of rome .
yet in the murphy case , ratzinger 's deputy at the time advised a secret disciplinary trial at first .
he later reversed that decision , and in 1998 , murphy appealed directly to ratzinger for clemency , shortly before he died .
all the calls for openness , trials and apologies are well and good , victims-rights advocates say , but they do n't go far enough .
what is missing on the part of the church is a departure from the secrecy , and a willingness to admit its own cover-ups .
last week , following revelations of pedophilia that rocked the irish catholic church , the pope issued a long-awaited apology to victims of child sex abuse in ireland .
he acknowledged " serious mistakes " on the part of the church , as well as the sense of betrayal in the church felt by victims and their families .
victims ' groups start protests but irish victims ' groups felt that the apology fell short of their demands ; they called for the church to acknowledge its role in covering up abuse .
maeve lewis , executive director of irish victims ' rights group one in four , told bbc news , " we are really disappointed that there is no acknowledgement that the cover-up and the policy of cover-up in the church went right to the the vatican . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope finally addressed the cases of abuse in ireland and in germany , victims-rights advocates were incensed that the apology failed to mention cases of church pedophilia in munich that have dominated headlines for weeks .
the church has had to contend with cover-up allegations in that city while ratzinger was the city 's archbishop from 1977 to 1981 .
on thursday members of the us activist organization snap - survivor network of those abused by priests - launched a demonstration in the vatican , holding up signs that said " stop the secrecy now . "
they demanded that pope benedict open up all files on pedophile catholic clerics worldwide , and called for all " predator priests " to be defrocked .
the group has also protested in germany , austria , and the netherlands , all countries recently hit by church sex abuse scandals .
one official 's stance " i would ask the pope if he would please open up the files from the congregation of the doctrine of the faith and turn over all the information to the police , " barbara blaine , the president of snap , told reuters news service .
a trickle of acknowledgements have begun , and some say a wave may be coming .
earlier this month , the german church 's representative responsible for dealing with cases of abuse , bishop stephan ackermann , also acknowledged severe failures .
" where there was no will toward explanation and where the person who committed the crime was simply moved to a new post , we have to admit , in a whole array of cases , that there was a cover-up , " he told the rhein zeitung newspaper .
and this week , german news magazine focus reported that archbishop zollitsch , the leader of the german roman catholic church , also admitted cases of child sex abuse were known and covered up .
" yes , we did have that , " he said .
many see the catholic church as so damaged by these allegations that it will be hard for the institution to regain its footing .
" we can only survive this situation with openness and honesty , " says the cologne archbishopric 's heckeley .
" we have to try to win people 's trust that way . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abuse allegedly took place at some german jesuit schools " our aim is to listen to the victims and help them get justice , even when the cases are years or decades old .
they need somebody to listen to them , and the most important thing is that they get justice , " he said .
the response from the church will differ case by case , but the church " urgently advises " victims to take perpetrators to court .
unfortunately , heckeley said , victims often do n't want to do this because it can be too upsetting to their families , and " can destroy their entire social environment - it can traumatize them a second time .
you have to be careful . "
prosecution is a right , not an obligation while there is a right to prosecute , there is no obligation to do so - a situation that is currently under hot debate .
still , heckeley said experts recommend caution , since " the dangers -lrb- of forced prosecution -rrb- could outweigh the risks . "
no matter what shape the case takes in federal court , allegations of abuse are always looked into by a church tribunal out of rome .
yet in the murphy case , ratzinger 's deputy at the time advised a secret disciplinary trial at first .
he later reversed that decision , and in 1998 , murphy appealed directly to ratzinger for clemency , shortly before he died .
all the calls for openness , trials and apologies are well and good , victims-rights advocates say , but they do n't go far enough .
what is missing on the part of the church is a departure from the secrecy , and a willingness to admit its own cover-ups .
last week , following revelations of pedophilia that rocked the irish catholic church , the pope issued a long-awaited apology to victims of child sex abuse in ireland .
he acknowledged " serious mistakes " on the part of the church , as well as the sense of betrayal in the church felt by victims and their families .
victims ' groups start protests but irish victims ' groups felt that the apology fell short of their demands ; they called for the church to acknowledge its role in covering up abuse .
maeve lewis , executive director of irish victims ' rights group one in four , told bbc news , " we are really disappointed that there is no acknowledgement that the cover-up and the policy of cover-up in the church went right to the the vatican . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope finally addressed the cases of abuse in ireland and in germany , victims-rights advocates were incensed that the apology failed to mention cases of church pedophilia in munich that have dominated headlines for weeks .
the church has had to contend with cover-up allegations in that city while ratzinger was the city 's archbishop from 1977 to 1981 .
on thursday members of the us activist organization snap - survivor network of those abused by priests - launched a demonstration in the vatican , holding up signs that said " stop the secrecy now . "
they demanded that pope benedict open up all files on pedophile catholic clerics worldwide , and called for all " predator priests " to be defrocked .
the group has also protested in germany , austria , and the netherlands , all countries recently hit by church sex abuse scandals .
one official 's stance " i would ask the pope if he would please open up the files from the congregation of the doctrine of the faith and turn over all the information to the police , " barbara blaine , the president of snap , told reuters news service .
a trickle of acknowledgements have begun , and some say a wave may be coming .
earlier this month , the german church 's representative responsible for dealing with cases of abuse , bishop stephan ackermann , also acknowledged severe failures .
" where there was no will toward explanation and where the person who committed the crime was simply moved to a new post , we have to admit , in a whole array of cases , that there was a cover-up , " he told the rhein zeitung newspaper .
and this week , german news magazine focus reported that archbishop zollitsch , the leader of the german roman catholic church , also admitted cases of child sex abuse were known and covered up .
" yes , we did have that , " he said .
many see the catholic church as so damaged by these allegations that it will be hard for the institution to regain its footing .
" we can only survive this situation with openness and honesty , " says the cologne archbishopric 's heckeley .
" we have to try to win people 's trust that way . "

meanwhile , activists say the church should take more responsibility for its wayward leaders .
either way , the situation surrounding sexual abuse scandals in the catholic church is like a modern-day hydra myth - no sooner is one scandal addressed than another rises up to take its place .
with europe 's catholics still reeling from a series of alleged child-molestation cover-ups , news broke in the united states of a 1996 case that touches the upper echelons of church power .
failure to defrock in the latest case to hit headlines , the new york times reported on thursday that pope benedict xvi ignored allegations of child sex abuse back in the 1990s .
at the time , he was head of the congregation of the doctrine of the faith , the vatican body that judges cases of sexual abuse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victims recently took to the streets of the vatican to protest the paper reported that the pope - then cardinal joseph ratzinger - failed to defrock rev. lawrence murphy , a priest in milwaukee who had been accused of sexually abusing some 200 deaf boys , despite the fact that he was aware of the allegations .
murphy worked from 1950 to 1977 at a school for the deaf and died in 1998 .
a spokesman for the vatican , federico lombardi , argued that rome was n't informed of the case until 20 years after it happened , and said that in the end the church did n't take action against murphy because he had confessed the acts and because he was very ill and close to the end of his life .
records uncovered by the times show that three different bishops were aware of the accusations , but that the case was not brought to trial .
still , lombardi told news service reuters that the church is eager to see abusive priests brought to justice .
church calls in professional help this is a feeling shared by christoph heckeley , a spokesman for the archbishopric of cologne , germany .
the catholic church in germany has had a directive for the past eight years that urges prosecution in sex abuse cases , heckeley told deutsche welle .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope finally addressed the cases of abuse in ireland and in germany , victims-rights advocates were incensed that the apology failed to mention cases of church pedophilia in munich that have dominated headlines for weeks .
the church has had to contend with cover-up allegations in that city while ratzinger was the city 's archbishop from 1977 to 1981 .
on thursday members of the us activist organization snap - survivor network of those abused by priests - launched a demonstration in the vatican , holding up signs that said " stop the secrecy now . "
they demanded that pope benedict open up all files on pedophile catholic clerics worldwide , and called for all " predator priests " to be defrocked .
the group has also protested in germany , austria , and the netherlands , all countries recently hit by church sex abuse scandals .
one official 's stance " i would ask the pope if he would please open up the files from the congregation of the doctrine of the faith and turn over all the information to the police , " barbara blaine , the president of snap , told reuters news service .
a trickle of acknowledgements have begun , and some say a wave may be coming .
earlier this month , the german church 's representative responsible for dealing with cases of abuse , bishop stephan ackermann , also acknowledged severe failures .
" where there was no will toward explanation and where the person who committed the crime was simply moved to a new post , we have to admit , in a whole array of cases , that there was a cover-up , " he told the rhein zeitung newspaper .
and this week , german news magazine focus reported that archbishop zollitsch , the leader of the german roman catholic church , also admitted cases of child sex abuse were known and covered up .
" yes , we did have that , " he said .
many see the catholic church as so damaged by these allegations that it will be hard for the institution to regain its footing .
" we can only survive this situation with openness and honesty , " says the cologne archbishopric 's heckeley .
" we have to try to win people 's trust that way . "

meanwhile , activists say the church should take more responsibility for its wayward leaders .
either way , the situation surrounding sexual abuse scandals in the catholic church is like a modern-day hydra myth - no sooner is one scandal addressed than another rises up to take its place .
with europe 's catholics still reeling from a series of alleged child-molestation cover-ups , news broke in the united states of a 1996 case that touches the upper echelons of church power .
failure to defrock in the latest case to hit headlines , the new york times reported on thursday that pope benedict xvi ignored allegations of child sex abuse back in the 1990s .
at the time , he was head of the congregation of the doctrine of the faith , the vatican body that judges cases of sexual abuse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victims recently took to the streets of the vatican to protest the paper reported that the pope - then cardinal joseph ratzinger - failed to defrock rev. lawrence murphy , a priest in milwaukee who had been accused of sexually abusing some 200 deaf boys , despite the fact that he was aware of the allegations .
murphy worked from 1950 to 1977 at a school for the deaf and died in 1998 .
a spokesman for the vatican , federico lombardi , argued that rome was n't informed of the case until 20 years after it happened , and said that in the end the church did n't take action against murphy because he had confessed the acts and because he was very ill and close to the end of his life .
records uncovered by the times show that three different bishops were aware of the accusations , but that the case was not brought to trial .
still , lombardi told news service reuters that the church is eager to see abusive priests brought to justice .
church calls in professional help this is a feeling shared by christoph heckeley , a spokesman for the archbishopric of cologne , germany .
the catholic church in germany has had a directive for the past eight years that urges prosecution in sex abuse cases , heckeley told deutsche welle .
" since 2002 we have a directive from the german bishops conference that says what you have to do in case sexual abuse is suspected , " heckeley said .
people with complaints are referred to professionals - psychologists , doctors and legal experts - who are hired by each bishopric , and are qualified to advise people who want to come forward with sex abuse allegations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abuse allegedly took place at some german jesuit schools " our aim is to listen to the victims and help them get justice , even when the cases are years or decades old .
they need somebody to listen to them , and the most important thing is that they get justice , " he said .
the response from the church will differ case by case , but the church " urgently advises " victims to take perpetrators to court .
unfortunately , heckeley said , victims often do n't want to do this because it can be too upsetting to their families , and " can destroy their entire social environment - it can traumatize them a second time .
you have to be careful . "
prosecution is a right , not an obligation while there is a right to prosecute , there is no obligation to do so - a situation that is currently under hot debate .
still , heckeley said experts recommend caution , since " the dangers -lrb- of forced prosecution -rrb- could outweigh the risks . "
no matter what shape the case takes in federal court , allegations of abuse are always looked into by a church tribunal out of rome .
yet in the murphy case , ratzinger 's deputy at the time advised a secret disciplinary trial at first .
he later reversed that decision , and in 1998 , murphy appealed directly to ratzinger for clemency , shortly before he died .
all the calls for openness , trials and apologies are well and good , victims-rights advocates say , but they do n't go far enough .
what is missing on the part of the church is a departure from the secrecy , and a willingness to admit its own cover-ups .
last week , following revelations of pedophilia that rocked the irish catholic church , the pope issued a long-awaited apology to victims of child sex abuse in ireland .
he acknowledged " serious mistakes " on the part of the church , as well as the sense of betrayal in the church felt by victims and their families .
victims ' groups start protests but irish victims ' groups felt that the apology fell short of their demands ; they called for the church to acknowledge its role in covering up abuse .
maeve lewis , executive director of irish victims ' rights group one in four , told bbc news , " we are really disappointed that there is no acknowledgement that the cover-up and the policy of cover-up in the church went right to the the vatican . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 25.03.2010 latest priest sex abuse scandal heats up responsibility debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as cardinal , ratzinger was informed but failed to act in the murphy case as the latest sexual abuse scandal in the catholic church gets uncomfortably close to the pope , questions of punishment versus apology in dealing with pedophile priests have once again emerged . the catholic church says the only way to face the burgeoning numbers of accusations is with complete honesty - and by urging victims to take legal action .
meanwhile , activists say the church should take more responsibility for its wayward leaders .
either way , the situation surrounding sexual abuse scandals in the catholic church is like a modern-day hydra myth - no sooner is one scandal addressed than another rises up to take its place .
with europe 's catholics still reeling from a series of alleged child-molestation cover-ups , news broke in the united states of a 1996 case that touches the upper echelons of church power .
failure to defrock in the latest case to hit headlines , the new york times reported on thursday that pope benedict xvi ignored allegations of child sex abuse back in the 1990s .
at the time , he was head of the congregation of the doctrine of the faith , the vatican body that judges cases of sexual abuse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victims recently took to the streets of the vatican to protest the paper reported that the pope - then cardinal joseph ratzinger - failed to defrock rev. lawrence murphy , a priest in milwaukee who had been accused of sexually abusing some 200 deaf boys , despite the fact that he was aware of the allegations .
murphy worked from 1950 to 1977 at a school for the deaf and died in 1998 .
a spokesman for the vatican , federico lombardi , argued that rome was n't informed of the case until 20 years after it happened , and said that in the end the church did n't take action against murphy because he had confessed the acts and because he was very ill and close to the end of his life .
records uncovered by the times show that three different bishops were aware of the accusations , but that the case was not brought to trial .
still , lombardi told news service reuters that the church is eager to see abusive priests brought to justice .
church calls in professional help this is a feeling shared by christoph heckeley , a spokesman for the archbishopric of cologne , germany .
the catholic church in germany has had a directive for the past eight years that urges prosecution in sex abuse cases , heckeley told deutsche welle .
" since 2002 we have a directive from the german bishops conference that says what you have to do in case sexual abuse is suspected , " heckeley said .
people with complaints are referred to professionals - psychologists , doctors and legal experts - who are hired by each bishopric , and are qualified to advise people who want to come forward with sex abuse allegations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abuse allegedly took place at some german jesuit schools " our aim is to listen to the victims and help them get justice , even when the cases are years or decades old .
they need somebody to listen to them , and the most important thing is that they get justice , " he said .
the response from the church will differ case by case , but the church " urgently advises " victims to take perpetrators to court .
unfortunately , heckeley said , victims often do n't want to do this because it can be too upsetting to their families , and " can destroy their entire social environment - it can traumatize them a second time .
you have to be careful . "
prosecution is a right , not an obligation while there is a right to prosecute , there is no obligation to do so - a situation that is currently under hot debate .
still , heckeley said experts recommend caution , since " the dangers -lrb- of forced prosecution -rrb- could outweigh the risks . "
no matter what shape the case takes in federal court , allegations of abuse are always looked into by a church tribunal out of rome .
yet in the murphy case , ratzinger 's deputy at the time advised a secret disciplinary trial at first .
he later reversed that decision , and in 1998 , murphy appealed directly to ratzinger for clemency , shortly before he died .
all the calls for openness , trials and apologies are well and good , victims-rights advocates say , but they do n't go far enough .
what is missing on the part of the church is a departure from the secrecy , and a willingness to admit its own cover-ups .
last week , following revelations of pedophilia that rocked the irish catholic church , the pope issued a long-awaited apology to victims of child sex abuse in ireland .
he acknowledged " serious mistakes " on the part of the church , as well as the sense of betrayal in the church felt by victims and their families .
victims ' groups start protests but irish victims ' groups felt that the apology fell short of their demands ; they called for the church to acknowledge its role in covering up abuse .
maeve lewis , executive director of irish victims ' rights group one in four , told bbc news , " we are really disappointed that there is no acknowledgement that the cover-up and the policy of cover-up in the church went right to the the vatican . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope finally addressed the cases of abuse in ireland and in germany , victims-rights advocates were incensed that the apology failed to mention cases of church pedophilia in munich that have dominated headlines for weeks .
the church has had to contend with cover-up allegations in that city while ratzinger was the city 's archbishop from 1977 to 1981 .
on thursday members of the us activist organization snap - survivor network of those abused by priests - launched a demonstration in the vatican , holding up signs that said " stop the secrecy now . "
they demanded that pope benedict open up all files on pedophile catholic clerics worldwide , and called for all " predator priests " to be defrocked .
the group has also protested in germany , austria , and the netherlands , all countries recently hit by church sex abuse scandals .
one official 's stance " i would ask the pope if he would please open up the files from the congregation of the doctrine of the faith and turn over all the information to the police , " barbara blaine , the president of snap , told reuters news service .
a trickle of acknowledgements have begun , and some say a wave may be coming .
earlier this month , the german church 's representative responsible for dealing with cases of abuse , bishop stephan ackermann , also acknowledged severe failures .
" where there was no will toward explanation and where the person who committed the crime was simply moved to a new post , we have to admit , in a whole array of cases , that there was a cover-up , " he told the rhein zeitung newspaper .
and this week , german news magazine focus reported that archbishop zollitsch , the leader of the german roman catholic church , also admitted cases of child sex abuse were known and covered up .
" yes , we did have that , " he said .
many see the catholic church as so damaged by these allegations that it will be hard for the institution to regain its footing .
" we can only survive this situation with openness and honesty , " says the cologne archbishopric 's heckeley .
" we have to try to win people 's trust that way . "

as iran continues to develop its nuclear program , analysts fear that an arms race in the middle east could begin .
if sanctions continue to fail , these analysts say that military action is necessary to prevent this . as world powers negotiate on how to deal with iran 's continuing development of its nuclear program , concerns about a nuclear arms race in the middle east , prompted by iran 's determination to build nuclear weapons , are mounting .
officials from the united states , russia , france , britain , germany and china participated in a conference call yesterday to discuss how to handle iran 's flaunting of international demands to cease nuclear work .
these countries , while attempting to deter iran from continued nuclear development by offering tehran incentives to allow more oversight of its program , are also threatening sanctions if tehran does not stop work toward producing weapons grade uranium . iran , which has faced sanctions from the united nations three times , says it is developing its nuclear program for peaceful purposes and has refused to allow inspectors from the international atomic energy agency access to its nuclear facilities .
it is party to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty , but repeatedly has been found non-compliant .
there is growing fear that iran will not stop work toward a weapon unless drastic action is taken .
middle east experts said that if iran continues on its current path , a nuclear arms race in the region could ensue . ' ' turkey , algeria , egypt , and saudi arabia are all potential candidates to develop nuclear weapons , " abdulaziz sager , chairman of the gulf research center in dubai , told deutsche welle .
' ' and they will say , if -lsb- nuclear weapon development -rsb- is permitted in iran , why ca n't we develop weapons as well ? "
a threat beyond israel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has called for the destruction of israel .
a nuclear-armed iran is widely seen as a direct threat to israel , as iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has pledged to ' ' wipe israel off the map . "
israel has not ruled out preemptive strikes against suspected nuclear sites inside iran if development continues .
but iran 's possession of a nuclear weapon has implications for other countries in the region as well , mustafa alani , senior advisor and program director at the gulf research center says .
' ' the question is not whether iran uses the bomb against other countries in the middle east , " alani told deutsche welle .
' ' but the question is whether iran has control of the region , and the political consequences of a dominant iran . "
the political balance of power in the middle east at the current time is relatively stable .
israel has a dominant military and nuclear weapons , as well as the backing of the united states .
economic power is diversified , as a number of states have thriving oil industries .
the region is also politically stable , with the exception of iraq , which is trying to sustain a functioning government in the wake of the iraq war .
a nuclear-armed and increasingly belligerent iran would dramatically alter this balance .
ahmadinejad would hold disproportionate clout , and if recent belligerent statements toward israel are to be believed , seems to be willing to use it .
preemption vs. nuclear war in the past , analysts have told deutsche welle that israel is unlikely to carry out unilateral military action against iran , as any action is not likely to destroy iran 's entire nuclear infrastructure .
last month , chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff admiral mike mullen told congress ' ' no strike , however effective , will be in and of itself decisive . "
however , the gulf center 's sager says that if economic sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a convoy of israeli military armored vehicles on the gaza strip. continue to fail , preemptive military action to stop iran from acquiring nuclear weapons is needed .
the power iran would have would be too great and too much of a risk to the region . ' ' if i had to chose between living with iran as a constant threat , or a military strike with limited retaliation , i can more easily live with the military option , " he said .
' ' we have already lived through wars , and no countries were erased from the map . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 25.03.2010 iran 's nuclear work brings fear of mideast arms race großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad at iran 's nuclear enrichment facility in natanz .
as iran continues to develop its nuclear program , analysts fear that an arms race in the middle east could begin .
if sanctions continue to fail , these analysts say that military action is necessary to prevent this . as world powers negotiate on how to deal with iran 's continuing development of its nuclear program , concerns about a nuclear arms race in the middle east , prompted by iran 's determination to build nuclear weapons , are mounting .
officials from the united states , russia , france , britain , germany and china participated in a conference call yesterday to discuss how to handle iran 's flaunting of international demands to cease nuclear work .
these countries , while attempting to deter iran from continued nuclear development by offering tehran incentives to allow more oversight of its program , are also threatening sanctions if tehran does not stop work toward producing weapons grade uranium . iran , which has faced sanctions from the united nations three times , says it is developing its nuclear program for peaceful purposes and has refused to allow inspectors from the international atomic energy agency access to its nuclear facilities .
it is party to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty , but repeatedly has been found non-compliant .
there is growing fear that iran will not stop work toward a weapon unless drastic action is taken .
middle east experts said that if iran continues on its current path , a nuclear arms race in the region could ensue . ' ' turkey , algeria , egypt , and saudi arabia are all potential candidates to develop nuclear weapons , " abdulaziz sager , chairman of the gulf research center in dubai , told deutsche welle .
' ' and they will say , if -lsb- nuclear weapon development -rsb- is permitted in iran , why ca n't we develop weapons as well ? "
a threat beyond israel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has called for the destruction of israel .
a nuclear-armed iran is widely seen as a direct threat to israel , as iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has pledged to ' ' wipe israel off the map . "
israel has not ruled out preemptive strikes against suspected nuclear sites inside iran if development continues .
but iran 's possession of a nuclear weapon has implications for other countries in the region as well , mustafa alani , senior advisor and program director at the gulf research center says .
' ' the question is not whether iran uses the bomb against other countries in the middle east , " alani told deutsche welle .
' ' but the question is whether iran has control of the region , and the political consequences of a dominant iran . "
the political balance of power in the middle east at the current time is relatively stable .
israel has a dominant military and nuclear weapons , as well as the backing of the united states .
economic power is diversified , as a number of states have thriving oil industries .
the region is also politically stable , with the exception of iraq , which is trying to sustain a functioning government in the wake of the iraq war .
a nuclear-armed and increasingly belligerent iran would dramatically alter this balance .
ahmadinejad would hold disproportionate clout , and if recent belligerent statements toward israel are to be believed , seems to be willing to use it .
preemption vs. nuclear war in the past , analysts have told deutsche welle that israel is unlikely to carry out unilateral military action against iran , as any action is not likely to destroy iran 's entire nuclear infrastructure .
last month , chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff admiral mike mullen told congress ' ' no strike , however effective , will be in and of itself decisive . "
however , the gulf center 's sager says that if economic sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a convoy of israeli military armored vehicles on the gaza strip. continue to fail , preemptive military action to stop iran from acquiring nuclear weapons is needed .
the power iran would have would be too great and too much of a risk to the region . ' ' if i had to chose between living with iran as a constant threat , or a military strike with limited retaliation , i can more easily live with the military option , " he said .
' ' we have already lived through wars , and no countries were erased from the map . "

the two leaders worked out the plan in face-to-face talks immediately before an eu summit was set to begin on thursday evening in brussels .
the agreement would allow eurozone countries to offer greece bilateral loans .
the international monetary fund would also be involved , providing additional support in exchange for fiscal reforms in athens .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de research -pipe- 25.03.2010 german researchers decode unrecognized dna from ancient humanoid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists analyzed dna from a fossil finger found in siberia when researchers discovered a fossil finger in a siberian cave , they found an ancestor - and perhaps a new human species .
johannes krause told deutsche welle about his team 's efforts to analyze the ancient dna . the new report was published on the website of science journal " nature " on march 24 .
leipzig researchers johannes krause and svante pääbo of the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology co-authored the international project . deutsche welle : how did you find a bone fragment from the altai mountains ?
johannes krause : for several years , we 've been involved in a very productive collaboration with our colleagues in russia .
we received bones from them that we later identified as neanderthal bones , for example , thus showing that neanderthals lived in southern siberia , too - not just in europe .
and in recent years , we 've received other bone samples for genetic testing .
here in leipzig , we 've taken our neanderthal research to the genetic level , so we 've been examining the dna of ancient man -lrb- ... -rrb- to help us learn how prehistoric man is related to modern-day man or other forms of early man . the neaderthal has their own dna at least for portions of the genome , so they are n't our direct ancestors ; they 're more an extinct cousin of sorts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dna analysis of homonid species could shed light on their ties to modern man and during our search for new neanderthal bones , we stumbled upon these bones with dna that belonged neither to neanderthals nor modern man .
it constitutes a new form of prehistoric man that had never been discovered - something we had never seen from a genetic standpoint and that we could n't categorize as an existing form of prehistoric man .
everyone 's calling this a sensation - would you call it that ?
i think it 's a sensation because until now we had the potential to do genetic research on two different forms of man - now there 's a third .
so that 's pretty sensational , particularly as it ca n't be classified according to any existing form of prehistoric man .
unfortunately , we do n't have a complete skeleton - just the bone from a pinkie finger .
it 's a tiny fragment that ca n't tell us much about the morphology .
therefore we still do n't know what this prehistoric man looked like - did he perhaps look like a neanderthal , modern man or a homo erectus ?
so we lack quite a lot of information , but we now have the potential to study the dna of this prehistoric man ; we have the potential to examine the entire genome and genetic material from this prehistoric man and compare it to modern man and the neanderthals , for instance .
and through that , we can learn a lot .
for example , what kind of interactions occurred between these three species of prehistoric man ?
we could also show that they lived in the same place at the same time - that 's another sensation for us .
that means , we find neanderthal bones in a nearby cave , and in same layer in which we found the bones of the new human form , we find archaeological artifacts that appear to have come from modern man - ornaments and jewelry that are only associated with modern man .
so it looks as though these three forms of early man lived in the same place at the same time .
you can then imagine any number of scenarios where gene flow could have occurred between these three populations , and that is certainly something that 's very interesting to analyze on a genetic level .
is finding something like this an anthropologist 's dream come true ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian researchers discovered the fossil bone at a site in the altai mountains in siberia yes , this is probably a once-in-a-lifetime chance - discovering a new species or form of prehistoric man .
it 's certainly quite exciting for us .
of course , we should note that we 're not calling it a new species - we 're only talking about a new " form . "
so far , we 've only analyzed a tiny portion of the dna , and only when the entire genome or a large part of the genome has been analyzed will we be able to tell whether it 's something completely new or different , like modern man or the neanderthals , for instance .
and until then , we 're not going to talk about a new species .
but all signs indicate that we 're actually dealing with an entirely knew species of man here .
then what do you know already ; whose bones are they ?
so far , we can only say that this dna - the dna we 've studied so far from this prehistoric man - has about 1 million years between it and the dna of modern man .
so that means that these two forms , modern man and prehistoric man , spent at least 1 million years developing in very different ways .
based on our genetic tests , we can also say that modern man is more closely related to the neanderthals than he is to this new form of prehistoric man - we 're seeing two times as many differences between the dna of modern man and this new form than we do with modern man and the neanderthals .
this represents a completely different line that split off from modern man much earlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mitochondrial dna decoding showed differences between the ancestor and modern man do you know if it was a woman or a man ?
we 've named it " x woman . "
" x " stands for the unknown , since we ca n't classify it so easiliy , as i 'd mentioned . and " woman " because we examined the mitochondrial dna - the dna from the powerhouse of the cell - and that 's always passed down from the mother to the child .
so we 're looking at the female lineage , and so we adopted a feministic position .
but since we have yet to examine the entire genetic material , we still do n't know whether it 's a man or a woman .
and this process for examining the mitochrondrial dna - that 's something you developed ?
yes , my boss svante pääbo studied mitochrondrial dna from prehistoric man for the first time in the ' 90s - at the time , from neanderthals .
in recent years , we have refined these methods to help us obtain more information more quickly - and of a higher qualitative value .
but we 've really kicked this kind of research into high gear in recent years .
what 's next ?
what else do you plan to study - and what do you hope to find ?
we plan to study the entire genome - this prehistoric man 's entire genetic material .
we do n't just want to look at this tiny fraction , rather we will examine the entire genome to learn more about this prehistoric man and to see how he was related to modern man and to neanderthals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the neanderthals share many commonalities with modern man was there potential gene flow between these three populations ?
and what can we learn about phenotypical features - what color hair did he have ?
we 'll look at other kinds of features that we can reconstruct based on dna sequencing .
and who gets to keep the bone once you conclude your research ? whatever 's left of the bone will certainly be sent back to novosibirsk , to the museum responsible for the entire excavation .
that said , it 's not a spectacular bone - it 's only as large as cherry pit .
so it 's a very tiny fragment and it might not be all that interesting to look at .

then what do you know already ; whose bones are they ?
so far , we can only say that this dna - the dna we 've studied so far from this prehistoric man - has about 1 million years between it and the dna of modern man .
so that means that these two forms , modern man and prehistoric man , spent at least 1 million years developing in very different ways .
based on our genetic tests , we can also say that modern man is more closely related to the neanderthals than he is to this new form of prehistoric man - we 're seeing two times as many differences between the dna of modern man and this new form than we do with modern man and the neanderthals .
this represents a completely different line that split off from modern man much earlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mitochondrial dna decoding showed differences between the ancestor and modern man do you know if it was a woman or a man ?
we 've named it " x woman . "
" x " stands for the unknown , since we ca n't classify it so easiliy , as i 'd mentioned . and " woman " because we examined the mitochondrial dna - the dna from the powerhouse of the cell - and that 's always passed down from the mother to the child .
so we 're looking at the female lineage , and so we adopted a feministic position .
but since we have yet to examine the entire genetic material , we still do n't know whether it 's a man or a woman .
and this process for examining the mitochrondrial dna - that 's something you developed ?
yes , my boss svante pääbo studied mitochrondrial dna from prehistoric man for the first time in the ' 90s - at the time , from neanderthals .
in recent years , we have refined these methods to help us obtain more information more quickly - and of a higher qualitative value .
but we 've really kicked this kind of research into high gear in recent years .
what 's next ?
what else do you plan to study - and what do you hope to find ?
we plan to study the entire genome - this prehistoric man 's entire genetic material .
we do n't just want to look at this tiny fraction , rather we will examine the entire genome to learn more about this prehistoric man and to see how he was related to modern man and to neanderthals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the neanderthals share many commonalities with modern man was there potential gene flow between these three populations ?
and what can we learn about phenotypical features - what color hair did he have ?
we 'll look at other kinds of features that we can reconstruct based on dna sequencing .
and who gets to keep the bone once you conclude your research ? whatever 's left of the bone will certainly be sent back to novosibirsk , to the museum responsible for the entire excavation .
that said , it 's not a spectacular bone - it 's only as large as cherry pit .
so it 's a very tiny fragment and it might not be all that interesting to look at .

" in turkey , we have german high schools - why should n't there be turkish high schools in germany ? "
erdogan asked in an interview with german weekly die zeit .
erdogan said that many of the almost three million people of turkish origin living in germany had problems with both languages , and offering education in turkish might also help their german .
" germany has not yet caught up with the times , " erdogan said .
" one must first have a firm command of one 's own language , that is to say , turkish , and that is unfortunately rarely the case . "
the federal government 's integration commissioner , maria boehmer , acknowledged the advantage pupils might gain if they could be fluent in two languages , but said learning german should take priority .
" only those who know german have a chance of social advancement , " boehmer , a christian democrat , told the daily berliner zeitung .
the head of the christian democratic party 's german-turkish forum in north-rhine westphalia was also skeptical .
" turkish secondary schools are a dead end for students , " buelent arslan told the daily koelner stadtanzeiger .
" to be successful in germany , a good level of german is essential , " arslan added .
tensions ahead of merkel visit the general secretary of the christian democrat 's bavarian sister party , the csu , said that erdogan was trying to use turkish people in germany to further his own political purposes .
" such demands are an affront in the run-up to his visit with our chancellor angela merkel , " alexander dobrindt told spiegel online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan will meet merkel next week in ankara chancellor angela merkel is due in ankara next monday for a two-day visit .
her relationship with erdogan is problematic , as germany does not favor full eu membership for turkey , calling for a ' privileged partnership ' instead .
turkey has repeatedly rejected anything but full membership in the bloc .
in berlin , which has the largest turkish community in germany , the council for education said the acquisition of turkish language was not necessarily conducive to integration .
it is the knowledge of german that counts , and often , turks in germany struggle to find skilled jobs because of a lack of good german , according to the council .
it also pointed out that there are already turkish grammar schools in germany , but they are privately funded .
some support erdogan 's comments found little support in the german media , but an editorial by daily sueddeutsche zeitung sees some merit in erdogan 's suggestion .
the newspaper pointed out that if more french schools were to be built in germany , it would be hailed as a symbol of franco-german friendship .
but germany seems to have a problem with the turkish language .
it does not " count for much " , according to sueddeutsche .
many companies are desperate to hire people with multiple language skills , so not giving turks the opportunity to study their language in-depth , was a " missed opportunity " , the paper claimed .
no dual citizenship erdogan also criticized the fact that germany does not allow dual citizenship unless the additional country is a member of the eu .
" i find it regrettable that germany is among the countries in the eu that does not allow dual citizenship , " he told die zeit .
a child of foreign parents can only obtain dual citizenship if one parent has lived in germany regularly for at least eight years .
but , at age 23 , the child needs to choose one nationality .
erdogan is no stranger to provocation .
in a speech in cologne in 2008 , erdogan said turks in germany can not be expected to ' assimilate ' and deny their turkish identity .
the comments were seen by many as a direct criticism of how germany treats people of turkish origin. svs / ng / dpa / apn / afp editor : matt hermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 25.03.2010 tired bayern need to dig deep as their chase for three titles intensifies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's fatigue was evident again at schalke bayern munich reached the german cup final on wednesday night after beating schalke .
with their bundesliga and champions league campaigns still on course , bayern face a punishing end-of-season run . it took something special for bayern munich to beat schalke in their own backyard to reach the german cup final on wednesday night .
dutch international arjen robben looked to be going nowhere when he took off with the ball just inside the schalke half before racing down the right-wing to the corner flag .
one electric injection of pace and direction later , with three defenders flailing in his wake , robben was suddenly in the penalty area lashing a left-footed shot beyond schalke keeper manuel neuer to win the semi-final in style .
although bayern had the lion 's share of possession and the early chances in this tense and sometimes bad tempered meeting , robben 's 112th minute winner was the only flash of real class in the whole game .
and despite having eight minutes to save the tie after the bayern winger scored , it was clear schalke were out as soon as the dutchman 's shot hit the back of the net .
neither team had produced anything as decisive in nearly two hours of soccer .
robben 's act of individual brilliance was a worthy match winner , but the dutchman 's tenth goal of the season certainly put a thick layer of gloss on a rather dull bayern performance .
schalke 's overwhelming emphasis on defense , along with the terrible state of the turf in the veltins arena , gradually sapped bayern 's strength and creativity .
but even the bavarians ' early attempts on goal were far from polished .
energetic robben the exception as bayern labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben stood out from the lethargic pack on wednesday robben was the exception throughout , tirelessly chasing and making runs at schalke defenders .
no-one else , not even the late substitute franck ribery , looked able to summon that kind of energy , which could be a matter of concern in the coming weeks .
" we 're still involved in three competitions and that is emotionally not all that easy for the players , " bayern coach louis van gaal said after wednesday 's semifinal win .
" but we want to be involved in all three competitions , so we will have to come to terms with that . "
with league matches against main title rivals schalke and bayer leverkusen on the horizon , and a make-or-break champions league tie over two legs against manchester united , bayern 's season will likely be decided by the end of april - for better or worse .
the concern settling over munich is that the squad may not be deep enough to survive three consecutive title races .
loan deals force coach 's hand over rising stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal 's faith in young players is being put to the test luke faron , a bayern munich expert with theoffside.com , believes that bayern are beginning to feel the effects of loaning a number of players out to other clubs and promoting youngsters to a first team involved in not only a bundesliga title fight and a lengthy german cup campaign but also european matches of the highest standard .
" loaning brazilian defender breno to nuremberg was a necessary step in continuing his development and in getting the young center back some playing time , " faron told deutsche welle .
loaning left back edson braafheid to celtic was a bit surprising , said faron .
combined with breno 's move , it meant holger badstuber would be the only true reserve center back , in addition to starting at left back .
" with center backs van buyten and demichelis suffering injuries , badstuber had to move back inside and the pressure on the youngster has been intense . "
faron believes that van gaal has been forced to test the faith he had in the young players he brought into replenish the senior side in january , but says the coach has so far - on the whole - been justified in his decisions .
" diego contento and david alaba have both performed admirably in their champions league debuts , " said faron .
" alaba had a very bad final five minutes in frankfurt last weekend and perhaps that showed the limits of the wisdom of playing a 17-year-old natural midfielder out of position in a highly competitive match . "
he said contento had had his hands full with jefferson farfan on wednesday , but that he had coped with the task well enough .
if any player was showing fatigue , said faron , it was forward thomas mueller " it 's a big adjustment for a young player like mueller who has n't even played a full season in the bundesliga before .
add in the champions league and the german cup and the fact he also just made his national team debut , and it 's easy to understand why . "
success from continuity makes coach reluctant to change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the league campaign did not start well under van gaal another factor which is contributing to bayern 's lethargy at this point in the season is van gaal 's commitment to continuity .
when he assumed control at the beginning of the season , it took the dutch coach at least ten matches of tinkering before he settled on his preferred line-up - ten matches during which bayern seemed rudderless and the coach 's credentials were questioned .
once the coach found his formula in november , however , an impressive winning streak began and van gaal has not looked back .
as a result , the dutchman risks wearing out his preferred starting 11 .
as bayern enter a run of decisive matches , time will tell if the squad 's mix of youngsters and stars can maintain top performance .
luke faron believes the bavarian giants have what it takes , regardless of tired legs .
" bayern have a chance against manchester united , but they have to be considered underdogs , " he said . " munich 's defense has not performed at the level necessary to progress further in the competition , though wednesday night 's performance in the cup might be the start of a turnaround . "
the big test , says faron , begins a week from saturday , when bayern face schalke , man united and bayer leverkusen all away from home , within a seven day period .
but thereafter , prospects seem bright .
" after the match in leverkusen they have an exceptionally easy schedule in the league for the last month of the campaign . in addition , they 're getting key players like gomez and demichelis back from injury and that should help during the run-in . i believe bayern will prevail in the bundesliga regardless of how far they progress in the champions league .

as iran continues to develop its nuclear program , analysts fear that an arms race in the middle east could begin .
if sanctions continue to fail , these analysts say that military action is necessary to prevent this . as world powers negotiate on how to deal with iran 's continuing development of its nuclear program , concerns about a nuclear arms race in the middle east , prompted by iran 's determination to build nuclear weapons , are mounting .
officials from the united states , russia , france , britain , germany and china participated in a conference call yesterday to discuss how to handle iran 's flaunting of international demands to cease nuclear work .
these countries , while attempting to deter iran from continued nuclear development by offering tehran incentives to allow more oversight of its program , are also threatening sanctions if tehran does not stop work toward producing weapons grade uranium . iran , which has faced sanctions from the united nations three times , says it is developing its nuclear program for peaceful purposes and has refused to allow inspectors from the international atomic energy agency access to its nuclear facilities .
it is party to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty , but repeatedly has been found non-compliant .
there is growing fear that iran will not stop work toward a weapon unless drastic action is taken .
middle east experts said that if iran continues on its current path , a nuclear arms race in the region could ensue . ' ' turkey , algeria , egypt , and saudi arabia are all potential candidates to develop nuclear weapons , " abdulaziz sager , chairman of the gulf research center in dubai , told deutsche welle .
' ' and they will say , if -lsb- nuclear weapon development -rsb- is permitted in iran , why ca n't we develop weapons as well ? "
a threat beyond israel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has called for the destruction of israel .
a nuclear-armed iran is widely seen as a direct threat to israel , as iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has pledged to ' ' wipe israel off the map . "
israel has not ruled out preemptive strikes against suspected nuclear sites inside iran if development continues .
but iran 's possession of a nuclear weapon has implications for other countries in the region as well , mustafa alani , senior advisor and program director at the gulf research center says .
' ' the question is not whether iran uses the bomb against other countries in the middle east , " alani told deutsche welle .
' ' but the question is whether iran has control of the region , and the political consequences of a dominant iran . "
the political balance of power in the middle east at the current time is relatively stable .
israel has a dominant military and nuclear weapons , as well as the backing of the united states .
economic power is diversified , as a number of states have thriving oil industries .
the region is also politically stable , with the exception of iraq , which is trying to sustain a functioning government in the wake of the iraq war .
a nuclear-armed and increasingly belligerent iran would dramatically alter this balance .
ahmadinejad would hold disproportionate clout , and if recent belligerent statements toward israel are to be believed , seems to be willing to use it .
preemption vs. nuclear war in the past , analysts have told deutsche welle that israel is unlikely to carry out unilateral military action against iran , as any action is not likely to destroy iran 's entire nuclear infrastructure .
last month , chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff admiral mike mullen told congress ' ' no strike , however effective , will be in and of itself decisive . "
however , the gulf center 's sager says that if economic sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a convoy of israeli military armored vehicles on the gaza strip. continue to fail , preemptive military action to stop iran from acquiring nuclear weapons is needed .
the power iran would have would be too great and too much of a risk to the region . ' ' if i had to chose between living with iran as a constant threat , or a military strike with limited retaliation , i can more easily live with the military option , " he said .
' ' we have already lived through wars , and no countries were erased from the map . "

johannes krause told deutsche welle about his team 's efforts to analyze the ancient dna . the new report was published on the website of science journal " nature " on march 24 .
leipzig researchers johannes krause and svante pääbo of the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology co-authored the international project . deutsche welle : how did you find a bone fragment from the altai mountains ?
johannes krause : for several years , we 've been involved in a very productive collaboration with our colleagues in russia .
we received bones from them that we later identified as neanderthal bones , for example , thus showing that neanderthals lived in southern siberia , too - not just in europe .
and in recent years , we 've received other bone samples for genetic testing .
here in leipzig , we 've taken our neanderthal research to the genetic level , so we 've been examining the dna of ancient man -lrb- ... -rrb- to help us learn how prehistoric man is related to modern-day man or other forms of early man . the neaderthal has their own dna at least for portions of the genome , so they are n't our direct ancestors ; they 're more an extinct cousin of sorts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dna analysis of homonid species could shed light on their ties to modern man and during our search for new neanderthal bones , we stumbled upon these bones with dna that belonged neither to neanderthals nor modern man .
it constitutes a new form of prehistoric man that had never been discovered - something we had never seen from a genetic standpoint and that we could n't categorize as an existing form of prehistoric man .
everyone 's calling this a sensation - would you call it that ?
i think it 's a sensation because until now we had the potential to do genetic research on two different forms of man - now there 's a third .
so that 's pretty sensational , particularly as it ca n't be classified according to any existing form of prehistoric man .
unfortunately , we do n't have a complete skeleton - just the bone from a pinkie finger .
it 's a tiny fragment that ca n't tell us much about the morphology .
therefore we still do n't know what this prehistoric man looked like - did he perhaps look like a neanderthal , modern man or a homo erectus ?
so we lack quite a lot of information , but we now have the potential to study the dna of this prehistoric man ; we have the potential to examine the entire genome and genetic material from this prehistoric man and compare it to modern man and the neanderthals , for instance .
and through that , we can learn a lot .
for example , what kind of interactions occurred between these three species of prehistoric man ?
we could also show that they lived in the same place at the same time - that 's another sensation for us .
that means , we find neanderthal bones in a nearby cave , and in same layer in which we found the bones of the new human form , we find archaeological artifacts that appear to have come from modern man - ornaments and jewelry that are only associated with modern man .
so it looks as though these three forms of early man lived in the same place at the same time .
you can then imagine any number of scenarios where gene flow could have occurred between these three populations , and that is certainly something that 's very interesting to analyze on a genetic level .
is finding something like this an anthropologist 's dream come true ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian researchers discovered the fossil bone at a site in the altai mountains in siberia yes , this is probably a once-in-a-lifetime chance - discovering a new species or form of prehistoric man .
it 's certainly quite exciting for us .
of course , we should note that we 're not calling it a new species - we 're only talking about a new " form . "
so far , we 've only analyzed a tiny portion of the dna , and only when the entire genome or a large part of the genome has been analyzed will we be able to tell whether it 's something completely new or different , like modern man or the neanderthals , for instance .
and until then , we 're not going to talk about a new species .
but all signs indicate that we 're actually dealing with an entirely knew species of man here .
then what do you know already ; whose bones are they ?
so far , we can only say that this dna - the dna we 've studied so far from this prehistoric man - has about 1 million years between it and the dna of modern man .
so that means that these two forms , modern man and prehistoric man , spent at least 1 million years developing in very different ways .
based on our genetic tests , we can also say that modern man is more closely related to the neanderthals than he is to this new form of prehistoric man - we 're seeing two times as many differences between the dna of modern man and this new form than we do with modern man and the neanderthals .
this represents a completely different line that split off from modern man much earlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mitochondrial dna decoding showed differences between the ancestor and modern man do you know if it was a woman or a man ?
we 've named it " x woman . "
" x " stands for the unknown , since we ca n't classify it so easiliy , as i 'd mentioned . and " woman " because we examined the mitochondrial dna - the dna from the powerhouse of the cell - and that 's always passed down from the mother to the child .
so we 're looking at the female lineage , and so we adopted a feministic position .
but since we have yet to examine the entire genetic material , we still do n't know whether it 's a man or a woman .
and this process for examining the mitochrondrial dna - that 's something you developed ?
yes , my boss svante pääbo studied mitochrondrial dna from prehistoric man for the first time in the ' 90s - at the time , from neanderthals .
in recent years , we have refined these methods to help us obtain more information more quickly - and of a higher qualitative value .
but we 've really kicked this kind of research into high gear in recent years .
what 's next ?
what else do you plan to study - and what do you hope to find ?
we plan to study the entire genome - this prehistoric man 's entire genetic material .
we do n't just want to look at this tiny fraction , rather we will examine the entire genome to learn more about this prehistoric man and to see how he was related to modern man and to neanderthals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the neanderthals share many commonalities with modern man was there potential gene flow between these three populations ?
and what can we learn about phenotypical features - what color hair did he have ?
we 'll look at other kinds of features that we can reconstruct based on dna sequencing .
and who gets to keep the bone once you conclude your research ? whatever 's left of the bone will certainly be sent back to novosibirsk , to the museum responsible for the entire excavation .
that said , it 's not a spectacular bone - it 's only as large as cherry pit .
so it 's a very tiny fragment and it might not be all that interesting to look at .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 25.03.2010 iran 's nuclear work brings fear of mideast arms race großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad at iran 's nuclear enrichment facility in natanz .
as iran continues to develop its nuclear program , analysts fear that an arms race in the middle east could begin .
if sanctions continue to fail , these analysts say that military action is necessary to prevent this . as world powers negotiate on how to deal with iran 's continuing development of its nuclear program , concerns about a nuclear arms race in the middle east , prompted by iran 's determination to build nuclear weapons , are mounting .
officials from the united states , russia , france , britain , germany and china participated in a conference call yesterday to discuss how to handle iran 's flaunting of international demands to cease nuclear work .
these countries , while attempting to deter iran from continued nuclear development by offering tehran incentives to allow more oversight of its program , are also threatening sanctions if tehran does not stop work toward producing weapons grade uranium . iran , which has faced sanctions from the united nations three times , says it is developing its nuclear program for peaceful purposes and has refused to allow inspectors from the international atomic energy agency access to its nuclear facilities .
it is party to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty , but repeatedly has been found non-compliant .
there is growing fear that iran will not stop work toward a weapon unless drastic action is taken .
middle east experts said that if iran continues on its current path , a nuclear arms race in the region could ensue . ' ' turkey , algeria , egypt , and saudi arabia are all potential candidates to develop nuclear weapons , " abdulaziz sager , chairman of the gulf research center in dubai , told deutsche welle .
' ' and they will say , if -lsb- nuclear weapon development -rsb- is permitted in iran , why ca n't we develop weapons as well ? "
a threat beyond israel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has called for the destruction of israel .
a nuclear-armed iran is widely seen as a direct threat to israel , as iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has pledged to ' ' wipe israel off the map . "
israel has not ruled out preemptive strikes against suspected nuclear sites inside iran if development continues .
but iran 's possession of a nuclear weapon has implications for other countries in the region as well , mustafa alani , senior advisor and program director at the gulf research center says .
' ' the question is not whether iran uses the bomb against other countries in the middle east , " alani told deutsche welle .
' ' but the question is whether iran has control of the region , and the political consequences of a dominant iran . "
the political balance of power in the middle east at the current time is relatively stable .
israel has a dominant military and nuclear weapons , as well as the backing of the united states .
economic power is diversified , as a number of states have thriving oil industries .
the region is also politically stable , with the exception of iraq , which is trying to sustain a functioning government in the wake of the iraq war .
a nuclear-armed and increasingly belligerent iran would dramatically alter this balance .
ahmadinejad would hold disproportionate clout , and if recent belligerent statements toward israel are to be believed , seems to be willing to use it .
preemption vs. nuclear war in the past , analysts have told deutsche welle that israel is unlikely to carry out unilateral military action against iran , as any action is not likely to destroy iran 's entire nuclear infrastructure .
last month , chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff admiral mike mullen told congress ' ' no strike , however effective , will be in and of itself decisive . "
however , the gulf center 's sager says that if economic sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a convoy of israeli military armored vehicles on the gaza strip. continue to fail , preemptive military action to stop iran from acquiring nuclear weapons is needed .
the power iran would have would be too great and too much of a risk to the region . ' ' if i had to chose between living with iran as a constant threat , or a military strike with limited retaliation , i can more easily live with the military option , " he said .
' ' we have already lived through wars , and no countries were erased from the map . "

johannes krause told deutsche welle about his team 's efforts to analyze the ancient dna . the new report was published on the website of science journal " nature " on march 24 .
leipzig researchers johannes krause and svante pääbo of the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology co-authored the international project . deutsche welle : how did you find a bone fragment from the altai mountains ?
johannes krause : for several years , we 've been involved in a very productive collaboration with our colleagues in russia .
we received bones from them that we later identified as neanderthal bones , for example , thus showing that neanderthals lived in southern siberia , too - not just in europe .
and in recent years , we 've received other bone samples for genetic testing .
here in leipzig , we 've taken our neanderthal research to the genetic level , so we 've been examining the dna of ancient man -lrb- ... -rrb- to help us learn how prehistoric man is related to modern-day man or other forms of early man . the neaderthal has their own dna at least for portions of the genome , so they are n't our direct ancestors ; they 're more an extinct cousin of sorts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dna analysis of homonid species could shed light on their ties to modern man and during our search for new neanderthal bones , we stumbled upon these bones with dna that belonged neither to neanderthals nor modern man .
it constitutes a new form of prehistoric man that had never been discovered - something we had never seen from a genetic standpoint and that we could n't categorize as an existing form of prehistoric man .
everyone 's calling this a sensation - would you call it that ?
i think it 's a sensation because until now we had the potential to do genetic research on two different forms of man - now there 's a third .
so that 's pretty sensational , particularly as it ca n't be classified according to any existing form of prehistoric man .
unfortunately , we do n't have a complete skeleton - just the bone from a pinkie finger .
it 's a tiny fragment that ca n't tell us much about the morphology .
therefore we still do n't know what this prehistoric man looked like - did he perhaps look like a neanderthal , modern man or a homo erectus ?
so we lack quite a lot of information , but we now have the potential to study the dna of this prehistoric man ; we have the potential to examine the entire genome and genetic material from this prehistoric man and compare it to modern man and the neanderthals , for instance .
and through that , we can learn a lot .
for example , what kind of interactions occurred between these three species of prehistoric man ?
we could also show that they lived in the same place at the same time - that 's another sensation for us .
that means , we find neanderthal bones in a nearby cave , and in same layer in which we found the bones of the new human form , we find archaeological artifacts that appear to have come from modern man - ornaments and jewelry that are only associated with modern man .
so it looks as though these three forms of early man lived in the same place at the same time .
you can then imagine any number of scenarios where gene flow could have occurred between these three populations , and that is certainly something that 's very interesting to analyze on a genetic level .
is finding something like this an anthropologist 's dream come true ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian researchers discovered the fossil bone at a site in the altai mountains in siberia yes , this is probably a once-in-a-lifetime chance - discovering a new species or form of prehistoric man .
it 's certainly quite exciting for us .
of course , we should note that we 're not calling it a new species - we 're only talking about a new " form . "
so far , we 've only analyzed a tiny portion of the dna , and only when the entire genome or a large part of the genome has been analyzed will we be able to tell whether it 's something completely new or different , like modern man or the neanderthals , for instance .
and until then , we 're not going to talk about a new species .
but all signs indicate that we 're actually dealing with an entirely knew species of man here .
then what do you know already ; whose bones are they ?
so far , we can only say that this dna - the dna we 've studied so far from this prehistoric man - has about 1 million years between it and the dna of modern man .
so that means that these two forms , modern man and prehistoric man , spent at least 1 million years developing in very different ways .
based on our genetic tests , we can also say that modern man is more closely related to the neanderthals than he is to this new form of prehistoric man - we 're seeing two times as many differences between the dna of modern man and this new form than we do with modern man and the neanderthals .
this represents a completely different line that split off from modern man much earlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mitochondrial dna decoding showed differences between the ancestor and modern man do you know if it was a woman or a man ?
we 've named it " x woman . "
" x " stands for the unknown , since we ca n't classify it so easiliy , as i 'd mentioned . and " woman " because we examined the mitochondrial dna - the dna from the powerhouse of the cell - and that 's always passed down from the mother to the child .
so we 're looking at the female lineage , and so we adopted a feministic position .
but since we have yet to examine the entire genetic material , we still do n't know whether it 's a man or a woman .
and this process for examining the mitochrondrial dna - that 's something you developed ?
yes , my boss svante pääbo studied mitochrondrial dna from prehistoric man for the first time in the ' 90s - at the time , from neanderthals .
in recent years , we have refined these methods to help us obtain more information more quickly - and of a higher qualitative value .
but we 've really kicked this kind of research into high gear in recent years .
what 's next ?
what else do you plan to study - and what do you hope to find ?
we plan to study the entire genome - this prehistoric man 's entire genetic material .
we do n't just want to look at this tiny fraction , rather we will examine the entire genome to learn more about this prehistoric man and to see how he was related to modern man and to neanderthals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the neanderthals share many commonalities with modern man was there potential gene flow between these three populations ?
and what can we learn about phenotypical features - what color hair did he have ?
we 'll look at other kinds of features that we can reconstruct based on dna sequencing .
and who gets to keep the bone once you conclude your research ? whatever 's left of the bone will certainly be sent back to novosibirsk , to the museum responsible for the entire excavation .
that said , it 's not a spectacular bone - it 's only as large as cherry pit .
so it 's a very tiny fragment and it might not be all that interesting to look at .

newsweekly der spiegel reported thursday that the german foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- sent an e-mail describing the attack and the possible numbers killed .
" many civilians were killed -lrb- numbers vary between 50 and 100 -rrb- , " the e-mail read .
a government spokesman described the e-mail as an " unconfirmed preliminary report . "
he said the e-mail has already been handed over , along with other related documents , to the parliamentary inquiry , and that all of these documents confirm merkel 's stance that civilian casualties were never ruled out .
who knew what when ?
while merkel never claimed that civilians were not killed , it was days before she first spoke to parliament about the airstrike .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the civilian deaths and the government 's response have stirred controvery in germany much of the parliamentary inquiry is focused on who knew what about the bombing and when they knew it .
franz-josef jung , defense minister at the time of the airstrike , stepped down in november over an alleged cover-up of civilian deaths .
he had originally said that no civilians had been killed .
a nato report ultimately found that 142 civilians were killed in the bombing of the two oil tankers , which had been hijacked by taliban insurgents but then got stuck crossing a river bed .
the strike was ordered by a german colonel and carried out by nato aircraft . the bnd e-mail explained the high number of civilian casualties by saying that afghan citizens had taken the " opportunity " to siphon off fuel for their own use .
testifying to the parliamentary inquiry on thursday , jung once again denied that he had suppressed evidence .
the opposition in parliament has reserved the right to call merkel as a witness in the inquiry , although no date has been set. hf / afp / apn editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i think , the west should not directly interfere in iranian domestic affairs , " said kosten . " there has to be rhetorical support and a strict and direct condemnation of all violence against peaceful protests and any breach of international law by parts of the regime in iran .
also , measures like support for free internet use and technical support should be considered .
but direct support , through direct financial aid for example , would be danger for the opposition since they would be immediately charged and outlawed in iran . " meir javedanfar , a middle east analyst and the director for the middle east economic and political analysis -lrb- meepas -rrb- think-tank , agreed that the west should refrain from any direct involvement with the opposition . " if the west were to continue to pressure the iranian regime over human rights and the treatment of protestors , that would be acceptable involvement , " he said . " if the sanctions were to concentrate on the assets of the regime , government-backed companies and manufacturers of armoured vehicles which have been involved in the suppression of the opposition , this would also be acceptable .
but funding and agitation by the west would be counterproductive and would lead to the opposition being labelled as puppets of the west and would justify the hard-line crackdown . " nuclear standoff likely to continue under moderate regime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iran under mousavi would still pursue nuclear ambitions experts believe that the possibility of regime change - peaceful or not - is still within the opposition ’ s reach .
but even if future events result in a moderate leadership taking power in iran , the west 's problems regarding tehran 's nuclear ambitions wo n't just go away .
in fact , while a moderate leadership would be more inclined to engage in talks , the west 's ultimate goal - to prevent iran from having nuclear technology - would still be non-negotiable . " the rhetoric would change and maybe broader negotiations would be more likely , " kosten said .
" however , there is no way to prevent iran from pursuing its civil right to develop nuclear energy .
the islamic republic of iran would not give up this technology , be it ahmadinejad or mousavi as president . " " the pursuit of nuclear technology would continue regardless , " javedanfar added .
" maybe the west would have more success in negotiating with a moderate regime , maybe deals such as third-party enrichment would be agreed to under mousavi or another reformist leader but even regime change wo n't stop iran pursuing nuclear technology - or the option to make a bomb .
this is something even the shah was pursuing .

he said the e-mail has already been handed over , along with other related documents , to the parliamentary inquiry , and that all of these documents confirm merkel 's stance that civilian casualties were never ruled out .
who knew what when ?
while merkel never claimed that civilians were not killed , it was days before she first spoke to parliament about the airstrike .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the civilian deaths and the government 's response have stirred controvery in germany much of the parliamentary inquiry is focused on who knew what about the bombing and when they knew it .
franz-josef jung , defense minister at the time of the airstrike , stepped down in november over an alleged cover-up of civilian deaths .
he had originally said that no civilians had been killed .
a nato report ultimately found that 142 civilians were killed in the bombing of the two oil tankers , which had been hijacked by taliban insurgents but then got stuck crossing a river bed .
the strike was ordered by a german colonel and carried out by nato aircraft . the bnd e-mail explained the high number of civilian casualties by saying that afghan citizens had taken the " opportunity " to siphon off fuel for their own use .
testifying to the parliamentary inquiry on thursday , jung once again denied that he had suppressed evidence .
the opposition in parliament has reserved the right to call merkel as a witness in the inquiry , although no date has been set. hf / afp / apn editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with their bundesliga and champions league campaigns still on course , bayern face a punishing end-of-season run . it took something special for bayern munich to beat schalke in their own backyard to reach the german cup final on wednesday night .
dutch international arjen robben looked to be going nowhere when he took off with the ball just inside the schalke half before racing down the right-wing to the corner flag .
one electric injection of pace and direction later , with three defenders flailing in his wake , robben was suddenly in the penalty area lashing a left-footed shot beyond schalke keeper manuel neuer to win the semi-final in style .
although bayern had the lion 's share of possession and the early chances in this tense and sometimes bad tempered meeting , robben 's 112th minute winner was the only flash of real class in the whole game .
and despite having eight minutes to save the tie after the bayern winger scored , it was clear schalke were out as soon as the dutchman 's shot hit the back of the net .
neither team had produced anything as decisive in nearly two hours of soccer .
robben 's act of individual brilliance was a worthy match winner , but the dutchman 's tenth goal of the season certainly put a thick layer of gloss on a rather dull bayern performance .
schalke 's overwhelming emphasis on defense , along with the terrible state of the turf in the veltins arena , gradually sapped bayern 's strength and creativity .
but even the bavarians ' early attempts on goal were far from polished .
energetic robben the exception as bayern labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben stood out from the lethargic pack on wednesday robben was the exception throughout , tirelessly chasing and making runs at schalke defenders .
no-one else , not even the late substitute franck ribery , looked able to summon that kind of energy , which could be a matter of concern in the coming weeks .
" we 're still involved in three competitions and that is emotionally not all that easy for the players , " bayern coach louis van gaal said after wednesday 's semifinal win .
" but we want to be involved in all three competitions , so we will have to come to terms with that . "
with league matches against main title rivals schalke and bayer leverkusen on the horizon , and a make-or-break champions league tie over two legs against manchester united , bayern 's season will likely be decided by the end of april - for better or worse .
the concern settling over munich is that the squad may not be deep enough to survive three consecutive title races .
loan deals force coach 's hand over rising stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal 's faith in young players is being put to the test luke faron , a bayern munich expert with theoffside.com , believes that bayern are beginning to feel the effects of loaning a number of players out to other clubs and promoting youngsters to a first team involved in not only a bundesliga title fight and a lengthy german cup campaign but also european matches of the highest standard .
" loaning brazilian defender breno to nuremberg was a necessary step in continuing his development and in getting the young center back some playing time , " faron told deutsche welle .
loaning left back edson braafheid to celtic was a bit surprising , said faron .
combined with breno 's move , it meant holger badstuber would be the only true reserve center back , in addition to starting at left back .
" with center backs van buyten and demichelis suffering injuries , badstuber had to move back inside and the pressure on the youngster has been intense . "
faron believes that van gaal has been forced to test the faith he had in the young players he brought into replenish the senior side in january , but says the coach has so far - on the whole - been justified in his decisions .
" diego contento and david alaba have both performed admirably in their champions league debuts , " said faron .
" alaba had a very bad final five minutes in frankfurt last weekend and perhaps that showed the limits of the wisdom of playing a 17-year-old natural midfielder out of position in a highly competitive match . "
he said contento had had his hands full with jefferson farfan on wednesday , but that he had coped with the task well enough .
if any player was showing fatigue , said faron , it was forward thomas mueller " it 's a big adjustment for a young player like mueller who has n't even played a full season in the bundesliga before .
add in the champions league and the german cup and the fact he also just made his national team debut , and it 's easy to understand why . "
success from continuity makes coach reluctant to change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the league campaign did not start well under van gaal another factor which is contributing to bayern 's lethargy at this point in the season is van gaal 's commitment to continuity .
when he assumed control at the beginning of the season , it took the dutch coach at least ten matches of tinkering before he settled on his preferred line-up - ten matches during which bayern seemed rudderless and the coach 's credentials were questioned .
once the coach found his formula in november , however , an impressive winning streak began and van gaal has not looked back .
as a result , the dutchman risks wearing out his preferred starting 11 .
as bayern enter a run of decisive matches , time will tell if the squad 's mix of youngsters and stars can maintain top performance .
luke faron believes the bavarian giants have what it takes , regardless of tired legs .
" bayern have a chance against manchester united , but they have to be considered underdogs , " he said . " munich 's defense has not performed at the level necessary to progress further in the competition , though wednesday night 's performance in the cup might be the start of a turnaround . "
the big test , says faron , begins a week from saturday , when bayern face schalke , man united and bayer leverkusen all away from home , within a seven day period .
but thereafter , prospects seem bright .
" after the match in leverkusen they have an exceptionally easy schedule in the league for the last month of the campaign . in addition , they 're getting key players like gomez and demichelis back from injury and that should help during the run-in . i believe bayern will prevail in the bundesliga regardless of how far they progress in the champions league .

" in turkey , we have german high schools - why should n't there be turkish high schools in germany ? "
erdogan asked in an interview with german weekly die zeit .
erdogan said that many of the almost three million people of turkish origin living in germany had problems with both languages , and offering education in turkish might also help their german .
" germany has not yet caught up with the times , " erdogan said .
" one must first have a firm command of one 's own language , that is to say , turkish , and that is unfortunately rarely the case . "
the federal government 's integration commissioner , maria boehmer , acknowledged the advantage pupils might gain if they could be fluent in two languages , but said learning german should take priority .
" only those who know german have a chance of social advancement , " boehmer , a christian democrat , told the daily berliner zeitung .
the head of the christian democratic party 's german-turkish forum in north-rhine westphalia was also skeptical .
" turkish secondary schools are a dead end for students , " buelent arslan told the daily koelner stadtanzeiger .
" to be successful in germany , a good level of german is essential , " arslan added .
tensions ahead of merkel visit the general secretary of the christian democrat 's bavarian sister party , the csu , said that erdogan was trying to use turkish people in germany to further his own political purposes .
" such demands are an affront in the run-up to his visit with our chancellor angela merkel , " alexander dobrindt told spiegel online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan will meet merkel next week in ankara chancellor angela merkel is due in ankara next monday for a two-day visit .
her relationship with erdogan is problematic , as germany does not favor full eu membership for turkey , calling for a ' privileged partnership ' instead .
turkey has repeatedly rejected anything but full membership in the bloc .
in berlin , which has the largest turkish community in germany , the council for education said the acquisition of turkish language was not necessarily conducive to integration .
it is the knowledge of german that counts , and often , turks in germany struggle to find skilled jobs because of a lack of good german , according to the council .
it also pointed out that there are already turkish grammar schools in germany , but they are privately funded .
some support erdogan 's comments found little support in the german media , but an editorial by daily sueddeutsche zeitung sees some merit in erdogan 's suggestion .
the newspaper pointed out that if more french schools were to be built in germany , it would be hailed as a symbol of franco-german friendship .
but germany seems to have a problem with the turkish language .
it does not " count for much " , according to sueddeutsche .
many companies are desperate to hire people with multiple language skills , so not giving turks the opportunity to study their language in-depth , was a " missed opportunity " , the paper claimed .
no dual citizenship erdogan also criticized the fact that germany does not allow dual citizenship unless the additional country is a member of the eu .
" i find it regrettable that germany is among the countries in the eu that does not allow dual citizenship , " he told die zeit .
a child of foreign parents can only obtain dual citizenship if one parent has lived in germany regularly for at least eight years .
but , at age 23 , the child needs to choose one nationality .
erdogan is no stranger to provocation .
in a speech in cologne in 2008 , erdogan said turks in germany can not be expected to ' assimilate ' and deny their turkish identity .
the comments were seen by many as a direct criticism of how germany treats people of turkish origin. svs / ng / dpa / apn / afp editor : matt hermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while merkel never claimed that civilians were not killed , it was days before she first spoke to parliament about the airstrike .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the civilian deaths and the government 's response have stirred controvery in germany much of the parliamentary inquiry is focused on who knew what about the bombing and when they knew it .
franz-josef jung , defense minister at the time of the airstrike , stepped down in november over an alleged cover-up of civilian deaths .
he had originally said that no civilians had been killed .
a nato report ultimately found that 142 civilians were killed in the bombing of the two oil tankers , which had been hijacked by taliban insurgents but then got stuck crossing a river bed .
the strike was ordered by a german colonel and carried out by nato aircraft . the bnd e-mail explained the high number of civilian casualties by saying that afghan citizens had taken the " opportunity " to siphon off fuel for their own use .
testifying to the parliamentary inquiry on thursday , jung once again denied that he had suppressed evidence .
the opposition in parliament has reserved the right to call merkel as a witness in the inquiry , although no date has been set. hf / afp / apn editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a statement released by the company said his resignation was " due to differing views with the financial market stabilization fund -lrb- soffin -rrb- regarding the management of the company . "
soffin is the german government 's bank bailout fund , set up to stabilize the country 's banking sector .

a spokeswoman for soffin told the magazine , " there were disagreements over employee salaries .
soffin holds that a bank owned by the state ca n't be measured by the same standards as private banks . "

wieandt " took on the responsibility of ceo at the height of the crisis and has made a significant contribution to the stabilization and realignment of the company , " hre 's statement said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 25.03.2010 tired bayern need to dig deep as their chase for three titles intensifies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's fatigue was evident again at schalke bayern munich reached the german cup final on wednesday night after beating schalke .
with their bundesliga and champions league campaigns still on course , bayern face a punishing end-of-season run . it took something special for bayern munich to beat schalke in their own backyard to reach the german cup final on wednesday night .
dutch international arjen robben looked to be going nowhere when he took off with the ball just inside the schalke half before racing down the right-wing to the corner flag .
one electric injection of pace and direction later , with three defenders flailing in his wake , robben was suddenly in the penalty area lashing a left-footed shot beyond schalke keeper manuel neuer to win the semi-final in style .
although bayern had the lion 's share of possession and the early chances in this tense and sometimes bad tempered meeting , robben 's 112th minute winner was the only flash of real class in the whole game .
and despite having eight minutes to save the tie after the bayern winger scored , it was clear schalke were out as soon as the dutchman 's shot hit the back of the net .
neither team had produced anything as decisive in nearly two hours of soccer .
robben 's act of individual brilliance was a worthy match winner , but the dutchman 's tenth goal of the season certainly put a thick layer of gloss on a rather dull bayern performance .
schalke 's overwhelming emphasis on defense , along with the terrible state of the turf in the veltins arena , gradually sapped bayern 's strength and creativity .
but even the bavarians ' early attempts on goal were far from polished .
energetic robben the exception as bayern labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben stood out from the lethargic pack on wednesday robben was the exception throughout , tirelessly chasing and making runs at schalke defenders .
no-one else , not even the late substitute franck ribery , looked able to summon that kind of energy , which could be a matter of concern in the coming weeks .
" we 're still involved in three competitions and that is emotionally not all that easy for the players , " bayern coach louis van gaal said after wednesday 's semifinal win .
" but we want to be involved in all three competitions , so we will have to come to terms with that . "
with league matches against main title rivals schalke and bayer leverkusen on the horizon , and a make-or-break champions league tie over two legs against manchester united , bayern 's season will likely be decided by the end of april - for better or worse .
the concern settling over munich is that the squad may not be deep enough to survive three consecutive title races .
loan deals force coach 's hand over rising stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal 's faith in young players is being put to the test luke faron , a bayern munich expert with theoffside.com , believes that bayern are beginning to feel the effects of loaning a number of players out to other clubs and promoting youngsters to a first team involved in not only a bundesliga title fight and a lengthy german cup campaign but also european matches of the highest standard .
" loaning brazilian defender breno to nuremberg was a necessary step in continuing his development and in getting the young center back some playing time , " faron told deutsche welle .
loaning left back edson braafheid to celtic was a bit surprising , said faron .
combined with breno 's move , it meant holger badstuber would be the only true reserve center back , in addition to starting at left back .
" with center backs van buyten and demichelis suffering injuries , badstuber had to move back inside and the pressure on the youngster has been intense . "
faron believes that van gaal has been forced to test the faith he had in the young players he brought into replenish the senior side in january , but says the coach has so far - on the whole - been justified in his decisions .
" diego contento and david alaba have both performed admirably in their champions league debuts , " said faron .
" alaba had a very bad final five minutes in frankfurt last weekend and perhaps that showed the limits of the wisdom of playing a 17-year-old natural midfielder out of position in a highly competitive match . "
he said contento had had his hands full with jefferson farfan on wednesday , but that he had coped with the task well enough .
if any player was showing fatigue , said faron , it was forward thomas mueller " it 's a big adjustment for a young player like mueller who has n't even played a full season in the bundesliga before .
add in the champions league and the german cup and the fact he also just made his national team debut , and it 's easy to understand why . "
success from continuity makes coach reluctant to change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the league campaign did not start well under van gaal another factor which is contributing to bayern 's lethargy at this point in the season is van gaal 's commitment to continuity .
when he assumed control at the beginning of the season , it took the dutch coach at least ten matches of tinkering before he settled on his preferred line-up - ten matches during which bayern seemed rudderless and the coach 's credentials were questioned .
once the coach found his formula in november , however , an impressive winning streak began and van gaal has not looked back .
as a result , the dutchman risks wearing out his preferred starting 11 .
as bayern enter a run of decisive matches , time will tell if the squad 's mix of youngsters and stars can maintain top performance .
luke faron believes the bavarian giants have what it takes , regardless of tired legs .
" bayern have a chance against manchester united , but they have to be considered underdogs , " he said . " munich 's defense has not performed at the level necessary to progress further in the competition , though wednesday night 's performance in the cup might be the start of a turnaround . "
the big test , says faron , begins a week from saturday , when bayern face schalke , man united and bayer leverkusen all away from home , within a seven day period .
but thereafter , prospects seem bright .
" after the match in leverkusen they have an exceptionally easy schedule in the league for the last month of the campaign . in addition , they 're getting key players like gomez and demichelis back from injury and that should help during the run-in . i believe bayern will prevail in the bundesliga regardless of how far they progress in the champions league .

" in turkey , we have german high schools - why should n't there be turkish high schools in germany ? "
erdogan asked in an interview with german weekly die zeit .
erdogan said that many of the almost three million people of turkish origin living in germany had problems with both languages , and offering education in turkish might also help their german .
" germany has not yet caught up with the times , " erdogan said .
" one must first have a firm command of one 's own language , that is to say , turkish , and that is unfortunately rarely the case . "
the federal government 's integration commissioner , maria boehmer , acknowledged the advantage pupils might gain if they could be fluent in two languages , but said learning german should take priority .
" only those who know german have a chance of social advancement , " boehmer , a christian democrat , told the daily berliner zeitung .
the head of the christian democratic party 's german-turkish forum in north-rhine westphalia was also skeptical .
" turkish secondary schools are a dead end for students , " buelent arslan told the daily koelner stadtanzeiger .
" to be successful in germany , a good level of german is essential , " arslan added .
tensions ahead of merkel visit the general secretary of the christian democrat 's bavarian sister party , the csu , said that erdogan was trying to use turkish people in germany to further his own political purposes .
" such demands are an affront in the run-up to his visit with our chancellor angela merkel , " alexander dobrindt told spiegel online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan will meet merkel next week in ankara chancellor angela merkel is due in ankara next monday for a two-day visit .
her relationship with erdogan is problematic , as germany does not favor full eu membership for turkey , calling for a ' privileged partnership ' instead .
turkey has repeatedly rejected anything but full membership in the bloc .
in berlin , which has the largest turkish community in germany , the council for education said the acquisition of turkish language was not necessarily conducive to integration .
it is the knowledge of german that counts , and often , turks in germany struggle to find skilled jobs because of a lack of good german , according to the council .
it also pointed out that there are already turkish grammar schools in germany , but they are privately funded .
some support erdogan 's comments found little support in the german media , but an editorial by daily sueddeutsche zeitung sees some merit in erdogan 's suggestion .
the newspaper pointed out that if more french schools were to be built in germany , it would be hailed as a symbol of franco-german friendship .
but germany seems to have a problem with the turkish language .
it does not " count for much " , according to sueddeutsche .
many companies are desperate to hire people with multiple language skills , so not giving turks the opportunity to study their language in-depth , was a " missed opportunity " , the paper claimed .
no dual citizenship erdogan also criticized the fact that germany does not allow dual citizenship unless the additional country is a member of the eu .
" i find it regrettable that germany is among the countries in the eu that does not allow dual citizenship , " he told die zeit .
a child of foreign parents can only obtain dual citizenship if one parent has lived in germany regularly for at least eight years .
but , at age 23 , the child needs to choose one nationality .
erdogan is no stranger to provocation .
in a speech in cologne in 2008 , erdogan said turks in germany can not be expected to ' assimilate ' and deny their turkish identity .
the comments were seen by many as a direct criticism of how germany treats people of turkish origin. svs / ng / dpa / apn / afp editor : matt hermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but when those international couples divorce , those borders can make it even more complicated .
some eu nations want to change that . some 300,000 marriages between people from different european union countries take place every year - the romantic side of the increasing borderlessness of the 27-nation bloc .
but 140,000 mixed-nationality eu couples file for divorce every year , and many are faced with a legal maze created by divorce laws that vary from country to country across the eu . but ten eu countries - austria , bulgaria , france , greece , hungary , italy , luxembourg , romania , slovakia and spain - want to take advantage of a never-before-used 1997 treaty provision to simplify that process .
it allows for a subgroup of eu countries to develop a system of " enhanced cooperation . " the ten want to form their own pact harmonizing their divorce laws .
the countries need approval from eu justice ministers to draw up such a deal , but the idea would be to obligate couples to agree on a jurisdiction for their divorce proceedings .
if they can not agree , the divorce laws of the country where they last lived together would apply .
a boon or a burden ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reding says eu should work to simplify mixed-nationality divorce supporters of the idea say it would streamline mixed-nationality divorces , possibly reduce legal fees , and discourage " divorce shopping , " in which one spouse seeks out the jurisdiction that favors him or her .
" international couples can encounter arbitrary legal problems that turn the tragedy of divorce into a financial and emotional disaster … because national legal systems have so far failed to provide clear answers , " said eu justice commissioner viviane reding .
but critics of the proposal say it would create a " europe within europe . "
and value-laden family policy is an area the eu usually sidesteps .
divorce laws vary dramatically across the bloc .
malta does not even permit divorce , only legal separation .
but reding downplayed concerns of a two-speed europe , saying that " several " other countries were also interested in the enhanced cooperation. hf / afp / ap editor : stephanie siek send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 25.03.2010 tired bayern need to dig deep as their chase for three titles intensifies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's fatigue was evident again at schalke bayern munich reached the german cup final on wednesday night after beating schalke .
with their bundesliga and champions league campaigns still on course , bayern face a punishing end-of-season run . it took something special for bayern munich to beat schalke in their own backyard to reach the german cup final on wednesday night .
dutch international arjen robben looked to be going nowhere when he took off with the ball just inside the schalke half before racing down the right-wing to the corner flag .
one electric injection of pace and direction later , with three defenders flailing in his wake , robben was suddenly in the penalty area lashing a left-footed shot beyond schalke keeper manuel neuer to win the semi-final in style .
although bayern had the lion 's share of possession and the early chances in this tense and sometimes bad tempered meeting , robben 's 112th minute winner was the only flash of real class in the whole game .
and despite having eight minutes to save the tie after the bayern winger scored , it was clear schalke were out as soon as the dutchman 's shot hit the back of the net .
neither team had produced anything as decisive in nearly two hours of soccer .
robben 's act of individual brilliance was a worthy match winner , but the dutchman 's tenth goal of the season certainly put a thick layer of gloss on a rather dull bayern performance .
schalke 's overwhelming emphasis on defense , along with the terrible state of the turf in the veltins arena , gradually sapped bayern 's strength and creativity .
but even the bavarians ' early attempts on goal were far from polished .
energetic robben the exception as bayern labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben stood out from the lethargic pack on wednesday robben was the exception throughout , tirelessly chasing and making runs at schalke defenders .
no-one else , not even the late substitute franck ribery , looked able to summon that kind of energy , which could be a matter of concern in the coming weeks .
" we 're still involved in three competitions and that is emotionally not all that easy for the players , " bayern coach louis van gaal said after wednesday 's semifinal win .
" but we want to be involved in all three competitions , so we will have to come to terms with that . "
with league matches against main title rivals schalke and bayer leverkusen on the horizon , and a make-or-break champions league tie over two legs against manchester united , bayern 's season will likely be decided by the end of april - for better or worse .
the concern settling over munich is that the squad may not be deep enough to survive three consecutive title races .
loan deals force coach 's hand over rising stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal 's faith in young players is being put to the test luke faron , a bayern munich expert with theoffside.com , believes that bayern are beginning to feel the effects of loaning a number of players out to other clubs and promoting youngsters to a first team involved in not only a bundesliga title fight and a lengthy german cup campaign but also european matches of the highest standard .
" loaning brazilian defender breno to nuremberg was a necessary step in continuing his development and in getting the young center back some playing time , " faron told deutsche welle .
loaning left back edson braafheid to celtic was a bit surprising , said faron .
combined with breno 's move , it meant holger badstuber would be the only true reserve center back , in addition to starting at left back .
" with center backs van buyten and demichelis suffering injuries , badstuber had to move back inside and the pressure on the youngster has been intense . "
faron believes that van gaal has been forced to test the faith he had in the young players he brought into replenish the senior side in january , but says the coach has so far - on the whole - been justified in his decisions .
" diego contento and david alaba have both performed admirably in their champions league debuts , " said faron .
" alaba had a very bad final five minutes in frankfurt last weekend and perhaps that showed the limits of the wisdom of playing a 17-year-old natural midfielder out of position in a highly competitive match . "
he said contento had had his hands full with jefferson farfan on wednesday , but that he had coped with the task well enough .
if any player was showing fatigue , said faron , it was forward thomas mueller " it 's a big adjustment for a young player like mueller who has n't even played a full season in the bundesliga before .
add in the champions league and the german cup and the fact he also just made his national team debut , and it 's easy to understand why . "
success from continuity makes coach reluctant to change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the league campaign did not start well under van gaal another factor which is contributing to bayern 's lethargy at this point in the season is van gaal 's commitment to continuity .
when he assumed control at the beginning of the season , it took the dutch coach at least ten matches of tinkering before he settled on his preferred line-up - ten matches during which bayern seemed rudderless and the coach 's credentials were questioned .
once the coach found his formula in november , however , an impressive winning streak began and van gaal has not looked back .
as a result , the dutchman risks wearing out his preferred starting 11 .
as bayern enter a run of decisive matches , time will tell if the squad 's mix of youngsters and stars can maintain top performance .
luke faron believes the bavarian giants have what it takes , regardless of tired legs .
" bayern have a chance against manchester united , but they have to be considered underdogs , " he said . " munich 's defense has not performed at the level necessary to progress further in the competition , though wednesday night 's performance in the cup might be the start of a turnaround . "
the big test , says faron , begins a week from saturday , when bayern face schalke , man united and bayer leverkusen all away from home , within a seven day period .
but thereafter , prospects seem bright .
" after the match in leverkusen they have an exceptionally easy schedule in the league for the last month of the campaign . in addition , they 're getting key players like gomez and demichelis back from injury and that should help during the run-in . i believe bayern will prevail in the bundesliga regardless of how far they progress in the champions league . "

many victims still find it difficult to talk about their experiences .
the transcultural psycho-social organization cambodia provides them with therapy . monks in orange robes are reciting prayers .
a group of men and women is sitting in front of them .
their heads are bowed and some are crying .
they are in a temple in the killing fields , not far from the cambodian capital of phnom penh . 17,000 were killed in this place alone under the khmer rouge regime that lasted from 1975 to 1979 .
those praying survived .
they are taking part in a therapy course that is run by the transcultural psycho-social organization cambodia -lrb- tpo -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 20,000 people were detained , tortured and killed in tuol sleng prison " it felt like i was in hell " one of the participants , sam rithy , was arrested and tortured in prison .
the khmer rouge , which wanted to establish a classless society , thought that he needed to be rid of his " bourgeois side " since he lived in the city . " they hit me with a weapon until i was unconscious .
they killed innocent children in jail and let children starve to death .
it felt like i was in hell .
i never thought i would survive , " he recalls . the method that the tpo uses – testimonial therapy – was developed in chile after the dictatorship fell .
participants work through their experiences of torture , war and human rights abuses , with qualified therapists . sleep problems and depression sam rithy has problems sleeping and im sam at is depressed .

" my husband was executed .
i was a widow at 22 .
i lost my children and my mother .
i feel very very lonely . " it is part of the therapy to write down memories and try to piece fragments together .
participants then go back to the killing fields together but only after they have been " debriefed " , explains sarat youn , one of the tpo ’ s therapists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least two million people are thought to have died under the khmer rouge , through execution , illness or starvation " we tell them that this place is not a good place to visit and will remind them of really bad past experiences .
we tell them that if they need to cry , they should .
they should not keep it in but should release their pain . " religious ceremony helps release pain and suffering in the final ceremony , the therapists read out the stories of each person .
sam rithy seems calm and composed as sarat youn reads his story .

the deal hinges on voluntary bilateral loans from eurozone countries . after finally ironing out differences that had threatened to derail european union assistance to greece , and destabilize the eurozone , german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy have come up with a plan to help greece .
the two leaders worked out the plan in face-to-face talks immediately before an eu summit was set to begin on thursday evening in brussels .
the agreement would allow eurozone countries to offer greece bilateral loans .
the international monetary fund would also be involved , providing additional support in exchange for fiscal reforms in athens .
sarkozy and merkel are set to present the plan first to eu president herman van rompuy , and then to eurozone and eu leaders .
two different approaches germany and france have come to represent two different views on how to deal with greece , whose growing debts have raised concerns for the wider eurozone .
merkel has pushed for imf aid while sarkozy wants to see the eu support greece .
" europe can not face this crisis alone , " merkel said in an address to the german parliament earlier on thursday .
greece , whose credit rating has been downgraded by all the major ratings agencies , had asked for the promise of a eurozone loan - rather than a loan itself - to convince other lenders to lower their charges for loans. hf / afp / dpa / reuters editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 25.03.2010 latest priest sex abuse scandal heats up responsibility debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as cardinal , ratzinger was informed but failed to act in the murphy case as the latest sexual abuse scandal in the catholic church gets uncomfortably close to the pope , questions of punishment versus apology in dealing with pedophile priests have once again emerged . the catholic church says the only way to face the burgeoning numbers of accusations is with complete honesty - and by urging victims to take legal action .
meanwhile , activists say the church should take more responsibility for its wayward leaders .
either way , the situation surrounding sexual abuse scandals in the catholic church is like a modern-day hydra myth - no sooner is one scandal addressed than another rises up to take its place .
with europe 's catholics still reeling from a series of alleged child-molestation cover-ups , news broke in the united states of a 1996 case that touches the upper echelons of church power .
failure to defrock in the latest case to hit headlines , the new york times reported on thursday that pope benedict xvi ignored allegations of child sex abuse back in the 1990s .
at the time , he was head of the congregation of the doctrine of the faith , the vatican body that judges cases of sexual abuse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victims recently took to the streets of the vatican to protest the paper reported that the pope - then cardinal joseph ratzinger - failed to defrock rev. lawrence murphy , a priest in milwaukee who had been accused of sexually abusing some 200 deaf boys , despite the fact that he was aware of the allegations .
murphy worked from 1950 to 1977 at a school for the deaf and died in 1998 .
a spokesman for the vatican , federico lombardi , argued that rome was n't informed of the case until 20 years after it happened , and said that in the end the church did n't take action against murphy because he had confessed the acts and because he was very ill and close to the end of his life .
records uncovered by the times show that three different bishops were aware of the accusations , but that the case was not brought to trial .
still , lombardi told news service reuters that the church is eager to see abusive priests brought to justice .
church calls in professional help this is a feeling shared by christoph heckeley , a spokesman for the archbishopric of cologne , germany .
the catholic church in germany has had a directive for the past eight years that urges prosecution in sex abuse cases , heckeley told deutsche welle .
" since 2002 we have a directive from the german bishops conference that says what you have to do in case sexual abuse is suspected , " heckeley said .
people with complaints are referred to professionals - psychologists , doctors and legal experts - who are hired by each bishopric , and are qualified to advise people who want to come forward with sex abuse allegations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abuse allegedly took place at some german jesuit schools " our aim is to listen to the victims and help them get justice , even when the cases are years or decades old .
they need somebody to listen to them , and the most important thing is that they get justice , " he said .
the response from the church will differ case by case , but the church " urgently advises " victims to take perpetrators to court .
unfortunately , heckeley said , victims often do n't want to do this because it can be too upsetting to their families , and " can destroy their entire social environment - it can traumatize them a second time .
you have to be careful . "
prosecution is a right , not an obligation while there is a right to prosecute , there is no obligation to do so - a situation that is currently under hot debate .
still , heckeley said experts recommend caution , since " the dangers -lrb- of forced prosecution -rrb- could outweigh the risks . "
no matter what shape the case takes in federal court , allegations of abuse are always looked into by a church tribunal out of rome .
yet in the murphy case , ratzinger 's deputy at the time advised a secret disciplinary trial at first .
he later reversed that decision , and in 1998 , murphy appealed directly to ratzinger for clemency , shortly before he died .
all the calls for openness , trials and apologies are well and good , victims-rights advocates say , but they do n't go far enough .
what is missing on the part of the church is a departure from the secrecy , and a willingness to admit its own cover-ups .
last week , following revelations of pedophilia that rocked the irish catholic church , the pope issued a long-awaited apology to victims of child sex abuse in ireland .
he acknowledged " serious mistakes " on the part of the church , as well as the sense of betrayal in the church felt by victims and their families .
victims ' groups start protests but irish victims ' groups felt that the apology fell short of their demands ; they called for the church to acknowledge its role in covering up abuse .
maeve lewis , executive director of irish victims ' rights group one in four , told bbc news , " we are really disappointed that there is no acknowledgement that the cover-up and the policy of cover-up in the church went right to the the vatican . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope finally addressed the cases of abuse in ireland and in germany , victims-rights advocates were incensed that the apology failed to mention cases of church pedophilia in munich that have dominated headlines for weeks .
the church has had to contend with cover-up allegations in that city while ratzinger was the city 's archbishop from 1977 to 1981 .
on thursday members of the us activist organization snap - survivor network of those abused by priests - launched a demonstration in the vatican , holding up signs that said " stop the secrecy now . "
they demanded that pope benedict open up all files on pedophile catholic clerics worldwide , and called for all " predator priests " to be defrocked .
the group has also protested in germany , austria , and the netherlands , all countries recently hit by church sex abuse scandals .
one official 's stance " i would ask the pope if he would please open up the files from the congregation of the doctrine of the faith and turn over all the information to the police , " barbara blaine , the president of snap , told reuters news service .
a trickle of acknowledgements have begun , and some say a wave may be coming .
earlier this month , the german church 's representative responsible for dealing with cases of abuse , bishop stephan ackermann , also acknowledged severe failures .
" where there was no will toward explanation and where the person who committed the crime was simply moved to a new post , we have to admit , in a whole array of cases , that there was a cover-up , " he told the rhein zeitung newspaper .
and this week , german news magazine focus reported that archbishop zollitsch , the leader of the german roman catholic church , also admitted cases of child sex abuse were known and covered up .
" yes , we did have that , " he said .
many see the catholic church as so damaged by these allegations that it will be hard for the institution to regain its footing .
" we can only survive this situation with openness and honesty , " says the cologne archbishopric 's heckeley .
" we have to try to win people 's trust that way . "

" in turkey , we have german high schools - why should n't there be turkish high schools in germany ? "
erdogan asked in an interview with german weekly die zeit .
erdogan said that many of the almost three million people of turkish origin living in germany had problems with both languages , and offering education in turkish might also help their german .
" germany has not yet caught up with the times , " erdogan said .
" one must first have a firm command of one 's own language , that is to say , turkish , and that is unfortunately rarely the case . "
the federal government 's integration commissioner , maria boehmer , acknowledged the advantage pupils might gain if they could be fluent in two languages , but said learning german should take priority .
" only those who know german have a chance of social advancement , " boehmer , a christian democrat , told the daily berliner zeitung .
the head of the christian democratic party 's german-turkish forum in north-rhine westphalia was also skeptical .
" turkish secondary schools are a dead end for students , " buelent arslan told the daily koelner stadtanzeiger .
" to be successful in germany , a good level of german is essential , " arslan added .
tensions ahead of merkel visit the general secretary of the christian democrat 's bavarian sister party , the csu , said that erdogan was trying to use turkish people in germany to further his own political purposes .
" such demands are an affront in the run-up to his visit with our chancellor angela merkel , " alexander dobrindt told spiegel online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan will meet merkel next week in ankara chancellor angela merkel is due in ankara next monday for a two-day visit .
her relationship with erdogan is problematic , as germany does not favor full eu membership for turkey , calling for a ' privileged partnership ' instead .
turkey has repeatedly rejected anything but full membership in the bloc .
in berlin , which has the largest turkish community in germany , the council for education said the acquisition of turkish language was not necessarily conducive to integration .
it is the knowledge of german that counts , and often , turks in germany struggle to find skilled jobs because of a lack of good german , according to the council .
it also pointed out that there are already turkish grammar schools in germany , but they are privately funded .
some support erdogan 's comments found little support in the german media , but an editorial by daily sueddeutsche zeitung sees some merit in erdogan 's suggestion .
the newspaper pointed out that if more french schools were to be built in germany , it would be hailed as a symbol of franco-german friendship .
but germany seems to have a problem with the turkish language .
it does not " count for much " , according to sueddeutsche .
many companies are desperate to hire people with multiple language skills , so not giving turks the opportunity to study their language in-depth , was a " missed opportunity " , the paper claimed .
no dual citizenship erdogan also criticized the fact that germany does not allow dual citizenship unless the additional country is a member of the eu .
" i find it regrettable that germany is among the countries in the eu that does not allow dual citizenship , " he told die zeit .
a child of foreign parents can only obtain dual citizenship if one parent has lived in germany regularly for at least eight years .
but , at age 23 , the child needs to choose one nationality .
erdogan is no stranger to provocation .
in a speech in cologne in 2008 , erdogan said turks in germany can not be expected to ' assimilate ' and deny their turkish identity .
the comments were seen by many as a direct criticism of how germany treats people of turkish origin. svs / ng / dpa / apn / afp editor : matt hermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but when those international couples divorce , those borders can make it even more complicated .
some eu nations want to change that . some 300,000 marriages between people from different european union countries take place every year - the romantic side of the increasing borderlessness of the 27-nation bloc .
but 140,000 mixed-nationality eu couples file for divorce every year , and many are faced with a legal maze created by divorce laws that vary from country to country across the eu . but ten eu countries - austria , bulgaria , france , greece , hungary , italy , luxembourg , romania , slovakia and spain - want to take advantage of a never-before-used 1997 treaty provision to simplify that process .
it allows for a subgroup of eu countries to develop a system of " enhanced cooperation . " the ten want to form their own pact harmonizing their divorce laws .
the countries need approval from eu justice ministers to draw up such a deal , but the idea would be to obligate couples to agree on a jurisdiction for their divorce proceedings .
if they can not agree , the divorce laws of the country where they last lived together would apply .
a boon or a burden ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reding says eu should work to simplify mixed-nationality divorce supporters of the idea say it would streamline mixed-nationality divorces , possibly reduce legal fees , and discourage " divorce shopping , " in which one spouse seeks out the jurisdiction that favors him or her .
" international couples can encounter arbitrary legal problems that turn the tragedy of divorce into a financial and emotional disaster … because national legal systems have so far failed to provide clear answers , " said eu justice commissioner viviane reding .
but critics of the proposal say it would create a " europe within europe . "
and value-laden family policy is an area the eu usually sidesteps .
divorce laws vary dramatically across the bloc .
malta does not even permit divorce , only legal separation .
but reding downplayed concerns of a two-speed europe , saying that " several " other countries were also interested in the enhanced cooperation. hf / afp / ap editor : stephanie siek send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" one must first have a firm command of one 's own language , that is to say , turkish , and that is unfortunately rarely the case . "
the federal government 's integration commissioner , maria boehmer , acknowledged the advantage pupils might gain if they could be fluent in two languages , but said learning german should take priority .
" only those who know german have a chance of social advancement , " boehmer , a christian democrat , told the daily berliner zeitung .
the head of the christian democratic party 's german-turkish forum in north-rhine westphalia was also skeptical .
" turkish secondary schools are a dead end for students , " buelent arslan told the daily koelner stadtanzeiger .
" to be successful in germany , a good level of german is essential , " arslan added .
tensions ahead of merkel visit the general secretary of the christian democrat 's bavarian sister party , the csu , said that erdogan was trying to use turkish people in germany to further his own political purposes .
" such demands are an affront in the run-up to his visit with our chancellor angela merkel , " alexander dobrindt told spiegel online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan will meet merkel next week in ankara chancellor angela merkel is due in ankara next monday for a two-day visit .
her relationship with erdogan is problematic , as germany does not favor full eu membership for turkey , calling for a ' privileged partnership ' instead .
turkey has repeatedly rejected anything but full membership in the bloc .
in berlin , which has the largest turkish community in germany , the council for education said the acquisition of turkish language was not necessarily conducive to integration .
it is the knowledge of german that counts , and often , turks in germany struggle to find skilled jobs because of a lack of good german , according to the council .
it also pointed out that there are already turkish grammar schools in germany , but they are privately funded .
some support erdogan 's comments found little support in the german media , but an editorial by daily sueddeutsche zeitung sees some merit in erdogan 's suggestion .
the newspaper pointed out that if more french schools were to be built in germany , it would be hailed as a symbol of franco-german friendship .
but germany seems to have a problem with the turkish language .
it does not " count for much " , according to sueddeutsche .
many companies are desperate to hire people with multiple language skills , so not giving turks the opportunity to study their language in-depth , was a " missed opportunity " , the paper claimed .
no dual citizenship erdogan also criticized the fact that germany does not allow dual citizenship unless the additional country is a member of the eu .
" i find it regrettable that germany is among the countries in the eu that does not allow dual citizenship , " he told die zeit .
a child of foreign parents can only obtain dual citizenship if one parent has lived in germany regularly for at least eight years .
but , at age 23 , the child needs to choose one nationality .
erdogan is no stranger to provocation .
in a speech in cologne in 2008 , erdogan said turks in germany can not be expected to ' assimilate ' and deny their turkish identity .
the comments were seen by many as a direct criticism of how germany treats people of turkish origin. svs / ng / dpa / apn / afp editor : matt hermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , activists say the church should take more responsibility for its wayward leaders .
either way , the situation surrounding sexual abuse scandals in the catholic church is like a modern-day hydra myth - no sooner is one scandal addressed than another rises up to take its place .
with europe 's catholics still reeling from a series of alleged child-molestation cover-ups , news broke in the united states of a 1996 case that touches the upper echelons of church power .
failure to defrock in the latest case to hit headlines , the new york times reported on thursday that pope benedict xvi ignored allegations of child sex abuse back in the 1990s .
at the time , he was head of the congregation of the doctrine of the faith , the vatican body that judges cases of sexual abuse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victims recently took to the streets of the vatican to protest the paper reported that the pope - then cardinal joseph ratzinger - failed to defrock rev. lawrence murphy , a priest in milwaukee who had been accused of sexually abusing some 200 deaf boys , despite the fact that he was aware of the allegations .
murphy worked from 1950 to 1977 at a school for the deaf and died in 1998 .
a spokesman for the vatican , federico lombardi , argued that rome was n't informed of the case until 20 years after it happened , and said that in the end the church did n't take action against murphy because he had confessed the acts and because he was very ill and close to the end of his life .
records uncovered by the times show that three different bishops were aware of the accusations , but that the case was not brought to trial .
still , lombardi told news service reuters that the church is eager to see abusive priests brought to justice .
church calls in professional help this is a feeling shared by christoph heckeley , a spokesman for the archbishopric of cologne , germany .
the catholic church in germany has had a directive for the past eight years that urges prosecution in sex abuse cases , heckeley told deutsche welle .
" since 2002 we have a directive from the german bishops conference that says what you have to do in case sexual abuse is suspected , " heckeley said .
people with complaints are referred to professionals - psychologists , doctors and legal experts - who are hired by each bishopric , and are qualified to advise people who want to come forward with sex abuse allegations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abuse allegedly took place at some german jesuit schools " our aim is to listen to the victims and help them get justice , even when the cases are years or decades old .
they need somebody to listen to them , and the most important thing is that they get justice , " he said .
the response from the church will differ case by case , but the church " urgently advises " victims to take perpetrators to court .
unfortunately , heckeley said , victims often do n't want to do this because it can be too upsetting to their families , and " can destroy their entire social environment - it can traumatize them a second time .
you have to be careful . "
prosecution is a right , not an obligation while there is a right to prosecute , there is no obligation to do so - a situation that is currently under hot debate .
still , heckeley said experts recommend caution , since " the dangers -lrb- of forced prosecution -rrb- could outweigh the risks . "
no matter what shape the case takes in federal court , allegations of abuse are always looked into by a church tribunal out of rome .
yet in the murphy case , ratzinger 's deputy at the time advised a secret disciplinary trial at first .
he later reversed that decision , and in 1998 , murphy appealed directly to ratzinger for clemency , shortly before he died .
all the calls for openness , trials and apologies are well and good , victims-rights advocates say , but they do n't go far enough .
what is missing on the part of the church is a departure from the secrecy , and a willingness to admit its own cover-ups .
last week , following revelations of pedophilia that rocked the irish catholic church , the pope issued a long-awaited apology to victims of child sex abuse in ireland .
he acknowledged " serious mistakes " on the part of the church , as well as the sense of betrayal in the church felt by victims and their families .
victims ' groups start protests but irish victims ' groups felt that the apology fell short of their demands ; they called for the church to acknowledge its role in covering up abuse .
maeve lewis , executive director of irish victims ' rights group one in four , told bbc news , " we are really disappointed that there is no acknowledgement that the cover-up and the policy of cover-up in the church went right to the the vatican . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope finally addressed the cases of abuse in ireland and in germany , victims-rights advocates were incensed that the apology failed to mention cases of church pedophilia in munich that have dominated headlines for weeks .
the church has had to contend with cover-up allegations in that city while ratzinger was the city 's archbishop from 1977 to 1981 .
on thursday members of the us activist organization snap - survivor network of those abused by priests - launched a demonstration in the vatican , holding up signs that said " stop the secrecy now . "
they demanded that pope benedict open up all files on pedophile catholic clerics worldwide , and called for all " predator priests " to be defrocked .
the group has also protested in germany , austria , and the netherlands , all countries recently hit by church sex abuse scandals .
one official 's stance " i would ask the pope if he would please open up the files from the congregation of the doctrine of the faith and turn over all the information to the police , " barbara blaine , the president of snap , told reuters news service .
a trickle of acknowledgements have begun , and some say a wave may be coming .
earlier this month , the german church 's representative responsible for dealing with cases of abuse , bishop stephan ackermann , also acknowledged severe failures .
" where there was no will toward explanation and where the person who committed the crime was simply moved to a new post , we have to admit , in a whole array of cases , that there was a cover-up , " he told the rhein zeitung newspaper .
and this week , german news magazine focus reported that archbishop zollitsch , the leader of the german roman catholic church , also admitted cases of child sex abuse were known and covered up .
" yes , we did have that , " he said .
many see the catholic church as so damaged by these allegations that it will be hard for the institution to regain its footing .
" we can only survive this situation with openness and honesty , " says the cologne archbishopric 's heckeley .
" we have to try to win people 's trust that way . "

conflict between european leaders over imf involvement looms . in an address to the german parliament on thursday , german chancellor angela merkel outlined her support for international monetary fund assistance to try to solve greece 's debt problems - and urged other european leaders to change their minds on the issue .
" europe can not face this crisis alone , " said merkel . the german chancellor said she would only support eu financial assistance if it was with additional support from the imf .
however she said this should occur as a " last resort . "
during her statement , merkel also outlined germany 's wishes for further sanctions for countries that break budget rules .
she said greece had shown how vulnerable the eu was to economic mismanagement in a single country .
she stressed that europe " could not afford to water down the stability pact . "
merkel added that germany was committed to the eu , saying that the countries " together were stronger . "
france-germany divide ?
ahead of thursday 's eu summit , european leaders are divided on how aid can best be pledged to support greece - and other eu countries that may face financial troubles in the future .
offering direct financial assistance to greece is an unpopular move in germany , as many german taxpayers believe they already contribute enough to the eu .
merkel 's pro-imf stance has set a clear distinction between germany and other eu countries , including france , who have said any financial support for greece should come from within the european union .
european commission president jose manuel barroso has urged leaders to come to an agreement swiftly in order to boost market confidence in the euro zone .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de research -pipe- 25.03.2010 german researchers decode unrecognized dna from ancient humanoid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists analyzed dna from a fossil finger found in siberia when researchers discovered a fossil finger in a siberian cave , they found an ancestor - and perhaps a new human species .
johannes krause told deutsche welle about his team 's efforts to analyze the ancient dna . the new report was published on the website of science journal " nature " on march 24 .
leipzig researchers johannes krause and svante pääbo of the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology co-authored the international project . deutsche welle : how did you find a bone fragment from the altai mountains ?
johannes krause : for several years , we 've been involved in a very productive collaboration with our colleagues in russia .
we received bones from them that we later identified as neanderthal bones , for example , thus showing that neanderthals lived in southern siberia , too - not just in europe .
and in recent years , we 've received other bone samples for genetic testing .
here in leipzig , we 've taken our neanderthal research to the genetic level , so we 've been examining the dna of ancient man -lrb- ... -rrb- to help us learn how prehistoric man is related to modern-day man or other forms of early man . the neaderthal has their own dna at least for portions of the genome , so they are n't our direct ancestors ; they 're more an extinct cousin of sorts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dna analysis of homonid species could shed light on their ties to modern man and during our search for new neanderthal bones , we stumbled upon these bones with dna that belonged neither to neanderthals nor modern man .
it constitutes a new form of prehistoric man that had never been discovered - something we had never seen from a genetic standpoint and that we could n't categorize as an existing form of prehistoric man .
everyone 's calling this a sensation - would you call it that ?
i think it 's a sensation because until now we had the potential to do genetic research on two different forms of man - now there 's a third .
so that 's pretty sensational , particularly as it ca n't be classified according to any existing form of prehistoric man .
unfortunately , we do n't have a complete skeleton - just the bone from a pinkie finger .
it 's a tiny fragment that ca n't tell us much about the morphology .
therefore we still do n't know what this prehistoric man looked like - did he perhaps look like a neanderthal , modern man or a homo erectus ?
so we lack quite a lot of information , but we now have the potential to study the dna of this prehistoric man ; we have the potential to examine the entire genome and genetic material from this prehistoric man and compare it to modern man and the neanderthals , for instance .
and through that , we can learn a lot .
for example , what kind of interactions occurred between these three species of prehistoric man ?
we could also show that they lived in the same place at the same time - that 's another sensation for us .
that means , we find neanderthal bones in a nearby cave , and in same layer in which we found the bones of the new human form , we find archaeological artifacts that appear to have come from modern man - ornaments and jewelry that are only associated with modern man .
so it looks as though these three forms of early man lived in the same place at the same time .
you can then imagine any number of scenarios where gene flow could have occurred between these three populations , and that is certainly something that 's very interesting to analyze on a genetic level .
is finding something like this an anthropologist 's dream come true ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian researchers discovered the fossil bone at a site in the altai mountains in siberia yes , this is probably a once-in-a-lifetime chance - discovering a new species or form of prehistoric man .
it 's certainly quite exciting for us .
of course , we should note that we 're not calling it a new species - we 're only talking about a new " form . "
so far , we 've only analyzed a tiny portion of the dna , and only when the entire genome or a large part of the genome has been analyzed will we be able to tell whether it 's something completely new or different , like modern man or the neanderthals , for instance .
and until then , we 're not going to talk about a new species .
but all signs indicate that we 're actually dealing with an entirely knew species of man here .
then what do you know already ; whose bones are they ?
so far , we can only say that this dna - the dna we 've studied so far from this prehistoric man - has about 1 million years between it and the dna of modern man .
so that means that these two forms , modern man and prehistoric man , spent at least 1 million years developing in very different ways .
based on our genetic tests , we can also say that modern man is more closely related to the neanderthals than he is to this new form of prehistoric man - we 're seeing two times as many differences between the dna of modern man and this new form than we do with modern man and the neanderthals .
this represents a completely different line that split off from modern man much earlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mitochondrial dna decoding showed differences between the ancestor and modern man do you know if it was a woman or a man ?
we 've named it " x woman . "
" x " stands for the unknown , since we ca n't classify it so easiliy , as i 'd mentioned . and " woman " because we examined the mitochondrial dna - the dna from the powerhouse of the cell - and that 's always passed down from the mother to the child .
so we 're looking at the female lineage , and so we adopted a feministic position .
but since we have yet to examine the entire genetic material , we still do n't know whether it 's a man or a woman .
and this process for examining the mitochrondrial dna - that 's something you developed ?
yes , my boss svante pääbo studied mitochrondrial dna from prehistoric man for the first time in the ' 90s - at the time , from neanderthals .
in recent years , we have refined these methods to help us obtain more information more quickly - and of a higher qualitative value .
but we 've really kicked this kind of research into high gear in recent years .
what 's next ?
what else do you plan to study - and what do you hope to find ?
we plan to study the entire genome - this prehistoric man 's entire genetic material .
we do n't just want to look at this tiny fraction , rather we will examine the entire genome to learn more about this prehistoric man and to see how he was related to modern man and to neanderthals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the neanderthals share many commonalities with modern man was there potential gene flow between these three populations ?
and what can we learn about phenotypical features - what color hair did he have ?
we 'll look at other kinds of features that we can reconstruct based on dna sequencing .
and who gets to keep the bone once you conclude your research ? whatever 's left of the bone will certainly be sent back to novosibirsk , to the museum responsible for the entire excavation .

as iran continues to develop its nuclear program , analysts fear that an arms race in the middle east could begin .
if sanctions continue to fail , these analysts say that military action is necessary to prevent this . as world powers negotiate on how to deal with iran 's continuing development of its nuclear program , concerns about a nuclear arms race in the middle east , prompted by iran 's determination to build nuclear weapons , are mounting .
officials from the united states , russia , france , britain , germany and china participated in a conference call yesterday to discuss how to handle iran 's flaunting of international demands to cease nuclear work .
these countries , while attempting to deter iran from continued nuclear development by offering tehran incentives to allow more oversight of its program , are also threatening sanctions if tehran does not stop work toward producing weapons grade uranium . iran , which has faced sanctions from the united nations three times , says it is developing its nuclear program for peaceful purposes and has refused to allow inspectors from the international atomic energy agency access to its nuclear facilities .
it is party to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty , but repeatedly has been found non-compliant .
there is growing fear that iran will not stop work toward a weapon unless drastic action is taken .
middle east experts said that if iran continues on its current path , a nuclear arms race in the region could ensue . ' ' turkey , algeria , egypt , and saudi arabia are all potential candidates to develop nuclear weapons , " abdulaziz sager , chairman of the gulf research center in dubai , told deutsche welle .
' ' and they will say , if -lsb- nuclear weapon development -rsb- is permitted in iran , why ca n't we develop weapons as well ? "

a nuclear-armed iran is widely seen as a direct threat to israel , as iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has pledged to ' ' wipe israel off the map . "
israel has not ruled out preemptive strikes against suspected nuclear sites inside iran if development continues .
but iran 's possession of a nuclear weapon has implications for other countries in the region as well , mustafa alani , senior advisor and program director at the gulf research center says .
' ' the question is not whether iran uses the bomb against other countries in the middle east , " alani told deutsche welle .
' ' but the question is whether iran has control of the region , and the political consequences of a dominant iran . "
the political balance of power in the middle east at the current time is relatively stable .
israel has a dominant military and nuclear weapons , as well as the backing of the united states .
economic power is diversified , as a number of states have thriving oil industries .
the region is also politically stable , with the exception of iraq , which is trying to sustain a functioning government in the wake of the iraq war .
a nuclear-armed and increasingly belligerent iran would dramatically alter this balance .
ahmadinejad would hold disproportionate clout , and if recent belligerent statements toward israel are to be believed , seems to be willing to use it .
preemption vs. nuclear war in the past , analysts have told deutsche welle that israel is unlikely to carry out unilateral military action against iran , as any action is not likely to destroy iran 's entire nuclear infrastructure .
last month , chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff admiral mike mullen told congress ' ' no strike , however effective , will be in and of itself decisive . "
however , the gulf center 's sager says that if economic sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a convoy of israeli military armored vehicles on the gaza strip. continue to fail , preemptive military action to stop iran from acquiring nuclear weapons is needed .
the power iran would have would be too great and too much of a risk to the region . ' ' if i had to chose between living with iran as a constant threat , or a military strike with limited retaliation , i can more easily live with the military option , " he said .
' ' we have already lived through wars , and no countries were erased from the map . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de research -pipe- 25.03.2010 german researchers decode unrecognized dna from ancient humanoid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists analyzed dna from a fossil finger found in siberia when researchers discovered a fossil finger in a siberian cave , they found an ancestor - and perhaps a new human species .
johannes krause told deutsche welle about his team 's efforts to analyze the ancient dna . the new report was published on the website of science journal " nature " on march 24 .
leipzig researchers johannes krause and svante pääbo of the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology co-authored the international project . deutsche welle : how did you find a bone fragment from the altai mountains ?
johannes krause : for several years , we 've been involved in a very productive collaboration with our colleagues in russia .
we received bones from them that we later identified as neanderthal bones , for example , thus showing that neanderthals lived in southern siberia , too - not just in europe .
and in recent years , we 've received other bone samples for genetic testing .
here in leipzig , we 've taken our neanderthal research to the genetic level , so we 've been examining the dna of ancient man -lrb- ... -rrb- to help us learn how prehistoric man is related to modern-day man or other forms of early man . the neaderthal has their own dna at least for portions of the genome , so they are n't our direct ancestors ; they 're more an extinct cousin of sorts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dna analysis of homonid species could shed light on their ties to modern man and during our search for new neanderthal bones , we stumbled upon these bones with dna that belonged neither to neanderthals nor modern man .
it constitutes a new form of prehistoric man that had never been discovered - something we had never seen from a genetic standpoint and that we could n't categorize as an existing form of prehistoric man .
everyone 's calling this a sensation - would you call it that ?
i think it 's a sensation because until now we had the potential to do genetic research on two different forms of man - now there 's a third .
so that 's pretty sensational , particularly as it ca n't be classified according to any existing form of prehistoric man .
unfortunately , we do n't have a complete skeleton - just the bone from a pinkie finger .
it 's a tiny fragment that ca n't tell us much about the morphology .
therefore we still do n't know what this prehistoric man looked like - did he perhaps look like a neanderthal , modern man or a homo erectus ?
so we lack quite a lot of information , but we now have the potential to study the dna of this prehistoric man ; we have the potential to examine the entire genome and genetic material from this prehistoric man and compare it to modern man and the neanderthals , for instance .
and through that , we can learn a lot .
for example , what kind of interactions occurred between these three species of prehistoric man ?
we could also show that they lived in the same place at the same time - that 's another sensation for us .
that means , we find neanderthal bones in a nearby cave , and in same layer in which we found the bones of the new human form , we find archaeological artifacts that appear to have come from modern man - ornaments and jewelry that are only associated with modern man .
so it looks as though these three forms of early man lived in the same place at the same time .
you can then imagine any number of scenarios where gene flow could have occurred between these three populations , and that is certainly something that 's very interesting to analyze on a genetic level .
is finding something like this an anthropologist 's dream come true ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian researchers discovered the fossil bone at a site in the altai mountains in siberia yes , this is probably a once-in-a-lifetime chance - discovering a new species or form of prehistoric man .
it 's certainly quite exciting for us .
of course , we should note that we 're not calling it a new species - we 're only talking about a new " form . "
so far , we 've only analyzed a tiny portion of the dna , and only when the entire genome or a large part of the genome has been analyzed will we be able to tell whether it 's something completely new or different , like modern man or the neanderthals , for instance .
and until then , we 're not going to talk about a new species .
but all signs indicate that we 're actually dealing with an entirely knew species of man here .
then what do you know already ; whose bones are they ?
so far , we can only say that this dna - the dna we 've studied so far from this prehistoric man - has about 1 million years between it and the dna of modern man .
so that means that these two forms , modern man and prehistoric man , spent at least 1 million years developing in very different ways .
based on our genetic tests , we can also say that modern man is more closely related to the neanderthals than he is to this new form of prehistoric man - we 're seeing two times as many differences between the dna of modern man and this new form than we do with modern man and the neanderthals .
this represents a completely different line that split off from modern man much earlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mitochondrial dna decoding showed differences between the ancestor and modern man do you know if it was a woman or a man ?
we 've named it " x woman . "
" x " stands for the unknown , since we ca n't classify it so easiliy , as i 'd mentioned . and " woman " because we examined the mitochondrial dna - the dna from the powerhouse of the cell - and that 's always passed down from the mother to the child .
so we 're looking at the female lineage , and so we adopted a feministic position .
but since we have yet to examine the entire genetic material , we still do n't know whether it 's a man or a woman .
and this process for examining the mitochrondrial dna - that 's something you developed ?
yes , my boss svante pääbo studied mitochrondrial dna from prehistoric man for the first time in the ' 90s - at the time , from neanderthals .
in recent years , we have refined these methods to help us obtain more information more quickly - and of a higher qualitative value .
but we 've really kicked this kind of research into high gear in recent years .
what 's next ?
what else do you plan to study - and what do you hope to find ?
we plan to study the entire genome - this prehistoric man 's entire genetic material .
we do n't just want to look at this tiny fraction , rather we will examine the entire genome to learn more about this prehistoric man and to see how he was related to modern man and to neanderthals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the neanderthals share many commonalities with modern man was there potential gene flow between these three populations ?
and what can we learn about phenotypical features - what color hair did he have ?
we 'll look at other kinds of features that we can reconstruct based on dna sequencing .
and who gets to keep the bone once you conclude your research ? whatever 's left of the bone will certainly be sent back to novosibirsk , to the museum responsible for the entire excavation .
that said , it 's not a spectacular bone - it 's only as large as cherry pit .
so it 's a very tiny fragment and it might not be all that interesting to look at .

meanwhile , activists say the church should take more responsibility for its wayward leaders .
either way , the situation surrounding sexual abuse scandals in the catholic church is like a modern-day hydra myth - no sooner is one scandal addressed than another rises up to take its place .
with europe 's catholics still reeling from a series of alleged child-molestation cover-ups , news broke in the united states of a 1996 case that touches the upper echelons of church power .
failure to defrock in the latest case to hit headlines , the new york times reported on thursday that pope benedict xvi ignored allegations of child sex abuse back in the 1990s .
at the time , he was head of the congregation of the doctrine of the faith , the vatican body that judges cases of sexual abuse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victims recently took to the streets of the vatican to protest the paper reported that the pope - then cardinal joseph ratzinger - failed to defrock rev. lawrence murphy , a priest in milwaukee who had been accused of sexually abusing some 200 deaf boys , despite the fact that he was aware of the allegations .
murphy worked from 1950 to 1977 at a school for the deaf and died in 1998 .
a spokesman for the vatican , federico lombardi , argued that rome was n't informed of the case until 20 years after it happened , and said that in the end the church did n't take action against murphy because he had confessed the acts and because he was very ill and close to the end of his life .
records uncovered by the times show that three different bishops were aware of the accusations , but that the case was not brought to trial .
still , lombardi told news service reuters that the church is eager to see abusive priests brought to justice .
church calls in professional help this is a feeling shared by christoph heckeley , a spokesman for the archbishopric of cologne , germany .
the catholic church in germany has had a directive for the past eight years that urges prosecution in sex abuse cases , heckeley told deutsche welle .
" since 2002 we have a directive from the german bishops conference that says what you have to do in case sexual abuse is suspected , " heckeley said .
people with complaints are referred to professionals - psychologists , doctors and legal experts - who are hired by each bishopric , and are qualified to advise people who want to come forward with sex abuse allegations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abuse allegedly took place at some german jesuit schools " our aim is to listen to the victims and help them get justice , even when the cases are years or decades old .
they need somebody to listen to them , and the most important thing is that they get justice , " he said .
the response from the church will differ case by case , but the church " urgently advises " victims to take perpetrators to court .
unfortunately , heckeley said , victims often do n't want to do this because it can be too upsetting to their families , and " can destroy their entire social environment - it can traumatize them a second time .
you have to be careful . "
prosecution is a right , not an obligation while there is a right to prosecute , there is no obligation to do so - a situation that is currently under hot debate .
still , heckeley said experts recommend caution , since " the dangers -lrb- of forced prosecution -rrb- could outweigh the risks . "
no matter what shape the case takes in federal court , allegations of abuse are always looked into by a church tribunal out of rome .
yet in the murphy case , ratzinger 's deputy at the time advised a secret disciplinary trial at first .
he later reversed that decision , and in 1998 , murphy appealed directly to ratzinger for clemency , shortly before he died .
all the calls for openness , trials and apologies are well and good , victims-rights advocates say , but they do n't go far enough .
what is missing on the part of the church is a departure from the secrecy , and a willingness to admit its own cover-ups .
last week , following revelations of pedophilia that rocked the irish catholic church , the pope issued a long-awaited apology to victims of child sex abuse in ireland .
he acknowledged " serious mistakes " on the part of the church , as well as the sense of betrayal in the church felt by victims and their families .
victims ' groups start protests but irish victims ' groups felt that the apology fell short of their demands ; they called for the church to acknowledge its role in covering up abuse .
maeve lewis , executive director of irish victims ' rights group one in four , told bbc news , " we are really disappointed that there is no acknowledgement that the cover-up and the policy of cover-up in the church went right to the the vatican . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope finally addressed the cases of abuse in ireland and in germany , victims-rights advocates were incensed that the apology failed to mention cases of church pedophilia in munich that have dominated headlines for weeks .
the church has had to contend with cover-up allegations in that city while ratzinger was the city 's archbishop from 1977 to 1981 .
on thursday members of the us activist organization snap - survivor network of those abused by priests - launched a demonstration in the vatican , holding up signs that said " stop the secrecy now . "
they demanded that pope benedict open up all files on pedophile catholic clerics worldwide , and called for all " predator priests " to be defrocked .
the group has also protested in germany , austria , and the netherlands , all countries recently hit by church sex abuse scandals .
one official 's stance " i would ask the pope if he would please open up the files from the congregation of the doctrine of the faith and turn over all the information to the police , " barbara blaine , the president of snap , told reuters news service .
a trickle of acknowledgements have begun , and some say a wave may be coming .
earlier this month , the german church 's representative responsible for dealing with cases of abuse , bishop stephan ackermann , also acknowledged severe failures .
" where there was no will toward explanation and where the person who committed the crime was simply moved to a new post , we have to admit , in a whole array of cases , that there was a cover-up , " he told the rhein zeitung newspaper .
and this week , german news magazine focus reported that archbishop zollitsch , the leader of the german roman catholic church , also admitted cases of child sex abuse were known and covered up .
" yes , we did have that , " he said .
many see the catholic church as so damaged by these allegations that it will be hard for the institution to regain its footing .
" we can only survive this situation with openness and honesty , " says the cologne archbishopric 's heckeley .
" we have to try to win people 's trust that way . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de research -pipe- 25.03.2010 german researchers decode unrecognized dna from ancient humanoid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists analyzed dna from a fossil finger found in siberia when researchers discovered a fossil finger in a siberian cave , they found an ancestor - and perhaps a new human species .
johannes krause told deutsche welle about his team 's efforts to analyze the ancient dna . the new report was published on the website of science journal " nature " on march 24 .
leipzig researchers johannes krause and svante pääbo of the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology co-authored the international project . deutsche welle : how did you find a bone fragment from the altai mountains ?
johannes krause : for several years , we 've been involved in a very productive collaboration with our colleagues in russia .
we received bones from them that we later identified as neanderthal bones , for example , thus showing that neanderthals lived in southern siberia , too - not just in europe .
and in recent years , we 've received other bone samples for genetic testing .
here in leipzig , we 've taken our neanderthal research to the genetic level , so we 've been examining the dna of ancient man -lrb- ... -rrb- to help us learn how prehistoric man is related to modern-day man or other forms of early man . the neaderthal has their own dna at least for portions of the genome , so they are n't our direct ancestors ; they 're more an extinct cousin of sorts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dna analysis of homonid species could shed light on their ties to modern man and during our search for new neanderthal bones , we stumbled upon these bones with dna that belonged neither to neanderthals nor modern man .
it constitutes a new form of prehistoric man that had never been discovered - something we had never seen from a genetic standpoint and that we could n't categorize as an existing form of prehistoric man .
everyone 's calling this a sensation - would you call it that ?
i think it 's a sensation because until now we had the potential to do genetic research on two different forms of man - now there 's a third .
so that 's pretty sensational , particularly as it ca n't be classified according to any existing form of prehistoric man .
unfortunately , we do n't have a complete skeleton - just the bone from a pinkie finger .
it 's a tiny fragment that ca n't tell us much about the morphology .
therefore we still do n't know what this prehistoric man looked like - did he perhaps look like a neanderthal , modern man or a homo erectus ?
so we lack quite a lot of information , but we now have the potential to study the dna of this prehistoric man ; we have the potential to examine the entire genome and genetic material from this prehistoric man and compare it to modern man and the neanderthals , for instance .
and through that , we can learn a lot .
for example , what kind of interactions occurred between these three species of prehistoric man ?
we could also show that they lived in the same place at the same time - that 's another sensation for us .
that means , we find neanderthal bones in a nearby cave , and in same layer in which we found the bones of the new human form , we find archaeological artifacts that appear to have come from modern man - ornaments and jewelry that are only associated with modern man .
so it looks as though these three forms of early man lived in the same place at the same time .
you can then imagine any number of scenarios where gene flow could have occurred between these three populations , and that is certainly something that 's very interesting to analyze on a genetic level .
is finding something like this an anthropologist 's dream come true ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian researchers discovered the fossil bone at a site in the altai mountains in siberia yes , this is probably a once-in-a-lifetime chance - discovering a new species or form of prehistoric man .
it 's certainly quite exciting for us .
of course , we should note that we 're not calling it a new species - we 're only talking about a new " form . "
so far , we 've only analyzed a tiny portion of the dna , and only when the entire genome or a large part of the genome has been analyzed will we be able to tell whether it 's something completely new or different , like modern man or the neanderthals , for instance .
and until then , we 're not going to talk about a new species .
but all signs indicate that we 're actually dealing with an entirely knew species of man here .
then what do you know already ; whose bones are they ?
so far , we can only say that this dna - the dna we 've studied so far from this prehistoric man - has about 1 million years between it and the dna of modern man .
so that means that these two forms , modern man and prehistoric man , spent at least 1 million years developing in very different ways .
based on our genetic tests , we can also say that modern man is more closely related to the neanderthals than he is to this new form of prehistoric man - we 're seeing two times as many differences between the dna of modern man and this new form than we do with modern man and the neanderthals .
this represents a completely different line that split off from modern man much earlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mitochondrial dna decoding showed differences between the ancestor and modern man do you know if it was a woman or a man ?
we 've named it " x woman . "
" x " stands for the unknown , since we ca n't classify it so easiliy , as i 'd mentioned . and " woman " because we examined the mitochondrial dna - the dna from the powerhouse of the cell - and that 's always passed down from the mother to the child .
so we 're looking at the female lineage , and so we adopted a feministic position .
but since we have yet to examine the entire genetic material , we still do n't know whether it 's a man or a woman .
and this process for examining the mitochrondrial dna - that 's something you developed ?
yes , my boss svante pääbo studied mitochrondrial dna from prehistoric man for the first time in the ' 90s - at the time , from neanderthals .
in recent years , we have refined these methods to help us obtain more information more quickly - and of a higher qualitative value .
but we 've really kicked this kind of research into high gear in recent years .
what 's next ?
what else do you plan to study - and what do you hope to find ?
we plan to study the entire genome - this prehistoric man 's entire genetic material .
we do n't just want to look at this tiny fraction , rather we will examine the entire genome to learn more about this prehistoric man and to see how he was related to modern man and to neanderthals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the neanderthals share many commonalities with modern man was there potential gene flow between these three populations ?
and what can we learn about phenotypical features - what color hair did he have ?
we 'll look at other kinds of features that we can reconstruct based on dna sequencing .
and who gets to keep the bone once you conclude your research ? whatever 's left of the bone will certainly be sent back to novosibirsk , to the museum responsible for the entire excavation .
that said , it 's not a spectacular bone - it 's only as large as cherry pit .
so it 's a very tiny fragment and it might not be all that interesting to look at .

we received bones from them that we later identified as neanderthal bones , for example , thus showing that neanderthals lived in southern siberia , too - not just in europe .
and in recent years , we 've received other bone samples for genetic testing .
here in leipzig , we 've taken our neanderthal research to the genetic level , so we 've been examining the dna of ancient man -lrb- ... -rrb- to help us learn how prehistoric man is related to modern-day man or other forms of early man . the neaderthal has their own dna at least for portions of the genome , so they are n't our direct ancestors ; they 're more an extinct cousin of sorts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dna analysis of homonid species could shed light on their ties to modern man and during our search for new neanderthal bones , we stumbled upon these bones with dna that belonged neither to neanderthals nor modern man .
it constitutes a new form of prehistoric man that had never been discovered - something we had never seen from a genetic standpoint and that we could n't categorize as an existing form of prehistoric man .
everyone 's calling this a sensation - would you call it that ?
i think it 's a sensation because until now we had the potential to do genetic research on two different forms of man - now there 's a third .
so that 's pretty sensational , particularly as it ca n't be classified according to any existing form of prehistoric man .
unfortunately , we do n't have a complete skeleton - just the bone from a pinkie finger .
it 's a tiny fragment that ca n't tell us much about the morphology .
therefore we still do n't know what this prehistoric man looked like - did he perhaps look like a neanderthal , modern man or a homo erectus ?
so we lack quite a lot of information , but we now have the potential to study the dna of this prehistoric man ; we have the potential to examine the entire genome and genetic material from this prehistoric man and compare it to modern man and the neanderthals , for instance .
and through that , we can learn a lot .
for example , what kind of interactions occurred between these three species of prehistoric man ?
we could also show that they lived in the same place at the same time - that 's another sensation for us .
that means , we find neanderthal bones in a nearby cave , and in same layer in which we found the bones of the new human form , we find archaeological artifacts that appear to have come from modern man - ornaments and jewelry that are only associated with modern man .
so it looks as though these three forms of early man lived in the same place at the same time .
you can then imagine any number of scenarios where gene flow could have occurred between these three populations , and that is certainly something that 's very interesting to analyze on a genetic level .
is finding something like this an anthropologist 's dream come true ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian researchers discovered the fossil bone at a site in the altai mountains in siberia yes , this is probably a once-in-a-lifetime chance - discovering a new species or form of prehistoric man .
it 's certainly quite exciting for us .
of course , we should note that we 're not calling it a new species - we 're only talking about a new " form . "
so far , we 've only analyzed a tiny portion of the dna , and only when the entire genome or a large part of the genome has been analyzed will we be able to tell whether it 's something completely new or different , like modern man or the neanderthals , for instance .
and until then , we 're not going to talk about a new species .
but all signs indicate that we 're actually dealing with an entirely knew species of man here .
then what do you know already ; whose bones are they ?
so far , we can only say that this dna - the dna we 've studied so far from this prehistoric man - has about 1 million years between it and the dna of modern man .
so that means that these two forms , modern man and prehistoric man , spent at least 1 million years developing in very different ways .
based on our genetic tests , we can also say that modern man is more closely related to the neanderthals than he is to this new form of prehistoric man - we 're seeing two times as many differences between the dna of modern man and this new form than we do with modern man and the neanderthals .
this represents a completely different line that split off from modern man much earlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mitochondrial dna decoding showed differences between the ancestor and modern man do you know if it was a woman or a man ?
we 've named it " x woman . "
" x " stands for the unknown , since we ca n't classify it so easiliy , as i 'd mentioned . and " woman " because we examined the mitochondrial dna - the dna from the powerhouse of the cell - and that 's always passed down from the mother to the child .
so we 're looking at the female lineage , and so we adopted a feministic position .
but since we have yet to examine the entire genetic material , we still do n't know whether it 's a man or a woman .
and this process for examining the mitochrondrial dna - that 's something you developed ?
yes , my boss svante pääbo studied mitochrondrial dna from prehistoric man for the first time in the ' 90s - at the time , from neanderthals .
in recent years , we have refined these methods to help us obtain more information more quickly - and of a higher qualitative value .
but we 've really kicked this kind of research into high gear in recent years .
what 's next ?
what else do you plan to study - and what do you hope to find ?
we plan to study the entire genome - this prehistoric man 's entire genetic material .
we do n't just want to look at this tiny fraction , rather we will examine the entire genome to learn more about this prehistoric man and to see how he was related to modern man and to neanderthals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the neanderthals share many commonalities with modern man was there potential gene flow between these three populations ?
and what can we learn about phenotypical features - what color hair did he have ?
we 'll look at other kinds of features that we can reconstruct based on dna sequencing .
and who gets to keep the bone once you conclude your research ? whatever 's left of the bone will certainly be sent back to novosibirsk , to the museum responsible for the entire excavation .
that said , it 's not a spectacular bone - it 's only as large as cherry pit .
so it 's a very tiny fragment and it might not be all that interesting to look at .

so we lack quite a lot of information , but we now have the potential to study the dna of this prehistoric man ; we have the potential to examine the entire genome and genetic material from this prehistoric man and compare it to modern man and the neanderthals , for instance .
and through that , we can learn a lot .
for example , what kind of interactions occurred between these three species of prehistoric man ?
we could also show that they lived in the same place at the same time - that 's another sensation for us .
that means , we find neanderthal bones in a nearby cave , and in same layer in which we found the bones of the new human form , we find archaeological artifacts that appear to have come from modern man - ornaments and jewelry that are only associated with modern man .
so it looks as though these three forms of early man lived in the same place at the same time .
you can then imagine any number of scenarios where gene flow could have occurred between these three populations , and that is certainly something that 's very interesting to analyze on a genetic level .
is finding something like this an anthropologist 's dream come true ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian researchers discovered the fossil bone at a site in the altai mountains in siberia yes , this is probably a once-in-a-lifetime chance - discovering a new species or form of prehistoric man .
it 's certainly quite exciting for us .
of course , we should note that we 're not calling it a new species - we 're only talking about a new " form . "
so far , we 've only analyzed a tiny portion of the dna , and only when the entire genome or a large part of the genome has been analyzed will we be able to tell whether it 's something completely new or different , like modern man or the neanderthals , for instance .
and until then , we 're not going to talk about a new species .
but all signs indicate that we 're actually dealing with an entirely knew species of man here .
then what do you know already ; whose bones are they ?
so far , we can only say that this dna - the dna we 've studied so far from this prehistoric man - has about 1 million years between it and the dna of modern man .
so that means that these two forms , modern man and prehistoric man , spent at least 1 million years developing in very different ways .
based on our genetic tests , we can also say that modern man is more closely related to the neanderthals than he is to this new form of prehistoric man - we 're seeing two times as many differences between the dna of modern man and this new form than we do with modern man and the neanderthals .
this represents a completely different line that split off from modern man much earlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mitochondrial dna decoding showed differences between the ancestor and modern man do you know if it was a woman or a man ?
we 've named it " x woman . "
" x " stands for the unknown , since we ca n't classify it so easiliy , as i 'd mentioned . and " woman " because we examined the mitochondrial dna - the dna from the powerhouse of the cell - and that 's always passed down from the mother to the child .
so we 're looking at the female lineage , and so we adopted a feministic position .
but since we have yet to examine the entire genetic material , we still do n't know whether it 's a man or a woman .
and this process for examining the mitochrondrial dna - that 's something you developed ?
yes , my boss svante pääbo studied mitochrondrial dna from prehistoric man for the first time in the ' 90s - at the time , from neanderthals .
in recent years , we have refined these methods to help us obtain more information more quickly - and of a higher qualitative value .
but we 've really kicked this kind of research into high gear in recent years .
what 's next ?
what else do you plan to study - and what do you hope to find ?
we plan to study the entire genome - this prehistoric man 's entire genetic material .
we do n't just want to look at this tiny fraction , rather we will examine the entire genome to learn more about this prehistoric man and to see how he was related to modern man and to neanderthals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the neanderthals share many commonalities with modern man was there potential gene flow between these three populations ?
and what can we learn about phenotypical features - what color hair did he have ?
we 'll look at other kinds of features that we can reconstruct based on dna sequencing .
and who gets to keep the bone once you conclude your research ? whatever 's left of the bone will certainly be sent back to novosibirsk , to the museum responsible for the entire excavation .
that said , it 's not a spectacular bone - it 's only as large as cherry pit .
so it 's a very tiny fragment and it might not be all that interesting to look at .

johannes krause told deutsche welle about his team 's efforts to analyze the ancient dna . the new report was published on the website of science journal " nature " on march 24 .
leipzig researchers johannes krause and svante pääbo of the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology co-authored the international project . deutsche welle : how did you find a bone fragment from the altai mountains ?
johannes krause : for several years , we 've been involved in a very productive collaboration with our colleagues in russia .
we received bones from them that we later identified as neanderthal bones , for example , thus showing that neanderthals lived in southern siberia , too - not just in europe .
and in recent years , we 've received other bone samples for genetic testing .
here in leipzig , we 've taken our neanderthal research to the genetic level , so we 've been examining the dna of ancient man -lrb- ... -rrb- to help us learn how prehistoric man is related to modern-day man or other forms of early man . the neaderthal has their own dna at least for portions of the genome , so they are n't our direct ancestors ; they 're more an extinct cousin of sorts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dna analysis of homonid species could shed light on their ties to modern man and during our search for new neanderthal bones , we stumbled upon these bones with dna that belonged neither to neanderthals nor modern man .
it constitutes a new form of prehistoric man that had never been discovered - something we had never seen from a genetic standpoint and that we could n't categorize as an existing form of prehistoric man .
everyone 's calling this a sensation - would you call it that ?
i think it 's a sensation because until now we had the potential to do genetic research on two different forms of man - now there 's a third .
so that 's pretty sensational , particularly as it ca n't be classified according to any existing form of prehistoric man .
unfortunately , we do n't have a complete skeleton - just the bone from a pinkie finger .
it 's a tiny fragment that ca n't tell us much about the morphology .

but all signs indicate that we 're actually dealing with an entirely knew species of man here .
then what do you know already ; whose bones are they ?
so far , we can only say that this dna - the dna we 've studied so far from this prehistoric man - has about 1 million years between it and the dna of modern man .
so that means that these two forms , modern man and prehistoric man , spent at least 1 million years developing in very different ways .
based on our genetic tests , we can also say that modern man is more closely related to the neanderthals than he is to this new form of prehistoric man - we 're seeing two times as many differences between the dna of modern man and this new form than we do with modern man and the neanderthals .
this represents a completely different line that split off from modern man much earlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mitochondrial dna decoding showed differences between the ancestor and modern man do you know if it was a woman or a man ?
we 've named it " x woman . "
" x " stands for the unknown , since we ca n't classify it so easiliy , as i 'd mentioned . and " woman " because we examined the mitochondrial dna - the dna from the powerhouse of the cell - and that 's always passed down from the mother to the child .
so we 're looking at the female lineage , and so we adopted a feministic position .
but since we have yet to examine the entire genetic material , we still do n't know whether it 's a man or a woman .
and this process for examining the mitochrondrial dna - that 's something you developed ?
yes , my boss svante pääbo studied mitochrondrial dna from prehistoric man for the first time in the ' 90s - at the time , from neanderthals .
in recent years , we have refined these methods to help us obtain more information more quickly - and of a higher qualitative value .
but we 've really kicked this kind of research into high gear in recent years .
what 's next ?
what else do you plan to study - and what do you hope to find ?
we plan to study the entire genome - this prehistoric man 's entire genetic material .
we do n't just want to look at this tiny fraction , rather we will examine the entire genome to learn more about this prehistoric man and to see how he was related to modern man and to neanderthals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the neanderthals share many commonalities with modern man was there potential gene flow between these three populations ?
and what can we learn about phenotypical features - what color hair did he have ?
we 'll look at other kinds of features that we can reconstruct based on dna sequencing .
and who gets to keep the bone once you conclude your research ? whatever 's left of the bone will certainly be sent back to novosibirsk , to the museum responsible for the entire excavation .
that said , it 's not a spectacular bone - it 's only as large as cherry pit .
so it 's a very tiny fragment and it might not be all that interesting to look at .

newsweekly der spiegel reported thursday that the german foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- sent an e-mail describing the attack and the possible numbers killed .
" many civilians were killed -lrb- numbers vary between 50 and 100 -rrb- , " the e-mail read .
a government spokesman described the e-mail as an " unconfirmed preliminary report . "
he said the e-mail has already been handed over , along with other related documents , to the parliamentary inquiry , and that all of these documents confirm merkel 's stance that civilian casualties were never ruled out .
who knew what when ?
while merkel never claimed that civilians were not killed , it was days before she first spoke to parliament about the airstrike .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the civilian deaths and the government 's response have stirred controvery in germany much of the parliamentary inquiry is focused on who knew what about the bombing and when they knew it .
franz-josef jung , defense minister at the time of the airstrike , stepped down in november over an alleged cover-up of civilian deaths .
he had originally said that no civilians had been killed .
a nato report ultimately found that 142 civilians were killed in the bombing of the two oil tankers , which had been hijacked by taliban insurgents but then got stuck crossing a river bed .
the strike was ordered by a german colonel and carried out by nato aircraft . the bnd e-mail explained the high number of civilian casualties by saying that afghan citizens had taken the " opportunity " to siphon off fuel for their own use .
testifying to the parliamentary inquiry on thursday , jung once again denied that he had suppressed evidence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 25.03.2010 latest priest sex abuse scandal heats up responsibility debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as cardinal , ratzinger was informed but failed to act in the murphy case as the latest sexual abuse scandal in the catholic church gets uncomfortably close to the pope , questions of punishment versus apology in dealing with pedophile priests have once again emerged . the catholic church says the only way to face the burgeoning numbers of accusations is with complete honesty - and by urging victims to take legal action .
meanwhile , activists say the church should take more responsibility for its wayward leaders .
either way , the situation surrounding sexual abuse scandals in the catholic church is like a modern-day hydra myth - no sooner is one scandal addressed than another rises up to take its place .
with europe 's catholics still reeling from a series of alleged child-molestation cover-ups , news broke in the united states of a 1996 case that touches the upper echelons of church power .
failure to defrock in the latest case to hit headlines , the new york times reported on thursday that pope benedict xvi ignored allegations of child sex abuse back in the 1990s .
at the time , he was head of the congregation of the doctrine of the faith , the vatican body that judges cases of sexual abuse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victims recently took to the streets of the vatican to protest the paper reported that the pope - then cardinal joseph ratzinger - failed to defrock rev. lawrence murphy , a priest in milwaukee who had been accused of sexually abusing some 200 deaf boys , despite the fact that he was aware of the allegations .
murphy worked from 1950 to 1977 at a school for the deaf and died in 1998 .
a spokesman for the vatican , federico lombardi , argued that rome was n't informed of the case until 20 years after it happened , and said that in the end the church did n't take action against murphy because he had confessed the acts and because he was very ill and close to the end of his life .
records uncovered by the times show that three different bishops were aware of the accusations , but that the case was not brought to trial .
still , lombardi told news service reuters that the church is eager to see abusive priests brought to justice .
church calls in professional help this is a feeling shared by christoph heckeley , a spokesman for the archbishopric of cologne , germany .
the catholic church in germany has had a directive for the past eight years that urges prosecution in sex abuse cases , heckeley told deutsche welle .
" since 2002 we have a directive from the german bishops conference that says what you have to do in case sexual abuse is suspected , " heckeley said .
people with complaints are referred to professionals - psychologists , doctors and legal experts - who are hired by each bishopric , and are qualified to advise people who want to come forward with sex abuse allegations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abuse allegedly took place at some german jesuit schools " our aim is to listen to the victims and help them get justice , even when the cases are years or decades old .
they need somebody to listen to them , and the most important thing is that they get justice , " he said .
the response from the church will differ case by case , but the church " urgently advises " victims to take perpetrators to court .
unfortunately , heckeley said , victims often do n't want to do this because it can be too upsetting to their families , and " can destroy their entire social environment - it can traumatize them a second time .
you have to be careful . "
prosecution is a right , not an obligation while there is a right to prosecute , there is no obligation to do so - a situation that is currently under hot debate .
still , heckeley said experts recommend caution , since " the dangers -lrb- of forced prosecution -rrb- could outweigh the risks . "
no matter what shape the case takes in federal court , allegations of abuse are always looked into by a church tribunal out of rome .
yet in the murphy case , ratzinger 's deputy at the time advised a secret disciplinary trial at first .
he later reversed that decision , and in 1998 , murphy appealed directly to ratzinger for clemency , shortly before he died .
all the calls for openness , trials and apologies are well and good , victims-rights advocates say , but they do n't go far enough .
what is missing on the part of the church is a departure from the secrecy , and a willingness to admit its own cover-ups .
last week , following revelations of pedophilia that rocked the irish catholic church , the pope issued a long-awaited apology to victims of child sex abuse in ireland .
he acknowledged " serious mistakes " on the part of the church , as well as the sense of betrayal in the church felt by victims and their families .
victims ' groups start protests but irish victims ' groups felt that the apology fell short of their demands ; they called for the church to acknowledge its role in covering up abuse .
maeve lewis , executive director of irish victims ' rights group one in four , told bbc news , " we are really disappointed that there is no acknowledgement that the cover-up and the policy of cover-up in the church went right to the the vatican . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope finally addressed the cases of abuse in ireland and in germany , victims-rights advocates were incensed that the apology failed to mention cases of church pedophilia in munich that have dominated headlines for weeks .
the church has had to contend with cover-up allegations in that city while ratzinger was the city 's archbishop from 1977 to 1981 .
on thursday members of the us activist organization snap - survivor network of those abused by priests - launched a demonstration in the vatican , holding up signs that said " stop the secrecy now . "
they demanded that pope benedict open up all files on pedophile catholic clerics worldwide , and called for all " predator priests " to be defrocked .
the group has also protested in germany , austria , and the netherlands , all countries recently hit by church sex abuse scandals .
one official 's stance " i would ask the pope if he would please open up the files from the congregation of the doctrine of the faith and turn over all the information to the police , " barbara blaine , the president of snap , told reuters news service .
a trickle of acknowledgements have begun , and some say a wave may be coming .
earlier this month , the german church 's representative responsible for dealing with cases of abuse , bishop stephan ackermann , also acknowledged severe failures .
" where there was no will toward explanation and where the person who committed the crime was simply moved to a new post , we have to admit , in a whole array of cases , that there was a cover-up , " he told the rhein zeitung newspaper .
and this week , german news magazine focus reported that archbishop zollitsch , the leader of the german roman catholic church , also admitted cases of child sex abuse were known and covered up .
" yes , we did have that , " he said .
many see the catholic church as so damaged by these allegations that it will be hard for the institution to regain its footing .
" we can only survive this situation with openness and honesty , " says the cologne archbishopric 's heckeley .
" we have to try to win people 's trust that way . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victims recently took to the streets of the vatican to protest the paper reported that the pope - then cardinal joseph ratzinger - failed to defrock rev. lawrence murphy , a priest in milwaukee who had been accused of sexually abusing some 200 deaf boys , despite the fact that he was aware of the allegations .
murphy worked from 1950 to 1977 at a school for the deaf and died in 1998 .
a spokesman for the vatican , federico lombardi , argued that rome was n't informed of the case until 20 years after it happened , and said that in the end the church did n't take action against murphy because he had confessed the acts and because he was very ill and close to the end of his life .
records uncovered by the times show that three different bishops were aware of the accusations , but that the case was not brought to trial .
still , lombardi told news service reuters that the church is eager to see abusive priests brought to justice .
church calls in professional help this is a feeling shared by christoph heckeley , a spokesman for the archbishopric of cologne , germany .
the catholic church in germany has had a directive for the past eight years that urges prosecution in sex abuse cases , heckeley told deutsche welle .
" since 2002 we have a directive from the german bishops conference that says what you have to do in case sexual abuse is suspected , " heckeley said .
people with complaints are referred to professionals - psychologists , doctors and legal experts - who are hired by each bishopric , and are qualified to advise people who want to come forward with sex abuse allegations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abuse allegedly took place at some german jesuit schools " our aim is to listen to the victims and help them get justice , even when the cases are years or decades old .
they need somebody to listen to them , and the most important thing is that they get justice , " he said .
the response from the church will differ case by case , but the church " urgently advises " victims to take perpetrators to court .
unfortunately , heckeley said , victims often do n't want to do this because it can be too upsetting to their families , and " can destroy their entire social environment - it can traumatize them a second time .
you have to be careful . "
prosecution is a right , not an obligation while there is a right to prosecute , there is no obligation to do so - a situation that is currently under hot debate .
still , heckeley said experts recommend caution , since " the dangers -lrb- of forced prosecution -rrb- could outweigh the risks . "
no matter what shape the case takes in federal court , allegations of abuse are always looked into by a church tribunal out of rome .
yet in the murphy case , ratzinger 's deputy at the time advised a secret disciplinary trial at first .
he later reversed that decision , and in 1998 , murphy appealed directly to ratzinger for clemency , shortly before he died .
all the calls for openness , trials and apologies are well and good , victims-rights advocates say , but they do n't go far enough .
what is missing on the part of the church is a departure from the secrecy , and a willingness to admit its own cover-ups .
last week , following revelations of pedophilia that rocked the irish catholic church , the pope issued a long-awaited apology to victims of child sex abuse in ireland .
he acknowledged " serious mistakes " on the part of the church , as well as the sense of betrayal in the church felt by victims and their families .
victims ' groups start protests but irish victims ' groups felt that the apology fell short of their demands ; they called for the church to acknowledge its role in covering up abuse .
maeve lewis , executive director of irish victims ' rights group one in four , told bbc news , " we are really disappointed that there is no acknowledgement that the cover-up and the policy of cover-up in the church went right to the the vatican . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope finally addressed the cases of abuse in ireland and in germany , victims-rights advocates were incensed that the apology failed to mention cases of church pedophilia in munich that have dominated headlines for weeks .
the church has had to contend with cover-up allegations in that city while ratzinger was the city 's archbishop from 1977 to 1981 .
on thursday members of the us activist organization snap - survivor network of those abused by priests - launched a demonstration in the vatican , holding up signs that said " stop the secrecy now . "
they demanded that pope benedict open up all files on pedophile catholic clerics worldwide , and called for all " predator priests " to be defrocked .
the group has also protested in germany , austria , and the netherlands , all countries recently hit by church sex abuse scandals .
one official 's stance " i would ask the pope if he would please open up the files from the congregation of the doctrine of the faith and turn over all the information to the police , " barbara blaine , the president of snap , told reuters news service .
a trickle of acknowledgements have begun , and some say a wave may be coming .
earlier this month , the german church 's representative responsible for dealing with cases of abuse , bishop stephan ackermann , also acknowledged severe failures .
" where there was no will toward explanation and where the person who committed the crime was simply moved to a new post , we have to admit , in a whole array of cases , that there was a cover-up , " he told the rhein zeitung newspaper .
and this week , german news magazine focus reported that archbishop zollitsch , the leader of the german roman catholic church , also admitted cases of child sex abuse were known and covered up .
" yes , we did have that , " he said .
many see the catholic church as so damaged by these allegations that it will be hard for the institution to regain its footing .
" we can only survive this situation with openness and honesty , " says the cologne archbishopric 's heckeley .
" we have to try to win people 's trust that way . "

prosecution is a right , not an obligation while there is a right to prosecute , there is no obligation to do so - a situation that is currently under hot debate .
still , heckeley said experts recommend caution , since " the dangers -lrb- of forced prosecution -rrb- could outweigh the risks . "
no matter what shape the case takes in federal court , allegations of abuse are always looked into by a church tribunal out of rome .
yet in the murphy case , ratzinger 's deputy at the time advised a secret disciplinary trial at first .
he later reversed that decision , and in 1998 , murphy appealed directly to ratzinger for clemency , shortly before he died .
all the calls for openness , trials and apologies are well and good , victims-rights advocates say , but they do n't go far enough .
what is missing on the part of the church is a departure from the secrecy , and a willingness to admit its own cover-ups .
last week , following revelations of pedophilia that rocked the irish catholic church , the pope issued a long-awaited apology to victims of child sex abuse in ireland .
he acknowledged " serious mistakes " on the part of the church , as well as the sense of betrayal in the church felt by victims and their families .
victims ' groups start protests but irish victims ' groups felt that the apology fell short of their demands ; they called for the church to acknowledge its role in covering up abuse .
maeve lewis , executive director of irish victims ' rights group one in four , told bbc news , " we are really disappointed that there is no acknowledgement that the cover-up and the policy of cover-up in the church went right to the the vatican . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope finally addressed the cases of abuse in ireland and in germany , victims-rights advocates were incensed that the apology failed to mention cases of church pedophilia in munich that have dominated headlines for weeks .
the church has had to contend with cover-up allegations in that city while ratzinger was the city 's archbishop from 1977 to 1981 .
on thursday members of the us activist organization snap - survivor network of those abused by priests - launched a demonstration in the vatican , holding up signs that said " stop the secrecy now . "
they demanded that pope benedict open up all files on pedophile catholic clerics worldwide , and called for all " predator priests " to be defrocked .
the group has also protested in germany , austria , and the netherlands , all countries recently hit by church sex abuse scandals .
one official 's stance " i would ask the pope if he would please open up the files from the congregation of the doctrine of the faith and turn over all the information to the police , " barbara blaine , the president of snap , told reuters news service .
a trickle of acknowledgements have begun , and some say a wave may be coming .
earlier this month , the german church 's representative responsible for dealing with cases of abuse , bishop stephan ackermann , also acknowledged severe failures .
" where there was no will toward explanation and where the person who committed the crime was simply moved to a new post , we have to admit , in a whole array of cases , that there was a cover-up , " he told the rhein zeitung newspaper .
and this week , german news magazine focus reported that archbishop zollitsch , the leader of the german roman catholic church , also admitted cases of child sex abuse were known and covered up .
" yes , we did have that , " he said .
many see the catholic church as so damaged by these allegations that it will be hard for the institution to regain its footing .
" we can only survive this situation with openness and honesty , " says the cologne archbishopric 's heckeley .
" we have to try to win people 's trust that way . "

meanwhile , activists say the church should take more responsibility for its wayward leaders .
either way , the situation surrounding sexual abuse scandals in the catholic church is like a modern-day hydra myth - no sooner is one scandal addressed than another rises up to take its place .
with europe 's catholics still reeling from a series of alleged child-molestation cover-ups , news broke in the united states of a 1996 case that touches the upper echelons of church power .
failure to defrock in the latest case to hit headlines , the new york times reported on thursday that pope benedict xvi ignored allegations of child sex abuse back in the 1990s .
at the time , he was head of the congregation of the doctrine of the faith , the vatican body that judges cases of sexual abuse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victims recently took to the streets of the vatican to protest the paper reported that the pope - then cardinal joseph ratzinger - failed to defrock rev. lawrence murphy , a priest in milwaukee who had been accused of sexually abusing some 200 deaf boys , despite the fact that he was aware of the allegations .
murphy worked from 1950 to 1977 at a school for the deaf and died in 1998 .
a spokesman for the vatican , federico lombardi , argued that rome was n't informed of the case until 20 years after it happened , and said that in the end the church did n't take action against murphy because he had confessed the acts and because he was very ill and close to the end of his life .
records uncovered by the times show that three different bishops were aware of the accusations , but that the case was not brought to trial .
still , lombardi told news service reuters that the church is eager to see abusive priests brought to justice .
church calls in professional help this is a feeling shared by christoph heckeley , a spokesman for the archbishopric of cologne , germany .
the catholic church in germany has had a directive for the past eight years that urges prosecution in sex abuse cases , heckeley told deutsche welle .
" since 2002 we have a directive from the german bishops conference that says what you have to do in case sexual abuse is suspected , " heckeley said .
people with complaints are referred to professionals - psychologists , doctors and legal experts - who are hired by each bishopric , and are qualified to advise people who want to come forward with sex abuse allegations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abuse allegedly took place at some german jesuit schools " our aim is to listen to the victims and help them get justice , even when the cases are years or decades old .
they need somebody to listen to them , and the most important thing is that they get justice , " he said .
the response from the church will differ case by case , but the church " urgently advises " victims to take perpetrators to court .
unfortunately , heckeley said , victims often do n't want to do this because it can be too upsetting to their families , and " can destroy their entire social environment - it can traumatize them a second time .
you have to be careful . "
prosecution is a right , not an obligation while there is a right to prosecute , there is no obligation to do so - a situation that is currently under hot debate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 25.03.2010 erdogan calls for turkish schools in germany and dual citizenship großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 2.7 million people of turkish origin live in germany suggestions by turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan for more turkish schools in germany have been largely rejected by german officials as detrimental to integration . german officials have rejected calls by turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan to introduce turkish schools in germany .
" in turkey , we have german high schools - why should n't there be turkish high schools in germany ? "
erdogan asked in an interview with german weekly die zeit .
erdogan said that many of the almost three million people of turkish origin living in germany had problems with both languages , and offering education in turkish might also help their german .
" germany has not yet caught up with the times , " erdogan said .
" one must first have a firm command of one 's own language , that is to say , turkish , and that is unfortunately rarely the case . "
the federal government 's integration commissioner , maria boehmer , acknowledged the advantage pupils might gain if they could be fluent in two languages , but said learning german should take priority .
" only those who know german have a chance of social advancement , " boehmer , a christian democrat , told the daily berliner zeitung .
the head of the christian democratic party 's german-turkish forum in north-rhine westphalia was also skeptical .
" turkish secondary schools are a dead end for students , " buelent arslan told the daily koelner stadtanzeiger .
" to be successful in germany , a good level of german is essential , " arslan added .
tensions ahead of merkel visit the general secretary of the christian democrat 's bavarian sister party , the csu , said that erdogan was trying to use turkish people in germany to further his own political purposes .
" such demands are an affront in the run-up to his visit with our chancellor angela merkel , " alexander dobrindt told spiegel online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan will meet merkel next week in ankara chancellor angela merkel is due in ankara next monday for a two-day visit .
her relationship with erdogan is problematic , as germany does not favor full eu membership for turkey , calling for a ' privileged partnership ' instead .
turkey has repeatedly rejected anything but full membership in the bloc .
in berlin , which has the largest turkish community in germany , the council for education said the acquisition of turkish language was not necessarily conducive to integration .
it is the knowledge of german that counts , and often , turks in germany struggle to find skilled jobs because of a lack of good german , according to the council .
it also pointed out that there are already turkish grammar schools in germany , but they are privately funded .
some support erdogan 's comments found little support in the german media , but an editorial by daily sueddeutsche zeitung sees some merit in erdogan 's suggestion .
the newspaper pointed out that if more french schools were to be built in germany , it would be hailed as a symbol of franco-german friendship .
but germany seems to have a problem with the turkish language .
it does not " count for much " , according to sueddeutsche .
many companies are desperate to hire people with multiple language skills , so not giving turks the opportunity to study their language in-depth , was a " missed opportunity " , the paper claimed .
no dual citizenship erdogan also criticized the fact that germany does not allow dual citizenship unless the additional country is a member of the eu .
" i find it regrettable that germany is among the countries in the eu that does not allow dual citizenship , " he told die zeit .
a child of foreign parents can only obtain dual citizenship if one parent has lived in germany regularly for at least eight years .
but , at age 23 , the child needs to choose one nationality .
erdogan is no stranger to provocation .
in a speech in cologne in 2008 , erdogan said turks in germany can not be expected to ' assimilate ' and deny their turkish identity .
the comments were seen by many as a direct criticism of how germany treats people of turkish origin. svs / ng / dpa / apn / afp editor : matt hermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de survey finds many turks in germany feel ' unwanted ' most immigrants from turkey feel like foreigners not only in germany , but also in their homeland , a new survey has found .
many said they do not feel wanted in their adopted country .

-lrb- 26.06.2009 -rrb- which way will turkey turn , east or west ?

" in turkey , we have german high schools - why should n't there be turkish high schools in germany ? "
erdogan asked in an interview with german weekly die zeit .
erdogan said that many of the almost three million people of turkish origin living in germany had problems with both languages , and offering education in turkish might also help their german .
" germany has not yet caught up with the times , " erdogan said .
" one must first have a firm command of one 's own language , that is to say , turkish , and that is unfortunately rarely the case . "
the federal government 's integration commissioner , maria boehmer , acknowledged the advantage pupils might gain if they could be fluent in two languages , but said learning german should take priority .
" only those who know german have a chance of social advancement , " boehmer , a christian democrat , told the daily berliner zeitung .
the head of the christian democratic party 's german-turkish forum in north-rhine westphalia was also skeptical .
" turkish secondary schools are a dead end for students , " buelent arslan told the daily koelner stadtanzeiger .
" to be successful in germany , a good level of german is essential , " arslan added .
tensions ahead of merkel visit the general secretary of the christian democrat 's bavarian sister party , the csu , said that erdogan was trying to use turkish people in germany to further his own political purposes .

turkey has repeatedly rejected anything but full membership in the bloc .
in berlin , which has the largest turkish community in germany , the council for education said the acquisition of turkish language was not necessarily conducive to integration .
it is the knowledge of german that counts , and often , turks in germany struggle to find skilled jobs because of a lack of good german , according to the council .
it also pointed out that there are already turkish grammar schools in germany , but they are privately funded .
some support erdogan 's comments found little support in the german media , but an editorial by daily sueddeutsche zeitung sees some merit in erdogan 's suggestion .
the newspaper pointed out that if more french schools were to be built in germany , it would be hailed as a symbol of franco-german friendship .
but germany seems to have a problem with the turkish language .
it does not " count for much " , according to sueddeutsche .
many companies are desperate to hire people with multiple language skills , so not giving turks the opportunity to study their language in-depth , was a " missed opportunity " , the paper claimed .
no dual citizenship erdogan also criticized the fact that germany does not allow dual citizenship unless the additional country is a member of the eu .
" i find it regrettable that germany is among the countries in the eu that does not allow dual citizenship , " he told die zeit .
a child of foreign parents can only obtain dual citizenship if one parent has lived in germany regularly for at least eight years .
but , at age 23 , the child needs to choose one nationality .

" in turkey , we have german high schools - why should n't there be turkish high schools in germany ? "
erdogan asked in an interview with german weekly die zeit .
erdogan said that many of the almost three million people of turkish origin living in germany had problems with both languages , and offering education in turkish might also help their german .
" germany has not yet caught up with the times , " erdogan said .
" one must first have a firm command of one 's own language , that is to say , turkish , and that is unfortunately rarely the case . "
the federal government 's integration commissioner , maria boehmer , acknowledged the advantage pupils might gain if they could be fluent in two languages , but said learning german should take priority .

with their bundesliga and champions league campaigns still on course , bayern face a punishing end-of-season run . it took something special for bayern munich to beat schalke in their own backyard to reach the german cup final on wednesday night .
dutch international arjen robben looked to be going nowhere when he took off with the ball just inside the schalke half before racing down the right-wing to the corner flag .
one electric injection of pace and direction later , with three defenders flailing in his wake , robben was suddenly in the penalty area lashing a left-footed shot beyond schalke keeper manuel neuer to win the semi-final in style .
although bayern had the lion 's share of possession and the early chances in this tense and sometimes bad tempered meeting , robben 's 112th minute winner was the only flash of real class in the whole game .
and despite having eight minutes to save the tie after the bayern winger scored , it was clear schalke were out as soon as the dutchman 's shot hit the back of the net .
neither team had produced anything as decisive in nearly two hours of soccer .
robben 's act of individual brilliance was a worthy match winner , but the dutchman 's tenth goal of the season certainly put a thick layer of gloss on a rather dull bayern performance .
schalke 's overwhelming emphasis on defense , along with the terrible state of the turf in the veltins arena , gradually sapped bayern 's strength and creativity .
but even the bavarians ' early attempts on goal were far from polished .
energetic robben the exception as bayern labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben stood out from the lethargic pack on wednesday robben was the exception throughout , tirelessly chasing and making runs at schalke defenders .
no-one else , not even the late substitute franck ribery , looked able to summon that kind of energy , which could be a matter of concern in the coming weeks .
" we 're still involved in three competitions and that is emotionally not all that easy for the players , " bayern coach louis van gaal said after wednesday 's semifinal win .
" but we want to be involved in all three competitions , so we will have to come to terms with that . "
with league matches against main title rivals schalke and bayer leverkusen on the horizon , and a make-or-break champions league tie over two legs against manchester united , bayern 's season will likely be decided by the end of april - for better or worse .
the concern settling over munich is that the squad may not be deep enough to survive three consecutive title races .
loan deals force coach 's hand over rising stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal 's faith in young players is being put to the test luke faron , a bayern munich expert with theoffside.com , believes that bayern are beginning to feel the effects of loaning a number of players out to other clubs and promoting youngsters to a first team involved in not only a bundesliga title fight and a lengthy german cup campaign but also european matches of the highest standard .
" loaning brazilian defender breno to nuremberg was a necessary step in continuing his development and in getting the young center back some playing time , " faron told deutsche welle .
loaning left back edson braafheid to celtic was a bit surprising , said faron .
combined with breno 's move , it meant holger badstuber would be the only true reserve center back , in addition to starting at left back .
" with center backs van buyten and demichelis suffering injuries , badstuber had to move back inside and the pressure on the youngster has been intense . "
faron believes that van gaal has been forced to test the faith he had in the young players he brought into replenish the senior side in january , but says the coach has so far - on the whole - been justified in his decisions .
" diego contento and david alaba have both performed admirably in their champions league debuts , " said faron .
" alaba had a very bad final five minutes in frankfurt last weekend and perhaps that showed the limits of the wisdom of playing a 17-year-old natural midfielder out of position in a highly competitive match . "
he said contento had had his hands full with jefferson farfan on wednesday , but that he had coped with the task well enough .
if any player was showing fatigue , said faron , it was forward thomas mueller " it 's a big adjustment for a young player like mueller who has n't even played a full season in the bundesliga before .
add in the champions league and the german cup and the fact he also just made his national team debut , and it 's easy to understand why . "
success from continuity makes coach reluctant to change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the league campaign did not start well under van gaal another factor which is contributing to bayern 's lethargy at this point in the season is van gaal 's commitment to continuity .
when he assumed control at the beginning of the season , it took the dutch coach at least ten matches of tinkering before he settled on his preferred line-up - ten matches during which bayern seemed rudderless and the coach 's credentials were questioned .
once the coach found his formula in november , however , an impressive winning streak began and van gaal has not looked back .
as a result , the dutchman risks wearing out his preferred starting 11 .
as bayern enter a run of decisive matches , time will tell if the squad 's mix of youngsters and stars can maintain top performance .
luke faron believes the bavarian giants have what it takes , regardless of tired legs .
" bayern have a chance against manchester united , but they have to be considered underdogs , " he said . " munich 's defense has not performed at the level necessary to progress further in the competition , though wednesday night 's performance in the cup might be the start of a turnaround . "
the big test , says faron , begins a week from saturday , when bayern face schalke , man united and bayer leverkusen all away from home , within a seven day period .
but thereafter , prospects seem bright .
" after the match in leverkusen they have an exceptionally easy schedule in the league for the last month of the campaign . in addition , they 're getting key players like gomez and demichelis back from injury and that should help during the run-in . i believe bayern will prevail in the bundesliga regardless of how far they progress in the champions league .

if any player was showing fatigue , said faron , it was forward thomas mueller " it 's a big adjustment for a young player like mueller who has n't even played a full season in the bundesliga before .

when he assumed control at the beginning of the season , it took the dutch coach at least ten matches of tinkering before he settled on his preferred line-up - ten matches during which bayern seemed rudderless and the coach 's credentials were questioned .
once the coach found his formula in november , however , an impressive winning streak began and van gaal has not looked back .
as a result , the dutchman risks wearing out his preferred starting 11 .
as bayern enter a run of decisive matches , time will tell if the squad 's mix of youngsters and stars can maintain top performance .
luke faron believes the bavarian giants have what it takes , regardless of tired legs .
" bayern have a chance against manchester united , but they have to be considered underdogs , " he said . " munich 's defense has not performed at the level necessary to progress further in the competition , though wednesday night 's performance in the cup might be the start of a turnaround . "
the big test , says faron , begins a week from saturday , when bayern face schalke , man united and bayer leverkusen all away from home , within a seven day period .
but thereafter , prospects seem bright .
" after the match in leverkusen they have an exceptionally easy schedule in the league for the last month of the campaign . in addition , they 're getting key players like gomez and demichelis back from injury and that should help during the run-in . i believe bayern will prevail in the bundesliga regardless of how far they progress in the champions league .

with their bundesliga and champions league campaigns still on course , bayern face a punishing end-of-season run . it took something special for bayern munich to beat schalke in their own backyard to reach the german cup final on wednesday night .
dutch international arjen robben looked to be going nowhere when he took off with the ball just inside the schalke half before racing down the right-wing to the corner flag .
one electric injection of pace and direction later , with three defenders flailing in his wake , robben was suddenly in the penalty area lashing a left-footed shot beyond schalke keeper manuel neuer to win the semi-final in style .
although bayern had the lion 's share of possession and the early chances in this tense and sometimes bad tempered meeting , robben 's 112th minute winner was the only flash of real class in the whole game .
and despite having eight minutes to save the tie after the bayern winger scored , it was clear schalke were out as soon as the dutchman 's shot hit the back of the net .
neither team had produced anything as decisive in nearly two hours of soccer .
robben 's act of individual brilliance was a worthy match winner , but the dutchman 's tenth goal of the season certainly put a thick layer of gloss on a rather dull bayern performance .
schalke 's overwhelming emphasis on defense , along with the terrible state of the turf in the veltins arena , gradually sapped bayern 's strength and creativity .
but even the bavarians ' early attempts on goal were far from polished .
energetic robben the exception as bayern labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben stood out from the lethargic pack on wednesday robben was the exception throughout , tirelessly chasing and making runs at schalke defenders .
no-one else , not even the late substitute franck ribery , looked able to summon that kind of energy , which could be a matter of concern in the coming weeks .
" we 're still involved in three competitions and that is emotionally not all that easy for the players , " bayern coach louis van gaal said after wednesday 's semifinal win .
" but we want to be involved in all three competitions , so we will have to come to terms with that . "
with league matches against main title rivals schalke and bayer leverkusen on the horizon , and a make-or-break champions league tie over two legs against manchester united , bayern 's season will likely be decided by the end of april - for better or worse .
the concern settling over munich is that the squad may not be deep enough to survive three consecutive title races .
loan deals force coach 's hand over rising stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal 's faith in young players is being put to the test luke faron , a bayern munich expert with theoffside.com , believes that bayern are beginning to feel the effects of loaning a number of players out to other clubs and promoting youngsters to a first team involved in not only a bundesliga title fight and a lengthy german cup campaign but also european matches of the highest standard .
" loaning brazilian defender breno to nuremberg was a necessary step in continuing his development and in getting the young center back some playing time , " faron told deutsche welle .
loaning left back edson braafheid to celtic was a bit surprising , said faron .
combined with breno 's move , it meant holger badstuber would be the only true reserve center back , in addition to starting at left back .
" with center backs van buyten and demichelis suffering injuries , badstuber had to move back inside and the pressure on the youngster has been intense . "
faron believes that van gaal has been forced to test the faith he had in the young players he brought into replenish the senior side in january , but says the coach has so far - on the whole - been justified in his decisions .
" diego contento and david alaba have both performed admirably in their champions league debuts , " said faron .
" alaba had a very bad final five minutes in frankfurt last weekend and perhaps that showed the limits of the wisdom of playing a 17-year-old natural midfielder out of position in a highly competitive match . "

with their bundesliga and champions league campaigns still on course , bayern face a punishing end-of-season run . it took something special for bayern munich to beat schalke in their own backyard to reach the german cup final on wednesday night .
dutch international arjen robben looked to be going nowhere when he took off with the ball just inside the schalke half before racing down the right-wing to the corner flag .
one electric injection of pace and direction later , with three defenders flailing in his wake , robben was suddenly in the penalty area lashing a left-footed shot beyond schalke keeper manuel neuer to win the semi-final in style .
although bayern had the lion 's share of possession and the early chances in this tense and sometimes bad tempered meeting , robben 's 112th minute winner was the only flash of real class in the whole game .
and despite having eight minutes to save the tie after the bayern winger scored , it was clear schalke were out as soon as the dutchman 's shot hit the back of the net .
neither team had produced anything as decisive in nearly two hours of soccer .
robben 's act of individual brilliance was a worthy match winner , but the dutchman 's tenth goal of the season certainly put a thick layer of gloss on a rather dull bayern performance .
schalke 's overwhelming emphasis on defense , along with the terrible state of the turf in the veltins arena , gradually sapped bayern 's strength and creativity .
but even the bavarians ' early attempts on goal were far from polished .
energetic robben the exception as bayern labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben stood out from the lethargic pack on wednesday robben was the exception throughout , tirelessly chasing and making runs at schalke defenders .
no-one else , not even the late substitute franck ribery , looked able to summon that kind of energy , which could be a matter of concern in the coming weeks .
" we 're still involved in three competitions and that is emotionally not all that easy for the players , " bayern coach louis van gaal said after wednesday 's semifinal win .
" but we want to be involved in all three competitions , so we will have to come to terms with that . "
with league matches against main title rivals schalke and bayer leverkusen on the horizon , and a make-or-break champions league tie over two legs against manchester united , bayern 's season will likely be decided by the end of april - for better or worse .
the concern settling over munich is that the squad may not be deep enough to survive three consecutive title races .
loan deals force coach 's hand over rising stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal 's faith in young players is being put to the test luke faron , a bayern munich expert with theoffside.com , believes that bayern are beginning to feel the effects of loaning a number of players out to other clubs and promoting youngsters to a first team involved in not only a bundesliga title fight and a lengthy german cup campaign but also european matches of the highest standard .
" loaning brazilian defender breno to nuremberg was a necessary step in continuing his development and in getting the young center back some playing time , " faron told deutsche welle .
loaning left back edson braafheid to celtic was a bit surprising , said faron .
combined with breno 's move , it meant holger badstuber would be the only true reserve center back , in addition to starting at left back .
" with center backs van buyten and demichelis suffering injuries , badstuber had to move back inside and the pressure on the youngster has been intense . "
faron believes that van gaal has been forced to test the faith he had in the young players he brought into replenish the senior side in january , but says the coach has so far - on the whole - been justified in his decisions .
" diego contento and david alaba have both performed admirably in their champions league debuts , " said faron .
" alaba had a very bad final five minutes in frankfurt last weekend and perhaps that showed the limits of the wisdom of playing a 17-year-old natural midfielder out of position in a highly competitive match . "
he said contento had had his hands full with jefferson farfan on wednesday , but that he had coped with the task well enough .
if any player was showing fatigue , said faron , it was forward thomas mueller " it 's a big adjustment for a young player like mueller who has n't even played a full season in the bundesliga before .
add in the champions league and the german cup and the fact he also just made his national team debut , and it 's easy to understand why . "
success from continuity makes coach reluctant to change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the league campaign did not start well under van gaal another factor which is contributing to bayern 's lethargy at this point in the season is van gaal 's commitment to continuity .
when he assumed control at the beginning of the season , it took the dutch coach at least ten matches of tinkering before he settled on his preferred line-up - ten matches during which bayern seemed rudderless and the coach 's credentials were questioned .
once the coach found his formula in november , however , an impressive winning streak began and van gaal has not looked back .
as a result , the dutchman risks wearing out his preferred starting 11 .
as bayern enter a run of decisive matches , time will tell if the squad 's mix of youngsters and stars can maintain top performance .
luke faron believes the bavarian giants have what it takes , regardless of tired legs .
" bayern have a chance against manchester united , but they have to be considered underdogs , " he said . " munich 's defense has not performed at the level necessary to progress further in the competition , though wednesday night 's performance in the cup might be the start of a turnaround . "
the big test , says faron , begins a week from saturday , when bayern face schalke , man united and bayer leverkusen all away from home , within a seven day period .
but thereafter , prospects seem bright .
" after the match in leverkusen they have an exceptionally easy schedule in the league for the last month of the campaign . in addition , they 're getting key players like gomez and demichelis back from injury and that should help during the run-in . i believe bayern will prevail in the bundesliga regardless of how far they progress in the champions league .

as iran continues to develop its nuclear program , analysts fear that an arms race in the middle east could begin .
if sanctions continue to fail , these analysts say that military action is necessary to prevent this . as world powers negotiate on how to deal with iran 's continuing development of its nuclear program , concerns about a nuclear arms race in the middle east , prompted by iran 's determination to build nuclear weapons , are mounting .
officials from the united states , russia , france , britain , germany and china participated in a conference call yesterday to discuss how to handle iran 's flaunting of international demands to cease nuclear work .
these countries , while attempting to deter iran from continued nuclear development by offering tehran incentives to allow more oversight of its program , are also threatening sanctions if tehran does not stop work toward producing weapons grade uranium . iran , which has faced sanctions from the united nations three times , says it is developing its nuclear program for peaceful purposes and has refused to allow inspectors from the international atomic energy agency access to its nuclear facilities .
it is party to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty , but repeatedly has been found non-compliant .
there is growing fear that iran will not stop work toward a weapon unless drastic action is taken .
middle east experts said that if iran continues on its current path , a nuclear arms race in the region could ensue . ' ' turkey , algeria , egypt , and saudi arabia are all potential candidates to develop nuclear weapons , " abdulaziz sager , chairman of the gulf research center in dubai , told deutsche welle .
' ' and they will say , if -lsb- nuclear weapon development -rsb- is permitted in iran , why ca n't we develop weapons as well ? "
a threat beyond israel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has called for the destruction of israel .
a nuclear-armed iran is widely seen as a direct threat to israel , as iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has pledged to ' ' wipe israel off the map . "
israel has not ruled out preemptive strikes against suspected nuclear sites inside iran if development continues .
but iran 's possession of a nuclear weapon has implications for other countries in the region as well , mustafa alani , senior advisor and program director at the gulf research center says .
' ' the question is not whether iran uses the bomb against other countries in the middle east , " alani told deutsche welle .
' ' but the question is whether iran has control of the region , and the political consequences of a dominant iran . "
the political balance of power in the middle east at the current time is relatively stable .
israel has a dominant military and nuclear weapons , as well as the backing of the united states .
economic power is diversified , as a number of states have thriving oil industries .
the region is also politically stable , with the exception of iraq , which is trying to sustain a functioning government in the wake of the iraq war .
a nuclear-armed and increasingly belligerent iran would dramatically alter this balance .
ahmadinejad would hold disproportionate clout , and if recent belligerent statements toward israel are to be believed , seems to be willing to use it .
preemption vs. nuclear war in the past , analysts have told deutsche welle that israel is unlikely to carry out unilateral military action against iran , as any action is not likely to destroy iran 's entire nuclear infrastructure .
last month , chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff admiral mike mullen told congress ' ' no strike , however effective , will be in and of itself decisive . "
however , the gulf center 's sager says that if economic sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a convoy of israeli military armored vehicles on the gaza strip. continue to fail , preemptive military action to stop iran from acquiring nuclear weapons is needed .
the power iran would have would be too great and too much of a risk to the region . ' ' if i had to chose between living with iran as a constant threat , or a military strike with limited retaliation , i can more easily live with the military option , " he said .
' ' we have already lived through wars , and no countries were erased from the map . "

as iran continues to develop its nuclear program , analysts fear that an arms race in the middle east could begin .
if sanctions continue to fail , these analysts say that military action is necessary to prevent this . as world powers negotiate on how to deal with iran 's continuing development of its nuclear program , concerns about a nuclear arms race in the middle east , prompted by iran 's determination to build nuclear weapons , are mounting .
officials from the united states , russia , france , britain , germany and china participated in a conference call yesterday to discuss how to handle iran 's flaunting of international demands to cease nuclear work .
these countries , while attempting to deter iran from continued nuclear development by offering tehran incentives to allow more oversight of its program , are also threatening sanctions if tehran does not stop work toward producing weapons grade uranium . iran , which has faced sanctions from the united nations three times , says it is developing its nuclear program for peaceful purposes and has refused to allow inspectors from the international atomic energy agency access to its nuclear facilities .
it is party to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty , but repeatedly has been found non-compliant .
there is growing fear that iran will not stop work toward a weapon unless drastic action is taken .
middle east experts said that if iran continues on its current path , a nuclear arms race in the region could ensue . ' ' turkey , algeria , egypt , and saudi arabia are all potential candidates to develop nuclear weapons , " abdulaziz sager , chairman of the gulf research center in dubai , told deutsche welle .
' ' and they will say , if -lsb- nuclear weapon development -rsb- is permitted in iran , why ca n't we develop weapons as well ? "
a threat beyond israel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has called for the destruction of israel .
a nuclear-armed iran is widely seen as a direct threat to israel , as iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has pledged to ' ' wipe israel off the map . "
israel has not ruled out preemptive strikes against suspected nuclear sites inside iran if development continues .
but iran 's possession of a nuclear weapon has implications for other countries in the region as well , mustafa alani , senior advisor and program director at the gulf research center says .
' ' the question is not whether iran uses the bomb against other countries in the middle east , " alani told deutsche welle .
' ' but the question is whether iran has control of the region , and the political consequences of a dominant iran . "
the political balance of power in the middle east at the current time is relatively stable .
israel has a dominant military and nuclear weapons , as well as the backing of the united states .
economic power is diversified , as a number of states have thriving oil industries .
the region is also politically stable , with the exception of iraq , which is trying to sustain a functioning government in the wake of the iraq war .
a nuclear-armed and increasingly belligerent iran would dramatically alter this balance .
ahmadinejad would hold disproportionate clout , and if recent belligerent statements toward israel are to be believed , seems to be willing to use it .
preemption vs. nuclear war in the past , analysts have told deutsche welle that israel is unlikely to carry out unilateral military action against iran , as any action is not likely to destroy iran 's entire nuclear infrastructure .
last month , chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff admiral mike mullen told congress ' ' no strike , however effective , will be in and of itself decisive . "
however , the gulf center 's sager says that if economic sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a convoy of israeli military armored vehicles on the gaza strip. continue to fail , preemptive military action to stop iran from acquiring nuclear weapons is needed .
the power iran would have would be too great and too much of a risk to the region . ' ' if i had to chose between living with iran as a constant threat , or a military strike with limited retaliation , i can more easily live with the military option , " he said .
' ' we have already lived through wars , and no countries were erased from the map . "

as iran continues to develop its nuclear program , analysts fear that an arms race in the middle east could begin .
if sanctions continue to fail , these analysts say that military action is necessary to prevent this . as world powers negotiate on how to deal with iran 's continuing development of its nuclear program , concerns about a nuclear arms race in the middle east , prompted by iran 's determination to build nuclear weapons , are mounting .
officials from the united states , russia , france , britain , germany and china participated in a conference call yesterday to discuss how to handle iran 's flaunting of international demands to cease nuclear work .
these countries , while attempting to deter iran from continued nuclear development by offering tehran incentives to allow more oversight of its program , are also threatening sanctions if tehran does not stop work toward producing weapons grade uranium . iran , which has faced sanctions from the united nations three times , says it is developing its nuclear program for peaceful purposes and has refused to allow inspectors from the international atomic energy agency access to its nuclear facilities .
it is party to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty , but repeatedly has been found non-compliant .
there is growing fear that iran will not stop work toward a weapon unless drastic action is taken .
middle east experts said that if iran continues on its current path , a nuclear arms race in the region could ensue . ' ' turkey , algeria , egypt , and saudi arabia are all potential candidates to develop nuclear weapons , " abdulaziz sager , chairman of the gulf research center in dubai , told deutsche welle .
' ' and they will say , if -lsb- nuclear weapon development -rsb- is permitted in iran , why ca n't we develop weapons as well ? "
a threat beyond israel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has called for the destruction of israel .
a nuclear-armed iran is widely seen as a direct threat to israel , as iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has pledged to ' ' wipe israel off the map . "
israel has not ruled out preemptive strikes against suspected nuclear sites inside iran if development continues .
but iran 's possession of a nuclear weapon has implications for other countries in the region as well , mustafa alani , senior advisor and program director at the gulf research center says .
' ' the question is not whether iran uses the bomb against other countries in the middle east , " alani told deutsche welle .
' ' but the question is whether iran has control of the region , and the political consequences of a dominant iran . "
the political balance of power in the middle east at the current time is relatively stable .
israel has a dominant military and nuclear weapons , as well as the backing of the united states .
economic power is diversified , as a number of states have thriving oil industries .
the region is also politically stable , with the exception of iraq , which is trying to sustain a functioning government in the wake of the iraq war .
a nuclear-armed and increasingly belligerent iran would dramatically alter this balance .
ahmadinejad would hold disproportionate clout , and if recent belligerent statements toward israel are to be believed , seems to be willing to use it .
preemption vs. nuclear war in the past , analysts have told deutsche welle that israel is unlikely to carry out unilateral military action against iran , as any action is not likely to destroy iran 's entire nuclear infrastructure .
last month , chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff admiral mike mullen told congress ' ' no strike , however effective , will be in and of itself decisive . "
however , the gulf center 's sager says that if economic sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a convoy of israeli military armored vehicles on the gaza strip. continue to fail , preemptive military action to stop iran from acquiring nuclear weapons is needed .
the power iran would have would be too great and too much of a risk to the region . ' ' if i had to chose between living with iran as a constant threat , or a military strike with limited retaliation , i can more easily live with the military option , " he said .
' ' we have already lived through wars , and no countries were erased from the map . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 25.03.2010 tired bayern need to dig deep as their chase for three titles intensifies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's fatigue was evident again at schalke bayern munich reached the german cup final on wednesday night after beating schalke .
with their bundesliga and champions league campaigns still on course , bayern face a punishing end-of-season run . it took something special for bayern munich to beat schalke in their own backyard to reach the german cup final on wednesday night .
dutch international arjen robben looked to be going nowhere when he took off with the ball just inside the schalke half before racing down the right-wing to the corner flag .
one electric injection of pace and direction later , with three defenders flailing in his wake , robben was suddenly in the penalty area lashing a left-footed shot beyond schalke keeper manuel neuer to win the semi-final in style .
although bayern had the lion 's share of possession and the early chances in this tense and sometimes bad tempered meeting , robben 's 112th minute winner was the only flash of real class in the whole game .
and despite having eight minutes to save the tie after the bayern winger scored , it was clear schalke were out as soon as the dutchman 's shot hit the back of the net .
neither team had produced anything as decisive in nearly two hours of soccer .
robben 's act of individual brilliance was a worthy match winner , but the dutchman 's tenth goal of the season certainly put a thick layer of gloss on a rather dull bayern performance .
schalke 's overwhelming emphasis on defense , along with the terrible state of the turf in the veltins arena , gradually sapped bayern 's strength and creativity .
but even the bavarians ' early attempts on goal were far from polished .
energetic robben the exception as bayern labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben stood out from the lethargic pack on wednesday robben was the exception throughout , tirelessly chasing and making runs at schalke defenders .
no-one else , not even the late substitute franck ribery , looked able to summon that kind of energy , which could be a matter of concern in the coming weeks .
" we 're still involved in three competitions and that is emotionally not all that easy for the players , " bayern coach louis van gaal said after wednesday 's semifinal win .
" but we want to be involved in all three competitions , so we will have to come to terms with that . "
with league matches against main title rivals schalke and bayer leverkusen on the horizon , and a make-or-break champions league tie over two legs against manchester united , bayern 's season will likely be decided by the end of april - for better or worse .
the concern settling over munich is that the squad may not be deep enough to survive three consecutive title races .
loan deals force coach 's hand over rising stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal 's faith in young players is being put to the test luke faron , a bayern munich expert with theoffside.com , believes that bayern are beginning to feel the effects of loaning a number of players out to other clubs and promoting youngsters to a first team involved in not only a bundesliga title fight and a lengthy german cup campaign but also european matches of the highest standard .
" loaning brazilian defender breno to nuremberg was a necessary step in continuing his development and in getting the young center back some playing time , " faron told deutsche welle .
loaning left back edson braafheid to celtic was a bit surprising , said faron .
combined with breno 's move , it meant holger badstuber would be the only true reserve center back , in addition to starting at left back .
" with center backs van buyten and demichelis suffering injuries , badstuber had to move back inside and the pressure on the youngster has been intense . "
faron believes that van gaal has been forced to test the faith he had in the young players he brought into replenish the senior side in january , but says the coach has so far - on the whole - been justified in his decisions .
" diego contento and david alaba have both performed admirably in their champions league debuts , " said faron .
" alaba had a very bad final five minutes in frankfurt last weekend and perhaps that showed the limits of the wisdom of playing a 17-year-old natural midfielder out of position in a highly competitive match . "
he said contento had had his hands full with jefferson farfan on wednesday , but that he had coped with the task well enough .
if any player was showing fatigue , said faron , it was forward thomas mueller " it 's a big adjustment for a young player like mueller who has n't even played a full season in the bundesliga before .
add in the champions league and the german cup and the fact he also just made his national team debut , and it 's easy to understand why . "
success from continuity makes coach reluctant to change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the league campaign did not start well under van gaal another factor which is contributing to bayern 's lethargy at this point in the season is van gaal 's commitment to continuity .
when he assumed control at the beginning of the season , it took the dutch coach at least ten matches of tinkering before he settled on his preferred line-up - ten matches during which bayern seemed rudderless and the coach 's credentials were questioned .
once the coach found his formula in november , however , an impressive winning streak began and van gaal has not looked back .
as a result , the dutchman risks wearing out his preferred starting 11 .
as bayern enter a run of decisive matches , time will tell if the squad 's mix of youngsters and stars can maintain top performance .
luke faron believes the bavarian giants have what it takes , regardless of tired legs .
" bayern have a chance against manchester united , but they have to be considered underdogs , " he said . " munich 's defense has not performed at the level necessary to progress further in the competition , though wednesday night 's performance in the cup might be the start of a turnaround . "
the big test , says faron , begins a week from saturday , when bayern face schalke , man united and bayer leverkusen all away from home , within a seven day period .
but thereafter , prospects seem bright .
" after the match in leverkusen they have an exceptionally easy schedule in the league for the last month of the campaign . in addition , they 're getting key players like gomez and demichelis back from injury and that should help during the run-in . i believe bayern will prevail in the bundesliga regardless of how far they progress in the champions league .

but when those international couples divorce , those borders can make it even more complicated .
some eu nations want to change that . some 300,000 marriages between people from different european union countries take place every year - the romantic side of the increasing borderlessness of the 27-nation bloc .
but 140,000 mixed-nationality eu couples file for divorce every year , and many are faced with a legal maze created by divorce laws that vary from country to country across the eu . but ten eu countries - austria , bulgaria , france , greece , hungary , italy , luxembourg , romania , slovakia and spain - want to take advantage of a never-before-used 1997 treaty provision to simplify that process .
it allows for a subgroup of eu countries to develop a system of " enhanced cooperation . " the ten want to form their own pact harmonizing their divorce laws .
the countries need approval from eu justice ministers to draw up such a deal , but the idea would be to obligate couples to agree on a jurisdiction for their divorce proceedings .
if they can not agree , the divorce laws of the country where they last lived together would apply .
a boon or a burden ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reding says eu should work to simplify mixed-nationality divorce supporters of the idea say it would streamline mixed-nationality divorces , possibly reduce legal fees , and discourage " divorce shopping , " in which one spouse seeks out the jurisdiction that favors him or her .
" international couples can encounter arbitrary legal problems that turn the tragedy of divorce into a financial and emotional disaster … because national legal systems have so far failed to provide clear answers , " said eu justice commissioner viviane reding .
but critics of the proposal say it would create a " europe within europe . "
and value-laden family policy is an area the eu usually sidesteps .
divorce laws vary dramatically across the bloc .
malta does not even permit divorce , only legal separation .
but reding downplayed concerns of a two-speed europe , saying that " several " other countries were also interested in the enhanced cooperation. hf / afp / ap editor : stephanie siek send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as iran continues to develop its nuclear program , analysts fear that an arms race in the middle east could begin .
if sanctions continue to fail , these analysts say that military action is necessary to prevent this . as world powers negotiate on how to deal with iran 's continuing development of its nuclear program , concerns about a nuclear arms race in the middle east , prompted by iran 's determination to build nuclear weapons , are mounting .
officials from the united states , russia , france , britain , germany and china participated in a conference call yesterday to discuss how to handle iran 's flaunting of international demands to cease nuclear work .
these countries , while attempting to deter iran from continued nuclear development by offering tehran incentives to allow more oversight of its program , are also threatening sanctions if tehran does not stop work toward producing weapons grade uranium . iran , which has faced sanctions from the united nations three times , says it is developing its nuclear program for peaceful purposes and has refused to allow inspectors from the international atomic energy agency access to its nuclear facilities .
it is party to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty , but repeatedly has been found non-compliant .
there is growing fear that iran will not stop work toward a weapon unless drastic action is taken .
middle east experts said that if iran continues on its current path , a nuclear arms race in the region could ensue . ' ' turkey , algeria , egypt , and saudi arabia are all potential candidates to develop nuclear weapons , " abdulaziz sager , chairman of the gulf research center in dubai , told deutsche welle .
' ' and they will say , if -lsb- nuclear weapon development -rsb- is permitted in iran , why ca n't we develop weapons as well ? "
a threat beyond israel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has called for the destruction of israel .
a nuclear-armed iran is widely seen as a direct threat to israel , as iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has pledged to ' ' wipe israel off the map . "
israel has not ruled out preemptive strikes against suspected nuclear sites inside iran if development continues .
but iran 's possession of a nuclear weapon has implications for other countries in the region as well , mustafa alani , senior advisor and program director at the gulf research center says .
' ' the question is not whether iran uses the bomb against other countries in the middle east , " alani told deutsche welle .
' ' but the question is whether iran has control of the region , and the political consequences of a dominant iran . "
the political balance of power in the middle east at the current time is relatively stable .
israel has a dominant military and nuclear weapons , as well as the backing of the united states .
economic power is diversified , as a number of states have thriving oil industries .
the region is also politically stable , with the exception of iraq , which is trying to sustain a functioning government in the wake of the iraq war .
a nuclear-armed and increasingly belligerent iran would dramatically alter this balance .
ahmadinejad would hold disproportionate clout , and if recent belligerent statements toward israel are to be believed , seems to be willing to use it .
preemption vs. nuclear war in the past , analysts have told deutsche welle that israel is unlikely to carry out unilateral military action against iran , as any action is not likely to destroy iran 's entire nuclear infrastructure .
last month , chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff admiral mike mullen told congress ' ' no strike , however effective , will be in and of itself decisive . "
however , the gulf center 's sager says that if economic sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a convoy of israeli military armored vehicles on the gaza strip. continue to fail , preemptive military action to stop iran from acquiring nuclear weapons is needed .
the power iran would have would be too great and too much of a risk to the region . ' ' if i had to chose between living with iran as a constant threat , or a military strike with limited retaliation , i can more easily live with the military option , " he said .
' ' we have already lived through wars , and no countries were erased from the map . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 25.03.2010 tired bayern need to dig deep as their chase for three titles intensifies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's fatigue was evident again at schalke bayern munich reached the german cup final on wednesday night after beating schalke .
with their bundesliga and champions league campaigns still on course , bayern face a punishing end-of-season run . it took something special for bayern munich to beat schalke in their own backyard to reach the german cup final on wednesday night .
dutch international arjen robben looked to be going nowhere when he took off with the ball just inside the schalke half before racing down the right-wing to the corner flag .
one electric injection of pace and direction later , with three defenders flailing in his wake , robben was suddenly in the penalty area lashing a left-footed shot beyond schalke keeper manuel neuer to win the semi-final in style .
although bayern had the lion 's share of possession and the early chances in this tense and sometimes bad tempered meeting , robben 's 112th minute winner was the only flash of real class in the whole game .
and despite having eight minutes to save the tie after the bayern winger scored , it was clear schalke were out as soon as the dutchman 's shot hit the back of the net .
neither team had produced anything as decisive in nearly two hours of soccer .
robben 's act of individual brilliance was a worthy match winner , but the dutchman 's tenth goal of the season certainly put a thick layer of gloss on a rather dull bayern performance .
schalke 's overwhelming emphasis on defense , along with the terrible state of the turf in the veltins arena , gradually sapped bayern 's strength and creativity .
but even the bavarians ' early attempts on goal were far from polished .
energetic robben the exception as bayern labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben stood out from the lethargic pack on wednesday robben was the exception throughout , tirelessly chasing and making runs at schalke defenders .
no-one else , not even the late substitute franck ribery , looked able to summon that kind of energy , which could be a matter of concern in the coming weeks .
" we 're still involved in three competitions and that is emotionally not all that easy for the players , " bayern coach louis van gaal said after wednesday 's semifinal win .
" but we want to be involved in all three competitions , so we will have to come to terms with that . "
with league matches against main title rivals schalke and bayer leverkusen on the horizon , and a make-or-break champions league tie over two legs against manchester united , bayern 's season will likely be decided by the end of april - for better or worse .
the concern settling over munich is that the squad may not be deep enough to survive three consecutive title races .
loan deals force coach 's hand over rising stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal 's faith in young players is being put to the test luke faron , a bayern munich expert with theoffside.com , believes that bayern are beginning to feel the effects of loaning a number of players out to other clubs and promoting youngsters to a first team involved in not only a bundesliga title fight and a lengthy german cup campaign but also european matches of the highest standard .
" loaning brazilian defender breno to nuremberg was a necessary step in continuing his development and in getting the young center back some playing time , " faron told deutsche welle .
loaning left back edson braafheid to celtic was a bit surprising , said faron .
combined with breno 's move , it meant holger badstuber would be the only true reserve center back , in addition to starting at left back .
" with center backs van buyten and demichelis suffering injuries , badstuber had to move back inside and the pressure on the youngster has been intense . "
faron believes that van gaal has been forced to test the faith he had in the young players he brought into replenish the senior side in january , but says the coach has so far - on the whole - been justified in his decisions .
" diego contento and david alaba have both performed admirably in their champions league debuts , " said faron .
" alaba had a very bad final five minutes in frankfurt last weekend and perhaps that showed the limits of the wisdom of playing a 17-year-old natural midfielder out of position in a highly competitive match . "
he said contento had had his hands full with jefferson farfan on wednesday , but that he had coped with the task well enough .
if any player was showing fatigue , said faron , it was forward thomas mueller " it 's a big adjustment for a young player like mueller who has n't even played a full season in the bundesliga before .
add in the champions league and the german cup and the fact he also just made his national team debut , and it 's easy to understand why . "
success from continuity makes coach reluctant to change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the league campaign did not start well under van gaal another factor which is contributing to bayern 's lethargy at this point in the season is van gaal 's commitment to continuity .
when he assumed control at the beginning of the season , it took the dutch coach at least ten matches of tinkering before he settled on his preferred line-up - ten matches during which bayern seemed rudderless and the coach 's credentials were questioned .
once the coach found his formula in november , however , an impressive winning streak began and van gaal has not looked back .
as a result , the dutchman risks wearing out his preferred starting 11 .
as bayern enter a run of decisive matches , time will tell if the squad 's mix of youngsters and stars can maintain top performance .
luke faron believes the bavarian giants have what it takes , regardless of tired legs .
" bayern have a chance against manchester united , but they have to be considered underdogs , " he said . " munich 's defense has not performed at the level necessary to progress further in the competition , though wednesday night 's performance in the cup might be the start of a turnaround . "
the big test , says faron , begins a week from saturday , when bayern face schalke , man united and bayer leverkusen all away from home , within a seven day period .
but thereafter , prospects seem bright .
" after the match in leverkusen they have an exceptionally easy schedule in the league for the last month of the campaign . in addition , they 're getting key players like gomez and demichelis back from injury and that should help during the run-in . i believe bayern will prevail in the bundesliga regardless of how far they progress in the champions league .

but when those international couples divorce , those borders can make it even more complicated .
some eu nations want to change that . some 300,000 marriages between people from different european union countries take place every year - the romantic side of the increasing borderlessness of the 27-nation bloc .
but 140,000 mixed-nationality eu couples file for divorce every year , and many are faced with a legal maze created by divorce laws that vary from country to country across the eu . but ten eu countries - austria , bulgaria , france , greece , hungary , italy , luxembourg , romania , slovakia and spain - want to take advantage of a never-before-used 1997 treaty provision to simplify that process .
it allows for a subgroup of eu countries to develop a system of " enhanced cooperation . " the ten want to form their own pact harmonizing their divorce laws .
the countries need approval from eu justice ministers to draw up such a deal , but the idea would be to obligate couples to agree on a jurisdiction for their divorce proceedings .
if they can not agree , the divorce laws of the country where they last lived together would apply .
a boon or a burden ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reding says eu should work to simplify mixed-nationality divorce supporters of the idea say it would streamline mixed-nationality divorces , possibly reduce legal fees , and discourage " divorce shopping , " in which one spouse seeks out the jurisdiction that favors him or her .
" international couples can encounter arbitrary legal problems that turn the tragedy of divorce into a financial and emotional disaster … because national legal systems have so far failed to provide clear answers , " said eu justice commissioner viviane reding .
but critics of the proposal say it would create a " europe within europe . "
and value-laden family policy is an area the eu usually sidesteps .
divorce laws vary dramatically across the bloc .
malta does not even permit divorce , only legal separation .

as iran continues to develop its nuclear program , analysts fear that an arms race in the middle east could begin .
if sanctions continue to fail , these analysts say that military action is necessary to prevent this . as world powers negotiate on how to deal with iran 's continuing development of its nuclear program , concerns about a nuclear arms race in the middle east , prompted by iran 's determination to build nuclear weapons , are mounting .
officials from the united states , russia , france , britain , germany and china participated in a conference call yesterday to discuss how to handle iran 's flaunting of international demands to cease nuclear work .
these countries , while attempting to deter iran from continued nuclear development by offering tehran incentives to allow more oversight of its program , are also threatening sanctions if tehran does not stop work toward producing weapons grade uranium . iran , which has faced sanctions from the united nations three times , says it is developing its nuclear program for peaceful purposes and has refused to allow inspectors from the international atomic energy agency access to its nuclear facilities .
it is party to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty , but repeatedly has been found non-compliant .
there is growing fear that iran will not stop work toward a weapon unless drastic action is taken .
middle east experts said that if iran continues on its current path , a nuclear arms race in the region could ensue . ' ' turkey , algeria , egypt , and saudi arabia are all potential candidates to develop nuclear weapons , " abdulaziz sager , chairman of the gulf research center in dubai , told deutsche welle .
' ' and they will say , if -lsb- nuclear weapon development -rsb- is permitted in iran , why ca n't we develop weapons as well ? "
a threat beyond israel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has called for the destruction of israel .
a nuclear-armed iran is widely seen as a direct threat to israel , as iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has pledged to ' ' wipe israel off the map . "
israel has not ruled out preemptive strikes against suspected nuclear sites inside iran if development continues .
but iran 's possession of a nuclear weapon has implications for other countries in the region as well , mustafa alani , senior advisor and program director at the gulf research center says .
' ' the question is not whether iran uses the bomb against other countries in the middle east , " alani told deutsche welle .
' ' but the question is whether iran has control of the region , and the political consequences of a dominant iran . "
the political balance of power in the middle east at the current time is relatively stable .
israel has a dominant military and nuclear weapons , as well as the backing of the united states .
economic power is diversified , as a number of states have thriving oil industries .
the region is also politically stable , with the exception of iraq , which is trying to sustain a functioning government in the wake of the iraq war .
a nuclear-armed and increasingly belligerent iran would dramatically alter this balance .
ahmadinejad would hold disproportionate clout , and if recent belligerent statements toward israel are to be believed , seems to be willing to use it .
preemption vs. nuclear war in the past , analysts have told deutsche welle that israel is unlikely to carry out unilateral military action against iran , as any action is not likely to destroy iran 's entire nuclear infrastructure .
last month , chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff admiral mike mullen told congress ' ' no strike , however effective , will be in and of itself decisive . "
however , the gulf center 's sager says that if economic sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a convoy of israeli military armored vehicles on the gaza strip. continue to fail , preemptive military action to stop iran from acquiring nuclear weapons is needed .
the power iran would have would be too great and too much of a risk to the region . ' ' if i had to chose between living with iran as a constant threat , or a military strike with limited retaliation , i can more easily live with the military option , " he said .
' ' we have already lived through wars , and no countries were erased from the map . "

" in turkey , we have german high schools - why should n't there be turkish high schools in germany ? "
erdogan asked in an interview with german weekly die zeit .
erdogan said that many of the almost three million people of turkish origin living in germany had problems with both languages , and offering education in turkish might also help their german .
" germany has not yet caught up with the times , " erdogan said .
" one must first have a firm command of one 's own language , that is to say , turkish , and that is unfortunately rarely the case . "
the federal government 's integration commissioner , maria boehmer , acknowledged the advantage pupils might gain if they could be fluent in two languages , but said learning german should take priority .

it does not " count for much " , according to sueddeutsche .

with their bundesliga and champions league campaigns still on course , bayern face a punishing end-of-season run . it took something special for bayern munich to beat schalke in their own backyard to reach the german cup final on wednesday night .
dutch international arjen robben looked to be going nowhere when he took off with the ball just inside the schalke half before racing down the right-wing to the corner flag .
one electric injection of pace and direction later , with three defenders flailing in his wake , robben was suddenly in the penalty area lashing a left-footed shot beyond schalke keeper manuel neuer to win the semi-final in style .
although bayern had the lion 's share of possession and the early chances in this tense and sometimes bad tempered meeting , robben 's 112th minute winner was the only flash of real class in the whole game .
and despite having eight minutes to save the tie after the bayern winger scored , it was clear schalke were out as soon as the dutchman 's shot hit the back of the net .
neither team had produced anything as decisive in nearly two hours of soccer .
robben 's act of individual brilliance was a worthy match winner , but the dutchman 's tenth goal of the season certainly put a thick layer of gloss on a rather dull bayern performance .
schalke 's overwhelming emphasis on defense , along with the terrible state of the turf in the veltins arena , gradually sapped bayern 's strength and creativity .
but even the bavarians ' early attempts on goal were far from polished .
energetic robben the exception as bayern labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben stood out from the lethargic pack on wednesday robben was the exception throughout , tirelessly chasing and making runs at schalke defenders .
no-one else , not even the late substitute franck ribery , looked able to summon that kind of energy , which could be a matter of concern in the coming weeks .
" we 're still involved in three competitions and that is emotionally not all that easy for the players , " bayern coach louis van gaal said after wednesday 's semifinal win .
" but we want to be involved in all three competitions , so we will have to come to terms with that . "
with league matches against main title rivals schalke and bayer leverkusen on the horizon , and a make-or-break champions league tie over two legs against manchester united , bayern 's season will likely be decided by the end of april - for better or worse .
the concern settling over munich is that the squad may not be deep enough to survive three consecutive title races .
loan deals force coach 's hand over rising stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal 's faith in young players is being put to the test luke faron , a bayern munich expert with theoffside.com , believes that bayern are beginning to feel the effects of loaning a number of players out to other clubs and promoting youngsters to a first team involved in not only a bundesliga title fight and a lengthy german cup campaign but also european matches of the highest standard .
" loaning brazilian defender breno to nuremberg was a necessary step in continuing his development and in getting the young center back some playing time , " faron told deutsche welle .
loaning left back edson braafheid to celtic was a bit surprising , said faron .
combined with breno 's move , it meant holger badstuber would be the only true reserve center back , in addition to starting at left back .
" with center backs van buyten and demichelis suffering injuries , badstuber had to move back inside and the pressure on the youngster has been intense . "
faron believes that van gaal has been forced to test the faith he had in the young players he brought into replenish the senior side in january , but says the coach has so far - on the whole - been justified in his decisions .
" diego contento and david alaba have both performed admirably in their champions league debuts , " said faron .
" alaba had a very bad final five minutes in frankfurt last weekend and perhaps that showed the limits of the wisdom of playing a 17-year-old natural midfielder out of position in a highly competitive match . "
he said contento had had his hands full with jefferson farfan on wednesday , but that he had coped with the task well enough .
if any player was showing fatigue , said faron , it was forward thomas mueller " it 's a big adjustment for a young player like mueller who has n't even played a full season in the bundesliga before .
add in the champions league and the german cup and the fact he also just made his national team debut , and it 's easy to understand why . "
success from continuity makes coach reluctant to change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the league campaign did not start well under van gaal another factor which is contributing to bayern 's lethargy at this point in the season is van gaal 's commitment to continuity .
when he assumed control at the beginning of the season , it took the dutch coach at least ten matches of tinkering before he settled on his preferred line-up - ten matches during which bayern seemed rudderless and the coach 's credentials were questioned .
once the coach found his formula in november , however , an impressive winning streak began and van gaal has not looked back .
as a result , the dutchman risks wearing out his preferred starting 11 .
as bayern enter a run of decisive matches , time will tell if the squad 's mix of youngsters and stars can maintain top performance .
luke faron believes the bavarian giants have what it takes , regardless of tired legs .
" bayern have a chance against manchester united , but they have to be considered underdogs , " he said . " munich 's defense has not performed at the level necessary to progress further in the competition , though wednesday night 's performance in the cup might be the start of a turnaround . "
the big test , says faron , begins a week from saturday , when bayern face schalke , man united and bayer leverkusen all away from home , within a seven day period .
but thereafter , prospects seem bright .
" after the match in leverkusen they have an exceptionally easy schedule in the league for the last month of the campaign . in addition , they 're getting key players like gomez and demichelis back from injury and that should help during the run-in . i believe bayern will prevail in the bundesliga regardless of how far they progress in the champions league .

" in turkey , we have german high schools - why should n't there be turkish high schools in germany ? "
erdogan asked in an interview with german weekly die zeit .
erdogan said that many of the almost three million people of turkish origin living in germany had problems with both languages , and offering education in turkish might also help their german .
" germany has not yet caught up with the times , " erdogan said .
" one must first have a firm command of one 's own language , that is to say , turkish , and that is unfortunately rarely the case . "
the federal government 's integration commissioner , maria boehmer , acknowledged the advantage pupils might gain if they could be fluent in two languages , but said learning german should take priority .
" only those who know german have a chance of social advancement , " boehmer , a christian democrat , told the daily berliner zeitung .
the head of the christian democratic party 's german-turkish forum in north-rhine westphalia was also skeptical .
" turkish secondary schools are a dead end for students , " buelent arslan told the daily koelner stadtanzeiger .

with their bundesliga and champions league campaigns still on course , bayern face a punishing end-of-season run . it took something special for bayern munich to beat schalke in their own backyard to reach the german cup final on wednesday night .
dutch international arjen robben looked to be going nowhere when he took off with the ball just inside the schalke half before racing down the right-wing to the corner flag .
one electric injection of pace and direction later , with three defenders flailing in his wake , robben was suddenly in the penalty area lashing a left-footed shot beyond schalke keeper manuel neuer to win the semi-final in style .
although bayern had the lion 's share of possession and the early chances in this tense and sometimes bad tempered meeting , robben 's 112th minute winner was the only flash of real class in the whole game .
and despite having eight minutes to save the tie after the bayern winger scored , it was clear schalke were out as soon as the dutchman 's shot hit the back of the net .
neither team had produced anything as decisive in nearly two hours of soccer .
robben 's act of individual brilliance was a worthy match winner , but the dutchman 's tenth goal of the season certainly put a thick layer of gloss on a rather dull bayern performance .
schalke 's overwhelming emphasis on defense , along with the terrible state of the turf in the veltins arena , gradually sapped bayern 's strength and creativity .
but even the bavarians ' early attempts on goal were far from polished .
energetic robben the exception as bayern labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben stood out from the lethargic pack on wednesday robben was the exception throughout , tirelessly chasing and making runs at schalke defenders .
no-one else , not even the late substitute franck ribery , looked able to summon that kind of energy , which could be a matter of concern in the coming weeks .
" we 're still involved in three competitions and that is emotionally not all that easy for the players , " bayern coach louis van gaal said after wednesday 's semifinal win .
" but we want to be involved in all three competitions , so we will have to come to terms with that . "
with league matches against main title rivals schalke and bayer leverkusen on the horizon , and a make-or-break champions league tie over two legs against manchester united , bayern 's season will likely be decided by the end of april - for better or worse .
the concern settling over munich is that the squad may not be deep enough to survive three consecutive title races .
loan deals force coach 's hand over rising stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal 's faith in young players is being put to the test luke faron , a bayern munich expert with theoffside.com , believes that bayern are beginning to feel the effects of loaning a number of players out to other clubs and promoting youngsters to a first team involved in not only a bundesliga title fight and a lengthy german cup campaign but also european matches of the highest standard .
" loaning brazilian defender breno to nuremberg was a necessary step in continuing his development and in getting the young center back some playing time , " faron told deutsche welle .
loaning left back edson braafheid to celtic was a bit surprising , said faron .
combined with breno 's move , it meant holger badstuber would be the only true reserve center back , in addition to starting at left back .
" with center backs van buyten and demichelis suffering injuries , badstuber had to move back inside and the pressure on the youngster has been intense . "
faron believes that van gaal has been forced to test the faith he had in the young players he brought into replenish the senior side in january , but says the coach has so far - on the whole - been justified in his decisions .
" diego contento and david alaba have both performed admirably in their champions league debuts , " said faron .
" alaba had a very bad final five minutes in frankfurt last weekend and perhaps that showed the limits of the wisdom of playing a 17-year-old natural midfielder out of position in a highly competitive match . "
he said contento had had his hands full with jefferson farfan on wednesday , but that he had coped with the task well enough .
if any player was showing fatigue , said faron , it was forward thomas mueller " it 's a big adjustment for a young player like mueller who has n't even played a full season in the bundesliga before .
add in the champions league and the german cup and the fact he also just made his national team debut , and it 's easy to understand why . "
success from continuity makes coach reluctant to change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the league campaign did not start well under van gaal another factor which is contributing to bayern 's lethargy at this point in the season is van gaal 's commitment to continuity .
when he assumed control at the beginning of the season , it took the dutch coach at least ten matches of tinkering before he settled on his preferred line-up - ten matches during which bayern seemed rudderless and the coach 's credentials were questioned .
once the coach found his formula in november , however , an impressive winning streak began and van gaal has not looked back .
as a result , the dutchman risks wearing out his preferred starting 11 .
as bayern enter a run of decisive matches , time will tell if the squad 's mix of youngsters and stars can maintain top performance .
luke faron believes the bavarian giants have what it takes , regardless of tired legs .
" bayern have a chance against manchester united , but they have to be considered underdogs , " he said . " munich 's defense has not performed at the level necessary to progress further in the competition , though wednesday night 's performance in the cup might be the start of a turnaround . "
the big test , says faron , begins a week from saturday , when bayern face schalke , man united and bayer leverkusen all away from home , within a seven day period .
but thereafter , prospects seem bright .
" after the match in leverkusen they have an exceptionally easy schedule in the league for the last month of the campaign . in addition , they 're getting key players like gomez and demichelis back from injury and that should help during the run-in . i believe bayern will prevail in the bundesliga regardless of how far they progress in the champions league .

as iran continues to develop its nuclear program , analysts fear that an arms race in the middle east could begin .
if sanctions continue to fail , these analysts say that military action is necessary to prevent this . as world powers negotiate on how to deal with iran 's continuing development of its nuclear program , concerns about a nuclear arms race in the middle east , prompted by iran 's determination to build nuclear weapons , are mounting .
officials from the united states , russia , france , britain , germany and china participated in a conference call yesterday to discuss how to handle iran 's flaunting of international demands to cease nuclear work .
these countries , while attempting to deter iran from continued nuclear development by offering tehran incentives to allow more oversight of its program , are also threatening sanctions if tehran does not stop work toward producing weapons grade uranium . iran , which has faced sanctions from the united nations three times , says it is developing its nuclear program for peaceful purposes and has refused to allow inspectors from the international atomic energy agency access to its nuclear facilities .
it is party to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty , but repeatedly has been found non-compliant .
there is growing fear that iran will not stop work toward a weapon unless drastic action is taken .
middle east experts said that if iran continues on its current path , a nuclear arms race in the region could ensue . ' ' turkey , algeria , egypt , and saudi arabia are all potential candidates to develop nuclear weapons , " abdulaziz sager , chairman of the gulf research center in dubai , told deutsche welle .
' ' and they will say , if -lsb- nuclear weapon development -rsb- is permitted in iran , why ca n't we develop weapons as well ? "
a threat beyond israel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has called for the destruction of israel .
a nuclear-armed iran is widely seen as a direct threat to israel , as iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has pledged to ' ' wipe israel off the map . "
israel has not ruled out preemptive strikes against suspected nuclear sites inside iran if development continues .
but iran 's possession of a nuclear weapon has implications for other countries in the region as well , mustafa alani , senior advisor and program director at the gulf research center says .
' ' the question is not whether iran uses the bomb against other countries in the middle east , " alani told deutsche welle .
' ' but the question is whether iran has control of the region , and the political consequences of a dominant iran . "
the political balance of power in the middle east at the current time is relatively stable .
israel has a dominant military and nuclear weapons , as well as the backing of the united states .
economic power is diversified , as a number of states have thriving oil industries .
the region is also politically stable , with the exception of iraq , which is trying to sustain a functioning government in the wake of the iraq war .
a nuclear-armed and increasingly belligerent iran would dramatically alter this balance .
ahmadinejad would hold disproportionate clout , and if recent belligerent statements toward israel are to be believed , seems to be willing to use it .
preemption vs. nuclear war in the past , analysts have told deutsche welle that israel is unlikely to carry out unilateral military action against iran , as any action is not likely to destroy iran 's entire nuclear infrastructure .
last month , chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff admiral mike mullen told congress ' ' no strike , however effective , will be in and of itself decisive . "
however , the gulf center 's sager says that if economic sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a convoy of israeli military armored vehicles on the gaza strip. continue to fail , preemptive military action to stop iran from acquiring nuclear weapons is needed .
the power iran would have would be too great and too much of a risk to the region . ' ' if i had to chose between living with iran as a constant threat , or a military strike with limited retaliation , i can more easily live with the military option , " he said .
' ' we have already lived through wars , and no countries were erased from the map . "

as iran continues to develop its nuclear program , analysts fear that an arms race in the middle east could begin .
if sanctions continue to fail , these analysts say that military action is necessary to prevent this . as world powers negotiate on how to deal with iran 's continuing development of its nuclear program , concerns about a nuclear arms race in the middle east , prompted by iran 's determination to build nuclear weapons , are mounting .
officials from the united states , russia , france , britain , germany and china participated in a conference call yesterday to discuss how to handle iran 's flaunting of international demands to cease nuclear work .
these countries , while attempting to deter iran from continued nuclear development by offering tehran incentives to allow more oversight of its program , are also threatening sanctions if tehran does not stop work toward producing weapons grade uranium . iran , which has faced sanctions from the united nations three times , says it is developing its nuclear program for peaceful purposes and has refused to allow inspectors from the international atomic energy agency access to its nuclear facilities .
it is party to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty , but repeatedly has been found non-compliant .
there is growing fear that iran will not stop work toward a weapon unless drastic action is taken .
middle east experts said that if iran continues on its current path , a nuclear arms race in the region could ensue . ' ' turkey , algeria , egypt , and saudi arabia are all potential candidates to develop nuclear weapons , " abdulaziz sager , chairman of the gulf research center in dubai , told deutsche welle .

a nuclear-armed iran is widely seen as a direct threat to israel , as iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has pledged to ' ' wipe israel off the map . "
israel has not ruled out preemptive strikes against suspected nuclear sites inside iran if development continues .
but iran 's possession of a nuclear weapon has implications for other countries in the region as well , mustafa alani , senior advisor and program director at the gulf research center says .
' ' the question is not whether iran uses the bomb against other countries in the middle east , " alani told deutsche welle .
' ' but the question is whether iran has control of the region , and the political consequences of a dominant iran . "
the political balance of power in the middle east at the current time is relatively stable .
israel has a dominant military and nuclear weapons , as well as the backing of the united states .
economic power is diversified , as a number of states have thriving oil industries .
the region is also politically stable , with the exception of iraq , which is trying to sustain a functioning government in the wake of the iraq war .
a nuclear-armed and increasingly belligerent iran would dramatically alter this balance .
ahmadinejad would hold disproportionate clout , and if recent belligerent statements toward israel are to be believed , seems to be willing to use it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 25.03.2010 tired bayern need to dig deep as their chase for three titles intensifies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's fatigue was evident again at schalke bayern munich reached the german cup final on wednesday night after beating schalke .
with their bundesliga and champions league campaigns still on course , bayern face a punishing end-of-season run . it took something special for bayern munich to beat schalke in their own backyard to reach the german cup final on wednesday night .
dutch international arjen robben looked to be going nowhere when he took off with the ball just inside the schalke half before racing down the right-wing to the corner flag .
one electric injection of pace and direction later , with three defenders flailing in his wake , robben was suddenly in the penalty area lashing a left-footed shot beyond schalke keeper manuel neuer to win the semi-final in style .
although bayern had the lion 's share of possession and the early chances in this tense and sometimes bad tempered meeting , robben 's 112th minute winner was the only flash of real class in the whole game .
and despite having eight minutes to save the tie after the bayern winger scored , it was clear schalke were out as soon as the dutchman 's shot hit the back of the net .
neither team had produced anything as decisive in nearly two hours of soccer .
robben 's act of individual brilliance was a worthy match winner , but the dutchman 's tenth goal of the season certainly put a thick layer of gloss on a rather dull bayern performance .
schalke 's overwhelming emphasis on defense , along with the terrible state of the turf in the veltins arena , gradually sapped bayern 's strength and creativity .
but even the bavarians ' early attempts on goal were far from polished .
energetic robben the exception as bayern labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben stood out from the lethargic pack on wednesday robben was the exception throughout , tirelessly chasing and making runs at schalke defenders .
no-one else , not even the late substitute franck ribery , looked able to summon that kind of energy , which could be a matter of concern in the coming weeks .
" we 're still involved in three competitions and that is emotionally not all that easy for the players , " bayern coach louis van gaal said after wednesday 's semifinal win .
" but we want to be involved in all three competitions , so we will have to come to terms with that . "
with league matches against main title rivals schalke and bayer leverkusen on the horizon , and a make-or-break champions league tie over two legs against manchester united , bayern 's season will likely be decided by the end of april - for better or worse .
the concern settling over munich is that the squad may not be deep enough to survive three consecutive title races .
loan deals force coach 's hand over rising stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal 's faith in young players is being put to the test luke faron , a bayern munich expert with theoffside.com , believes that bayern are beginning to feel the effects of loaning a number of players out to other clubs and promoting youngsters to a first team involved in not only a bundesliga title fight and a lengthy german cup campaign but also european matches of the highest standard .
" loaning brazilian defender breno to nuremberg was a necessary step in continuing his development and in getting the young center back some playing time , " faron told deutsche welle .
loaning left back edson braafheid to celtic was a bit surprising , said faron .
combined with breno 's move , it meant holger badstuber would be the only true reserve center back , in addition to starting at left back .
" with center backs van buyten and demichelis suffering injuries , badstuber had to move back inside and the pressure on the youngster has been intense . "
faron believes that van gaal has been forced to test the faith he had in the young players he brought into replenish the senior side in january , but says the coach has so far - on the whole - been justified in his decisions .
" diego contento and david alaba have both performed admirably in their champions league debuts , " said faron .
" alaba had a very bad final five minutes in frankfurt last weekend and perhaps that showed the limits of the wisdom of playing a 17-year-old natural midfielder out of position in a highly competitive match . "
he said contento had had his hands full with jefferson farfan on wednesday , but that he had coped with the task well enough .
if any player was showing fatigue , said faron , it was forward thomas mueller " it 's a big adjustment for a young player like mueller who has n't even played a full season in the bundesliga before .
add in the champions league and the german cup and the fact he also just made his national team debut , and it 's easy to understand why . "
success from continuity makes coach reluctant to change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the league campaign did not start well under van gaal another factor which is contributing to bayern 's lethargy at this point in the season is van gaal 's commitment to continuity .
when he assumed control at the beginning of the season , it took the dutch coach at least ten matches of tinkering before he settled on his preferred line-up - ten matches during which bayern seemed rudderless and the coach 's credentials were questioned .
once the coach found his formula in november , however , an impressive winning streak began and van gaal has not looked back .
as a result , the dutchman risks wearing out his preferred starting 11 .
as bayern enter a run of decisive matches , time will tell if the squad 's mix of youngsters and stars can maintain top performance .
luke faron believes the bavarian giants have what it takes , regardless of tired legs .
" bayern have a chance against manchester united , but they have to be considered underdogs , " he said . " munich 's defense has not performed at the level necessary to progress further in the competition , though wednesday night 's performance in the cup might be the start of a turnaround . "
the big test , says faron , begins a week from saturday , when bayern face schalke , man united and bayer leverkusen all away from home , within a seven day period .
but thereafter , prospects seem bright .
" after the match in leverkusen they have an exceptionally easy schedule in the league for the last month of the campaign . in addition , they 're getting key players like gomez and demichelis back from injury and that should help during the run-in . i believe bayern will prevail in the bundesliga regardless of how far they progress in the champions league .

with their bundesliga and champions league campaigns still on course , bayern face a punishing end-of-season run . it took something special for bayern munich to beat schalke in their own backyard to reach the german cup final on wednesday night .
dutch international arjen robben looked to be going nowhere when he took off with the ball just inside the schalke half before racing down the right-wing to the corner flag .
one electric injection of pace and direction later , with three defenders flailing in his wake , robben was suddenly in the penalty area lashing a left-footed shot beyond schalke keeper manuel neuer to win the semi-final in style .
although bayern had the lion 's share of possession and the early chances in this tense and sometimes bad tempered meeting , robben 's 112th minute winner was the only flash of real class in the whole game .
and despite having eight minutes to save the tie after the bayern winger scored , it was clear schalke were out as soon as the dutchman 's shot hit the back of the net .
neither team had produced anything as decisive in nearly two hours of soccer .
robben 's act of individual brilliance was a worthy match winner , but the dutchman 's tenth goal of the season certainly put a thick layer of gloss on a rather dull bayern performance .
schalke 's overwhelming emphasis on defense , along with the terrible state of the turf in the veltins arena , gradually sapped bayern 's strength and creativity .
but even the bavarians ' early attempts on goal were far from polished .
energetic robben the exception as bayern labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben stood out from the lethargic pack on wednesday robben was the exception throughout , tirelessly chasing and making runs at schalke defenders .
no-one else , not even the late substitute franck ribery , looked able to summon that kind of energy , which could be a matter of concern in the coming weeks .
" we 're still involved in three competitions and that is emotionally not all that easy for the players , " bayern coach louis van gaal said after wednesday 's semifinal win .
" but we want to be involved in all three competitions , so we will have to come to terms with that . "
with league matches against main title rivals schalke and bayer leverkusen on the horizon , and a make-or-break champions league tie over two legs against manchester united , bayern 's season will likely be decided by the end of april - for better or worse .
the concern settling over munich is that the squad may not be deep enough to survive three consecutive title races .
loan deals force coach 's hand over rising stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal 's faith in young players is being put to the test luke faron , a bayern munich expert with theoffside.com , believes that bayern are beginning to feel the effects of loaning a number of players out to other clubs and promoting youngsters to a first team involved in not only a bundesliga title fight and a lengthy german cup campaign but also european matches of the highest standard .
" loaning brazilian defender breno to nuremberg was a necessary step in continuing his development and in getting the young center back some playing time , " faron told deutsche welle .
loaning left back edson braafheid to celtic was a bit surprising , said faron .
combined with breno 's move , it meant holger badstuber would be the only true reserve center back , in addition to starting at left back .
" with center backs van buyten and demichelis suffering injuries , badstuber had to move back inside and the pressure on the youngster has been intense . "
faron believes that van gaal has been forced to test the faith he had in the young players he brought into replenish the senior side in january , but says the coach has so far - on the whole - been justified in his decisions .
" diego contento and david alaba have both performed admirably in their champions league debuts , " said faron .
" alaba had a very bad final five minutes in frankfurt last weekend and perhaps that showed the limits of the wisdom of playing a 17-year-old natural midfielder out of position in a highly competitive match . "
he said contento had had his hands full with jefferson farfan on wednesday , but that he had coped with the task well enough .
if any player was showing fatigue , said faron , it was forward thomas mueller " it 's a big adjustment for a young player like mueller who has n't even played a full season in the bundesliga before .
add in the champions league and the german cup and the fact he also just made his national team debut , and it 's easy to understand why . "
success from continuity makes coach reluctant to change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the league campaign did not start well under van gaal another factor which is contributing to bayern 's lethargy at this point in the season is van gaal 's commitment to continuity .
when he assumed control at the beginning of the season , it took the dutch coach at least ten matches of tinkering before he settled on his preferred line-up - ten matches during which bayern seemed rudderless and the coach 's credentials were questioned .
once the coach found his formula in november , however , an impressive winning streak began and van gaal has not looked back .
as a result , the dutchman risks wearing out his preferred starting 11 .
as bayern enter a run of decisive matches , time will tell if the squad 's mix of youngsters and stars can maintain top performance .
luke faron believes the bavarian giants have what it takes , regardless of tired legs .
" bayern have a chance against manchester united , but they have to be considered underdogs , " he said . " munich 's defense has not performed at the level necessary to progress further in the competition , though wednesday night 's performance in the cup might be the start of a turnaround . "
the big test , says faron , begins a week from saturday , when bayern face schalke , man united and bayer leverkusen all away from home , within a seven day period .
but thereafter , prospects seem bright .
" after the match in leverkusen they have an exceptionally easy schedule in the league for the last month of the campaign . in addition , they 're getting key players like gomez and demichelis back from injury and that should help during the run-in . i believe bayern will prevail in the bundesliga regardless of how far they progress in the champions league .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 25.03.2010 iran 's nuclear work brings fear of mideast arms race großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad at iran 's nuclear enrichment facility in natanz .
as iran continues to develop its nuclear program , analysts fear that an arms race in the middle east could begin .
if sanctions continue to fail , these analysts say that military action is necessary to prevent this . as world powers negotiate on how to deal with iran 's continuing development of its nuclear program , concerns about a nuclear arms race in the middle east , prompted by iran 's determination to build nuclear weapons , are mounting .
officials from the united states , russia , france , britain , germany and china participated in a conference call yesterday to discuss how to handle iran 's flaunting of international demands to cease nuclear work .
these countries , while attempting to deter iran from continued nuclear development by offering tehran incentives to allow more oversight of its program , are also threatening sanctions if tehran does not stop work toward producing weapons grade uranium . iran , which has faced sanctions from the united nations three times , says it is developing its nuclear program for peaceful purposes and has refused to allow inspectors from the international atomic energy agency access to its nuclear facilities .
it is party to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty , but repeatedly has been found non-compliant .
there is growing fear that iran will not stop work toward a weapon unless drastic action is taken .
middle east experts said that if iran continues on its current path , a nuclear arms race in the region could ensue . ' ' turkey , algeria , egypt , and saudi arabia are all potential candidates to develop nuclear weapons , " abdulaziz sager , chairman of the gulf research center in dubai , told deutsche welle .
' ' and they will say , if -lsb- nuclear weapon development -rsb- is permitted in iran , why ca n't we develop weapons as well ? "
a threat beyond israel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has called for the destruction of israel .
a nuclear-armed iran is widely seen as a direct threat to israel , as iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has pledged to ' ' wipe israel off the map . "
israel has not ruled out preemptive strikes against suspected nuclear sites inside iran if development continues .
but iran 's possession of a nuclear weapon has implications for other countries in the region as well , mustafa alani , senior advisor and program director at the gulf research center says .
' ' the question is not whether iran uses the bomb against other countries in the middle east , " alani told deutsche welle .
' ' but the question is whether iran has control of the region , and the political consequences of a dominant iran . "
the political balance of power in the middle east at the current time is relatively stable .
israel has a dominant military and nuclear weapons , as well as the backing of the united states .
economic power is diversified , as a number of states have thriving oil industries .
the region is also politically stable , with the exception of iraq , which is trying to sustain a functioning government in the wake of the iraq war .
a nuclear-armed and increasingly belligerent iran would dramatically alter this balance .
ahmadinejad would hold disproportionate clout , and if recent belligerent statements toward israel are to be believed , seems to be willing to use it .
preemption vs. nuclear war in the past , analysts have told deutsche welle that israel is unlikely to carry out unilateral military action against iran , as any action is not likely to destroy iran 's entire nuclear infrastructure .
last month , chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff admiral mike mullen told congress ' ' no strike , however effective , will be in and of itself decisive . "
however , the gulf center 's sager says that if economic sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a convoy of israeli military armored vehicles on the gaza strip. continue to fail , preemptive military action to stop iran from acquiring nuclear weapons is needed .
the power iran would have would be too great and too much of a risk to the region . ' ' if i had to chose between living with iran as a constant threat , or a military strike with limited retaliation , i can more easily live with the military option , " he said .
' ' we have already lived through wars , and no countries were erased from the map . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 25.03.2010 erdogan calls for turkish schools in germany and dual citizenship großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 2.7 million people of turkish origin live in germany suggestions by turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan for more turkish schools in germany have been largely rejected by german officials as detrimental to integration . german officials have rejected calls by turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan to introduce turkish schools in germany .
" in turkey , we have german high schools - why should n't there be turkish high schools in germany ? "
erdogan asked in an interview with german weekly die zeit .
erdogan said that many of the almost three million people of turkish origin living in germany had problems with both languages , and offering education in turkish might also help their german .
" germany has not yet caught up with the times , " erdogan said .
" one must first have a firm command of one 's own language , that is to say , turkish , and that is unfortunately rarely the case . "
the federal government 's integration commissioner , maria boehmer , acknowledged the advantage pupils might gain if they could be fluent in two languages , but said learning german should take priority .
" only those who know german have a chance of social advancement , " boehmer , a christian democrat , told the daily berliner zeitung .
the head of the christian democratic party 's german-turkish forum in north-rhine westphalia was also skeptical .
" turkish secondary schools are a dead end for students , " buelent arslan told the daily koelner stadtanzeiger .
" to be successful in germany , a good level of german is essential , " arslan added .
tensions ahead of merkel visit the general secretary of the christian democrat 's bavarian sister party , the csu , said that erdogan was trying to use turkish people in germany to further his own political purposes .
" such demands are an affront in the run-up to his visit with our chancellor angela merkel , " alexander dobrindt told spiegel online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan will meet merkel next week in ankara chancellor angela merkel is due in ankara next monday for a two-day visit .
her relationship with erdogan is problematic , as germany does not favor full eu membership for turkey , calling for a ' privileged partnership ' instead .
turkey has repeatedly rejected anything but full membership in the bloc .
in berlin , which has the largest turkish community in germany , the council for education said the acquisition of turkish language was not necessarily conducive to integration .
it is the knowledge of german that counts , and often , turks in germany struggle to find skilled jobs because of a lack of good german , according to the council .
it also pointed out that there are already turkish grammar schools in germany , but they are privately funded .
some support erdogan 's comments found little support in the german media , but an editorial by daily sueddeutsche zeitung sees some merit in erdogan 's suggestion .
the newspaper pointed out that if more french schools were to be built in germany , it would be hailed as a symbol of franco-german friendship .
but germany seems to have a problem with the turkish language .
it does not " count for much " , according to sueddeutsche .
many companies are desperate to hire people with multiple language skills , so not giving turks the opportunity to study their language in-depth , was a " missed opportunity " , the paper claimed .
no dual citizenship erdogan also criticized the fact that germany does not allow dual citizenship unless the additional country is a member of the eu .
" i find it regrettable that germany is among the countries in the eu that does not allow dual citizenship , " he told die zeit .
a child of foreign parents can only obtain dual citizenship if one parent has lived in germany regularly for at least eight years .
but , at age 23 , the child needs to choose one nationality .
erdogan is no stranger to provocation .
in a speech in cologne in 2008 , erdogan said turks in germany can not be expected to ' assimilate ' and deny their turkish identity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de research -pipe- 25.03.2010 german researchers decode unrecognized dna from ancient humanoid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists analyzed dna from a fossil finger found in siberia when researchers discovered a fossil finger in a siberian cave , they found an ancestor - and perhaps a new human species .
johannes krause told deutsche welle about his team 's efforts to analyze the ancient dna . the new report was published on the website of science journal " nature " on march 24 .
leipzig researchers johannes krause and svante pääbo of the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology co-authored the international project . deutsche welle : how did you find a bone fragment from the altai mountains ?
johannes krause : for several years , we 've been involved in a very productive collaboration with our colleagues in russia .
we received bones from them that we later identified as neanderthal bones , for example , thus showing that neanderthals lived in southern siberia , too - not just in europe .
and in recent years , we 've received other bone samples for genetic testing .
here in leipzig , we 've taken our neanderthal research to the genetic level , so we 've been examining the dna of ancient man -lrb- ... -rrb- to help us learn how prehistoric man is related to modern-day man or other forms of early man . the neaderthal has their own dna at least for portions of the genome , so they are n't our direct ancestors ; they 're more an extinct cousin of sorts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dna analysis of homonid species could shed light on their ties to modern man and during our search for new neanderthal bones , we stumbled upon these bones with dna that belonged neither to neanderthals nor modern man .
it constitutes a new form of prehistoric man that had never been discovered - something we had never seen from a genetic standpoint and that we could n't categorize as an existing form of prehistoric man .
everyone 's calling this a sensation - would you call it that ?
i think it 's a sensation because until now we had the potential to do genetic research on two different forms of man - now there 's a third .
so that 's pretty sensational , particularly as it ca n't be classified according to any existing form of prehistoric man .
unfortunately , we do n't have a complete skeleton - just the bone from a pinkie finger .
it 's a tiny fragment that ca n't tell us much about the morphology .
therefore we still do n't know what this prehistoric man looked like - did he perhaps look like a neanderthal , modern man or a homo erectus ?
so we lack quite a lot of information , but we now have the potential to study the dna of this prehistoric man ; we have the potential to examine the entire genome and genetic material from this prehistoric man and compare it to modern man and the neanderthals , for instance .
and through that , we can learn a lot .
for example , what kind of interactions occurred between these three species of prehistoric man ?
we could also show that they lived in the same place at the same time - that 's another sensation for us .
that means , we find neanderthal bones in a nearby cave , and in same layer in which we found the bones of the new human form , we find archaeological artifacts that appear to have come from modern man - ornaments and jewelry that are only associated with modern man .
so it looks as though these three forms of early man lived in the same place at the same time .
you can then imagine any number of scenarios where gene flow could have occurred between these three populations , and that is certainly something that 's very interesting to analyze on a genetic level .
is finding something like this an anthropologist 's dream come true ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian researchers discovered the fossil bone at a site in the altai mountains in siberia yes , this is probably a once-in-a-lifetime chance - discovering a new species or form of prehistoric man .
it 's certainly quite exciting for us .
of course , we should note that we 're not calling it a new species - we 're only talking about a new " form . "
so far , we 've only analyzed a tiny portion of the dna , and only when the entire genome or a large part of the genome has been analyzed will we be able to tell whether it 's something completely new or different , like modern man or the neanderthals , for instance .
and until then , we 're not going to talk about a new species .
but all signs indicate that we 're actually dealing with an entirely knew species of man here .
then what do you know already ; whose bones are they ?
so far , we can only say that this dna - the dna we 've studied so far from this prehistoric man - has about 1 million years between it and the dna of modern man .
so that means that these two forms , modern man and prehistoric man , spent at least 1 million years developing in very different ways .
based on our genetic tests , we can also say that modern man is more closely related to the neanderthals than he is to this new form of prehistoric man - we 're seeing two times as many differences between the dna of modern man and this new form than we do with modern man and the neanderthals .
this represents a completely different line that split off from modern man much earlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mitochondrial dna decoding showed differences between the ancestor and modern man do you know if it was a woman or a man ?
we 've named it " x woman . "
" x " stands for the unknown , since we ca n't classify it so easiliy , as i 'd mentioned . and " woman " because we examined the mitochondrial dna - the dna from the powerhouse of the cell - and that 's always passed down from the mother to the child .
so we 're looking at the female lineage , and so we adopted a feministic position .
but since we have yet to examine the entire genetic material , we still do n't know whether it 's a man or a woman .
and this process for examining the mitochrondrial dna - that 's something you developed ?
yes , my boss svante pääbo studied mitochrondrial dna from prehistoric man for the first time in the ' 90s - at the time , from neanderthals .
in recent years , we have refined these methods to help us obtain more information more quickly - and of a higher qualitative value .
but we 've really kicked this kind of research into high gear in recent years .
what 's next ?
what else do you plan to study - and what do you hope to find ?
we plan to study the entire genome - this prehistoric man 's entire genetic material .
we do n't just want to look at this tiny fraction , rather we will examine the entire genome to learn more about this prehistoric man and to see how he was related to modern man and to neanderthals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the neanderthals share many commonalities with modern man was there potential gene flow between these three populations ?
and what can we learn about phenotypical features - what color hair did he have ?
we 'll look at other kinds of features that we can reconstruct based on dna sequencing .
and who gets to keep the bone once you conclude your research ? whatever 's left of the bone will certainly be sent back to novosibirsk , to the museum responsible for the entire excavation .
that said , it 's not a spectacular bone - it 's only as large as cherry pit .
so it 's a very tiny fragment and it might not be all that interesting to look at .

we 've named it " x woman . "
" x " stands for the unknown , since we ca n't classify it so easiliy , as i 'd mentioned . and " woman " because we examined the mitochondrial dna - the dna from the powerhouse of the cell - and that 's always passed down from the mother to the child .
so we 're looking at the female lineage , and so we adopted a feministic position .
but since we have yet to examine the entire genetic material , we still do n't know whether it 's a man or a woman .
and this process for examining the mitochrondrial dna - that 's something you developed ?
yes , my boss svante pääbo studied mitochrondrial dna from prehistoric man for the first time in the ' 90s - at the time , from neanderthals .
in recent years , we have refined these methods to help us obtain more information more quickly - and of a higher qualitative value .
but we 've really kicked this kind of research into high gear in recent years .
what 's next ?
what else do you plan to study - and what do you hope to find ?
we plan to study the entire genome - this prehistoric man 's entire genetic material .
we do n't just want to look at this tiny fraction , rather we will examine the entire genome to learn more about this prehistoric man and to see how he was related to modern man and to neanderthals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the neanderthals share many commonalities with modern man was there potential gene flow between these three populations ?
and what can we learn about phenotypical features - what color hair did he have ?
we 'll look at other kinds of features that we can reconstruct based on dna sequencing .
and who gets to keep the bone once you conclude your research ? whatever 's left of the bone will certainly be sent back to novosibirsk , to the museum responsible for the entire excavation .

johannes krause told deutsche welle about his team 's efforts to analyze the ancient dna . the new report was published on the website of science journal " nature " on march 24 .
leipzig researchers johannes krause and svante pääbo of the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology co-authored the international project . deutsche welle : how did you find a bone fragment from the altai mountains ?
johannes krause : for several years , we 've been involved in a very productive collaboration with our colleagues in russia .
we received bones from them that we later identified as neanderthal bones , for example , thus showing that neanderthals lived in southern siberia , too - not just in europe .
and in recent years , we 've received other bone samples for genetic testing .
here in leipzig , we 've taken our neanderthal research to the genetic level , so we 've been examining the dna of ancient man -lrb- ... -rrb- to help us learn how prehistoric man is related to modern-day man or other forms of early man . the neaderthal has their own dna at least for portions of the genome , so they are n't our direct ancestors ; they 're more an extinct cousin of sorts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dna analysis of homonid species could shed light on their ties to modern man and during our search for new neanderthal bones , we stumbled upon these bones with dna that belonged neither to neanderthals nor modern man .
it constitutes a new form of prehistoric man that had never been discovered - something we had never seen from a genetic standpoint and that we could n't categorize as an existing form of prehistoric man .
everyone 's calling this a sensation - would you call it that ?
i think it 's a sensation because until now we had the potential to do genetic research on two different forms of man - now there 's a third .
so that 's pretty sensational , particularly as it ca n't be classified according to any existing form of prehistoric man .
unfortunately , we do n't have a complete skeleton - just the bone from a pinkie finger .
it 's a tiny fragment that ca n't tell us much about the morphology .
therefore we still do n't know what this prehistoric man looked like - did he perhaps look like a neanderthal , modern man or a homo erectus ?
so we lack quite a lot of information , but we now have the potential to study the dna of this prehistoric man ; we have the potential to examine the entire genome and genetic material from this prehistoric man and compare it to modern man and the neanderthals , for instance .
and through that , we can learn a lot .
for example , what kind of interactions occurred between these three species of prehistoric man ?
we could also show that they lived in the same place at the same time - that 's another sensation for us .
that means , we find neanderthal bones in a nearby cave , and in same layer in which we found the bones of the new human form , we find archaeological artifacts that appear to have come from modern man - ornaments and jewelry that are only associated with modern man .
so it looks as though these three forms of early man lived in the same place at the same time .
you can then imagine any number of scenarios where gene flow could have occurred between these three populations , and that is certainly something that 's very interesting to analyze on a genetic level .
is finding something like this an anthropologist 's dream come true ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian researchers discovered the fossil bone at a site in the altai mountains in siberia yes , this is probably a once-in-a-lifetime chance - discovering a new species or form of prehistoric man .
it 's certainly quite exciting for us .
of course , we should note that we 're not calling it a new species - we 're only talking about a new " form . "
so far , we 've only analyzed a tiny portion of the dna , and only when the entire genome or a large part of the genome has been analyzed will we be able to tell whether it 's something completely new or different , like modern man or the neanderthals , for instance .
and until then , we 're not going to talk about a new species .
but all signs indicate that we 're actually dealing with an entirely knew species of man here .
then what do you know already ; whose bones are they ?
so far , we can only say that this dna - the dna we 've studied so far from this prehistoric man - has about 1 million years between it and the dna of modern man .
so that means that these two forms , modern man and prehistoric man , spent at least 1 million years developing in very different ways .
based on our genetic tests , we can also say that modern man is more closely related to the neanderthals than he is to this new form of prehistoric man - we 're seeing two times as many differences between the dna of modern man and this new form than we do with modern man and the neanderthals .
this represents a completely different line that split off from modern man much earlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mitochondrial dna decoding showed differences between the ancestor and modern man do you know if it was a woman or a man ?
we 've named it " x woman . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 25.03.2010 latest priest sex abuse scandal heats up responsibility debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as cardinal , ratzinger was informed but failed to act in the murphy case as the latest sexual abuse scandal in the catholic church gets uncomfortably close to the pope , questions of punishment versus apology in dealing with pedophile priests have once again emerged . the catholic church says the only way to face the burgeoning numbers of accusations is with complete honesty - and by urging victims to take legal action .
meanwhile , activists say the church should take more responsibility for its wayward leaders .
either way , the situation surrounding sexual abuse scandals in the catholic church is like a modern-day hydra myth - no sooner is one scandal addressed than another rises up to take its place .
with europe 's catholics still reeling from a series of alleged child-molestation cover-ups , news broke in the united states of a 1996 case that touches the upper echelons of church power .
failure to defrock in the latest case to hit headlines , the new york times reported on thursday that pope benedict xvi ignored allegations of child sex abuse back in the 1990s .
at the time , he was head of the congregation of the doctrine of the faith , the vatican body that judges cases of sexual abuse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victims recently took to the streets of the vatican to protest the paper reported that the pope - then cardinal joseph ratzinger - failed to defrock rev. lawrence murphy , a priest in milwaukee who had been accused of sexually abusing some 200 deaf boys , despite the fact that he was aware of the allegations .
murphy worked from 1950 to 1977 at a school for the deaf and died in 1998 .
a spokesman for the vatican , federico lombardi , argued that rome was n't informed of the case until 20 years after it happened , and said that in the end the church did n't take action against murphy because he had confessed the acts and because he was very ill and close to the end of his life .
records uncovered by the times show that three different bishops were aware of the accusations , but that the case was not brought to trial .
still , lombardi told news service reuters that the church is eager to see abusive priests brought to justice .
church calls in professional help this is a feeling shared by christoph heckeley , a spokesman for the archbishopric of cologne , germany .
the catholic church in germany has had a directive for the past eight years that urges prosecution in sex abuse cases , heckeley told deutsche welle .
" since 2002 we have a directive from the german bishops conference that says what you have to do in case sexual abuse is suspected , " heckeley said .
people with complaints are referred to professionals - psychologists , doctors and legal experts - who are hired by each bishopric , and are qualified to advise people who want to come forward with sex abuse allegations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abuse allegedly took place at some german jesuit schools " our aim is to listen to the victims and help them get justice , even when the cases are years or decades old .
they need somebody to listen to them , and the most important thing is that they get justice , " he said .
the response from the church will differ case by case , but the church " urgently advises " victims to take perpetrators to court .
unfortunately , heckeley said , victims often do n't want to do this because it can be too upsetting to their families , and " can destroy their entire social environment - it can traumatize them a second time .
you have to be careful . "
prosecution is a right , not an obligation while there is a right to prosecute , there is no obligation to do so - a situation that is currently under hot debate .
still , heckeley said experts recommend caution , since " the dangers -lrb- of forced prosecution -rrb- could outweigh the risks . "
no matter what shape the case takes in federal court , allegations of abuse are always looked into by a church tribunal out of rome .
yet in the murphy case , ratzinger 's deputy at the time advised a secret disciplinary trial at first .
he later reversed that decision , and in 1998 , murphy appealed directly to ratzinger for clemency , shortly before he died .
all the calls for openness , trials and apologies are well and good , victims-rights advocates say , but they do n't go far enough .
what is missing on the part of the church is a departure from the secrecy , and a willingness to admit its own cover-ups .
last week , following revelations of pedophilia that rocked the irish catholic church , the pope issued a long-awaited apology to victims of child sex abuse in ireland .
he acknowledged " serious mistakes " on the part of the church , as well as the sense of betrayal in the church felt by victims and their families .
victims ' groups start protests but irish victims ' groups felt that the apology fell short of their demands ; they called for the church to acknowledge its role in covering up abuse .
maeve lewis , executive director of irish victims ' rights group one in four , told bbc news , " we are really disappointed that there is no acknowledgement that the cover-up and the policy of cover-up in the church went right to the the vatican . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope finally addressed the cases of abuse in ireland and in germany , victims-rights advocates were incensed that the apology failed to mention cases of church pedophilia in munich that have dominated headlines for weeks .
the church has had to contend with cover-up allegations in that city while ratzinger was the city 's archbishop from 1977 to 1981 .
on thursday members of the us activist organization snap - survivor network of those abused by priests - launched a demonstration in the vatican , holding up signs that said " stop the secrecy now . "
they demanded that pope benedict open up all files on pedophile catholic clerics worldwide , and called for all " predator priests " to be defrocked .
the group has also protested in germany , austria , and the netherlands , all countries recently hit by church sex abuse scandals .
one official 's stance " i would ask the pope if he would please open up the files from the congregation of the doctrine of the faith and turn over all the information to the police , " barbara blaine , the president of snap , told reuters news service .
a trickle of acknowledgements have begun , and some say a wave may be coming .
earlier this month , the german church 's representative responsible for dealing with cases of abuse , bishop stephan ackermann , also acknowledged severe failures .
" where there was no will toward explanation and where the person who committed the crime was simply moved to a new post , we have to admit , in a whole array of cases , that there was a cover-up , " he told the rhein zeitung newspaper .
and this week , german news magazine focus reported that archbishop zollitsch , the leader of the german roman catholic church , also admitted cases of child sex abuse were known and covered up .
" yes , we did have that , " he said .
many see the catholic church as so damaged by these allegations that it will be hard for the institution to regain its footing .
" we can only survive this situation with openness and honesty , " says the cologne archbishopric 's heckeley .
" we have to try to win people 's trust that way . "

experts in kolkata on thursday said fishermen had confirmed this . the tiny island , which was about 3.5 kilometers long and 3 kilometers wide , was claimed by both bangladesh and india .
it had been a bone of contention between the two countries since the 1970s .

johannes krause told deutsche welle about his team 's efforts to analyze the ancient dna . the new report was published on the website of science journal " nature " on march 24 .
leipzig researchers johannes krause and svante pääbo of the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology co-authored the international project . deutsche welle : how did you find a bone fragment from the altai mountains ?
johannes krause : for several years , we 've been involved in a very productive collaboration with our colleagues in russia .
we received bones from them that we later identified as neanderthal bones , for example , thus showing that neanderthals lived in southern siberia , too - not just in europe .
and in recent years , we 've received other bone samples for genetic testing .
here in leipzig , we 've taken our neanderthal research to the genetic level , so we 've been examining the dna of ancient man -lrb- ... -rrb- to help us learn how prehistoric man is related to modern-day man or other forms of early man . the neaderthal has their own dna at least for portions of the genome , so they are n't our direct ancestors ; they 're more an extinct cousin of sorts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dna analysis of homonid species could shed light on their ties to modern man and during our search for new neanderthal bones , we stumbled upon these bones with dna that belonged neither to neanderthals nor modern man .
it constitutes a new form of prehistoric man that had never been discovered - something we had never seen from a genetic standpoint and that we could n't categorize as an existing form of prehistoric man .
everyone 's calling this a sensation - would you call it that ?
i think it 's a sensation because until now we had the potential to do genetic research on two different forms of man - now there 's a third .
so that 's pretty sensational , particularly as it ca n't be classified according to any existing form of prehistoric man .
unfortunately , we do n't have a complete skeleton - just the bone from a pinkie finger .
it 's a tiny fragment that ca n't tell us much about the morphology .
therefore we still do n't know what this prehistoric man looked like - did he perhaps look like a neanderthal , modern man or a homo erectus ?
so we lack quite a lot of information , but we now have the potential to study the dna of this prehistoric man ; we have the potential to examine the entire genome and genetic material from this prehistoric man and compare it to modern man and the neanderthals , for instance .
and through that , we can learn a lot .
for example , what kind of interactions occurred between these three species of prehistoric man ?
we could also show that they lived in the same place at the same time - that 's another sensation for us .
that means , we find neanderthal bones in a nearby cave , and in same layer in which we found the bones of the new human form , we find archaeological artifacts that appear to have come from modern man - ornaments and jewelry that are only associated with modern man .
so it looks as though these three forms of early man lived in the same place at the same time .
you can then imagine any number of scenarios where gene flow could have occurred between these three populations , and that is certainly something that 's very interesting to analyze on a genetic level .
is finding something like this an anthropologist 's dream come true ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian researchers discovered the fossil bone at a site in the altai mountains in siberia yes , this is probably a once-in-a-lifetime chance - discovering a new species or form of prehistoric man .
it 's certainly quite exciting for us .
of course , we should note that we 're not calling it a new species - we 're only talking about a new " form . "
so far , we 've only analyzed a tiny portion of the dna , and only when the entire genome or a large part of the genome has been analyzed will we be able to tell whether it 's something completely new or different , like modern man or the neanderthals , for instance .
and until then , we 're not going to talk about a new species .
but all signs indicate that we 're actually dealing with an entirely knew species of man here .
then what do you know already ; whose bones are they ?
so far , we can only say that this dna - the dna we 've studied so far from this prehistoric man - has about 1 million years between it and the dna of modern man .
so that means that these two forms , modern man and prehistoric man , spent at least 1 million years developing in very different ways .
based on our genetic tests , we can also say that modern man is more closely related to the neanderthals than he is to this new form of prehistoric man - we 're seeing two times as many differences between the dna of modern man and this new form than we do with modern man and the neanderthals .
this represents a completely different line that split off from modern man much earlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mitochondrial dna decoding showed differences between the ancestor and modern man do you know if it was a woman or a man ?
we 've named it " x woman . "
" x " stands for the unknown , since we ca n't classify it so easiliy , as i 'd mentioned . and " woman " because we examined the mitochondrial dna - the dna from the powerhouse of the cell - and that 's always passed down from the mother to the child .
so we 're looking at the female lineage , and so we adopted a feministic position .
but since we have yet to examine the entire genetic material , we still do n't know whether it 's a man or a woman .
and this process for examining the mitochrondrial dna - that 's something you developed ?
yes , my boss svante pääbo studied mitochrondrial dna from prehistoric man for the first time in the ' 90s - at the time , from neanderthals .
in recent years , we have refined these methods to help us obtain more information more quickly - and of a higher qualitative value .
but we 've really kicked this kind of research into high gear in recent years .
what 's next ?
what else do you plan to study - and what do you hope to find ?
we plan to study the entire genome - this prehistoric man 's entire genetic material .
we do n't just want to look at this tiny fraction , rather we will examine the entire genome to learn more about this prehistoric man and to see how he was related to modern man and to neanderthals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the neanderthals share many commonalities with modern man was there potential gene flow between these three populations ?
and what can we learn about phenotypical features - what color hair did he have ?
we 'll look at other kinds of features that we can reconstruct based on dna sequencing .
and who gets to keep the bone once you conclude your research ? whatever 's left of the bone will certainly be sent back to novosibirsk , to the museum responsible for the entire excavation .
that said , it 's not a spectacular bone - it 's only as large as cherry pit .
so it 's a very tiny fragment and it might not be all that interesting to look at .

" in turkey , we have german high schools - why should n't there be turkish high schools in germany ? "
erdogan asked in an interview with german weekly die zeit .
erdogan said that many of the almost three million people of turkish origin living in germany had problems with both languages , and offering education in turkish might also help their german .
" germany has not yet caught up with the times , " erdogan said .
" one must first have a firm command of one 's own language , that is to say , turkish , and that is unfortunately rarely the case . "
the federal government 's integration commissioner , maria boehmer , acknowledged the advantage pupils might gain if they could be fluent in two languages , but said learning german should take priority .
" only those who know german have a chance of social advancement , " boehmer , a christian democrat , told the daily berliner zeitung .
the head of the christian democratic party 's german-turkish forum in north-rhine westphalia was also skeptical .
" turkish secondary schools are a dead end for students , " buelent arslan told the daily koelner stadtanzeiger .
" to be successful in germany , a good level of german is essential , " arslan added .
tensions ahead of merkel visit the general secretary of the christian democrat 's bavarian sister party , the csu , said that erdogan was trying to use turkish people in germany to further his own political purposes .
" such demands are an affront in the run-up to his visit with our chancellor angela merkel , " alexander dobrindt told spiegel online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan will meet merkel next week in ankara chancellor angela merkel is due in ankara next monday for a two-day visit .
her relationship with erdogan is problematic , as germany does not favor full eu membership for turkey , calling for a ' privileged partnership ' instead .
turkey has repeatedly rejected anything but full membership in the bloc .
in berlin , which has the largest turkish community in germany , the council for education said the acquisition of turkish language was not necessarily conducive to integration .
it is the knowledge of german that counts , and often , turks in germany struggle to find skilled jobs because of a lack of good german , according to the council .
it also pointed out that there are already turkish grammar schools in germany , but they are privately funded .
some support erdogan 's comments found little support in the german media , but an editorial by daily sueddeutsche zeitung sees some merit in erdogan 's suggestion .
the newspaper pointed out that if more french schools were to be built in germany , it would be hailed as a symbol of franco-german friendship .
but germany seems to have a problem with the turkish language .
it does not " count for much " , according to sueddeutsche .
many companies are desperate to hire people with multiple language skills , so not giving turks the opportunity to study their language in-depth , was a " missed opportunity " , the paper claimed .
no dual citizenship erdogan also criticized the fact that germany does not allow dual citizenship unless the additional country is a member of the eu .
" i find it regrettable that germany is among the countries in the eu that does not allow dual citizenship , " he told die zeit .
a child of foreign parents can only obtain dual citizenship if one parent has lived in germany regularly for at least eight years .
but , at age 23 , the child needs to choose one nationality .
erdogan is no stranger to provocation .
in a speech in cologne in 2008 , erdogan said turks in germany can not be expected to ' assimilate ' and deny their turkish identity .
the comments were seen by many as a direct criticism of how germany treats people of turkish origin. svs / ng / dpa / apn / afp editor : matt hermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 25.03.2010 tired bayern need to dig deep as their chase for three titles intensifies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's fatigue was evident again at schalke bayern munich reached the german cup final on wednesday night after beating schalke .
with their bundesliga and champions league campaigns still on course , bayern face a punishing end-of-season run . it took something special for bayern munich to beat schalke in their own backyard to reach the german cup final on wednesday night .
dutch international arjen robben looked to be going nowhere when he took off with the ball just inside the schalke half before racing down the right-wing to the corner flag .
one electric injection of pace and direction later , with three defenders flailing in his wake , robben was suddenly in the penalty area lashing a left-footed shot beyond schalke keeper manuel neuer to win the semi-final in style .
although bayern had the lion 's share of possession and the early chances in this tense and sometimes bad tempered meeting , robben 's 112th minute winner was the only flash of real class in the whole game .
and despite having eight minutes to save the tie after the bayern winger scored , it was clear schalke were out as soon as the dutchman 's shot hit the back of the net .
neither team had produced anything as decisive in nearly two hours of soccer .
robben 's act of individual brilliance was a worthy match winner , but the dutchman 's tenth goal of the season certainly put a thick layer of gloss on a rather dull bayern performance .
schalke 's overwhelming emphasis on defense , along with the terrible state of the turf in the veltins arena , gradually sapped bayern 's strength and creativity .
but even the bavarians ' early attempts on goal were far from polished .
energetic robben the exception as bayern labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben stood out from the lethargic pack on wednesday robben was the exception throughout , tirelessly chasing and making runs at schalke defenders .
no-one else , not even the late substitute franck ribery , looked able to summon that kind of energy , which could be a matter of concern in the coming weeks .
" we 're still involved in three competitions and that is emotionally not all that easy for the players , " bayern coach louis van gaal said after wednesday 's semifinal win .
" but we want to be involved in all three competitions , so we will have to come to terms with that . "
with league matches against main title rivals schalke and bayer leverkusen on the horizon , and a make-or-break champions league tie over two legs against manchester united , bayern 's season will likely be decided by the end of april - for better or worse .
the concern settling over munich is that the squad may not be deep enough to survive three consecutive title races .
loan deals force coach 's hand over rising stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal 's faith in young players is being put to the test luke faron , a bayern munich expert with theoffside.com , believes that bayern are beginning to feel the effects of loaning a number of players out to other clubs and promoting youngsters to a first team involved in not only a bundesliga title fight and a lengthy german cup campaign but also european matches of the highest standard .
" loaning brazilian defender breno to nuremberg was a necessary step in continuing his development and in getting the young center back some playing time , " faron told deutsche welle .
loaning left back edson braafheid to celtic was a bit surprising , said faron .
combined with breno 's move , it meant holger badstuber would be the only true reserve center back , in addition to starting at left back .
" with center backs van buyten and demichelis suffering injuries , badstuber had to move back inside and the pressure on the youngster has been intense . "
faron believes that van gaal has been forced to test the faith he had in the young players he brought into replenish the senior side in january , but says the coach has so far - on the whole - been justified in his decisions .
" diego contento and david alaba have both performed admirably in their champions league debuts , " said faron .
" alaba had a very bad final five minutes in frankfurt last weekend and perhaps that showed the limits of the wisdom of playing a 17-year-old natural midfielder out of position in a highly competitive match . "
he said contento had had his hands full with jefferson farfan on wednesday , but that he had coped with the task well enough .
if any player was showing fatigue , said faron , it was forward thomas mueller " it 's a big adjustment for a young player like mueller who has n't even played a full season in the bundesliga before .
add in the champions league and the german cup and the fact he also just made his national team debut , and it 's easy to understand why . "
success from continuity makes coach reluctant to change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the league campaign did not start well under van gaal another factor which is contributing to bayern 's lethargy at this point in the season is van gaal 's commitment to continuity .
when he assumed control at the beginning of the season , it took the dutch coach at least ten matches of tinkering before he settled on his preferred line-up - ten matches during which bayern seemed rudderless and the coach 's credentials were questioned .
once the coach found his formula in november , however , an impressive winning streak began and van gaal has not looked back .
as a result , the dutchman risks wearing out his preferred starting 11 .
as bayern enter a run of decisive matches , time will tell if the squad 's mix of youngsters and stars can maintain top performance .
luke faron believes the bavarian giants have what it takes , regardless of tired legs .
" bayern have a chance against manchester united , but they have to be considered underdogs , " he said . " munich 's defense has not performed at the level necessary to progress further in the competition , though wednesday night 's performance in the cup might be the start of a turnaround . "
the big test , says faron , begins a week from saturday , when bayern face schalke , man united and bayer leverkusen all away from home , within a seven day period .
but thereafter , prospects seem bright .
" after the match in leverkusen they have an exceptionally easy schedule in the league for the last month of the campaign . in addition , they 're getting key players like gomez and demichelis back from injury and that should help during the run-in . i believe bayern will prevail in the bundesliga regardless of how far they progress in the champions league .

but when those international couples divorce , those borders can make it even more complicated .
some eu nations want to change that . some 300,000 marriages between people from different european union countries take place every year - the romantic side of the increasing borderlessness of the 27-nation bloc .
but 140,000 mixed-nationality eu couples file for divorce every year , and many are faced with a legal maze created by divorce laws that vary from country to country across the eu . but ten eu countries - austria , bulgaria , france , greece , hungary , italy , luxembourg , romania , slovakia and spain - want to take advantage of a never-before-used 1997 treaty provision to simplify that process .
it allows for a subgroup of eu countries to develop a system of " enhanced cooperation . " the ten want to form their own pact harmonizing their divorce laws .
the countries need approval from eu justice ministers to draw up such a deal , but the idea would be to obligate couples to agree on a jurisdiction for their divorce proceedings .
if they can not agree , the divorce laws of the country where they last lived together would apply .
a boon or a burden ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reding says eu should work to simplify mixed-nationality divorce supporters of the idea say it would streamline mixed-nationality divorces , possibly reduce legal fees , and discourage " divorce shopping , " in which one spouse seeks out the jurisdiction that favors him or her .
" international couples can encounter arbitrary legal problems that turn the tragedy of divorce into a financial and emotional disaster … because national legal systems have so far failed to provide clear answers , " said eu justice commissioner viviane reding .
but critics of the proposal say it would create a " europe within europe . "
and value-laden family policy is an area the eu usually sidesteps .
divorce laws vary dramatically across the bloc .
malta does not even permit divorce , only legal separation .
but reding downplayed concerns of a two-speed europe , saying that " several " other countries were also interested in the enhanced cooperation. hf / afp / ap editor : stephanie siek send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in turkey , we have german high schools - why should n't there be turkish high schools in germany ? "
erdogan asked in an interview with german weekly die zeit .
erdogan said that many of the almost three million people of turkish origin living in germany had problems with both languages , and offering education in turkish might also help their german .
" germany has not yet caught up with the times , " erdogan said .
" one must first have a firm command of one 's own language , that is to say , turkish , and that is unfortunately rarely the case . "
the federal government 's integration commissioner , maria boehmer , acknowledged the advantage pupils might gain if they could be fluent in two languages , but said learning german should take priority .
" only those who know german have a chance of social advancement , " boehmer , a christian democrat , told the daily berliner zeitung .
the head of the christian democratic party 's german-turkish forum in north-rhine westphalia was also skeptical .
" turkish secondary schools are a dead end for students , " buelent arslan told the daily koelner stadtanzeiger .
" to be successful in germany , a good level of german is essential , " arslan added .
tensions ahead of merkel visit the general secretary of the christian democrat 's bavarian sister party , the csu , said that erdogan was trying to use turkish people in germany to further his own political purposes .
" such demands are an affront in the run-up to his visit with our chancellor angela merkel , " alexander dobrindt told spiegel online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan will meet merkel next week in ankara chancellor angela merkel is due in ankara next monday for a two-day visit .
her relationship with erdogan is problematic , as germany does not favor full eu membership for turkey , calling for a ' privileged partnership ' instead .
turkey has repeatedly rejected anything but full membership in the bloc .
in berlin , which has the largest turkish community in germany , the council for education said the acquisition of turkish language was not necessarily conducive to integration .
it is the knowledge of german that counts , and often , turks in germany struggle to find skilled jobs because of a lack of good german , according to the council .
it also pointed out that there are already turkish grammar schools in germany , but they are privately funded .
some support erdogan 's comments found little support in the german media , but an editorial by daily sueddeutsche zeitung sees some merit in erdogan 's suggestion .
the newspaper pointed out that if more french schools were to be built in germany , it would be hailed as a symbol of franco-german friendship .
but germany seems to have a problem with the turkish language .
it does not " count for much " , according to sueddeutsche .
many companies are desperate to hire people with multiple language skills , so not giving turks the opportunity to study their language in-depth , was a " missed opportunity " , the paper claimed .
no dual citizenship erdogan also criticized the fact that germany does not allow dual citizenship unless the additional country is a member of the eu .
" i find it regrettable that germany is among the countries in the eu that does not allow dual citizenship , " he told die zeit .
a child of foreign parents can only obtain dual citizenship if one parent has lived in germany regularly for at least eight years .
but , at age 23 , the child needs to choose one nationality .
erdogan is no stranger to provocation .
in a speech in cologne in 2008 , erdogan said turks in germany can not be expected to ' assimilate ' and deny their turkish identity .
the comments were seen by many as a direct criticism of how germany treats people of turkish origin. svs / ng / dpa / apn / afp editor : matt hermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , activists say the church should take more responsibility for its wayward leaders .
either way , the situation surrounding sexual abuse scandals in the catholic church is like a modern-day hydra myth - no sooner is one scandal addressed than another rises up to take its place .
with europe 's catholics still reeling from a series of alleged child-molestation cover-ups , news broke in the united states of a 1996 case that touches the upper echelons of church power .
failure to defrock in the latest case to hit headlines , the new york times reported on thursday that pope benedict xvi ignored allegations of child sex abuse back in the 1990s .
at the time , he was head of the congregation of the doctrine of the faith , the vatican body that judges cases of sexual abuse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victims recently took to the streets of the vatican to protest the paper reported that the pope - then cardinal joseph ratzinger - failed to defrock rev. lawrence murphy , a priest in milwaukee who had been accused of sexually abusing some 200 deaf boys , despite the fact that he was aware of the allegations .
murphy worked from 1950 to 1977 at a school for the deaf and died in 1998 .
a spokesman for the vatican , federico lombardi , argued that rome was n't informed of the case until 20 years after it happened , and said that in the end the church did n't take action against murphy because he had confessed the acts and because he was very ill and close to the end of his life .
records uncovered by the times show that three different bishops were aware of the accusations , but that the case was not brought to trial .
still , lombardi told news service reuters that the church is eager to see abusive priests brought to justice .
church calls in professional help this is a feeling shared by christoph heckeley , a spokesman for the archbishopric of cologne , germany .
the catholic church in germany has had a directive for the past eight years that urges prosecution in sex abuse cases , heckeley told deutsche welle .
" since 2002 we have a directive from the german bishops conference that says what you have to do in case sexual abuse is suspected , " heckeley said .
people with complaints are referred to professionals - psychologists , doctors and legal experts - who are hired by each bishopric , and are qualified to advise people who want to come forward with sex abuse allegations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abuse allegedly took place at some german jesuit schools " our aim is to listen to the victims and help them get justice , even when the cases are years or decades old .
they need somebody to listen to them , and the most important thing is that they get justice , " he said .
the response from the church will differ case by case , but the church " urgently advises " victims to take perpetrators to court .
unfortunately , heckeley said , victims often do n't want to do this because it can be too upsetting to their families , and " can destroy their entire social environment - it can traumatize them a second time .
you have to be careful . "
prosecution is a right , not an obligation while there is a right to prosecute , there is no obligation to do so - a situation that is currently under hot debate .
still , heckeley said experts recommend caution , since " the dangers -lrb- of forced prosecution -rrb- could outweigh the risks . "
no matter what shape the case takes in federal court , allegations of abuse are always looked into by a church tribunal out of rome .
yet in the murphy case , ratzinger 's deputy at the time advised a secret disciplinary trial at first .
he later reversed that decision , and in 1998 , murphy appealed directly to ratzinger for clemency , shortly before he died .
all the calls for openness , trials and apologies are well and good , victims-rights advocates say , but they do n't go far enough .
what is missing on the part of the church is a departure from the secrecy , and a willingness to admit its own cover-ups .
last week , following revelations of pedophilia that rocked the irish catholic church , the pope issued a long-awaited apology to victims of child sex abuse in ireland .
he acknowledged " serious mistakes " on the part of the church , as well as the sense of betrayal in the church felt by victims and their families .
victims ' groups start protests but irish victims ' groups felt that the apology fell short of their demands ; they called for the church to acknowledge its role in covering up abuse .
maeve lewis , executive director of irish victims ' rights group one in four , told bbc news , " we are really disappointed that there is no acknowledgement that the cover-up and the policy of cover-up in the church went right to the the vatican . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope finally addressed the cases of abuse in ireland and in germany , victims-rights advocates were incensed that the apology failed to mention cases of church pedophilia in munich that have dominated headlines for weeks .
the church has had to contend with cover-up allegations in that city while ratzinger was the city 's archbishop from 1977 to 1981 .
on thursday members of the us activist organization snap - survivor network of those abused by priests - launched a demonstration in the vatican , holding up signs that said " stop the secrecy now . "
they demanded that pope benedict open up all files on pedophile catholic clerics worldwide , and called for all " predator priests " to be defrocked .
the group has also protested in germany , austria , and the netherlands , all countries recently hit by church sex abuse scandals .
one official 's stance " i would ask the pope if he would please open up the files from the congregation of the doctrine of the faith and turn over all the information to the police , " barbara blaine , the president of snap , told reuters news service .
a trickle of acknowledgements have begun , and some say a wave may be coming .
earlier this month , the german church 's representative responsible for dealing with cases of abuse , bishop stephan ackermann , also acknowledged severe failures .
" where there was no will toward explanation and where the person who committed the crime was simply moved to a new post , we have to admit , in a whole array of cases , that there was a cover-up , " he told the rhein zeitung newspaper .
and this week , german news magazine focus reported that archbishop zollitsch , the leader of the german roman catholic church , also admitted cases of child sex abuse were known and covered up .
" yes , we did have that , " he said .
many see the catholic church as so damaged by these allegations that it will be hard for the institution to regain its footing .
" we can only survive this situation with openness and honesty , " says the cologne archbishopric 's heckeley .
" we have to try to win people 's trust that way . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 25.03.2010 erdogan calls for turkish schools in germany and dual citizenship großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 2.7 million people of turkish origin live in germany suggestions by turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan for more turkish schools in germany have been largely rejected by german officials as detrimental to integration . german officials have rejected calls by turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan to introduce turkish schools in germany .
" in turkey , we have german high schools - why should n't there be turkish high schools in germany ? "
erdogan asked in an interview with german weekly die zeit .
erdogan said that many of the almost three million people of turkish origin living in germany had problems with both languages , and offering education in turkish might also help their german .
" germany has not yet caught up with the times , " erdogan said .
" one must first have a firm command of one 's own language , that is to say , turkish , and that is unfortunately rarely the case . "
the federal government 's integration commissioner , maria boehmer , acknowledged the advantage pupils might gain if they could be fluent in two languages , but said learning german should take priority .
" only those who know german have a chance of social advancement , " boehmer , a christian democrat , told the daily berliner zeitung .
the head of the christian democratic party 's german-turkish forum in north-rhine westphalia was also skeptical .
" turkish secondary schools are a dead end for students , " buelent arslan told the daily koelner stadtanzeiger .
" to be successful in germany , a good level of german is essential , " arslan added .
tensions ahead of merkel visit the general secretary of the christian democrat 's bavarian sister party , the csu , said that erdogan was trying to use turkish people in germany to further his own political purposes .
" such demands are an affront in the run-up to his visit with our chancellor angela merkel , " alexander dobrindt told spiegel online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan will meet merkel next week in ankara chancellor angela merkel is due in ankara next monday for a two-day visit .
her relationship with erdogan is problematic , as germany does not favor full eu membership for turkey , calling for a ' privileged partnership ' instead .
turkey has repeatedly rejected anything but full membership in the bloc .
in berlin , which has the largest turkish community in germany , the council for education said the acquisition of turkish language was not necessarily conducive to integration .
it is the knowledge of german that counts , and often , turks in germany struggle to find skilled jobs because of a lack of good german , according to the council .
it also pointed out that there are already turkish grammar schools in germany , but they are privately funded .
some support erdogan 's comments found little support in the german media , but an editorial by daily sueddeutsche zeitung sees some merit in erdogan 's suggestion .
the newspaper pointed out that if more french schools were to be built in germany , it would be hailed as a symbol of franco-german friendship .
but germany seems to have a problem with the turkish language .
it does not " count for much " , according to sueddeutsche .
many companies are desperate to hire people with multiple language skills , so not giving turks the opportunity to study their language in-depth , was a " missed opportunity " , the paper claimed .
no dual citizenship erdogan also criticized the fact that germany does not allow dual citizenship unless the additional country is a member of the eu .
" i find it regrettable that germany is among the countries in the eu that does not allow dual citizenship , " he told die zeit .
a child of foreign parents can only obtain dual citizenship if one parent has lived in germany regularly for at least eight years .
but , at age 23 , the child needs to choose one nationality .
erdogan is no stranger to provocation .
in a speech in cologne in 2008 , erdogan said turks in germany can not be expected to ' assimilate ' and deny their turkish identity .
the comments were seen by many as a direct criticism of how germany treats people of turkish origin. svs / ng / dpa / apn / afp editor : matt hermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i think , the west should not directly interfere in iranian domestic affairs , " said kosten . " there has to be rhetorical support and a strict and direct condemnation of all violence against peaceful protests and any breach of international law by parts of the regime in iran .
also , measures like support for free internet use and technical support should be considered .
but direct support , through direct financial aid for example , would be danger for the opposition since they would be immediately charged and outlawed in iran . " meir javedanfar , a middle east analyst and the director for the middle east economic and political analysis -lrb- meepas -rrb- think-tank , agreed that the west should refrain from any direct involvement with the opposition . " if the west were to continue to pressure the iranian regime over human rights and the treatment of protestors , that would be acceptable involvement , " he said . " if the sanctions were to concentrate on the assets of the regime , government-backed companies and manufacturers of armoured vehicles which have been involved in the suppression of the opposition , this would also be acceptable .
but funding and agitation by the west would be counterproductive and would lead to the opposition being labelled as puppets of the west and would justify the hard-line crackdown . " nuclear standoff likely to continue under moderate regime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iran under mousavi would still pursue nuclear ambitions experts believe that the possibility of regime change - peaceful or not - is still within the opposition ’ s reach .
but even if future events result in a moderate leadership taking power in iran , the west 's problems regarding tehran 's nuclear ambitions wo n't just go away .
in fact , while a moderate leadership would be more inclined to engage in talks , the west 's ultimate goal - to prevent iran from having nuclear technology - would still be non-negotiable . " the rhetoric would change and maybe broader negotiations would be more likely , " kosten said .
" however , there is no way to prevent iran from pursuing its civil right to develop nuclear energy .
the islamic republic of iran would not give up this technology , be it ahmadinejad or mousavi as president . " " the pursuit of nuclear technology would continue regardless , " javedanfar added .
" maybe the west would have more success in negotiating with a moderate regime , maybe deals such as third-party enrichment would be agreed to under mousavi or another reformist leader but even regime change wo n't stop iran pursuing nuclear technology - or the option to make a bomb .
this is something even the shah was pursuing .

in iran , however , positive change may still be in the hands of the country 's opposition . in the summer of 2009 , the international press was full of headlines about the opposition movement in iran and its attempts to take control of the islamic republic and steer it back into the international fold . the world watched as millions of iranians risked imprisonment , beatings and even death to support the reformist candidate mir hossein mousavi and challenge the regime of president mahmoud ahmadinejad and the leadership of the mullahs . as demonstrations and protests continued beyond the disputed june election which saw ahmadinejad secure another term , hopes - however slim - remained among those who saw the opposition 's challenge to the government as an opportunity for positive change in iran . gradually , however , the green revolution was suppressed and hopes of immediate change extinguished .

the west returned to its preoccupation with iran 's nuclear ambitions and the quest to secure new sanctions against ahmadinejad 's regime . west abandons hope of change for bellicose rhetoric bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's stance has led to increased western pressure now the west 's rhetoric is once again less about positive political change in iran and more about tightening and expanding the existing sanctions on tehran in an attempt to force the islamic republic to abandon its nuclear plans . if anything , the failure of the iranian opposition to take charge of iran and begin its rehabilitation has made the west 's approach even more bellicose , with french foreign minister bernard kouchner saying there was " no other choice " but to impose fresh sanctions , and the middle east quartet 's peace envoy tony blair going further by saying the world will do " whatever it takes " to stop iran acquiring a nuclear weapon . it appears that the west has abandoned hope of internal reform in iran in favor of returning to the strong-arm tactics of the pre-green revolution era .
but has this hope been cast aside too soon ?
is the iranian opposition movement truly dead ?
and if the opposition is still alive in the backrooms and alleyways of tehran how can it help bring iran back from the brink and in from the cold ? iranian opposition working to bring rival sides together bildunterschrift : the iranian opposition movement has retreated to formulate a political strategy for its next phase " the iranian opposition is alive and continues , though its recent public activities have been mainly successfully prevented by the security forces , " konstantin kosten , an iran expert at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle . " the key question for the opposition 's future remains the political strategy , and how the different fractions of the opposition - which might be summed up as ' regime change ' versus ' political change within the system ' - remain united . "
kosten believes that the opposition has been regrouping and refocusing behind closed doors , and that ahmadinejad 's regime has not seen the last of public protest . " there will definitely be more public uprisings in future , " he said .
" the next date might be april 1 , the day of the islamic republic . the opposition movement has to deal with questions of how to integrate the different ethnic groups in iran , how to reach possible agreements within the current system and how to remain united . " " a major success for the opposition movement would definitely be earning the support of the ' bazaaris ' -lrb- the small shopkeeper / merchant sector of the traditional middle class of iran -rrb- .
if large parts of the bazar and the working class in iran would support the opposition this would be a major challenge for the regime .

" i think , the west should not directly interfere in iranian domestic affairs , " said kosten . " there has to be rhetorical support and a strict and direct condemnation of all violence against peaceful protests and any breach of international law by parts of the regime in iran .
also , measures like support for free internet use and technical support should be considered .
but direct support , through direct financial aid for example , would be danger for the opposition since they would be immediately charged and outlawed in iran . " meir javedanfar , a middle east analyst and the director for the middle east economic and political analysis -lrb- meepas -rrb- think-tank , agreed that the west should refrain from any direct involvement with the opposition . " if the west were to continue to pressure the iranian regime over human rights and the treatment of protestors , that would be acceptable involvement , " he said . " if the sanctions were to concentrate on the assets of the regime , government-backed companies and manufacturers of armoured vehicles which have been involved in the suppression of the opposition , this would also be acceptable .
but funding and agitation by the west would be counterproductive and would lead to the opposition being labelled as puppets of the west and would justify the hard-line crackdown . " nuclear standoff likely to continue under moderate regime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iran under mousavi would still pursue nuclear ambitions experts believe that the possibility of regime change - peaceful or not - is still within the opposition ’ s reach .
but even if future events result in a moderate leadership taking power in iran , the west 's problems regarding tehran 's nuclear ambitions wo n't just go away .
in fact , while a moderate leadership would be more inclined to engage in talks , the west 's ultimate goal - to prevent iran from having nuclear technology - would still be non-negotiable . " the rhetoric would change and maybe broader negotiations would be more likely , " kosten said .
" however , there is no way to prevent iran from pursuing its civil right to develop nuclear energy .
the islamic republic of iran would not give up this technology , be it ahmadinejad or mousavi as president . " " the pursuit of nuclear technology would continue regardless , " javedanfar added .
" maybe the west would have more success in negotiating with a moderate regime , maybe deals such as third-party enrichment would be agreed to under mousavi or another reformist leader but even regime change wo n't stop iran pursuing nuclear technology - or the option to make a bomb .
this is something even the shah was pursuing .

with their bundesliga and champions league campaigns still on course , bayern face a punishing end-of-season run . it took something special for bayern munich to beat schalke in their own backyard to reach the german cup final on wednesday night .
dutch international arjen robben looked to be going nowhere when he took off with the ball just inside the schalke half before racing down the right-wing to the corner flag .
one electric injection of pace and direction later , with three defenders flailing in his wake , robben was suddenly in the penalty area lashing a left-footed shot beyond schalke keeper manuel neuer to win the semi-final in style .
although bayern had the lion 's share of possession and the early chances in this tense and sometimes bad tempered meeting , robben 's 112th minute winner was the only flash of real class in the whole game .
and despite having eight minutes to save the tie after the bayern winger scored , it was clear schalke were out as soon as the dutchman 's shot hit the back of the net .
neither team had produced anything as decisive in nearly two hours of soccer .
robben 's act of individual brilliance was a worthy match winner , but the dutchman 's tenth goal of the season certainly put a thick layer of gloss on a rather dull bayern performance .
schalke 's overwhelming emphasis on defense , along with the terrible state of the turf in the veltins arena , gradually sapped bayern 's strength and creativity .
but even the bavarians ' early attempts on goal were far from polished .
energetic robben the exception as bayern labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben stood out from the lethargic pack on wednesday robben was the exception throughout , tirelessly chasing and making runs at schalke defenders .
no-one else , not even the late substitute franck ribery , looked able to summon that kind of energy , which could be a matter of concern in the coming weeks .
" we 're still involved in three competitions and that is emotionally not all that easy for the players , " bayern coach louis van gaal said after wednesday 's semifinal win .
" but we want to be involved in all three competitions , so we will have to come to terms with that . "
with league matches against main title rivals schalke and bayer leverkusen on the horizon , and a make-or-break champions league tie over two legs against manchester united , bayern 's season will likely be decided by the end of april - for better or worse .
the concern settling over munich is that the squad may not be deep enough to survive three consecutive title races .
loan deals force coach 's hand over rising stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal 's faith in young players is being put to the test luke faron , a bayern munich expert with theoffside.com , believes that bayern are beginning to feel the effects of loaning a number of players out to other clubs and promoting youngsters to a first team involved in not only a bundesliga title fight and a lengthy german cup campaign but also european matches of the highest standard .
" loaning brazilian defender breno to nuremberg was a necessary step in continuing his development and in getting the young center back some playing time , " faron told deutsche welle .
loaning left back edson braafheid to celtic was a bit surprising , said faron .
combined with breno 's move , it meant holger badstuber would be the only true reserve center back , in addition to starting at left back .
" with center backs van buyten and demichelis suffering injuries , badstuber had to move back inside and the pressure on the youngster has been intense . "
faron believes that van gaal has been forced to test the faith he had in the young players he brought into replenish the senior side in january , but says the coach has so far - on the whole - been justified in his decisions .
" diego contento and david alaba have both performed admirably in their champions league debuts , " said faron .
" alaba had a very bad final five minutes in frankfurt last weekend and perhaps that showed the limits of the wisdom of playing a 17-year-old natural midfielder out of position in a highly competitive match . "
he said contento had had his hands full with jefferson farfan on wednesday , but that he had coped with the task well enough .
if any player was showing fatigue , said faron , it was forward thomas mueller " it 's a big adjustment for a young player like mueller who has n't even played a full season in the bundesliga before .
add in the champions league and the german cup and the fact he also just made his national team debut , and it 's easy to understand why . "
success from continuity makes coach reluctant to change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the league campaign did not start well under van gaal another factor which is contributing to bayern 's lethargy at this point in the season is van gaal 's commitment to continuity .
when he assumed control at the beginning of the season , it took the dutch coach at least ten matches of tinkering before he settled on his preferred line-up - ten matches during which bayern seemed rudderless and the coach 's credentials were questioned .
once the coach found his formula in november , however , an impressive winning streak began and van gaal has not looked back .
as a result , the dutchman risks wearing out his preferred starting 11 .
as bayern enter a run of decisive matches , time will tell if the squad 's mix of youngsters and stars can maintain top performance .
luke faron believes the bavarian giants have what it takes , regardless of tired legs .
" bayern have a chance against manchester united , but they have to be considered underdogs , " he said . " munich 's defense has not performed at the level necessary to progress further in the competition , though wednesday night 's performance in the cup might be the start of a turnaround . "
the big test , says faron , begins a week from saturday , when bayern face schalke , man united and bayer leverkusen all away from home , within a seven day period .
but thereafter , prospects seem bright .
" after the match in leverkusen they have an exceptionally easy schedule in the league for the last month of the campaign . in addition , they 're getting key players like gomez and demichelis back from injury and that should help during the run-in . i believe bayern will prevail in the bundesliga regardless of how far they progress in the champions league .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de research -pipe- 25.03.2010 german researchers decode unrecognized dna from ancient humanoid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists analyzed dna from a fossil finger found in siberia when researchers discovered a fossil finger in a siberian cave , they found an ancestor - and perhaps a new human species .
johannes krause told deutsche welle about his team 's efforts to analyze the ancient dna . the new report was published on the website of science journal " nature " on march 24 .
leipzig researchers johannes krause and svante pääbo of the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology co-authored the international project . deutsche welle : how did you find a bone fragment from the altai mountains ?
johannes krause : for several years , we 've been involved in a very productive collaboration with our colleagues in russia .
we received bones from them that we later identified as neanderthal bones , for example , thus showing that neanderthals lived in southern siberia , too - not just in europe .
and in recent years , we 've received other bone samples for genetic testing .
here in leipzig , we 've taken our neanderthal research to the genetic level , so we 've been examining the dna of ancient man -lrb- ... -rrb- to help us learn how prehistoric man is related to modern-day man or other forms of early man . the neaderthal has their own dna at least for portions of the genome , so they are n't our direct ancestors ; they 're more an extinct cousin of sorts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dna analysis of homonid species could shed light on their ties to modern man and during our search for new neanderthal bones , we stumbled upon these bones with dna that belonged neither to neanderthals nor modern man .
it constitutes a new form of prehistoric man that had never been discovered - something we had never seen from a genetic standpoint and that we could n't categorize as an existing form of prehistoric man .
everyone 's calling this a sensation - would you call it that ?
i think it 's a sensation because until now we had the potential to do genetic research on two different forms of man - now there 's a third .
so that 's pretty sensational , particularly as it ca n't be classified according to any existing form of prehistoric man .
unfortunately , we do n't have a complete skeleton - just the bone from a pinkie finger .
it 's a tiny fragment that ca n't tell us much about the morphology .
therefore we still do n't know what this prehistoric man looked like - did he perhaps look like a neanderthal , modern man or a homo erectus ?
so we lack quite a lot of information , but we now have the potential to study the dna of this prehistoric man ; we have the potential to examine the entire genome and genetic material from this prehistoric man and compare it to modern man and the neanderthals , for instance .
and through that , we can learn a lot .
for example , what kind of interactions occurred between these three species of prehistoric man ?
we could also show that they lived in the same place at the same time - that 's another sensation for us .
that means , we find neanderthal bones in a nearby cave , and in same layer in which we found the bones of the new human form , we find archaeological artifacts that appear to have come from modern man - ornaments and jewelry that are only associated with modern man .
so it looks as though these three forms of early man lived in the same place at the same time .
you can then imagine any number of scenarios where gene flow could have occurred between these three populations , and that is certainly something that 's very interesting to analyze on a genetic level .
is finding something like this an anthropologist 's dream come true ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian researchers discovered the fossil bone at a site in the altai mountains in siberia yes , this is probably a once-in-a-lifetime chance - discovering a new species or form of prehistoric man .
it 's certainly quite exciting for us .
of course , we should note that we 're not calling it a new species - we 're only talking about a new " form . "
so far , we 've only analyzed a tiny portion of the dna , and only when the entire genome or a large part of the genome has been analyzed will we be able to tell whether it 's something completely new or different , like modern man or the neanderthals , for instance .
and until then , we 're not going to talk about a new species .
but all signs indicate that we 're actually dealing with an entirely knew species of man here .
then what do you know already ; whose bones are they ?
so far , we can only say that this dna - the dna we 've studied so far from this prehistoric man - has about 1 million years between it and the dna of modern man .
so that means that these two forms , modern man and prehistoric man , spent at least 1 million years developing in very different ways .
based on our genetic tests , we can also say that modern man is more closely related to the neanderthals than he is to this new form of prehistoric man - we 're seeing two times as many differences between the dna of modern man and this new form than we do with modern man and the neanderthals .
this represents a completely different line that split off from modern man much earlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mitochondrial dna decoding showed differences between the ancestor and modern man do you know if it was a woman or a man ?
we 've named it " x woman . "
" x " stands for the unknown , since we ca n't classify it so easiliy , as i 'd mentioned . and " woman " because we examined the mitochondrial dna - the dna from the powerhouse of the cell - and that 's always passed down from the mother to the child .
so we 're looking at the female lineage , and so we adopted a feministic position .
but since we have yet to examine the entire genetic material , we still do n't know whether it 's a man or a woman .
and this process for examining the mitochrondrial dna - that 's something you developed ?
yes , my boss svante pääbo studied mitochrondrial dna from prehistoric man for the first time in the ' 90s - at the time , from neanderthals .
in recent years , we have refined these methods to help us obtain more information more quickly - and of a higher qualitative value .
but we 've really kicked this kind of research into high gear in recent years .
what 's next ?
what else do you plan to study - and what do you hope to find ?
we plan to study the entire genome - this prehistoric man 's entire genetic material .
we do n't just want to look at this tiny fraction , rather we will examine the entire genome to learn more about this prehistoric man and to see how he was related to modern man and to neanderthals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the neanderthals share many commonalities with modern man was there potential gene flow between these three populations ?
and what can we learn about phenotypical features - what color hair did he have ?
we 'll look at other kinds of features that we can reconstruct based on dna sequencing .
and who gets to keep the bone once you conclude your research ? whatever 's left of the bone will certainly be sent back to novosibirsk , to the museum responsible for the entire excavation .
that said , it 's not a spectacular bone - it 's only as large as cherry pit .
so it 's a very tiny fragment and it might not be all that interesting to look at .

with their bundesliga and champions league campaigns still on course , bayern face a punishing end-of-season run . it took something special for bayern munich to beat schalke in their own backyard to reach the german cup final on wednesday night .
dutch international arjen robben looked to be going nowhere when he took off with the ball just inside the schalke half before racing down the right-wing to the corner flag .
one electric injection of pace and direction later , with three defenders flailing in his wake , robben was suddenly in the penalty area lashing a left-footed shot beyond schalke keeper manuel neuer to win the semi-final in style .
although bayern had the lion 's share of possession and the early chances in this tense and sometimes bad tempered meeting , robben 's 112th minute winner was the only flash of real class in the whole game .
and despite having eight minutes to save the tie after the bayern winger scored , it was clear schalke were out as soon as the dutchman 's shot hit the back of the net .
neither team had produced anything as decisive in nearly two hours of soccer .
robben 's act of individual brilliance was a worthy match winner , but the dutchman 's tenth goal of the season certainly put a thick layer of gloss on a rather dull bayern performance .
schalke 's overwhelming emphasis on defense , along with the terrible state of the turf in the veltins arena , gradually sapped bayern 's strength and creativity .
but even the bavarians ' early attempts on goal were far from polished .
energetic robben the exception as bayern labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben stood out from the lethargic pack on wednesday robben was the exception throughout , tirelessly chasing and making runs at schalke defenders .
no-one else , not even the late substitute franck ribery , looked able to summon that kind of energy , which could be a matter of concern in the coming weeks .
" we 're still involved in three competitions and that is emotionally not all that easy for the players , " bayern coach louis van gaal said after wednesday 's semifinal win .
" but we want to be involved in all three competitions , so we will have to come to terms with that . "
with league matches against main title rivals schalke and bayer leverkusen on the horizon , and a make-or-break champions league tie over two legs against manchester united , bayern 's season will likely be decided by the end of april - for better or worse .
the concern settling over munich is that the squad may not be deep enough to survive three consecutive title races .
loan deals force coach 's hand over rising stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal 's faith in young players is being put to the test luke faron , a bayern munich expert with theoffside.com , believes that bayern are beginning to feel the effects of loaning a number of players out to other clubs and promoting youngsters to a first team involved in not only a bundesliga title fight and a lengthy german cup campaign but also european matches of the highest standard .
" loaning brazilian defender breno to nuremberg was a necessary step in continuing his development and in getting the young center back some playing time , " faron told deutsche welle .
loaning left back edson braafheid to celtic was a bit surprising , said faron .
combined with breno 's move , it meant holger badstuber would be the only true reserve center back , in addition to starting at left back .
" with center backs van buyten and demichelis suffering injuries , badstuber had to move back inside and the pressure on the youngster has been intense . "
faron believes that van gaal has been forced to test the faith he had in the young players he brought into replenish the senior side in january , but says the coach has so far - on the whole - been justified in his decisions .
" diego contento and david alaba have both performed admirably in their champions league debuts , " said faron .
" alaba had a very bad final five minutes in frankfurt last weekend and perhaps that showed the limits of the wisdom of playing a 17-year-old natural midfielder out of position in a highly competitive match . "
he said contento had had his hands full with jefferson farfan on wednesday , but that he had coped with the task well enough .
if any player was showing fatigue , said faron , it was forward thomas mueller " it 's a big adjustment for a young player like mueller who has n't even played a full season in the bundesliga before .
add in the champions league and the german cup and the fact he also just made his national team debut , and it 's easy to understand why . "
success from continuity makes coach reluctant to change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the league campaign did not start well under van gaal another factor which is contributing to bayern 's lethargy at this point in the season is van gaal 's commitment to continuity .
when he assumed control at the beginning of the season , it took the dutch coach at least ten matches of tinkering before he settled on his preferred line-up - ten matches during which bayern seemed rudderless and the coach 's credentials were questioned .
once the coach found his formula in november , however , an impressive winning streak began and van gaal has not looked back .
as a result , the dutchman risks wearing out his preferred starting 11 .
as bayern enter a run of decisive matches , time will tell if the squad 's mix of youngsters and stars can maintain top performance .
luke faron believes the bavarian giants have what it takes , regardless of tired legs .
" bayern have a chance against manchester united , but they have to be considered underdogs , " he said . " munich 's defense has not performed at the level necessary to progress further in the competition , though wednesday night 's performance in the cup might be the start of a turnaround . "
the big test , says faron , begins a week from saturday , when bayern face schalke , man united and bayer leverkusen all away from home , within a seven day period .
but thereafter , prospects seem bright .
" after the match in leverkusen they have an exceptionally easy schedule in the league for the last month of the campaign . in addition , they 're getting key players like gomez and demichelis back from injury and that should help during the run-in . i believe bayern will prevail in the bundesliga regardless of how far they progress in the champions league .

as iran continues to develop its nuclear program , analysts fear that an arms race in the middle east could begin .
if sanctions continue to fail , these analysts say that military action is necessary to prevent this . as world powers negotiate on how to deal with iran 's continuing development of its nuclear program , concerns about a nuclear arms race in the middle east , prompted by iran 's determination to build nuclear weapons , are mounting .
officials from the united states , russia , france , britain , germany and china participated in a conference call yesterday to discuss how to handle iran 's flaunting of international demands to cease nuclear work .
these countries , while attempting to deter iran from continued nuclear development by offering tehran incentives to allow more oversight of its program , are also threatening sanctions if tehran does not stop work toward producing weapons grade uranium . iran , which has faced sanctions from the united nations three times , says it is developing its nuclear program for peaceful purposes and has refused to allow inspectors from the international atomic energy agency access to its nuclear facilities .
it is party to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty , but repeatedly has been found non-compliant .
there is growing fear that iran will not stop work toward a weapon unless drastic action is taken .
middle east experts said that if iran continues on its current path , a nuclear arms race in the region could ensue . ' ' turkey , algeria , egypt , and saudi arabia are all potential candidates to develop nuclear weapons , " abdulaziz sager , chairman of the gulf research center in dubai , told deutsche welle .
' ' and they will say , if -lsb- nuclear weapon development -rsb- is permitted in iran , why ca n't we develop weapons as well ? "
a threat beyond israel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has called for the destruction of israel .
a nuclear-armed iran is widely seen as a direct threat to israel , as iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has pledged to ' ' wipe israel off the map . "
israel has not ruled out preemptive strikes against suspected nuclear sites inside iran if development continues .
but iran 's possession of a nuclear weapon has implications for other countries in the region as well , mustafa alani , senior advisor and program director at the gulf research center says .
' ' the question is not whether iran uses the bomb against other countries in the middle east , " alani told deutsche welle .
' ' but the question is whether iran has control of the region , and the political consequences of a dominant iran . "
the political balance of power in the middle east at the current time is relatively stable .
israel has a dominant military and nuclear weapons , as well as the backing of the united states .
economic power is diversified , as a number of states have thriving oil industries .
the region is also politically stable , with the exception of iraq , which is trying to sustain a functioning government in the wake of the iraq war .
a nuclear-armed and increasingly belligerent iran would dramatically alter this balance .
ahmadinejad would hold disproportionate clout , and if recent belligerent statements toward israel are to be believed , seems to be willing to use it .
preemption vs. nuclear war in the past , analysts have told deutsche welle that israel is unlikely to carry out unilateral military action against iran , as any action is not likely to destroy iran 's entire nuclear infrastructure .
last month , chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff admiral mike mullen told congress ' ' no strike , however effective , will be in and of itself decisive . "
however , the gulf center 's sager says that if economic sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a convoy of israeli military armored vehicles on the gaza strip. continue to fail , preemptive military action to stop iran from acquiring nuclear weapons is needed .
the power iran would have would be too great and too much of a risk to the region . ' ' if i had to chose between living with iran as a constant threat , or a military strike with limited retaliation , i can more easily live with the military option , " he said .
' ' we have already lived through wars , and no countries were erased from the map . "

middle east experts said that if iran continues on its current path , a nuclear arms race in the region could ensue . ' ' turkey , algeria , egypt , and saudi arabia are all potential candidates to develop nuclear weapons , " abdulaziz sager , chairman of the gulf research center in dubai , told deutsche welle .
' ' and they will say , if -lsb- nuclear weapon development -rsb- is permitted in iran , why ca n't we develop weapons as well ? "
a threat beyond israel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has called for the destruction of israel .
a nuclear-armed iran is widely seen as a direct threat to israel , as iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has pledged to ' ' wipe israel off the map . "
israel has not ruled out preemptive strikes against suspected nuclear sites inside iran if development continues .
but iran 's possession of a nuclear weapon has implications for other countries in the region as well , mustafa alani , senior advisor and program director at the gulf research center says .
' ' the question is not whether iran uses the bomb against other countries in the middle east , " alani told deutsche welle .
' ' but the question is whether iran has control of the region , and the political consequences of a dominant iran . "
the political balance of power in the middle east at the current time is relatively stable .
israel has a dominant military and nuclear weapons , as well as the backing of the united states .
economic power is diversified , as a number of states have thriving oil industries .
the region is also politically stable , with the exception of iraq , which is trying to sustain a functioning government in the wake of the iraq war .
a nuclear-armed and increasingly belligerent iran would dramatically alter this balance .
ahmadinejad would hold disproportionate clout , and if recent belligerent statements toward israel are to be believed , seems to be willing to use it .
preemption vs. nuclear war in the past , analysts have told deutsche welle that israel is unlikely to carry out unilateral military action against iran , as any action is not likely to destroy iran 's entire nuclear infrastructure .
last month , chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff admiral mike mullen told congress ' ' no strike , however effective , will be in and of itself decisive . "
however , the gulf center 's sager says that if economic sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a convoy of israeli military armored vehicles on the gaza strip. continue to fail , preemptive military action to stop iran from acquiring nuclear weapons is needed .
the power iran would have would be too great and too much of a risk to the region . ' ' if i had to chose between living with iran as a constant threat , or a military strike with limited retaliation , i can more easily live with the military option , " he said .
' ' we have already lived through wars , and no countries were erased from the map . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de research -pipe- 25.03.2010 german researchers decode unrecognized dna from ancient humanoid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists analyzed dna from a fossil finger found in siberia when researchers discovered a fossil finger in a siberian cave , they found an ancestor - and perhaps a new human species .
johannes krause told deutsche welle about his team 's efforts to analyze the ancient dna . the new report was published on the website of science journal " nature " on march 24 .
leipzig researchers johannes krause and svante pääbo of the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology co-authored the international project . deutsche welle : how did you find a bone fragment from the altai mountains ?
johannes krause : for several years , we 've been involved in a very productive collaboration with our colleagues in russia .
we received bones from them that we later identified as neanderthal bones , for example , thus showing that neanderthals lived in southern siberia , too - not just in europe .
and in recent years , we 've received other bone samples for genetic testing .
here in leipzig , we 've taken our neanderthal research to the genetic level , so we 've been examining the dna of ancient man -lrb- ... -rrb- to help us learn how prehistoric man is related to modern-day man or other forms of early man . the neaderthal has their own dna at least for portions of the genome , so they are n't our direct ancestors ; they 're more an extinct cousin of sorts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dna analysis of homonid species could shed light on their ties to modern man and during our search for new neanderthal bones , we stumbled upon these bones with dna that belonged neither to neanderthals nor modern man .
it constitutes a new form of prehistoric man that had never been discovered - something we had never seen from a genetic standpoint and that we could n't categorize as an existing form of prehistoric man .
everyone 's calling this a sensation - would you call it that ?
i think it 's a sensation because until now we had the potential to do genetic research on two different forms of man - now there 's a third .
so that 's pretty sensational , particularly as it ca n't be classified according to any existing form of prehistoric man .
unfortunately , we do n't have a complete skeleton - just the bone from a pinkie finger .
it 's a tiny fragment that ca n't tell us much about the morphology .
therefore we still do n't know what this prehistoric man looked like - did he perhaps look like a neanderthal , modern man or a homo erectus ?
so we lack quite a lot of information , but we now have the potential to study the dna of this prehistoric man ; we have the potential to examine the entire genome and genetic material from this prehistoric man and compare it to modern man and the neanderthals , for instance .
and through that , we can learn a lot .
for example , what kind of interactions occurred between these three species of prehistoric man ?
we could also show that they lived in the same place at the same time - that 's another sensation for us .
that means , we find neanderthal bones in a nearby cave , and in same layer in which we found the bones of the new human form , we find archaeological artifacts that appear to have come from modern man - ornaments and jewelry that are only associated with modern man .
so it looks as though these three forms of early man lived in the same place at the same time .
you can then imagine any number of scenarios where gene flow could have occurred between these three populations , and that is certainly something that 's very interesting to analyze on a genetic level .
is finding something like this an anthropologist 's dream come true ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian researchers discovered the fossil bone at a site in the altai mountains in siberia yes , this is probably a once-in-a-lifetime chance - discovering a new species or form of prehistoric man .
it 's certainly quite exciting for us .
of course , we should note that we 're not calling it a new species - we 're only talking about a new " form . "
so far , we 've only analyzed a tiny portion of the dna , and only when the entire genome or a large part of the genome has been analyzed will we be able to tell whether it 's something completely new or different , like modern man or the neanderthals , for instance .
and until then , we 're not going to talk about a new species .
but all signs indicate that we 're actually dealing with an entirely knew species of man here .
then what do you know already ; whose bones are they ?
so far , we can only say that this dna - the dna we 've studied so far from this prehistoric man - has about 1 million years between it and the dna of modern man .
so that means that these two forms , modern man and prehistoric man , spent at least 1 million years developing in very different ways .
based on our genetic tests , we can also say that modern man is more closely related to the neanderthals than he is to this new form of prehistoric man - we 're seeing two times as many differences between the dna of modern man and this new form than we do with modern man and the neanderthals .
this represents a completely different line that split off from modern man much earlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mitochondrial dna decoding showed differences between the ancestor and modern man do you know if it was a woman or a man ?
we 've named it " x woman . "
" x " stands for the unknown , since we ca n't classify it so easiliy , as i 'd mentioned . and " woman " because we examined the mitochondrial dna - the dna from the powerhouse of the cell - and that 's always passed down from the mother to the child .
so we 're looking at the female lineage , and so we adopted a feministic position .
but since we have yet to examine the entire genetic material , we still do n't know whether it 's a man or a woman .
and this process for examining the mitochrondrial dna - that 's something you developed ?
yes , my boss svante pääbo studied mitochrondrial dna from prehistoric man for the first time in the ' 90s - at the time , from neanderthals .
in recent years , we have refined these methods to help us obtain more information more quickly - and of a higher qualitative value .
but we 've really kicked this kind of research into high gear in recent years .
what 's next ?
what else do you plan to study - and what do you hope to find ?
we plan to study the entire genome - this prehistoric man 's entire genetic material .
we do n't just want to look at this tiny fraction , rather we will examine the entire genome to learn more about this prehistoric man and to see how he was related to modern man and to neanderthals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the neanderthals share many commonalities with modern man was there potential gene flow between these three populations ?
and what can we learn about phenotypical features - what color hair did he have ?
we 'll look at other kinds of features that we can reconstruct based on dna sequencing .
and who gets to keep the bone once you conclude your research ? whatever 's left of the bone will certainly be sent back to novosibirsk , to the museum responsible for the entire excavation .
that said , it 's not a spectacular bone - it 's only as large as cherry pit .
so it 's a very tiny fragment and it might not be all that interesting to look at .

meanwhile , activists say the church should take more responsibility for its wayward leaders .
either way , the situation surrounding sexual abuse scandals in the catholic church is like a modern-day hydra myth - no sooner is one scandal addressed than another rises up to take its place .
with europe 's catholics still reeling from a series of alleged child-molestation cover-ups , news broke in the united states of a 1996 case that touches the upper echelons of church power .
failure to defrock in the latest case to hit headlines , the new york times reported on thursday that pope benedict xvi ignored allegations of child sex abuse back in the 1990s .
at the time , he was head of the congregation of the doctrine of the faith , the vatican body that judges cases of sexual abuse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victims recently took to the streets of the vatican to protest the paper reported that the pope - then cardinal joseph ratzinger - failed to defrock rev. lawrence murphy , a priest in milwaukee who had been accused of sexually abusing some 200 deaf boys , despite the fact that he was aware of the allegations .
murphy worked from 1950 to 1977 at a school for the deaf and died in 1998 .
a spokesman for the vatican , federico lombardi , argued that rome was n't informed of the case until 20 years after it happened , and said that in the end the church did n't take action against murphy because he had confessed the acts and because he was very ill and close to the end of his life .
records uncovered by the times show that three different bishops were aware of the accusations , but that the case was not brought to trial .
still , lombardi told news service reuters that the church is eager to see abusive priests brought to justice .
church calls in professional help this is a feeling shared by christoph heckeley , a spokesman for the archbishopric of cologne , germany .
the catholic church in germany has had a directive for the past eight years that urges prosecution in sex abuse cases , heckeley told deutsche welle .
" since 2002 we have a directive from the german bishops conference that says what you have to do in case sexual abuse is suspected , " heckeley said .
people with complaints are referred to professionals - psychologists , doctors and legal experts - who are hired by each bishopric , and are qualified to advise people who want to come forward with sex abuse allegations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abuse allegedly took place at some german jesuit schools " our aim is to listen to the victims and help them get justice , even when the cases are years or decades old .
they need somebody to listen to them , and the most important thing is that they get justice , " he said .
the response from the church will differ case by case , but the church " urgently advises " victims to take perpetrators to court .
unfortunately , heckeley said , victims often do n't want to do this because it can be too upsetting to their families , and " can destroy their entire social environment - it can traumatize them a second time .
you have to be careful . "
prosecution is a right , not an obligation while there is a right to prosecute , there is no obligation to do so - a situation that is currently under hot debate .
still , heckeley said experts recommend caution , since " the dangers -lrb- of forced prosecution -rrb- could outweigh the risks . "
no matter what shape the case takes in federal court , allegations of abuse are always looked into by a church tribunal out of rome .
yet in the murphy case , ratzinger 's deputy at the time advised a secret disciplinary trial at first .
he later reversed that decision , and in 1998 , murphy appealed directly to ratzinger for clemency , shortly before he died .
all the calls for openness , trials and apologies are well and good , victims-rights advocates say , but they do n't go far enough .
what is missing on the part of the church is a departure from the secrecy , and a willingness to admit its own cover-ups .
last week , following revelations of pedophilia that rocked the irish catholic church , the pope issued a long-awaited apology to victims of child sex abuse in ireland .
he acknowledged " serious mistakes " on the part of the church , as well as the sense of betrayal in the church felt by victims and their families .
victims ' groups start protests but irish victims ' groups felt that the apology fell short of their demands ; they called for the church to acknowledge its role in covering up abuse .
maeve lewis , executive director of irish victims ' rights group one in four , told bbc news , " we are really disappointed that there is no acknowledgement that the cover-up and the policy of cover-up in the church went right to the the vatican . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope finally addressed the cases of abuse in ireland and in germany , victims-rights advocates were incensed that the apology failed to mention cases of church pedophilia in munich that have dominated headlines for weeks .
the church has had to contend with cover-up allegations in that city while ratzinger was the city 's archbishop from 1977 to 1981 .
on thursday members of the us activist organization snap - survivor network of those abused by priests - launched a demonstration in the vatican , holding up signs that said " stop the secrecy now . "
they demanded that pope benedict open up all files on pedophile catholic clerics worldwide , and called for all " predator priests " to be defrocked .
the group has also protested in germany , austria , and the netherlands , all countries recently hit by church sex abuse scandals .
one official 's stance " i would ask the pope if he would please open up the files from the congregation of the doctrine of the faith and turn over all the information to the police , " barbara blaine , the president of snap , told reuters news service .
a trickle of acknowledgements have begun , and some say a wave may be coming .
earlier this month , the german church 's representative responsible for dealing with cases of abuse , bishop stephan ackermann , also acknowledged severe failures .
" where there was no will toward explanation and where the person who committed the crime was simply moved to a new post , we have to admit , in a whole array of cases , that there was a cover-up , " he told the rhein zeitung newspaper .
and this week , german news magazine focus reported that archbishop zollitsch , the leader of the german roman catholic church , also admitted cases of child sex abuse were known and covered up .
" yes , we did have that , " he said .
many see the catholic church as so damaged by these allegations that it will be hard for the institution to regain its footing .
" we can only survive this situation with openness and honesty , " says the cologne archbishopric 's heckeley .
" we have to try to win people 's trust that way . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 25.03.2010 latest priest sex abuse scandal heats up responsibility debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as cardinal , ratzinger was informed but failed to act in the murphy case as the latest sexual abuse scandal in the catholic church gets uncomfortably close to the pope , questions of punishment versus apology in dealing with pedophile priests have once again emerged . the catholic church says the only way to face the burgeoning numbers of accusations is with complete honesty - and by urging victims to take legal action .
meanwhile , activists say the church should take more responsibility for its wayward leaders .
either way , the situation surrounding sexual abuse scandals in the catholic church is like a modern-day hydra myth - no sooner is one scandal addressed than another rises up to take its place .
with europe 's catholics still reeling from a series of alleged child-molestation cover-ups , news broke in the united states of a 1996 case that touches the upper echelons of church power .
failure to defrock in the latest case to hit headlines , the new york times reported on thursday that pope benedict xvi ignored allegations of child sex abuse back in the 1990s .
at the time , he was head of the congregation of the doctrine of the faith , the vatican body that judges cases of sexual abuse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victims recently took to the streets of the vatican to protest the paper reported that the pope - then cardinal joseph ratzinger - failed to defrock rev. lawrence murphy , a priest in milwaukee who had been accused of sexually abusing some 200 deaf boys , despite the fact that he was aware of the allegations .
murphy worked from 1950 to 1977 at a school for the deaf and died in 1998 .
a spokesman for the vatican , federico lombardi , argued that rome was n't informed of the case until 20 years after it happened , and said that in the end the church did n't take action against murphy because he had confessed the acts and because he was very ill and close to the end of his life .
records uncovered by the times show that three different bishops were aware of the accusations , but that the case was not brought to trial .
still , lombardi told news service reuters that the church is eager to see abusive priests brought to justice .
church calls in professional help this is a feeling shared by christoph heckeley , a spokesman for the archbishopric of cologne , germany .
the catholic church in germany has had a directive for the past eight years that urges prosecution in sex abuse cases , heckeley told deutsche welle .
" since 2002 we have a directive from the german bishops conference that says what you have to do in case sexual abuse is suspected , " heckeley said .
people with complaints are referred to professionals - psychologists , doctors and legal experts - who are hired by each bishopric , and are qualified to advise people who want to come forward with sex abuse allegations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abuse allegedly took place at some german jesuit schools " our aim is to listen to the victims and help them get justice , even when the cases are years or decades old .
they need somebody to listen to them , and the most important thing is that they get justice , " he said .
the response from the church will differ case by case , but the church " urgently advises " victims to take perpetrators to court .
unfortunately , heckeley said , victims often do n't want to do this because it can be too upsetting to their families , and " can destroy their entire social environment - it can traumatize them a second time .
you have to be careful . "
prosecution is a right , not an obligation while there is a right to prosecute , there is no obligation to do so - a situation that is currently under hot debate .
still , heckeley said experts recommend caution , since " the dangers -lrb- of forced prosecution -rrb- could outweigh the risks . "
no matter what shape the case takes in federal court , allegations of abuse are always looked into by a church tribunal out of rome .
yet in the murphy case , ratzinger 's deputy at the time advised a secret disciplinary trial at first .
he later reversed that decision , and in 1998 , murphy appealed directly to ratzinger for clemency , shortly before he died .
all the calls for openness , trials and apologies are well and good , victims-rights advocates say , but they do n't go far enough .
what is missing on the part of the church is a departure from the secrecy , and a willingness to admit its own cover-ups .
last week , following revelations of pedophilia that rocked the irish catholic church , the pope issued a long-awaited apology to victims of child sex abuse in ireland .
he acknowledged " serious mistakes " on the part of the church , as well as the sense of betrayal in the church felt by victims and their families .
victims ' groups start protests but irish victims ' groups felt that the apology fell short of their demands ; they called for the church to acknowledge its role in covering up abuse .
maeve lewis , executive director of irish victims ' rights group one in four , told bbc news , " we are really disappointed that there is no acknowledgement that the cover-up and the policy of cover-up in the church went right to the the vatican . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope finally addressed the cases of abuse in ireland and in germany , victims-rights advocates were incensed that the apology failed to mention cases of church pedophilia in munich that have dominated headlines for weeks .
the church has had to contend with cover-up allegations in that city while ratzinger was the city 's archbishop from 1977 to 1981 .
on thursday members of the us activist organization snap - survivor network of those abused by priests - launched a demonstration in the vatican , holding up signs that said " stop the secrecy now . "
they demanded that pope benedict open up all files on pedophile catholic clerics worldwide , and called for all " predator priests " to be defrocked .
the group has also protested in germany , austria , and the netherlands , all countries recently hit by church sex abuse scandals .
one official 's stance " i would ask the pope if he would please open up the files from the congregation of the doctrine of the faith and turn over all the information to the police , " barbara blaine , the president of snap , told reuters news service .
a trickle of acknowledgements have begun , and some say a wave may be coming .
earlier this month , the german church 's representative responsible for dealing with cases of abuse , bishop stephan ackermann , also acknowledged severe failures .
" where there was no will toward explanation and where the person who committed the crime was simply moved to a new post , we have to admit , in a whole array of cases , that there was a cover-up , " he told the rhein zeitung newspaper .
and this week , german news magazine focus reported that archbishop zollitsch , the leader of the german roman catholic church , also admitted cases of child sex abuse were known and covered up .
" yes , we did have that , " he said .
many see the catholic church as so damaged by these allegations that it will be hard for the institution to regain its footing .
" we can only survive this situation with openness and honesty , " says the cologne archbishopric 's heckeley .
" we have to try to win people 's trust that way . "

conflict between european leaders over imf involvement looms . in an address to the german parliament on thursday , german chancellor angela merkel outlined her support for international monetary fund assistance to try to solve greece 's debt problems - and urged other european leaders to change their minds on the issue .
" europe can not face this crisis alone , " said merkel . the german chancellor said she would only support eu financial assistance if it was with additional support from the imf .
however she said this should occur as a " last resort . "
during her statement , merkel also outlined germany 's wishes for further sanctions for countries that break budget rules .
she said greece had shown how vulnerable the eu was to economic mismanagement in a single country .
she stressed that europe " could not afford to water down the stability pact . "
merkel added that germany was committed to the eu , saying that the countries " together were stronger . "
france-germany divide ?
ahead of thursday 's eu summit , european leaders are divided on how aid can best be pledged to support greece - and other eu countries that may face financial troubles in the future .
offering direct financial assistance to greece is an unpopular move in germany , as many german taxpayers believe they already contribute enough to the eu .
merkel 's pro-imf stance has set a clear distinction between germany and other eu countries , including france , who have said any financial support for greece should come from within the european union .
european commission president jose manuel barroso has urged leaders to come to an agreement swiftly in order to boost market confidence in the euro zone .

newsweekly der spiegel reported thursday that the german foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- sent an e-mail describing the attack and the possible numbers killed .
" many civilians were killed -lrb- numbers vary between 50 and 100 -rrb- , " the e-mail read .
a government spokesman described the e-mail as an " unconfirmed preliminary report . "
he said the e-mail has already been handed over , along with other related documents , to the parliamentary inquiry , and that all of these documents confirm merkel 's stance that civilian casualties were never ruled out .
who knew what when ?
while merkel never claimed that civilians were not killed , it was days before she first spoke to parliament about the airstrike .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the civilian deaths and the government 's response have stirred controvery in germany much of the parliamentary inquiry is focused on who knew what about the bombing and when they knew it .
franz-josef jung , defense minister at the time of the airstrike , stepped down in november over an alleged cover-up of civilian deaths .
he had originally said that no civilians had been killed .
a nato report ultimately found that 142 civilians were killed in the bombing of the two oil tankers , which had been hijacked by taliban insurgents but then got stuck crossing a river bed .
the strike was ordered by a german colonel and carried out by nato aircraft . the bnd e-mail explained the high number of civilian casualties by saying that afghan citizens had taken the " opportunity " to siphon off fuel for their own use .
testifying to the parliamentary inquiry on thursday , jung once again denied that he had suppressed evidence .
the opposition in parliament has reserved the right to call merkel as a witness in the inquiry , although no date has been set. hf / afp / apn editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal hinges on voluntary bilateral loans from eurozone countries . after finally ironing out differences that had threatened to derail european union assistance to greece , and destabilize the eurozone , german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy have come up with a plan to help greece .
the two leaders worked out the plan in face-to-face talks immediately before an eu summit was set to begin on thursday evening in brussels .
the agreement would allow eurozone countries to offer greece bilateral loans .
the international monetary fund would also be involved , providing additional support in exchange for fiscal reforms in athens .
sarkozy and merkel are set to present the plan first to eu president herman van rompuy , and then to eurozone and eu leaders .
two different approaches germany and france have come to represent two different views on how to deal with greece , whose growing debts have raised concerns for the wider eurozone .
merkel has pushed for imf aid while sarkozy wants to see the eu support greece .
" europe can not face this crisis alone , " merkel said in an address to the german parliament earlier on thursday .
greece , whose credit rating has been downgraded by all the major ratings agencies , had asked for the promise of a eurozone loan - rather than a loan itself - to convince other lenders to lower their charges for loans. hf / afp / dpa / reuters editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with their bundesliga and champions league campaigns still on course , bayern face a punishing end-of-season run . it took something special for bayern munich to beat schalke in their own backyard to reach the german cup final on wednesday night .
dutch international arjen robben looked to be going nowhere when he took off with the ball just inside the schalke half before racing down the right-wing to the corner flag .
one electric injection of pace and direction later , with three defenders flailing in his wake , robben was suddenly in the penalty area lashing a left-footed shot beyond schalke keeper manuel neuer to win the semi-final in style .
although bayern had the lion 's share of possession and the early chances in this tense and sometimes bad tempered meeting , robben 's 112th minute winner was the only flash of real class in the whole game .
and despite having eight minutes to save the tie after the bayern winger scored , it was clear schalke were out as soon as the dutchman 's shot hit the back of the net .
neither team had produced anything as decisive in nearly two hours of soccer .
robben 's act of individual brilliance was a worthy match winner , but the dutchman 's tenth goal of the season certainly put a thick layer of gloss on a rather dull bayern performance .
schalke 's overwhelming emphasis on defense , along with the terrible state of the turf in the veltins arena , gradually sapped bayern 's strength and creativity .
but even the bavarians ' early attempts on goal were far from polished .
energetic robben the exception as bayern labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben stood out from the lethargic pack on wednesday robben was the exception throughout , tirelessly chasing and making runs at schalke defenders .
no-one else , not even the late substitute franck ribery , looked able to summon that kind of energy , which could be a matter of concern in the coming weeks .
" we 're still involved in three competitions and that is emotionally not all that easy for the players , " bayern coach louis van gaal said after wednesday 's semifinal win .
" but we want to be involved in all three competitions , so we will have to come to terms with that . "
with league matches against main title rivals schalke and bayer leverkusen on the horizon , and a make-or-break champions league tie over two legs against manchester united , bayern 's season will likely be decided by the end of april - for better or worse .
the concern settling over munich is that the squad may not be deep enough to survive three consecutive title races .
loan deals force coach 's hand over rising stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal 's faith in young players is being put to the test luke faron , a bayern munich expert with theoffside.com , believes that bayern are beginning to feel the effects of loaning a number of players out to other clubs and promoting youngsters to a first team involved in not only a bundesliga title fight and a lengthy german cup campaign but also european matches of the highest standard .
" loaning brazilian defender breno to nuremberg was a necessary step in continuing his development and in getting the young center back some playing time , " faron told deutsche welle .
loaning left back edson braafheid to celtic was a bit surprising , said faron .
combined with breno 's move , it meant holger badstuber would be the only true reserve center back , in addition to starting at left back .
" with center backs van buyten and demichelis suffering injuries , badstuber had to move back inside and the pressure on the youngster has been intense . "
faron believes that van gaal has been forced to test the faith he had in the young players he brought into replenish the senior side in january , but says the coach has so far - on the whole - been justified in his decisions .
" diego contento and david alaba have both performed admirably in their champions league debuts , " said faron .
" alaba had a very bad final five minutes in frankfurt last weekend and perhaps that showed the limits of the wisdom of playing a 17-year-old natural midfielder out of position in a highly competitive match . "
he said contento had had his hands full with jefferson farfan on wednesday , but that he had coped with the task well enough .
if any player was showing fatigue , said faron , it was forward thomas mueller " it 's a big adjustment for a young player like mueller who has n't even played a full season in the bundesliga before .
add in the champions league and the german cup and the fact he also just made his national team debut , and it 's easy to understand why . "
success from continuity makes coach reluctant to change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the league campaign did not start well under van gaal another factor which is contributing to bayern 's lethargy at this point in the season is van gaal 's commitment to continuity .
when he assumed control at the beginning of the season , it took the dutch coach at least ten matches of tinkering before he settled on his preferred line-up - ten matches during which bayern seemed rudderless and the coach 's credentials were questioned .
once the coach found his formula in november , however , an impressive winning streak began and van gaal has not looked back .
as a result , the dutchman risks wearing out his preferred starting 11 .
as bayern enter a run of decisive matches , time will tell if the squad 's mix of youngsters and stars can maintain top performance .
luke faron believes the bavarian giants have what it takes , regardless of tired legs .
" bayern have a chance against manchester united , but they have to be considered underdogs , " he said . " munich 's defense has not performed at the level necessary to progress further in the competition , though wednesday night 's performance in the cup might be the start of a turnaround . "
the big test , says faron , begins a week from saturday , when bayern face schalke , man united and bayer leverkusen all away from home , within a seven day period .
but thereafter , prospects seem bright .
" after the match in leverkusen they have an exceptionally easy schedule in the league for the last month of the campaign . in addition , they 're getting key players like gomez and demichelis back from injury and that should help during the run-in . i believe bayern will prevail in the bundesliga regardless of how far they progress in the champions league .

" in turkey , we have german high schools - why should n't there be turkish high schools in germany ? "
erdogan asked in an interview with german weekly die zeit .
erdogan said that many of the almost three million people of turkish origin living in germany had problems with both languages , and offering education in turkish might also help their german .
" germany has not yet caught up with the times , " erdogan said .
" one must first have a firm command of one 's own language , that is to say , turkish , and that is unfortunately rarely the case . "
the federal government 's integration commissioner , maria boehmer , acknowledged the advantage pupils might gain if they could be fluent in two languages , but said learning german should take priority .
" only those who know german have a chance of social advancement , " boehmer , a christian democrat , told the daily berliner zeitung .
the head of the christian democratic party 's german-turkish forum in north-rhine westphalia was also skeptical .
" turkish secondary schools are a dead end for students , " buelent arslan told the daily koelner stadtanzeiger .
" to be successful in germany , a good level of german is essential , " arslan added .

the deal hinges on voluntary bilateral loans from eurozone countries . after finally ironing out differences that had threatened to derail european union assistance to greece , and destabilize the eurozone , german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy have come up with a plan to help greece .
the two leaders worked out the plan in face-to-face talks immediately before an eu summit was set to begin on thursday evening in brussels .
the agreement would allow eurozone countries to offer greece bilateral loans .
the international monetary fund would also be involved , providing additional support in exchange for fiscal reforms in athens .
sarkozy and merkel are set to present the plan first to eu president herman van rompuy , and then to eurozone and eu leaders .
two different approaches germany and france have come to represent two different views on how to deal with greece , whose growing debts have raised concerns for the wider eurozone .
merkel has pushed for imf aid while sarkozy wants to see the eu support greece .
" europe can not face this crisis alone , " merkel said in an address to the german parliament earlier on thursday .
greece , whose credit rating has been downgraded by all the major ratings agencies , had asked for the promise of a eurozone loan - rather than a loan itself - to convince other lenders to lower their charges for loans. hf / afp / dpa / reuters editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de research -pipe- 25.03.2010 german researchers decode unrecognized dna from ancient humanoid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists analyzed dna from a fossil finger found in siberia when researchers discovered a fossil finger in a siberian cave , they found an ancestor - and perhaps a new human species .
johannes krause told deutsche welle about his team 's efforts to analyze the ancient dna . the new report was published on the website of science journal " nature " on march 24 .
leipzig researchers johannes krause and svante pääbo of the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology co-authored the international project . deutsche welle : how did you find a bone fragment from the altai mountains ?
johannes krause : for several years , we 've been involved in a very productive collaboration with our colleagues in russia .
we received bones from them that we later identified as neanderthal bones , for example , thus showing that neanderthals lived in southern siberia , too - not just in europe .
and in recent years , we 've received other bone samples for genetic testing .
here in leipzig , we 've taken our neanderthal research to the genetic level , so we 've been examining the dna of ancient man -lrb- ... -rrb- to help us learn how prehistoric man is related to modern-day man or other forms of early man . the neaderthal has their own dna at least for portions of the genome , so they are n't our direct ancestors ; they 're more an extinct cousin of sorts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dna analysis of homonid species could shed light on their ties to modern man and during our search for new neanderthal bones , we stumbled upon these bones with dna that belonged neither to neanderthals nor modern man .
it constitutes a new form of prehistoric man that had never been discovered - something we had never seen from a genetic standpoint and that we could n't categorize as an existing form of prehistoric man .
everyone 's calling this a sensation - would you call it that ?
i think it 's a sensation because until now we had the potential to do genetic research on two different forms of man - now there 's a third .
so that 's pretty sensational , particularly as it ca n't be classified according to any existing form of prehistoric man .
unfortunately , we do n't have a complete skeleton - just the bone from a pinkie finger .
it 's a tiny fragment that ca n't tell us much about the morphology .
therefore we still do n't know what this prehistoric man looked like - did he perhaps look like a neanderthal , modern man or a homo erectus ?
so we lack quite a lot of information , but we now have the potential to study the dna of this prehistoric man ; we have the potential to examine the entire genome and genetic material from this prehistoric man and compare it to modern man and the neanderthals , for instance .
and through that , we can learn a lot .
for example , what kind of interactions occurred between these three species of prehistoric man ?
we could also show that they lived in the same place at the same time - that 's another sensation for us .
that means , we find neanderthal bones in a nearby cave , and in same layer in which we found the bones of the new human form , we find archaeological artifacts that appear to have come from modern man - ornaments and jewelry that are only associated with modern man .
so it looks as though these three forms of early man lived in the same place at the same time .
you can then imagine any number of scenarios where gene flow could have occurred between these three populations , and that is certainly something that 's very interesting to analyze on a genetic level .
is finding something like this an anthropologist 's dream come true ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian researchers discovered the fossil bone at a site in the altai mountains in siberia yes , this is probably a once-in-a-lifetime chance - discovering a new species or form of prehistoric man .
it 's certainly quite exciting for us .
of course , we should note that we 're not calling it a new species - we 're only talking about a new " form . "
so far , we 've only analyzed a tiny portion of the dna , and only when the entire genome or a large part of the genome has been analyzed will we be able to tell whether it 's something completely new or different , like modern man or the neanderthals , for instance .
and until then , we 're not going to talk about a new species .
but all signs indicate that we 're actually dealing with an entirely knew species of man here .
then what do you know already ; whose bones are they ?
so far , we can only say that this dna - the dna we 've studied so far from this prehistoric man - has about 1 million years between it and the dna of modern man .
so that means that these two forms , modern man and prehistoric man , spent at least 1 million years developing in very different ways .
based on our genetic tests , we can also say that modern man is more closely related to the neanderthals than he is to this new form of prehistoric man - we 're seeing two times as many differences between the dna of modern man and this new form than we do with modern man and the neanderthals .
this represents a completely different line that split off from modern man much earlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mitochondrial dna decoding showed differences between the ancestor and modern man do you know if it was a woman or a man ?
we 've named it " x woman . "
" x " stands for the unknown , since we ca n't classify it so easiliy , as i 'd mentioned . and " woman " because we examined the mitochondrial dna - the dna from the powerhouse of the cell - and that 's always passed down from the mother to the child .
so we 're looking at the female lineage , and so we adopted a feministic position .
but since we have yet to examine the entire genetic material , we still do n't know whether it 's a man or a woman .
and this process for examining the mitochrondrial dna - that 's something you developed ?
yes , my boss svante pääbo studied mitochrondrial dna from prehistoric man for the first time in the ' 90s - at the time , from neanderthals .
in recent years , we have refined these methods to help us obtain more information more quickly - and of a higher qualitative value .
but we 've really kicked this kind of research into high gear in recent years .
what 's next ?
what else do you plan to study - and what do you hope to find ?
we plan to study the entire genome - this prehistoric man 's entire genetic material .
we do n't just want to look at this tiny fraction , rather we will examine the entire genome to learn more about this prehistoric man and to see how he was related to modern man and to neanderthals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the neanderthals share many commonalities with modern man was there potential gene flow between these three populations ?
and what can we learn about phenotypical features - what color hair did he have ?
we 'll look at other kinds of features that we can reconstruct based on dna sequencing .
and who gets to keep the bone once you conclude your research ? whatever 's left of the bone will certainly be sent back to novosibirsk , to the museum responsible for the entire excavation .
that said , it 's not a spectacular bone - it 's only as large as cherry pit .
so it 's a very tiny fragment and it might not be all that interesting to look at .

" in turkey , we have german high schools - why should n't there be turkish high schools in germany ? "
erdogan asked in an interview with german weekly die zeit .
erdogan said that many of the almost three million people of turkish origin living in germany had problems with both languages , and offering education in turkish might also help their german .
" germany has not yet caught up with the times , " erdogan said .
" one must first have a firm command of one 's own language , that is to say , turkish , and that is unfortunately rarely the case . "
the federal government 's integration commissioner , maria boehmer , acknowledged the advantage pupils might gain if they could be fluent in two languages , but said learning german should take priority .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 25.03.2010 iran 's nuclear work brings fear of mideast arms race großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad at iran 's nuclear enrichment facility in natanz .
as iran continues to develop its nuclear program , analysts fear that an arms race in the middle east could begin .
if sanctions continue to fail , these analysts say that military action is necessary to prevent this . as world powers negotiate on how to deal with iran 's continuing development of its nuclear program , concerns about a nuclear arms race in the middle east , prompted by iran 's determination to build nuclear weapons , are mounting .
officials from the united states , russia , france , britain , germany and china participated in a conference call yesterday to discuss how to handle iran 's flaunting of international demands to cease nuclear work .
these countries , while attempting to deter iran from continued nuclear development by offering tehran incentives to allow more oversight of its program , are also threatening sanctions if tehran does not stop work toward producing weapons grade uranium . iran , which has faced sanctions from the united nations three times , says it is developing its nuclear program for peaceful purposes and has refused to allow inspectors from the international atomic energy agency access to its nuclear facilities .
it is party to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty , but repeatedly has been found non-compliant .
there is growing fear that iran will not stop work toward a weapon unless drastic action is taken .
middle east experts said that if iran continues on its current path , a nuclear arms race in the region could ensue . ' ' turkey , algeria , egypt , and saudi arabia are all potential candidates to develop nuclear weapons , " abdulaziz sager , chairman of the gulf research center in dubai , told deutsche welle .
' ' and they will say , if -lsb- nuclear weapon development -rsb- is permitted in iran , why ca n't we develop weapons as well ? "
a threat beyond israel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has called for the destruction of israel .
a nuclear-armed iran is widely seen as a direct threat to israel , as iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has pledged to ' ' wipe israel off the map . "
israel has not ruled out preemptive strikes against suspected nuclear sites inside iran if development continues .
but iran 's possession of a nuclear weapon has implications for other countries in the region as well , mustafa alani , senior advisor and program director at the gulf research center says .
' ' the question is not whether iran uses the bomb against other countries in the middle east , " alani told deutsche welle .
' ' but the question is whether iran has control of the region , and the political consequences of a dominant iran . "
the political balance of power in the middle east at the current time is relatively stable .
israel has a dominant military and nuclear weapons , as well as the backing of the united states .
economic power is diversified , as a number of states have thriving oil industries .
the region is also politically stable , with the exception of iraq , which is trying to sustain a functioning government in the wake of the iraq war .
a nuclear-armed and increasingly belligerent iran would dramatically alter this balance .
ahmadinejad would hold disproportionate clout , and if recent belligerent statements toward israel are to be believed , seems to be willing to use it .
preemption vs. nuclear war in the past , analysts have told deutsche welle that israel is unlikely to carry out unilateral military action against iran , as any action is not likely to destroy iran 's entire nuclear infrastructure .
last month , chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff admiral mike mullen told congress ' ' no strike , however effective , will be in and of itself decisive . "
however , the gulf center 's sager says that if economic sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a convoy of israeli military armored vehicles on the gaza strip. continue to fail , preemptive military action to stop iran from acquiring nuclear weapons is needed .
the power iran would have would be too great and too much of a risk to the region . ' ' if i had to chose between living with iran as a constant threat , or a military strike with limited retaliation , i can more easily live with the military option , " he said .
' ' we have already lived through wars , and no countries were erased from the map . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de research -pipe- 25.03.2010 german researchers decode unrecognized dna from ancient humanoid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists analyzed dna from a fossil finger found in siberia when researchers discovered a fossil finger in a siberian cave , they found an ancestor - and perhaps a new human species .
johannes krause told deutsche welle about his team 's efforts to analyze the ancient dna . the new report was published on the website of science journal " nature " on march 24 .
leipzig researchers johannes krause and svante pääbo of the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology co-authored the international project . deutsche welle : how did you find a bone fragment from the altai mountains ?
johannes krause : for several years , we 've been involved in a very productive collaboration with our colleagues in russia .
we received bones from them that we later identified as neanderthal bones , for example , thus showing that neanderthals lived in southern siberia , too - not just in europe .
and in recent years , we 've received other bone samples for genetic testing .
here in leipzig , we 've taken our neanderthal research to the genetic level , so we 've been examining the dna of ancient man -lrb- ... -rrb- to help us learn how prehistoric man is related to modern-day man or other forms of early man . the neaderthal has their own dna at least for portions of the genome , so they are n't our direct ancestors ; they 're more an extinct cousin of sorts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dna analysis of homonid species could shed light on their ties to modern man and during our search for new neanderthal bones , we stumbled upon these bones with dna that belonged neither to neanderthals nor modern man .
it constitutes a new form of prehistoric man that had never been discovered - something we had never seen from a genetic standpoint and that we could n't categorize as an existing form of prehistoric man .
everyone 's calling this a sensation - would you call it that ?
i think it 's a sensation because until now we had the potential to do genetic research on two different forms of man - now there 's a third .
so that 's pretty sensational , particularly as it ca n't be classified according to any existing form of prehistoric man .
unfortunately , we do n't have a complete skeleton - just the bone from a pinkie finger .
it 's a tiny fragment that ca n't tell us much about the morphology .
therefore we still do n't know what this prehistoric man looked like - did he perhaps look like a neanderthal , modern man or a homo erectus ?
so we lack quite a lot of information , but we now have the potential to study the dna of this prehistoric man ; we have the potential to examine the entire genome and genetic material from this prehistoric man and compare it to modern man and the neanderthals , for instance .
and through that , we can learn a lot .
for example , what kind of interactions occurred between these three species of prehistoric man ?
we could also show that they lived in the same place at the same time - that 's another sensation for us .
that means , we find neanderthal bones in a nearby cave , and in same layer in which we found the bones of the new human form , we find archaeological artifacts that appear to have come from modern man - ornaments and jewelry that are only associated with modern man .
so it looks as though these three forms of early man lived in the same place at the same time .
you can then imagine any number of scenarios where gene flow could have occurred between these three populations , and that is certainly something that 's very interesting to analyze on a genetic level .
is finding something like this an anthropologist 's dream come true ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian researchers discovered the fossil bone at a site in the altai mountains in siberia yes , this is probably a once-in-a-lifetime chance - discovering a new species or form of prehistoric man .
it 's certainly quite exciting for us .
of course , we should note that we 're not calling it a new species - we 're only talking about a new " form . "
so far , we 've only analyzed a tiny portion of the dna , and only when the entire genome or a large part of the genome has been analyzed will we be able to tell whether it 's something completely new or different , like modern man or the neanderthals , for instance .
and until then , we 're not going to talk about a new species .
but all signs indicate that we 're actually dealing with an entirely knew species of man here .
then what do you know already ; whose bones are they ?
so far , we can only say that this dna - the dna we 've studied so far from this prehistoric man - has about 1 million years between it and the dna of modern man .
so that means that these two forms , modern man and prehistoric man , spent at least 1 million years developing in very different ways .
based on our genetic tests , we can also say that modern man is more closely related to the neanderthals than he is to this new form of prehistoric man - we 're seeing two times as many differences between the dna of modern man and this new form than we do with modern man and the neanderthals .
this represents a completely different line that split off from modern man much earlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mitochondrial dna decoding showed differences between the ancestor and modern man do you know if it was a woman or a man ?
we 've named it " x woman . "
" x " stands for the unknown , since we ca n't classify it so easiliy , as i 'd mentioned . and " woman " because we examined the mitochondrial dna - the dna from the powerhouse of the cell - and that 's always passed down from the mother to the child .
so we 're looking at the female lineage , and so we adopted a feministic position .
but since we have yet to examine the entire genetic material , we still do n't know whether it 's a man or a woman .
and this process for examining the mitochrondrial dna - that 's something you developed ?
yes , my boss svante pääbo studied mitochrondrial dna from prehistoric man for the first time in the ' 90s - at the time , from neanderthals .
in recent years , we have refined these methods to help us obtain more information more quickly - and of a higher qualitative value .
but we 've really kicked this kind of research into high gear in recent years .
what 's next ?
what else do you plan to study - and what do you hope to find ?
we plan to study the entire genome - this prehistoric man 's entire genetic material .
we do n't just want to look at this tiny fraction , rather we will examine the entire genome to learn more about this prehistoric man and to see how he was related to modern man and to neanderthals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the neanderthals share many commonalities with modern man was there potential gene flow between these three populations ?
and what can we learn about phenotypical features - what color hair did he have ?
we 'll look at other kinds of features that we can reconstruct based on dna sequencing .
and who gets to keep the bone once you conclude your research ? whatever 's left of the bone will certainly be sent back to novosibirsk , to the museum responsible for the entire excavation .
that said , it 's not a spectacular bone - it 's only as large as cherry pit .
so it 's a very tiny fragment and it might not be all that interesting to look at .

with their bundesliga and champions league campaigns still on course , bayern face a punishing end-of-season run . it took something special for bayern munich to beat schalke in their own backyard to reach the german cup final on wednesday night .
dutch international arjen robben looked to be going nowhere when he took off with the ball just inside the schalke half before racing down the right-wing to the corner flag .
one electric injection of pace and direction later , with three defenders flailing in his wake , robben was suddenly in the penalty area lashing a left-footed shot beyond schalke keeper manuel neuer to win the semi-final in style .
although bayern had the lion 's share of possession and the early chances in this tense and sometimes bad tempered meeting , robben 's 112th minute winner was the only flash of real class in the whole game .
and despite having eight minutes to save the tie after the bayern winger scored , it was clear schalke were out as soon as the dutchman 's shot hit the back of the net .
neither team had produced anything as decisive in nearly two hours of soccer .
robben 's act of individual brilliance was a worthy match winner , but the dutchman 's tenth goal of the season certainly put a thick layer of gloss on a rather dull bayern performance .
schalke 's overwhelming emphasis on defense , along with the terrible state of the turf in the veltins arena , gradually sapped bayern 's strength and creativity .
but even the bavarians ' early attempts on goal were far from polished .
energetic robben the exception as bayern labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben stood out from the lethargic pack on wednesday robben was the exception throughout , tirelessly chasing and making runs at schalke defenders .
no-one else , not even the late substitute franck ribery , looked able to summon that kind of energy , which could be a matter of concern in the coming weeks .
" we 're still involved in three competitions and that is emotionally not all that easy for the players , " bayern coach louis van gaal said after wednesday 's semifinal win .
" but we want to be involved in all three competitions , so we will have to come to terms with that . "
with league matches against main title rivals schalke and bayer leverkusen on the horizon , and a make-or-break champions league tie over two legs against manchester united , bayern 's season will likely be decided by the end of april - for better or worse .
the concern settling over munich is that the squad may not be deep enough to survive three consecutive title races .
loan deals force coach 's hand over rising stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal 's faith in young players is being put to the test luke faron , a bayern munich expert with theoffside.com , believes that bayern are beginning to feel the effects of loaning a number of players out to other clubs and promoting youngsters to a first team involved in not only a bundesliga title fight and a lengthy german cup campaign but also european matches of the highest standard .
" loaning brazilian defender breno to nuremberg was a necessary step in continuing his development and in getting the young center back some playing time , " faron told deutsche welle .
loaning left back edson braafheid to celtic was a bit surprising , said faron .
combined with breno 's move , it meant holger badstuber would be the only true reserve center back , in addition to starting at left back .
" with center backs van buyten and demichelis suffering injuries , badstuber had to move back inside and the pressure on the youngster has been intense . "
faron believes that van gaal has been forced to test the faith he had in the young players he brought into replenish the senior side in january , but says the coach has so far - on the whole - been justified in his decisions .
" diego contento and david alaba have both performed admirably in their champions league debuts , " said faron .
" alaba had a very bad final five minutes in frankfurt last weekend and perhaps that showed the limits of the wisdom of playing a 17-year-old natural midfielder out of position in a highly competitive match . "
he said contento had had his hands full with jefferson farfan on wednesday , but that he had coped with the task well enough .
if any player was showing fatigue , said faron , it was forward thomas mueller " it 's a big adjustment for a young player like mueller who has n't even played a full season in the bundesliga before .
add in the champions league and the german cup and the fact he also just made his national team debut , and it 's easy to understand why . "
success from continuity makes coach reluctant to change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the league campaign did not start well under van gaal another factor which is contributing to bayern 's lethargy at this point in the season is van gaal 's commitment to continuity .
when he assumed control at the beginning of the season , it took the dutch coach at least ten matches of tinkering before he settled on his preferred line-up - ten matches during which bayern seemed rudderless and the coach 's credentials were questioned .
once the coach found his formula in november , however , an impressive winning streak began and van gaal has not looked back .
as a result , the dutchman risks wearing out his preferred starting 11 .
as bayern enter a run of decisive matches , time will tell if the squad 's mix of youngsters and stars can maintain top performance .
luke faron believes the bavarian giants have what it takes , regardless of tired legs .
" bayern have a chance against manchester united , but they have to be considered underdogs , " he said . " munich 's defense has not performed at the level necessary to progress further in the competition , though wednesday night 's performance in the cup might be the start of a turnaround . "
the big test , says faron , begins a week from saturday , when bayern face schalke , man united and bayer leverkusen all away from home , within a seven day period .
but thereafter , prospects seem bright .
" after the match in leverkusen they have an exceptionally easy schedule in the league for the last month of the campaign . in addition , they 're getting key players like gomez and demichelis back from injury and that should help during the run-in . i believe bayern will prevail in the bundesliga regardless of how far they progress in the champions league .

greece , whose credit rating has been downgraded by all the major ratings agencies , had asked for the promise of a eurozone loan - rather than a loan itself - to convince other lenders to lower their charges for loans. hf / afp / dpa / reuters editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

johannes krause told deutsche welle about his team 's efforts to analyze the ancient dna . the new report was published on the website of science journal " nature " on march 24 .
leipzig researchers johannes krause and svante pääbo of the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology co-authored the international project . deutsche welle : how did you find a bone fragment from the altai mountains ?
johannes krause : for several years , we 've been involved in a very productive collaboration with our colleagues in russia .
we received bones from them that we later identified as neanderthal bones , for example , thus showing that neanderthals lived in southern siberia , too - not just in europe .
and in recent years , we 've received other bone samples for genetic testing .
here in leipzig , we 've taken our neanderthal research to the genetic level , so we 've been examining the dna of ancient man -lrb- ... -rrb- to help us learn how prehistoric man is related to modern-day man or other forms of early man . the neaderthal has their own dna at least for portions of the genome , so they are n't our direct ancestors ; they 're more an extinct cousin of sorts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dna analysis of homonid species could shed light on their ties to modern man and during our search for new neanderthal bones , we stumbled upon these bones with dna that belonged neither to neanderthals nor modern man .
it constitutes a new form of prehistoric man that had never been discovered - something we had never seen from a genetic standpoint and that we could n't categorize as an existing form of prehistoric man .
everyone 's calling this a sensation - would you call it that ?
i think it 's a sensation because until now we had the potential to do genetic research on two different forms of man - now there 's a third .
so that 's pretty sensational , particularly as it ca n't be classified according to any existing form of prehistoric man .
unfortunately , we do n't have a complete skeleton - just the bone from a pinkie finger .
it 's a tiny fragment that ca n't tell us much about the morphology .
therefore we still do n't know what this prehistoric man looked like - did he perhaps look like a neanderthal , modern man or a homo erectus ?
so we lack quite a lot of information , but we now have the potential to study the dna of this prehistoric man ; we have the potential to examine the entire genome and genetic material from this prehistoric man and compare it to modern man and the neanderthals , for instance .
and through that , we can learn a lot .
for example , what kind of interactions occurred between these three species of prehistoric man ?
we could also show that they lived in the same place at the same time - that 's another sensation for us .
that means , we find neanderthal bones in a nearby cave , and in same layer in which we found the bones of the new human form , we find archaeological artifacts that appear to have come from modern man - ornaments and jewelry that are only associated with modern man .
so it looks as though these three forms of early man lived in the same place at the same time .
you can then imagine any number of scenarios where gene flow could have occurred between these three populations , and that is certainly something that 's very interesting to analyze on a genetic level .
is finding something like this an anthropologist 's dream come true ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian researchers discovered the fossil bone at a site in the altai mountains in siberia yes , this is probably a once-in-a-lifetime chance - discovering a new species or form of prehistoric man .
it 's certainly quite exciting for us .
of course , we should note that we 're not calling it a new species - we 're only talking about a new " form . "
so far , we 've only analyzed a tiny portion of the dna , and only when the entire genome or a large part of the genome has been analyzed will we be able to tell whether it 's something completely new or different , like modern man or the neanderthals , for instance .
and until then , we 're not going to talk about a new species .
but all signs indicate that we 're actually dealing with an entirely knew species of man here .
then what do you know already ; whose bones are they ?
so far , we can only say that this dna - the dna we 've studied so far from this prehistoric man - has about 1 million years between it and the dna of modern man .
so that means that these two forms , modern man and prehistoric man , spent at least 1 million years developing in very different ways .
based on our genetic tests , we can also say that modern man is more closely related to the neanderthals than he is to this new form of prehistoric man - we 're seeing two times as many differences between the dna of modern man and this new form than we do with modern man and the neanderthals .
this represents a completely different line that split off from modern man much earlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mitochondrial dna decoding showed differences between the ancestor and modern man do you know if it was a woman or a man ?
we 've named it " x woman . "
" x " stands for the unknown , since we ca n't classify it so easiliy , as i 'd mentioned . and " woman " because we examined the mitochondrial dna - the dna from the powerhouse of the cell - and that 's always passed down from the mother to the child .
so we 're looking at the female lineage , and so we adopted a feministic position .
but since we have yet to examine the entire genetic material , we still do n't know whether it 's a man or a woman .
and this process for examining the mitochrondrial dna - that 's something you developed ?
yes , my boss svante pääbo studied mitochrondrial dna from prehistoric man for the first time in the ' 90s - at the time , from neanderthals .
in recent years , we have refined these methods to help us obtain more information more quickly - and of a higher qualitative value .
but we 've really kicked this kind of research into high gear in recent years .
what 's next ?
what else do you plan to study - and what do you hope to find ?
we plan to study the entire genome - this prehistoric man 's entire genetic material .
we do n't just want to look at this tiny fraction , rather we will examine the entire genome to learn more about this prehistoric man and to see how he was related to modern man and to neanderthals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the neanderthals share many commonalities with modern man was there potential gene flow between these three populations ?
and what can we learn about phenotypical features - what color hair did he have ?
we 'll look at other kinds of features that we can reconstruct based on dna sequencing .
and who gets to keep the bone once you conclude your research ? whatever 's left of the bone will certainly be sent back to novosibirsk , to the museum responsible for the entire excavation .
that said , it 's not a spectacular bone - it 's only as large as cherry pit .
so it 's a very tiny fragment and it might not be all that interesting to look at .

meanwhile , activists say the church should take more responsibility for its wayward leaders .
either way , the situation surrounding sexual abuse scandals in the catholic church is like a modern-day hydra myth - no sooner is one scandal addressed than another rises up to take its place .
with europe 's catholics still reeling from a series of alleged child-molestation cover-ups , news broke in the united states of a 1996 case that touches the upper echelons of church power .
failure to defrock in the latest case to hit headlines , the new york times reported on thursday that pope benedict xvi ignored allegations of child sex abuse back in the 1990s .
at the time , he was head of the congregation of the doctrine of the faith , the vatican body that judges cases of sexual abuse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victims recently took to the streets of the vatican to protest the paper reported that the pope - then cardinal joseph ratzinger - failed to defrock rev. lawrence murphy , a priest in milwaukee who had been accused of sexually abusing some 200 deaf boys , despite the fact that he was aware of the allegations .
murphy worked from 1950 to 1977 at a school for the deaf and died in 1998 .
a spokesman for the vatican , federico lombardi , argued that rome was n't informed of the case until 20 years after it happened , and said that in the end the church did n't take action against murphy because he had confessed the acts and because he was very ill and close to the end of his life .
records uncovered by the times show that three different bishops were aware of the accusations , but that the case was not brought to trial .
still , lombardi told news service reuters that the church is eager to see abusive priests brought to justice .
church calls in professional help this is a feeling shared by christoph heckeley , a spokesman for the archbishopric of cologne , germany .
the catholic church in germany has had a directive for the past eight years that urges prosecution in sex abuse cases , heckeley told deutsche welle .
" since 2002 we have a directive from the german bishops conference that says what you have to do in case sexual abuse is suspected , " heckeley said .
people with complaints are referred to professionals - psychologists , doctors and legal experts - who are hired by each bishopric , and are qualified to advise people who want to come forward with sex abuse allegations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abuse allegedly took place at some german jesuit schools " our aim is to listen to the victims and help them get justice , even when the cases are years or decades old .
they need somebody to listen to them , and the most important thing is that they get justice , " he said .
the response from the church will differ case by case , but the church " urgently advises " victims to take perpetrators to court .
unfortunately , heckeley said , victims often do n't want to do this because it can be too upsetting to their families , and " can destroy their entire social environment - it can traumatize them a second time .
you have to be careful . "
prosecution is a right , not an obligation while there is a right to prosecute , there is no obligation to do so - a situation that is currently under hot debate .
still , heckeley said experts recommend caution , since " the dangers -lrb- of forced prosecution -rrb- could outweigh the risks . "
no matter what shape the case takes in federal court , allegations of abuse are always looked into by a church tribunal out of rome .
yet in the murphy case , ratzinger 's deputy at the time advised a secret disciplinary trial at first .
he later reversed that decision , and in 1998 , murphy appealed directly to ratzinger for clemency , shortly before he died .
all the calls for openness , trials and apologies are well and good , victims-rights advocates say , but they do n't go far enough .
what is missing on the part of the church is a departure from the secrecy , and a willingness to admit its own cover-ups .
last week , following revelations of pedophilia that rocked the irish catholic church , the pope issued a long-awaited apology to victims of child sex abuse in ireland .
he acknowledged " serious mistakes " on the part of the church , as well as the sense of betrayal in the church felt by victims and their families .
victims ' groups start protests but irish victims ' groups felt that the apology fell short of their demands ; they called for the church to acknowledge its role in covering up abuse .
maeve lewis , executive director of irish victims ' rights group one in four , told bbc news , " we are really disappointed that there is no acknowledgement that the cover-up and the policy of cover-up in the church went right to the the vatican . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope finally addressed the cases of abuse in ireland and in germany , victims-rights advocates were incensed that the apology failed to mention cases of church pedophilia in munich that have dominated headlines for weeks .
the church has had to contend with cover-up allegations in that city while ratzinger was the city 's archbishop from 1977 to 1981 .
on thursday members of the us activist organization snap - survivor network of those abused by priests - launched a demonstration in the vatican , holding up signs that said " stop the secrecy now . "
they demanded that pope benedict open up all files on pedophile catholic clerics worldwide , and called for all " predator priests " to be defrocked .
the group has also protested in germany , austria , and the netherlands , all countries recently hit by church sex abuse scandals .
one official 's stance " i would ask the pope if he would please open up the files from the congregation of the doctrine of the faith and turn over all the information to the police , " barbara blaine , the president of snap , told reuters news service .
a trickle of acknowledgements have begun , and some say a wave may be coming .
earlier this month , the german church 's representative responsible for dealing with cases of abuse , bishop stephan ackermann , also acknowledged severe failures .
" where there was no will toward explanation and where the person who committed the crime was simply moved to a new post , we have to admit , in a whole array of cases , that there was a cover-up , " he told the rhein zeitung newspaper .
and this week , german news magazine focus reported that archbishop zollitsch , the leader of the german roman catholic church , also admitted cases of child sex abuse were known and covered up .
" yes , we did have that , " he said .
many see the catholic church as so damaged by these allegations that it will be hard for the institution to regain its footing .
" we can only survive this situation with openness and honesty , " says the cologne archbishopric 's heckeley .
" we have to try to win people 's trust that way . "

meanwhile , activists say the church should take more responsibility for its wayward leaders .
either way , the situation surrounding sexual abuse scandals in the catholic church is like a modern-day hydra myth - no sooner is one scandal addressed than another rises up to take its place .
with europe 's catholics still reeling from a series of alleged child-molestation cover-ups , news broke in the united states of a 1996 case that touches the upper echelons of church power .
failure to defrock in the latest case to hit headlines , the new york times reported on thursday that pope benedict xvi ignored allegations of child sex abuse back in the 1990s .
at the time , he was head of the congregation of the doctrine of the faith , the vatican body that judges cases of sexual abuse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victims recently took to the streets of the vatican to protest the paper reported that the pope - then cardinal joseph ratzinger - failed to defrock rev. lawrence murphy , a priest in milwaukee who had been accused of sexually abusing some 200 deaf boys , despite the fact that he was aware of the allegations .
murphy worked from 1950 to 1977 at a school for the deaf and died in 1998 .
a spokesman for the vatican , federico lombardi , argued that rome was n't informed of the case until 20 years after it happened , and said that in the end the church did n't take action against murphy because he had confessed the acts and because he was very ill and close to the end of his life .
records uncovered by the times show that three different bishops were aware of the accusations , but that the case was not brought to trial .
still , lombardi told news service reuters that the church is eager to see abusive priests brought to justice .
church calls in professional help this is a feeling shared by christoph heckeley , a spokesman for the archbishopric of cologne , germany .
the catholic church in germany has had a directive for the past eight years that urges prosecution in sex abuse cases , heckeley told deutsche welle .
" since 2002 we have a directive from the german bishops conference that says what you have to do in case sexual abuse is suspected , " heckeley said .
people with complaints are referred to professionals - psychologists , doctors and legal experts - who are hired by each bishopric , and are qualified to advise people who want to come forward with sex abuse allegations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abuse allegedly took place at some german jesuit schools " our aim is to listen to the victims and help them get justice , even when the cases are years or decades old .
they need somebody to listen to them , and the most important thing is that they get justice , " he said .
the response from the church will differ case by case , but the church " urgently advises " victims to take perpetrators to court .
unfortunately , heckeley said , victims often do n't want to do this because it can be too upsetting to their families , and " can destroy their entire social environment - it can traumatize them a second time .
you have to be careful . "
prosecution is a right , not an obligation while there is a right to prosecute , there is no obligation to do so - a situation that is currently under hot debate .
still , heckeley said experts recommend caution , since " the dangers -lrb- of forced prosecution -rrb- could outweigh the risks . "
no matter what shape the case takes in federal court , allegations of abuse are always looked into by a church tribunal out of rome .
yet in the murphy case , ratzinger 's deputy at the time advised a secret disciplinary trial at first .
he later reversed that decision , and in 1998 , murphy appealed directly to ratzinger for clemency , shortly before he died .
all the calls for openness , trials and apologies are well and good , victims-rights advocates say , but they do n't go far enough .
what is missing on the part of the church is a departure from the secrecy , and a willingness to admit its own cover-ups .
last week , following revelations of pedophilia that rocked the irish catholic church , the pope issued a long-awaited apology to victims of child sex abuse in ireland .
he acknowledged " serious mistakes " on the part of the church , as well as the sense of betrayal in the church felt by victims and their families .
victims ' groups start protests but irish victims ' groups felt that the apology fell short of their demands ; they called for the church to acknowledge its role in covering up abuse .
maeve lewis , executive director of irish victims ' rights group one in four , told bbc news , " we are really disappointed that there is no acknowledgement that the cover-up and the policy of cover-up in the church went right to the the vatican . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope finally addressed the cases of abuse in ireland and in germany , victims-rights advocates were incensed that the apology failed to mention cases of church pedophilia in munich that have dominated headlines for weeks .
the church has had to contend with cover-up allegations in that city while ratzinger was the city 's archbishop from 1977 to 1981 .
on thursday members of the us activist organization snap - survivor network of those abused by priests - launched a demonstration in the vatican , holding up signs that said " stop the secrecy now . "
they demanded that pope benedict open up all files on pedophile catholic clerics worldwide , and called for all " predator priests " to be defrocked .
the group has also protested in germany , austria , and the netherlands , all countries recently hit by church sex abuse scandals .
one official 's stance " i would ask the pope if he would please open up the files from the congregation of the doctrine of the faith and turn over all the information to the police , " barbara blaine , the president of snap , told reuters news service .
a trickle of acknowledgements have begun , and some say a wave may be coming .
earlier this month , the german church 's representative responsible for dealing with cases of abuse , bishop stephan ackermann , also acknowledged severe failures .
" where there was no will toward explanation and where the person who committed the crime was simply moved to a new post , we have to admit , in a whole array of cases , that there was a cover-up , " he told the rhein zeitung newspaper .
and this week , german news magazine focus reported that archbishop zollitsch , the leader of the german roman catholic church , also admitted cases of child sex abuse were known and covered up .
" yes , we did have that , " he said .
many see the catholic church as so damaged by these allegations that it will be hard for the institution to regain its footing .
" we can only survive this situation with openness and honesty , " says the cologne archbishopric 's heckeley .
" we have to try to win people 's trust that way . "

murphy worked from 1950 to 1977 at a school for the deaf and died in 1998 .
a spokesman for the vatican , federico lombardi , argued that rome was n't informed of the case until 20 years after it happened , and said that in the end the church did n't take action against murphy because he had confessed the acts and because he was very ill and close to the end of his life .
records uncovered by the times show that three different bishops were aware of the accusations , but that the case was not brought to trial .
still , lombardi told news service reuters that the church is eager to see abusive priests brought to justice .
church calls in professional help this is a feeling shared by christoph heckeley , a spokesman for the archbishopric of cologne , germany .
the catholic church in germany has had a directive for the past eight years that urges prosecution in sex abuse cases , heckeley told deutsche welle .
" since 2002 we have a directive from the german bishops conference that says what you have to do in case sexual abuse is suspected , " heckeley said .
people with complaints are referred to professionals - psychologists , doctors and legal experts - who are hired by each bishopric , and are qualified to advise people who want to come forward with sex abuse allegations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abuse allegedly took place at some german jesuit schools " our aim is to listen to the victims and help them get justice , even when the cases are years or decades old .
they need somebody to listen to them , and the most important thing is that they get justice , " he said .
the response from the church will differ case by case , but the church " urgently advises " victims to take perpetrators to court .
unfortunately , heckeley said , victims often do n't want to do this because it can be too upsetting to their families , and " can destroy their entire social environment - it can traumatize them a second time .
you have to be careful . "
prosecution is a right , not an obligation while there is a right to prosecute , there is no obligation to do so - a situation that is currently under hot debate .
still , heckeley said experts recommend caution , since " the dangers -lrb- of forced prosecution -rrb- could outweigh the risks . "
no matter what shape the case takes in federal court , allegations of abuse are always looked into by a church tribunal out of rome .
yet in the murphy case , ratzinger 's deputy at the time advised a secret disciplinary trial at first .
he later reversed that decision , and in 1998 , murphy appealed directly to ratzinger for clemency , shortly before he died .
all the calls for openness , trials and apologies are well and good , victims-rights advocates say , but they do n't go far enough .
what is missing on the part of the church is a departure from the secrecy , and a willingness to admit its own cover-ups .
last week , following revelations of pedophilia that rocked the irish catholic church , the pope issued a long-awaited apology to victims of child sex abuse in ireland .
he acknowledged " serious mistakes " on the part of the church , as well as the sense of betrayal in the church felt by victims and their families .
victims ' groups start protests but irish victims ' groups felt that the apology fell short of their demands ; they called for the church to acknowledge its role in covering up abuse .
maeve lewis , executive director of irish victims ' rights group one in four , told bbc news , " we are really disappointed that there is no acknowledgement that the cover-up and the policy of cover-up in the church went right to the the vatican . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope finally addressed the cases of abuse in ireland and in germany , victims-rights advocates were incensed that the apology failed to mention cases of church pedophilia in munich that have dominated headlines for weeks .
the church has had to contend with cover-up allegations in that city while ratzinger was the city 's archbishop from 1977 to 1981 .
on thursday members of the us activist organization snap - survivor network of those abused by priests - launched a demonstration in the vatican , holding up signs that said " stop the secrecy now . "
they demanded that pope benedict open up all files on pedophile catholic clerics worldwide , and called for all " predator priests " to be defrocked .
the group has also protested in germany , austria , and the netherlands , all countries recently hit by church sex abuse scandals .
one official 's stance " i would ask the pope if he would please open up the files from the congregation of the doctrine of the faith and turn over all the information to the police , " barbara blaine , the president of snap , told reuters news service .
a trickle of acknowledgements have begun , and some say a wave may be coming .
earlier this month , the german church 's representative responsible for dealing with cases of abuse , bishop stephan ackermann , also acknowledged severe failures .
" where there was no will toward explanation and where the person who committed the crime was simply moved to a new post , we have to admit , in a whole array of cases , that there was a cover-up , " he told the rhein zeitung newspaper .
and this week , german news magazine focus reported that archbishop zollitsch , the leader of the german roman catholic church , also admitted cases of child sex abuse were known and covered up .
" yes , we did have that , " he said .
many see the catholic church as so damaged by these allegations that it will be hard for the institution to regain its footing .
" we can only survive this situation with openness and honesty , " says the cologne archbishopric 's heckeley .
" we have to try to win people 's trust that way . "

meanwhile , activists say the church should take more responsibility for its wayward leaders .
either way , the situation surrounding sexual abuse scandals in the catholic church is like a modern-day hydra myth - no sooner is one scandal addressed than another rises up to take its place .
with europe 's catholics still reeling from a series of alleged child-molestation cover-ups , news broke in the united states of a 1996 case that touches the upper echelons of church power .
failure to defrock in the latest case to hit headlines , the new york times reported on thursday that pope benedict xvi ignored allegations of child sex abuse back in the 1990s .
at the time , he was head of the congregation of the doctrine of the faith , the vatican body that judges cases of sexual abuse .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de research -pipe- 25.03.2010 german researchers decode unrecognized dna from ancient humanoid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists analyzed dna from a fossil finger found in siberia when researchers discovered a fossil finger in a siberian cave , they found an ancestor - and perhaps a new human species .
johannes krause told deutsche welle about his team 's efforts to analyze the ancient dna . the new report was published on the website of science journal " nature " on march 24 .
leipzig researchers johannes krause and svante pääbo of the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology co-authored the international project . deutsche welle : how did you find a bone fragment from the altai mountains ?
johannes krause : for several years , we 've been involved in a very productive collaboration with our colleagues in russia .
we received bones from them that we later identified as neanderthal bones , for example , thus showing that neanderthals lived in southern siberia , too - not just in europe .
and in recent years , we 've received other bone samples for genetic testing .
here in leipzig , we 've taken our neanderthal research to the genetic level , so we 've been examining the dna of ancient man -lrb- ... -rrb- to help us learn how prehistoric man is related to modern-day man or other forms of early man . the neaderthal has their own dna at least for portions of the genome , so they are n't our direct ancestors ; they 're more an extinct cousin of sorts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dna analysis of homonid species could shed light on their ties to modern man and during our search for new neanderthal bones , we stumbled upon these bones with dna that belonged neither to neanderthals nor modern man .
it constitutes a new form of prehistoric man that had never been discovered - something we had never seen from a genetic standpoint and that we could n't categorize as an existing form of prehistoric man .
everyone 's calling this a sensation - would you call it that ?
i think it 's a sensation because until now we had the potential to do genetic research on two different forms of man - now there 's a third .
so that 's pretty sensational , particularly as it ca n't be classified according to any existing form of prehistoric man .
unfortunately , we do n't have a complete skeleton - just the bone from a pinkie finger .
it 's a tiny fragment that ca n't tell us much about the morphology .
therefore we still do n't know what this prehistoric man looked like - did he perhaps look like a neanderthal , modern man or a homo erectus ?
so we lack quite a lot of information , but we now have the potential to study the dna of this prehistoric man ; we have the potential to examine the entire genome and genetic material from this prehistoric man and compare it to modern man and the neanderthals , for instance .
and through that , we can learn a lot .
for example , what kind of interactions occurred between these three species of prehistoric man ?
we could also show that they lived in the same place at the same time - that 's another sensation for us .
that means , we find neanderthal bones in a nearby cave , and in same layer in which we found the bones of the new human form , we find archaeological artifacts that appear to have come from modern man - ornaments and jewelry that are only associated with modern man .
so it looks as though these three forms of early man lived in the same place at the same time .
you can then imagine any number of scenarios where gene flow could have occurred between these three populations , and that is certainly something that 's very interesting to analyze on a genetic level .
is finding something like this an anthropologist 's dream come true ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian researchers discovered the fossil bone at a site in the altai mountains in siberia yes , this is probably a once-in-a-lifetime chance - discovering a new species or form of prehistoric man .
it 's certainly quite exciting for us .
of course , we should note that we 're not calling it a new species - we 're only talking about a new " form . "
so far , we 've only analyzed a tiny portion of the dna , and only when the entire genome or a large part of the genome has been analyzed will we be able to tell whether it 's something completely new or different , like modern man or the neanderthals , for instance .
and until then , we 're not going to talk about a new species .
but all signs indicate that we 're actually dealing with an entirely knew species of man here .
then what do you know already ; whose bones are they ?
so far , we can only say that this dna - the dna we 've studied so far from this prehistoric man - has about 1 million years between it and the dna of modern man .
so that means that these two forms , modern man and prehistoric man , spent at least 1 million years developing in very different ways .
based on our genetic tests , we can also say that modern man is more closely related to the neanderthals than he is to this new form of prehistoric man - we 're seeing two times as many differences between the dna of modern man and this new form than we do with modern man and the neanderthals .
this represents a completely different line that split off from modern man much earlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mitochondrial dna decoding showed differences between the ancestor and modern man do you know if it was a woman or a man ?
we 've named it " x woman . "
" x " stands for the unknown , since we ca n't classify it so easiliy , as i 'd mentioned . and " woman " because we examined the mitochondrial dna - the dna from the powerhouse of the cell - and that 's always passed down from the mother to the child .
so we 're looking at the female lineage , and so we adopted a feministic position .
but since we have yet to examine the entire genetic material , we still do n't know whether it 's a man or a woman .
and this process for examining the mitochrondrial dna - that 's something you developed ?
yes , my boss svante pääbo studied mitochrondrial dna from prehistoric man for the first time in the ' 90s - at the time , from neanderthals .
in recent years , we have refined these methods to help us obtain more information more quickly - and of a higher qualitative value .
but we 've really kicked this kind of research into high gear in recent years .
what 's next ?
what else do you plan to study - and what do you hope to find ?
we plan to study the entire genome - this prehistoric man 's entire genetic material .
we do n't just want to look at this tiny fraction , rather we will examine the entire genome to learn more about this prehistoric man and to see how he was related to modern man and to neanderthals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the neanderthals share many commonalities with modern man was there potential gene flow between these three populations ?
and what can we learn about phenotypical features - what color hair did he have ?
we 'll look at other kinds of features that we can reconstruct based on dna sequencing .
and who gets to keep the bone once you conclude your research ? whatever 's left of the bone will certainly be sent back to novosibirsk , to the museum responsible for the entire excavation .
that said , it 's not a spectacular bone - it 's only as large as cherry pit .
so it 's a very tiny fragment and it might not be all that interesting to look at .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian researchers discovered the fossil bone at a site in the altai mountains in siberia yes , this is probably a once-in-a-lifetime chance - discovering a new species or form of prehistoric man .
it 's certainly quite exciting for us .
of course , we should note that we 're not calling it a new species - we 're only talking about a new " form . "
so far , we 've only analyzed a tiny portion of the dna , and only when the entire genome or a large part of the genome has been analyzed will we be able to tell whether it 's something completely new or different , like modern man or the neanderthals , for instance .
and until then , we 're not going to talk about a new species .
but all signs indicate that we 're actually dealing with an entirely knew species of man here .
then what do you know already ; whose bones are they ?
so far , we can only say that this dna - the dna we 've studied so far from this prehistoric man - has about 1 million years between it and the dna of modern man .
so that means that these two forms , modern man and prehistoric man , spent at least 1 million years developing in very different ways .
based on our genetic tests , we can also say that modern man is more closely related to the neanderthals than he is to this new form of prehistoric man - we 're seeing two times as many differences between the dna of modern man and this new form than we do with modern man and the neanderthals .
this represents a completely different line that split off from modern man much earlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mitochondrial dna decoding showed differences between the ancestor and modern man do you know if it was a woman or a man ?
we 've named it " x woman . "
" x " stands for the unknown , since we ca n't classify it so easiliy , as i 'd mentioned . and " woman " because we examined the mitochondrial dna - the dna from the powerhouse of the cell - and that 's always passed down from the mother to the child .
so we 're looking at the female lineage , and so we adopted a feministic position .
but since we have yet to examine the entire genetic material , we still do n't know whether it 's a man or a woman .
and this process for examining the mitochrondrial dna - that 's something you developed ?
yes , my boss svante pääbo studied mitochrondrial dna from prehistoric man for the first time in the ' 90s - at the time , from neanderthals .
in recent years , we have refined these methods to help us obtain more information more quickly - and of a higher qualitative value .
but we 've really kicked this kind of research into high gear in recent years .
what 's next ?
what else do you plan to study - and what do you hope to find ?
we plan to study the entire genome - this prehistoric man 's entire genetic material .
we do n't just want to look at this tiny fraction , rather we will examine the entire genome to learn more about this prehistoric man and to see how he was related to modern man and to neanderthals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the neanderthals share many commonalities with modern man was there potential gene flow between these three populations ?
and what can we learn about phenotypical features - what color hair did he have ?
we 'll look at other kinds of features that we can reconstruct based on dna sequencing .
and who gets to keep the bone once you conclude your research ? whatever 's left of the bone will certainly be sent back to novosibirsk , to the museum responsible for the entire excavation .
that said , it 's not a spectacular bone - it 's only as large as cherry pit .
so it 's a very tiny fragment and it might not be all that interesting to look at .

johannes krause told deutsche welle about his team 's efforts to analyze the ancient dna . the new report was published on the website of science journal " nature " on march 24 .
leipzig researchers johannes krause and svante pääbo of the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology co-authored the international project . deutsche welle : how did you find a bone fragment from the altai mountains ?
johannes krause : for several years , we 've been involved in a very productive collaboration with our colleagues in russia .
we received bones from them that we later identified as neanderthal bones , for example , thus showing that neanderthals lived in southern siberia , too - not just in europe .
and in recent years , we 've received other bone samples for genetic testing .
here in leipzig , we 've taken our neanderthal research to the genetic level , so we 've been examining the dna of ancient man -lrb- ... -rrb- to help us learn how prehistoric man is related to modern-day man or other forms of early man . the neaderthal has their own dna at least for portions of the genome , so they are n't our direct ancestors ; they 're more an extinct cousin of sorts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dna analysis of homonid species could shed light on their ties to modern man and during our search for new neanderthal bones , we stumbled upon these bones with dna that belonged neither to neanderthals nor modern man .
it constitutes a new form of prehistoric man that had never been discovered - something we had never seen from a genetic standpoint and that we could n't categorize as an existing form of prehistoric man .
everyone 's calling this a sensation - would you call it that ?
i think it 's a sensation because until now we had the potential to do genetic research on two different forms of man - now there 's a third .
so that 's pretty sensational , particularly as it ca n't be classified according to any existing form of prehistoric man .
unfortunately , we do n't have a complete skeleton - just the bone from a pinkie finger .
it 's a tiny fragment that ca n't tell us much about the morphology .
therefore we still do n't know what this prehistoric man looked like - did he perhaps look like a neanderthal , modern man or a homo erectus ?
so we lack quite a lot of information , but we now have the potential to study the dna of this prehistoric man ; we have the potential to examine the entire genome and genetic material from this prehistoric man and compare it to modern man and the neanderthals , for instance .
and through that , we can learn a lot .
for example , what kind of interactions occurred between these three species of prehistoric man ?
we could also show that they lived in the same place at the same time - that 's another sensation for us .
that means , we find neanderthal bones in a nearby cave , and in same layer in which we found the bones of the new human form , we find archaeological artifacts that appear to have come from modern man - ornaments and jewelry that are only associated with modern man .
so it looks as though these three forms of early man lived in the same place at the same time .
you can then imagine any number of scenarios where gene flow could have occurred between these three populations , and that is certainly something that 's very interesting to analyze on a genetic level .

many victims still find it difficult to talk about their experiences .
the transcultural psycho-social organization cambodia provides them with therapy . monks in orange robes are reciting prayers .
a group of men and women is sitting in front of them .
their heads are bowed and some are crying .
they are in a temple in the killing fields , not far from the cambodian capital of phnom penh . 17,000 were killed in this place alone under the khmer rouge regime that lasted from 1975 to 1979 .
those praying survived .
they are taking part in a therapy course that is run by the transcultural psycho-social organization cambodia -lrb- tpo -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 20,000 people were detained , tortured and killed in tuol sleng prison " it felt like i was in hell " one of the participants , sam rithy , was arrested and tortured in prison .
the khmer rouge , which wanted to establish a classless society , thought that he needed to be rid of his " bourgeois side " since he lived in the city . " they hit me with a weapon until i was unconscious .
they killed innocent children in jail and let children starve to death .
it felt like i was in hell .
i never thought i would survive , " he recalls . the method that the tpo uses – testimonial therapy – was developed in chile after the dictatorship fell .
participants work through their experiences of torture , war and human rights abuses , with qualified therapists . sleep problems and depression sam rithy has problems sleeping and im sam at is depressed .
the two are sitting in a cafe in pnomh penh , speaking about their experiences .
im sam at is massaging her forehead : " i think about the past too much , " she says .
" my husband was executed .
i was a widow at 22 .
i lost my children and my mother .
i feel very very lonely . " it is part of the therapy to write down memories and try to piece fragments together .
participants then go back to the killing fields together but only after they have been " debriefed " , explains sarat youn , one of the tpo ’ s therapists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least two million people are thought to have died under the khmer rouge , through execution , illness or starvation " we tell them that this place is not a good place to visit and will remind them of really bad past experiences .
we tell them that if they need to cry , they should .
they should not keep it in but should release their pain . " religious ceremony helps release pain and suffering in the final ceremony , the therapists read out the stories of each person .
sam rithy seems calm and composed as sarat youn reads his story .
he nods over and over again . sam rithy then gives the document to the head monk , who blesses it .
the monk then wraps a red band around sam rithy ’ s wrist . sarat youn explains that the religious ceremony can help victims release their pain and find peace .
the monks relieve the victims of suffering and memories that they have kept deep within themselves for years by taking the documents and blessing them . those who have gone through the therapy say that they feel more hope and energy afterwards . author : nina ritter / act editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de research -pipe- 25.03.2010 german researchers decode unrecognized dna from ancient humanoid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists analyzed dna from a fossil finger found in siberia when researchers discovered a fossil finger in a siberian cave , they found an ancestor - and perhaps a new human species .
johannes krause told deutsche welle about his team 's efforts to analyze the ancient dna . the new report was published on the website of science journal " nature " on march 24 .
leipzig researchers johannes krause and svante pääbo of the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology co-authored the international project . deutsche welle : how did you find a bone fragment from the altai mountains ?
johannes krause : for several years , we 've been involved in a very productive collaboration with our colleagues in russia .
we received bones from them that we later identified as neanderthal bones , for example , thus showing that neanderthals lived in southern siberia , too - not just in europe .
and in recent years , we 've received other bone samples for genetic testing .
here in leipzig , we 've taken our neanderthal research to the genetic level , so we 've been examining the dna of ancient man -lrb- ... -rrb- to help us learn how prehistoric man is related to modern-day man or other forms of early man . the neaderthal has their own dna at least for portions of the genome , so they are n't our direct ancestors ; they 're more an extinct cousin of sorts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dna analysis of homonid species could shed light on their ties to modern man and during our search for new neanderthal bones , we stumbled upon these bones with dna that belonged neither to neanderthals nor modern man .
it constitutes a new form of prehistoric man that had never been discovered - something we had never seen from a genetic standpoint and that we could n't categorize as an existing form of prehistoric man .
everyone 's calling this a sensation - would you call it that ?
i think it 's a sensation because until now we had the potential to do genetic research on two different forms of man - now there 's a third .
so that 's pretty sensational , particularly as it ca n't be classified according to any existing form of prehistoric man .
unfortunately , we do n't have a complete skeleton - just the bone from a pinkie finger .
it 's a tiny fragment that ca n't tell us much about the morphology .
therefore we still do n't know what this prehistoric man looked like - did he perhaps look like a neanderthal , modern man or a homo erectus ?
so we lack quite a lot of information , but we now have the potential to study the dna of this prehistoric man ; we have the potential to examine the entire genome and genetic material from this prehistoric man and compare it to modern man and the neanderthals , for instance .
and through that , we can learn a lot .
for example , what kind of interactions occurred between these three species of prehistoric man ?
we could also show that they lived in the same place at the same time - that 's another sensation for us .
that means , we find neanderthal bones in a nearby cave , and in same layer in which we found the bones of the new human form , we find archaeological artifacts that appear to have come from modern man - ornaments and jewelry that are only associated with modern man .
so it looks as though these three forms of early man lived in the same place at the same time .
you can then imagine any number of scenarios where gene flow could have occurred between these three populations , and that is certainly something that 's very interesting to analyze on a genetic level .
is finding something like this an anthropologist 's dream come true ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian researchers discovered the fossil bone at a site in the altai mountains in siberia yes , this is probably a once-in-a-lifetime chance - discovering a new species or form of prehistoric man .
it 's certainly quite exciting for us .
of course , we should note that we 're not calling it a new species - we 're only talking about a new " form . "
so far , we 've only analyzed a tiny portion of the dna , and only when the entire genome or a large part of the genome has been analyzed will we be able to tell whether it 's something completely new or different , like modern man or the neanderthals , for instance .
and until then , we 're not going to talk about a new species .
but all signs indicate that we 're actually dealing with an entirely knew species of man here .
then what do you know already ; whose bones are they ?
so far , we can only say that this dna - the dna we 've studied so far from this prehistoric man - has about 1 million years between it and the dna of modern man .
so that means that these two forms , modern man and prehistoric man , spent at least 1 million years developing in very different ways .
based on our genetic tests , we can also say that modern man is more closely related to the neanderthals than he is to this new form of prehistoric man - we 're seeing two times as many differences between the dna of modern man and this new form than we do with modern man and the neanderthals .
this represents a completely different line that split off from modern man much earlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mitochondrial dna decoding showed differences between the ancestor and modern man do you know if it was a woman or a man ?
we 've named it " x woman . "
" x " stands for the unknown , since we ca n't classify it so easiliy , as i 'd mentioned . and " woman " because we examined the mitochondrial dna - the dna from the powerhouse of the cell - and that 's always passed down from the mother to the child .
so we 're looking at the female lineage , and so we adopted a feministic position .
but since we have yet to examine the entire genetic material , we still do n't know whether it 's a man or a woman .
and this process for examining the mitochrondrial dna - that 's something you developed ?
yes , my boss svante pääbo studied mitochrondrial dna from prehistoric man for the first time in the ' 90s - at the time , from neanderthals .
in recent years , we have refined these methods to help us obtain more information more quickly - and of a higher qualitative value .
but we 've really kicked this kind of research into high gear in recent years .
what 's next ?
what else do you plan to study - and what do you hope to find ?
we plan to study the entire genome - this prehistoric man 's entire genetic material .
we do n't just want to look at this tiny fraction , rather we will examine the entire genome to learn more about this prehistoric man and to see how he was related to modern man and to neanderthals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the neanderthals share many commonalities with modern man was there potential gene flow between these three populations ?
and what can we learn about phenotypical features - what color hair did he have ?
we 'll look at other kinds of features that we can reconstruct based on dna sequencing .
and who gets to keep the bone once you conclude your research ? whatever 's left of the bone will certainly be sent back to novosibirsk , to the museum responsible for the entire excavation .
that said , it 's not a spectacular bone - it 's only as large as cherry pit .
so it 's a very tiny fragment and it might not be all that interesting to look at .

experts in kolkata on thursday said fishermen had confirmed this . the tiny island , which was about 3.5 kilometers long and 3 kilometers wide , was claimed by both bangladesh and india .
it had been a bone of contention between the two countries since the 1970s .
sugata hazra from the school of oceanographic studies at kolkata 's jadavpur university from the school of oceanographic studies said that " global warming and erosion were responsible for solving this point in the sometimes fractious relations between bangladesh and india . "
created by a cyclone , sunk by climage change the original source of the dispute in the sundarbans mangrove delta is thought to have been created by a cyclone only about 40 years ago .
the indian navy planted its national flag there in 1981 but there was never any permanent settlement despite years of negotiations .
hazra said that he believed the island had vanished in 1990 .
he added that lohachara , a larger island in the bay of bengal had also disappeared in 1996 , shortly after its 4,000 inhabitants fled .

they killed innocent children in jail and let children starve to death .
it felt like i was in hell .

" my husband was executed .
i was a widow at 22 .
i lost my children and my mother .
i feel very very lonely . " it is part of the therapy to write down memories and try to piece fragments together .

we tell them that if they need to cry , they should .
they should not keep it in but should release their pain . " religious ceremony helps release pain and suffering in the final ceremony , the therapists read out the stories of each person .
sam rithy seems calm and composed as sarat youn reads his story .
he nods over and over again . sam rithy then gives the document to the head monk , who blesses it .
the monk then wraps a red band around sam rithy ’ s wrist . sarat youn explains that the religious ceremony can help victims release their pain and find peace .
