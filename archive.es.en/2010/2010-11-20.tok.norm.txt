successful in sentencing a group of key personalities of the nazi party , they inspired a series of further trials all aimed at punishing the war criminals of the third reich . the trials , which began on november 20 , 1945 , in the bavarian city of nuremberg , were a new type of event on the world stage .
it was the first time an international tribunal had sought to sentence the leaders of a regime - politicians , army officers and economic advisors - even though in some cases direct responsibility for specific criminal acts could not be attributed to them . as a group , they were seen as initiators , aides , organizers and executers of crimes against humanity .
they were accused of orchestrating wars of aggression , murdering civilians and prisoners of war , deporting people , plundering , engaging in racial persecution , murdering european jews and occupying numerous european countries . however , all these accusations had little impact on the nazis in the courtroom , who did not see themselves as responsible for the listed crimes .
not a single one plead guilty . a combined international effort the judges for the trials came from the united states , the soviet union , france and great britain and were appointed by their governments for this role . the chief prosecutor was robert jackson from the united states , and his assistant chief counsel was german-jewish lawyer robert kempner , who had been stripped of his german citizenship by the nazis before world war ii and had immigrated to the united states .
" when i began to work on this matter in america in 1942 , my american colleagues asked me , ' is this all true ?
can we prove it ? " ' recalled kempner .
" and i said , ' we can prove this 100 percent . " '
the trials lasted 218 days , with 236 witnesses questioned , 5,330 documents and 200,000 statements submitted as evidence and 25,000 pages of protocol written .
the hearings shed light on the dimensions of the nazi regime 's crimes . the verdicts came out on september 30 and october 1 , 1946 : seven imprisonments , 12 death sentences and three acquittals . bildunterschrift : the 218 days of trials produced various sentences and 25,000 pages of protocol inspiration for further trials the first round of trials was followed by 12 others .
these were aimed at nazi medical doctors , lawyers , soldiers and even companies such as flick - an industrial conglomerate that supported the nazi party .
flick profited from the liquidation of jewish property , assisted hitler 's rearmament efforts and used slave laborers from concentration camps .
the german population and its attitude towards the nazi era were largely unaffected by the trials .
they were seen as an arbitrary act of the winning side and it was not long before the government of the newly-formed federal republic of germany , together with party and church representatives , pleaded for clemency on behalf of the convicted persons . some death sentences were turned into prison sentences , and there were some early releases .
some of the accused got the chance to resume their interrupted careers .
despite some of these sentences being overturned , the trials left a lasting impression on the world . the creation of the international military tribunal has served as a model for other tribunals , including the hague in the netherlands - for trying crimes committed during the balkan wars - and the international military tribunal for the far east , which tried japanese officials for crimes against peace and against humanity . the trials also significantly influenced the development of international criminal law , serving as models for conventions such as the 1948 convention on genocide . author : cornelia rabitz / ew editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chancellor merkel has said this would mark the definitive end of the cold war . nato leaders sought to entice russia into collaborating on a missile defense shield at the alliance 's annual summit in lisbon , ahead of russian president dmitry medvedev 's arrival on saturday .
" missile defense will bind the nato allies closer together , " nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen , who visited moscow earlier this month , said at the summit .
" by reaching out and inviting russia to cooperate with us , i believe we also have a real chance to build a security roof for the entire euro-atlantic area . "
initial plans for a missile defense shield in eastern europe , led by the us , were met with considerable skepticism in moscow , with the kremlin often questioning whether the new network was designed to deal with potential attacks from countries like iran , or to target russia .
however , the russian stance has softened of late , with medvedev recently calling on nato to offer more concrete details on how a cooperative program might work .
" the fact that we are talking to russia about common threats and the chance to cooperate with russia on missile defense is an extremely important step , " german chancellor angela merkel said .
" that could be proof that the cold war has finally come to an end . "
us president barack obama also hailed the progress made on the defense shield , saying the planned network would be " strong enough to cover all nato european territory and populations , and the united states . "
a suggestion to tie the missile shield to nuclear disarmament by german foreign minister guido westerwelle , who wants the remaining us nuclear warheads stationed in germany removed as quickly as possible , was rebuffed by nuclear powers like the us and france , who argued that europe still needs a nuclear deterrent for the foreseeable future .
strategic concept for digital age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says the lisbon summit will go down in nato history nato leaders also settled on a new 10-year strategic concept for the 21st century , updating their last deal from 1999 .
" this summit will go down in nato history , " merkel said .
" the strategic concept is clear and open , and it shows that we are all working on the same foundation . "
the text of the new deal repeats the alliance 's core commitment for each member state to defend all the others , but is also meant to guide the 28 countries as they reform their armed forces and plan more joint operations over the next decade .
the alliance said it was trying to adapt to face more modern dangers to global security , with rasmussen mentioning threats like cyber attacks , terrorism and the political and social instability that can spill over from failing states .
" weak states halfway across the globe can have a direct impact on our security , " rasmussen said .
" they can be breeding grounds for terrorism , for drugs , for trafficking of weapons or people .
and afghanistan is an obvious case in point . "
the new strategic concept also called for closer cooperation with " any nations and relevant organizations across the globe that share our interest in peaceful international relations , " a statement apparently aimed in no small part at the european union .
nato and the eu have particularly fraught ties - despite an overwhelming overlap in terms of membership - because of the long-standing impasse between turkey , a nato member , and cyprus , an eu member , who trade vetoes on any proposals for greater cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai is in lisbon for tough talks afghanistan handover still slated for 2014 as nato members suffer increasing military losses in afghanistan , the alliance reiterated its desire to hand over security responsibilities to the administration in kabul by 2014 , amid claims from some nato and pentagon officials that this target might not be attainable .
" i see a role for troops after 2014 , but with a focus on training security forces , " rasmussen said .
the nato secretary general said the transition process would begin next year , and that he considered the 2014 deadline " realistic . "
president obama is set to have private talks with his afghan counterpart hamid karzai at the lisbon summit on saturday , after a period of rather tense relations between the two administrations .
obama has also called for a move towards reconciliation with parts of the taliban in the country , as nato forces struggle to make inroads against the insurgency there .
germany is the third largest contributor to the mission in afghanistan , although most polls show the engagement is unpopular among the german public .
the two-day summit in lisbon is set to close on saturday evening .
local security forces in the portuguese capital have been on high alert over fears of protests or demonstrations , but the atmosphere so far in the city has been largely calm .

chancellor merkel has said this would mark the definitive end of the cold war . nato leaders sought to entice russia into collaborating on a missile defense shield at the alliance 's annual summit in lisbon , ahead of russian president dmitry medvedev 's arrival on saturday .
" missile defense will bind the nato allies closer together , " nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen , who visited moscow earlier this month , said at the summit .
" by reaching out and inviting russia to cooperate with us , i believe we also have a real chance to build a security roof for the entire euro-atlantic area . "
initial plans for a missile defense shield in eastern europe , led by the us , were met with considerable skepticism in moscow , with the kremlin often questioning whether the new network was designed to deal with potential attacks from countries like iran , or to target russia .
however , the russian stance has softened of late , with medvedev recently calling on nato to offer more concrete details on how a cooperative program might work .
" the fact that we are talking to russia about common threats and the chance to cooperate with russia on missile defense is an extremely important step , " german chancellor angela merkel said .
" that could be proof that the cold war has finally come to an end . "
us president barack obama also hailed the progress made on the defense shield , saying the planned network would be " strong enough to cover all nato european territory and populations , and the united states . "
a suggestion to tie the missile shield to nuclear disarmament by german foreign minister guido westerwelle , who wants the remaining us nuclear warheads stationed in germany removed as quickly as possible , was rebuffed by nuclear powers like the us and france , who argued that europe still needs a nuclear deterrent for the foreseeable future .
strategic concept for digital age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says the lisbon summit will go down in nato history nato leaders also settled on a new 10-year strategic concept for the 21st century , updating their last deal from 1999 .
" this summit will go down in nato history , " merkel said .
" the strategic concept is clear and open , and it shows that we are all working on the same foundation . "
the text of the new deal repeats the alliance 's core commitment for each member state to defend all the others , but is also meant to guide the 28 countries as they reform their armed forces and plan more joint operations over the next decade .
the alliance said it was trying to adapt to face more modern dangers to global security , with rasmussen mentioning threats like cyber attacks , terrorism and the political and social instability that can spill over from failing states .
" weak states halfway across the globe can have a direct impact on our security , " rasmussen said .
" they can be breeding grounds for terrorism , for drugs , for trafficking of weapons or people .
and afghanistan is an obvious case in point . "
the new strategic concept also called for closer cooperation with " any nations and relevant organizations across the globe that share our interest in peaceful international relations , " a statement apparently aimed in no small part at the european union .
nato and the eu have particularly fraught ties - despite an overwhelming overlap in terms of membership - because of the long-standing impasse between turkey , a nato member , and cyprus , an eu member , who trade vetoes on any proposals for greater cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai is in lisbon for tough talks afghanistan handover still slated for 2014 as nato members suffer increasing military losses in afghanistan , the alliance reiterated its desire to hand over security responsibilities to the administration in kabul by 2014 , amid claims from some nato and pentagon officials that this target might not be attainable .
" i see a role for troops after 2014 , but with a focus on training security forces , " rasmussen said .
the nato secretary general said the transition process would begin next year , and that he considered the 2014 deadline " realistic . "
president obama is set to have private talks with his afghan counterpart hamid karzai at the lisbon summit on saturday , after a period of rather tense relations between the two administrations .
obama has also called for a move towards reconciliation with parts of the taliban in the country , as nato forces struggle to make inroads against the insurgency there .
germany is the third largest contributor to the mission in afghanistan , although most polls show the engagement is unpopular among the german public .
the two-day summit in lisbon is set to close on saturday evening .
local security forces in the portuguese capital have been on high alert over fears of protests or demonstrations , but the atmosphere so far in the city has been largely calm .

the german media and public are nearly as fascinated with the wedding of prince william and kate middleton as the british press is - almost surprisingly so for a european country with no royal court of its own . it did n't take long for the news of prince william and kate middleton 's engagement to spread .
as soon as the pair announced their plans on the morning of november 16 , a flurry of reports followed in the british media .
the international press soon caught up .
so why are the modern , information-oriented masses so fixated on the marriages of royal couples ?
after all , the wedding of sweden 's crown princess victoria to daniel westling on june 19 was reportedly watched by 1 billion people .
and why , for instance , are germans so interested in britain 's royalty ?
media expert jo grobel says it 's a simple matter of compensation .
" for one thing , in germany in particular there is still a slight desire and wistfulness with regards to royalty , " he told deutsche welle .
" seeing as how we no longer have our own royal court , we need the english to let us borrow a bit of theirs .
that way at least we have a kind of secondhand royal court . "
royal weddings also provide a contrast to the continuous news coverage of events such as crises , wars and catastrophes .
people want to see something positive in between , grobel says .
the british royal family carries with it a particular intrigue because it has been a source of inspiration for dramas and soap operas over generations .
the culminating dramatic stroke , of course , was the tragic demise of princess diana in 1997 .
" there is already speculation over whether or not kate middleton will be the next diana - whether or not she 'll also meet a tragic end .
in other words , it 's good entertainment , " grobel said .
fascination beyond national boundaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swedish royal wedding was watched by 1 billion people add in the fact that for the first time in 30 years , britain has an heir apparent who will marry - and to a non-royal at that - then one could almost see the royal family as an extraordinarily well-financed vehicle for manufacturing the sights and sounds the masses dream about .
" it has something to do with forming an identity , " grobel said .
" it has to do with the upkeep of tradition - even in those countries where the royal family is barely 200 years old .
we always imagine they 've been around forever .
that 's true in britain , but not in belgium or the netherlands . "
illusory or not , traditions grow around royal families and shape national identity in ways which elected politicians ca n't .
and that form of identity crosses national boundaries , too .
germans look to great britain and feel connected to an older form of european culture , something which plays a significant role as regional traditions change drastically .
according to grobel , people look for a basic paradox in royal weddings .
" even when it comes to royalty sometimes things get confusing , and it is n't always much better than in our homes and neighborhoods , " he said .
" both elements come together : the very everyday and banal , and the grandiose largesse of world history . "

"
the move may set back talks on visa-free travel , and germany has strongly criticized the move . from november , german citizens applying for a russian visa must now show a bank account statement , proof of earnings and the registration of a personal business or place of residence .
this is all meant to prove the applicant 's willingness to eventually leave russia and return home .
russian authorities cited the " principle of reciprocity " for the changes in requirements , as russian citizens must present similar certificates when applying for entry into the european union .
moscow has sought visa-free travel with the eu for years , and president dmitry medvedev has said russia could lift visa restrictions immediately .
" our country is ready to solve this problem - the problem is not ours , " he said .
at a russia-eu summit in rostov-on-don with european council president herman van rompuy and european commission president jose manuel barroso earlier this year , medvedev openly offered to end visa restrictions , hoping to accelerate negotiations .
now russia is hoping for a deadline on visa-free travel by the next russia-eu summit on december 12 in brussels .
little understanding germany belongs to those eu member states which support a gradual relaxation of visa restrictions with russia .
foreign minister guido westerwelle made that clear at a meeting with his russian counterpart sergei lavrov on november 1 , stipulating that there were still many details the eu had to clear up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev has told eu leaders russia is ready to drop visa requirements thus berlin has shown little understanding for the most recent tightening of visa restrictions , and the foreign ministry stated it would not accept the restrictions without protest .
the bundestag also criticized russia 's move , with parliamentarian marina schuster of the foreign affairs committee saying she was " surprised that russia has taken this step , " which moved the process backwards .
" the goal should be for both sides to make advances toward visa freedom - and lavrov and westerwelle also discussed this , " she told deutsche welle .
quid pro quo however , hans-henning schroeder from the german institute for international and security affairs said russia 's tightening of visa restrictions was a completely normal diplomatic step .
" the schengen zone makes certain demands of russian applicants for visas , and now russia is simply making the same demands , " he said , referring to europe 's border-free travel area .
this may be bothersome , he added , but it is not unusual .
schroeder said one should not assume that the tighter visa requirements would have consequences for negotiations on visa-free travel .
" there wo n't be visa-free travel without compromises , " he said .
" rather it 's a negotiation process , and the russian side has to bring bargaining power to the table . "
a host of questions must still be resolved , on issues like border security or readmission agreements .
schroeder said ultimately the schengen states will hope to ensure that any ending of visa restrictions will not turn into a liability .

successful in sentencing a group of key personalities of the nazi party , they inspired a series of further trials all aimed at punishing the war criminals of the third reich . the trials , which began on november 20 , 1945 , in the bavarian city of nuremberg , were a new type of event on the world stage .
it was the first time an international tribunal had sought to sentence the leaders of a regime - politicians , army officers and economic advisors - even though in some cases direct responsibility for specific criminal acts could not be attributed to them . as a group , they were seen as initiators , aides , organizers and executers of crimes against humanity .
they were accused of orchestrating wars of aggression , murdering civilians and prisoners of war , deporting people , plundering , engaging in racial persecution , murdering european jews and occupying numerous european countries . however , all these accusations had little impact on the nazis in the courtroom , who did not see themselves as responsible for the listed crimes .
not a single one plead guilty . a combined international effort the judges for the trials came from the united states , the soviet union , france and great britain and were appointed by their governments for this role . the chief prosecutor was robert jackson from the united states , and his assistant chief counsel was german-jewish lawyer robert kempner , who had been stripped of his german citizenship by the nazis before world war ii and had immigrated to the united states .
" when i began to work on this matter in america in 1942 , my american colleagues asked me , ' is this all true ?
can we prove it ? " ' recalled kempner .
" and i said , ' we can prove this 100 percent . " '
the trials lasted 218 days , with 236 witnesses questioned , 5,330 documents and 200,000 statements submitted as evidence and 25,000 pages of protocol written .
the hearings shed light on the dimensions of the nazi regime 's crimes . the verdicts came out on september 30 and october 1 , 1946 : seven imprisonments , 12 death sentences and three acquittals . bildunterschrift : the 218 days of trials produced various sentences and 25,000 pages of protocol inspiration for further trials the first round of trials was followed by 12 others .
these were aimed at nazi medical doctors , lawyers , soldiers and even companies such as flick - an industrial conglomerate that supported the nazi party .
flick profited from the liquidation of jewish property , assisted hitler 's rearmament efforts and used slave laborers from concentration camps .
the german population and its attitude towards the nazi era were largely unaffected by the trials .
they were seen as an arbitrary act of the winning side and it was not long before the government of the newly-formed federal republic of germany , together with party and church representatives , pleaded for clemency on behalf of the convicted persons . some death sentences were turned into prison sentences , and there were some early releases .
some of the accused got the chance to resume their interrupted careers .
despite some of these sentences being overturned , the trials left a lasting impression on the world . the creation of the international military tribunal has served as a model for other tribunals , including the hague in the netherlands - for trying crimes committed during the balkan wars - and the international military tribunal for the far east , which tried japanese officials for crimes against peace and against humanity . the trials also significantly influenced the development of international criminal law , serving as models for conventions such as the 1948 convention on genocide . author : cornelia rabitz / ew editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de travel -pipe- 20.11.2010 russia introduces stricter visa requirements for eu citizens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia cited the ' principle of reciprocity ' for the changes russia has tightened visa restrictions with eu citizens , citing the " principle of reciprocity . "
the move may set back talks on visa-free travel , and germany has strongly criticized the move . from november , german citizens applying for a russian visa must now show a bank account statement , proof of earnings and the registration of a personal business or place of residence .
this is all meant to prove the applicant 's willingness to eventually leave russia and return home .
russian authorities cited the " principle of reciprocity " for the changes in requirements , as russian citizens must present similar certificates when applying for entry into the european union .
moscow has sought visa-free travel with the eu for years , and president dmitry medvedev has said russia could lift visa restrictions immediately .
" our country is ready to solve this problem - the problem is not ours , " he said .
at a russia-eu summit in rostov-on-don with european council president herman van rompuy and european commission president jose manuel barroso earlier this year , medvedev openly offered to end visa restrictions , hoping to accelerate negotiations .
now russia is hoping for a deadline on visa-free travel by the next russia-eu summit on december 12 in brussels .
little understanding germany belongs to those eu member states which support a gradual relaxation of visa restrictions with russia .
foreign minister guido westerwelle made that clear at a meeting with his russian counterpart sergei lavrov on november 1 , stipulating that there were still many details the eu had to clear up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev has told eu leaders russia is ready to drop visa requirements thus berlin has shown little understanding for the most recent tightening of visa restrictions , and the foreign ministry stated it would not accept the restrictions without protest .
the bundestag also criticized russia 's move , with parliamentarian marina schuster of the foreign affairs committee saying she was " surprised that russia has taken this step , " which moved the process backwards .
" the goal should be for both sides to make advances toward visa freedom - and lavrov and westerwelle also discussed this , " she told deutsche welle .
quid pro quo however , hans-henning schroeder from the german institute for international and security affairs said russia 's tightening of visa restrictions was a completely normal diplomatic step .
" the schengen zone makes certain demands of russian applicants for visas , and now russia is simply making the same demands , " he said , referring to europe 's border-free travel area .
this may be bothersome , he added , but it is not unusual .
schroeder said one should not assume that the tighter visa requirements would have consequences for negotiations on visa-free travel .
" there wo n't be visa-free travel without compromises , " he said .
" rather it 's a negotiation process , and the russian side has to bring bargaining power to the table . "
a host of questions must still be resolved , on issues like border security or readmission agreements .
schroeder said ultimately the schengen states will hope to ensure that any ending of visa restrictions will not turn into a liability .

successful in sentencing a group of key personalities of the nazi party , they inspired a series of further trials all aimed at punishing the war criminals of the third reich . the trials , which began on november 20 , 1945 , in the bavarian city of nuremberg , were a new type of event on the world stage .
it was the first time an international tribunal had sought to sentence the leaders of a regime - politicians , army officers and economic advisors - even though in some cases direct responsibility for specific criminal acts could not be attributed to them . as a group , they were seen as initiators , aides , organizers and executers of crimes against humanity .
they were accused of orchestrating wars of aggression , murdering civilians and prisoners of war , deporting people , plundering , engaging in racial persecution , murdering european jews and occupying numerous european countries . however , all these accusations had little impact on the nazis in the courtroom , who did not see themselves as responsible for the listed crimes .
not a single one plead guilty . a combined international effort the judges for the trials came from the united states , the soviet union , france and great britain and were appointed by their governments for this role . the chief prosecutor was robert jackson from the united states , and his assistant chief counsel was german-jewish lawyer robert kempner , who had been stripped of his german citizenship by the nazis before world war ii and had immigrated to the united states .
" when i began to work on this matter in america in 1942 , my american colleagues asked me , ' is this all true ?
can we prove it ? " ' recalled kempner .
" and i said , ' we can prove this 100 percent . " '
the trials lasted 218 days , with 236 witnesses questioned , 5,330 documents and 200,000 statements submitted as evidence and 25,000 pages of protocol written .
the hearings shed light on the dimensions of the nazi regime 's crimes . the verdicts came out on september 30 and october 1 , 1946 : seven imprisonments , 12 death sentences and three acquittals . bildunterschrift : the 218 days of trials produced various sentences and 25,000 pages of protocol inspiration for further trials the first round of trials was followed by 12 others .
these were aimed at nazi medical doctors , lawyers , soldiers and even companies such as flick - an industrial conglomerate that supported the nazi party .
flick profited from the liquidation of jewish property , assisted hitler 's rearmament efforts and used slave laborers from concentration camps .
the german population and its attitude towards the nazi era were largely unaffected by the trials .
they were seen as an arbitrary act of the winning side and it was not long before the government of the newly-formed federal republic of germany , together with party and church representatives , pleaded for clemency on behalf of the convicted persons . some death sentences were turned into prison sentences , and there were some early releases .
some of the accused got the chance to resume their interrupted careers .
despite some of these sentences being overturned , the trials left a lasting impression on the world . the creation of the international military tribunal has served as a model for other tribunals , including the hague in the netherlands - for trying crimes committed during the balkan wars - and the international military tribunal for the far east , which tried japanese officials for crimes against peace and against humanity . the trials also significantly influenced the development of international criminal law , serving as models for conventions such as the 1948 convention on genocide . author : cornelia rabitz / ew editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" when i began to work on this matter in america in 1942 , my american colleagues asked me , ' is this all true ?
can we prove it ? " ' recalled kempner .
" and i said , ' we can prove this 100 percent . " '
the trials lasted 218 days , with 236 witnesses questioned , 5,330 documents and 200,000 statements submitted as evidence and 25,000 pages of protocol written .
the hearings shed light on the dimensions of the nazi regime 's crimes . the verdicts came out on september 30 and october 1 , 1946 : seven imprisonments , 12 death sentences and three acquittals . bildunterschrift : the 218 days of trials produced various sentences and 25,000 pages of protocol inspiration for further trials the first round of trials was followed by 12 others .
these were aimed at nazi medical doctors , lawyers , soldiers and even companies such as flick - an industrial conglomerate that supported the nazi party .
flick profited from the liquidation of jewish property , assisted hitler 's rearmament efforts and used slave laborers from concentration camps .
the german population and its attitude towards the nazi era were largely unaffected by the trials .
they were seen as an arbitrary act of the winning side and it was not long before the government of the newly-formed federal republic of germany , together with party and church representatives , pleaded for clemency on behalf of the convicted persons . some death sentences were turned into prison sentences , and there were some early releases .
some of the accused got the chance to resume their interrupted careers .
despite some of these sentences being overturned , the trials left a lasting impression on the world . the creation of the international military tribunal has served as a model for other tribunals , including the hague in the netherlands - for trying crimes committed during the balkan wars - and the international military tribunal for the far east , which tried japanese officials for crimes against peace and against humanity . the trials also significantly influenced the development of international criminal law , serving as models for conventions such as the 1948 convention on genocide . author : cornelia rabitz / ew editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , forces will remain in the most dangerous areas until 2014 , and likely stay in a supporting role beyond then . a timeline for the gradual withdrawal of foreign troops from afghanistan has been negotiated by nato nations during a meeting in lisbon .
the western allies met with afghanistan 's president hamid karzai to discuss an exit strategy for the 150,000-strong force .
according to an internal nato document , the nations approved a plan to start pulling out troops in early 2011 , with the first provinces expected to pass to afghan control by july .
however , combat forces are expected to remain in control of the most dangerous areas until 2014 , and stay in a supporting role well beyond that date .
‘ long-term partnership ' nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said they would not abandon afghanistan in its fight against the taliban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai wants the handover completed by the end of 2014 " if the enemies of afghanistan have the idea that they can just wait it out until we leave , they have the wrong idea .
we will stay as long as it takes to finish our job , " rasmussen said .
he added the idea is that the afghan government takes control of the country district by district .
this meant that not all of the 150,000 foreign troops now deployed in afghanistan would leave by the 2014 deadline .
rasmussen said the relationship between nato and afghanistan would be " a long-term partnership . "
wrangling on the eu budget meanwhile , on the sidelines of the nato lisbon summit , german chancellor angela merkel met with british prime minister david cameron and french president nicolas sarkozy to discuss the failed eu budget for 2011 .
the deadline for securing the budget for the coming year was missed due to a standoff between the european parliament and the governments of the 27 member states .
the three leaders came together on friday evening to work out a new proposal for the budget , which could be adopted at the next eu summit in mid-december .
the proposal suggests a rise in the budget of around 3 percent , to take it to 123 billion euros -lrb- $ 168.4 billion -rrb- .
under the terms of the lisbon treaty , if a new budget is not finalized , the budget is frozen at 2010 levels , which will threaten the development of new projects such as the european external action service .

chancellor merkel has said this would mark the definitive end of the cold war . nato leaders sought to entice russia into collaborating on a missile defense shield at the alliance 's annual summit in lisbon , ahead of russian president dmitry medvedev 's arrival on saturday .
" missile defense will bind the nato allies closer together , " nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen , who visited moscow earlier this month , said at the summit .
" by reaching out and inviting russia to cooperate with us , i believe we also have a real chance to build a security roof for the entire euro-atlantic area . "
initial plans for a missile defense shield in eastern europe , led by the us , were met with considerable skepticism in moscow , with the kremlin often questioning whether the new network was designed to deal with potential attacks from countries like iran , or to target russia .
however , the russian stance has softened of late , with medvedev recently calling on nato to offer more concrete details on how a cooperative program might work .
" the fact that we are talking to russia about common threats and the chance to cooperate with russia on missile defense is an extremely important step , " german chancellor angela merkel said .
" that could be proof that the cold war has finally come to an end . "
us president barack obama also hailed the progress made on the defense shield , saying the planned network would be " strong enough to cover all nato european territory and populations , and the united states . "
a suggestion to tie the missile shield to nuclear disarmament by german foreign minister guido westerwelle , who wants the remaining us nuclear warheads stationed in germany removed as quickly as possible , was rebuffed by nuclear powers like the us and france , who argued that europe still needs a nuclear deterrent for the foreseeable future .
strategic concept for digital age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says the lisbon summit will go down in nato history nato leaders also settled on a new 10-year strategic concept for the 21st century , updating their last deal from 1999 .
" this summit will go down in nato history , " merkel said .
" the strategic concept is clear and open , and it shows that we are all working on the same foundation . "
the text of the new deal repeats the alliance 's core commitment for each member state to defend all the others , but is also meant to guide the 28 countries as they reform their armed forces and plan more joint operations over the next decade .
the alliance said it was trying to adapt to face more modern dangers to global security , with rasmussen mentioning threats like cyber attacks , terrorism and the political and social instability that can spill over from failing states .
" weak states halfway across the globe can have a direct impact on our security , " rasmussen said .
" they can be breeding grounds for terrorism , for drugs , for trafficking of weapons or people .
and afghanistan is an obvious case in point . "
the new strategic concept also called for closer cooperation with " any nations and relevant organizations across the globe that share our interest in peaceful international relations , " a statement apparently aimed in no small part at the european union .
nato and the eu have particularly fraught ties - despite an overwhelming overlap in terms of membership - because of the long-standing impasse between turkey , a nato member , and cyprus , an eu member , who trade vetoes on any proposals for greater cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai is in lisbon for tough talks afghanistan handover still slated for 2014 as nato members suffer increasing military losses in afghanistan , the alliance reiterated its desire to hand over security responsibilities to the administration in kabul by 2014 , amid claims from some nato and pentagon officials that this target might not be attainable .
" i see a role for troops after 2014 , but with a focus on training security forces , " rasmussen said .
the nato secretary general said the transition process would begin next year , and that he considered the 2014 deadline " realistic . "
president obama is set to have private talks with his afghan counterpart hamid karzai at the lisbon summit on saturday , after a period of rather tense relations between the two administrations .
obama has also called for a move towards reconciliation with parts of the taliban in the country , as nato forces struggle to make inroads against the insurgency there .
germany is the third largest contributor to the mission in afghanistan , although most polls show the engagement is unpopular among the german public .
the two-day summit in lisbon is set to close on saturday evening .
local security forces in the portuguese capital have been on high alert over fears of protests or demonstrations , but the atmosphere so far in the city has been largely calm .

at a russia-eu summit in rostov-on-don with european council president herman van rompuy and european commission president jose manuel barroso earlier this year , medvedev openly offered to end visa restrictions , hoping to accelerate negotiations .
now russia is hoping for a deadline on visa-free travel by the next russia-eu summit on december 12 in brussels .

cooperation with civilian authorities is said to be a core principle . the roman catholic church has announced that it 's working on a new set of guidelines for bishops on preventing and responding to cases of abuse by clerics .
about three quarters of the world 's catholic cardinals converged at the vatican friday to hold a rare gathering discussing this issue , as well as religious freedom and accepting converts from the anglican church .
cardinal william levada , the head of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith - the body in charge of church dogma - led the closed-door discussions , and later issued a statement promising a " coordinated and effective program " of response and prevention that would involve " greater responsibility of bishops for the protection of faithful entrusted to them . "
levada also spoke to the participants about " cooperation with civilian authorities , the need for an effective protection of children and young people , and a careful selection of future priests . "
the vatican described the meeting as " a day of prayer and reflection " on a number of challenges facing the catholic church .
the church has been struggling to deal with repeated scandals across much of europe - including germany - and the us , over hundreds of cases of sexual abuse of children and young people by priests that were subsequently covered up by higher ranking members of the clergy .
critics not satisfied with ' symbolic gestures ' victims of sexual abuse staged protests in rome to coincide with the meeting , and have said the vatican is not doing enough to protect children from future abuse , or to investigate past cases .
" we did n't have high hopes for this meeting , because these church officials are the same men who ignored and concealed , " a us-based victims abuse group , survivors network of those abused by priests -lrb- snap -rrb- , said in a statement after the meeting .
" we want the bishops to turn over to police and prosecutors the personnel files of proven , admitted and credibly accused child-molesting clerics , " snap 's barbara blaine said , describing the vatican 's proposals as " symbolic gestures . "
german cardinal walter kasper , however , praised the meeting , saying it had encouraged catholic bishops around the world " to continue to fight this evil . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 20.11.2010 nuremberg trials left a lasting legacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trials saw prominent nazis sentenced to death , imprisonment november 20 marks the 65th anniversary of the start of the nuremberg trials , in which 22 prominent leaders of nazi germany were brought to justice by the international military tribunal . the nuremberg trials , launched in the wake of world war ii , left behind a broad legacy .
successful in sentencing a group of key personalities of the nazi party , they inspired a series of further trials all aimed at punishing the war criminals of the third reich . the trials , which began on november 20 , 1945 , in the bavarian city of nuremberg , were a new type of event on the world stage .
it was the first time an international tribunal had sought to sentence the leaders of a regime - politicians , army officers and economic advisors - even though in some cases direct responsibility for specific criminal acts could not be attributed to them . as a group , they were seen as initiators , aides , organizers and executers of crimes against humanity .
they were accused of orchestrating wars of aggression , murdering civilians and prisoners of war , deporting people , plundering , engaging in racial persecution , murdering european jews and occupying numerous european countries . however , all these accusations had little impact on the nazis in the courtroom , who did not see themselves as responsible for the listed crimes .
not a single one plead guilty . a combined international effort the judges for the trials came from the united states , the soviet union , france and great britain and were appointed by their governments for this role . the chief prosecutor was robert jackson from the united states , and his assistant chief counsel was german-jewish lawyer robert kempner , who had been stripped of his german citizenship by the nazis before world war ii and had immigrated to the united states .
" when i began to work on this matter in america in 1942 , my american colleagues asked me , ' is this all true ?
can we prove it ? " ' recalled kempner .
" and i said , ' we can prove this 100 percent . " '
the trials lasted 218 days , with 236 witnesses questioned , 5,330 documents and 200,000 statements submitted as evidence and 25,000 pages of protocol written .
the hearings shed light on the dimensions of the nazi regime 's crimes . the verdicts came out on september 30 and october 1 , 1946 : seven imprisonments , 12 death sentences and three acquittals . bildunterschrift : the 218 days of trials produced various sentences and 25,000 pages of protocol inspiration for further trials the first round of trials was followed by 12 others .
these were aimed at nazi medical doctors , lawyers , soldiers and even companies such as flick - an industrial conglomerate that supported the nazi party .
flick profited from the liquidation of jewish property , assisted hitler 's rearmament efforts and used slave laborers from concentration camps .
the german population and its attitude towards the nazi era were largely unaffected by the trials .
they were seen as an arbitrary act of the winning side and it was not long before the government of the newly-formed federal republic of germany , together with party and church representatives , pleaded for clemency on behalf of the convicted persons . some death sentences were turned into prison sentences , and there were some early releases .
some of the accused got the chance to resume their interrupted careers .
despite some of these sentences being overturned , the trials left a lasting impression on the world . the creation of the international military tribunal has served as a model for other tribunals , including the hague in the netherlands - for trying crimes committed during the balkan wars - and the international military tribunal for the far east , which tried japanese officials for crimes against peace and against humanity . the trials also significantly influenced the development of international criminal law , serving as models for conventions such as the 1948 convention on genocide . author : cornelia rabitz / ew editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german media and public are nearly as fascinated with the wedding of prince william and kate middleton as the british press is - almost surprisingly so for a european country with no royal court of its own . it did n't take long for the news of prince william and kate middleton 's engagement to spread .
as soon as the pair announced their plans on the morning of november 16 , a flurry of reports followed in the british media .
the international press soon caught up .
so why are the modern , information-oriented masses so fixated on the marriages of royal couples ?
after all , the wedding of sweden 's crown princess victoria to daniel westling on june 19 was reportedly watched by 1 billion people .
and why , for instance , are germans so interested in britain 's royalty ?
media expert jo grobel says it 's a simple matter of compensation .
" for one thing , in germany in particular there is still a slight desire and wistfulness with regards to royalty , " he told deutsche welle .
" seeing as how we no longer have our own royal court , we need the english to let us borrow a bit of theirs .
that way at least we have a kind of secondhand royal court . "
royal weddings also provide a contrast to the continuous news coverage of events such as crises , wars and catastrophes .
people want to see something positive in between , grobel says .
the british royal family carries with it a particular intrigue because it has been a source of inspiration for dramas and soap operas over generations .
the culminating dramatic stroke , of course , was the tragic demise of princess diana in 1997 .
" there is already speculation over whether or not kate middleton will be the next diana - whether or not she 'll also meet a tragic end .
in other words , it 's good entertainment , " grobel said .
fascination beyond national boundaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swedish royal wedding was watched by 1 billion people add in the fact that for the first time in 30 years , britain has an heir apparent who will marry - and to a non-royal at that - then one could almost see the royal family as an extraordinarily well-financed vehicle for manufacturing the sights and sounds the masses dream about .
" it has something to do with forming an identity , " grobel said .
" it has to do with the upkeep of tradition - even in those countries where the royal family is barely 200 years old .
we always imagine they 've been around forever .
that 's true in britain , but not in belgium or the netherlands . "
illusory or not , traditions grow around royal families and shape national identity in ways which elected politicians ca n't .
and that form of identity crosses national boundaries , too .
germans look to great britain and feel connected to an older form of european culture , something which plays a significant role as regional traditions change drastically .
according to grobel , people look for a basic paradox in royal weddings .
" even when it comes to royalty sometimes things get confusing , and it is n't always much better than in our homes and neighborhoods , " he said .
" both elements come together : the very everyday and banal , and the grandiose largesse of world history . "

the german media and public are nearly as fascinated with the wedding of prince william and kate middleton as the british press is - almost surprisingly so for a european country with no royal court of its own . it did n't take long for the news of prince william and kate middleton 's engagement to spread .
as soon as the pair announced their plans on the morning of november 16 , a flurry of reports followed in the british media .
the international press soon caught up .
so why are the modern , information-oriented masses so fixated on the marriages of royal couples ?
after all , the wedding of sweden 's crown princess victoria to daniel westling on june 19 was reportedly watched by 1 billion people .
and why , for instance , are germans so interested in britain 's royalty ?
media expert jo grobel says it 's a simple matter of compensation .
" for one thing , in germany in particular there is still a slight desire and wistfulness with regards to royalty , " he told deutsche welle .
" seeing as how we no longer have our own royal court , we need the english to let us borrow a bit of theirs .
that way at least we have a kind of secondhand royal court . "
royal weddings also provide a contrast to the continuous news coverage of events such as crises , wars and catastrophes .
people want to see something positive in between , grobel says .
the british royal family carries with it a particular intrigue because it has been a source of inspiration for dramas and soap operas over generations .
the culminating dramatic stroke , of course , was the tragic demise of princess diana in 1997 .
" there is already speculation over whether or not kate middleton will be the next diana - whether or not she 'll also meet a tragic end .
in other words , it 's good entertainment , " grobel said .
fascination beyond national boundaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swedish royal wedding was watched by 1 billion people add in the fact that for the first time in 30 years , britain has an heir apparent who will marry - and to a non-royal at that - then one could almost see the royal family as an extraordinarily well-financed vehicle for manufacturing the sights and sounds the masses dream about .
" it has something to do with forming an identity , " grobel said .
" it has to do with the upkeep of tradition - even in those countries where the royal family is barely 200 years old .
we always imagine they 've been around forever .
that 's true in britain , but not in belgium or the netherlands . "
illusory or not , traditions grow around royal families and shape national identity in ways which elected politicians ca n't .
and that form of identity crosses national boundaries , too .
germans look to great britain and feel connected to an older form of european culture , something which plays a significant role as regional traditions change drastically .
according to grobel , people look for a basic paradox in royal weddings .
" even when it comes to royalty sometimes things get confusing , and it is n't always much better than in our homes and neighborhoods , " he said .
" both elements come together : the very everyday and banal , and the grandiose largesse of world history . "

successful in sentencing a group of key personalities of the nazi party , they inspired a series of further trials all aimed at punishing the war criminals of the third reich . the trials , which began on november 20 , 1945 , in the bavarian city of nuremberg , were a new type of event on the world stage .
it was the first time an international tribunal had sought to sentence the leaders of a regime - politicians , army officers and economic advisors - even though in some cases direct responsibility for specific criminal acts could not be attributed to them . as a group , they were seen as initiators , aides , organizers and executers of crimes against humanity .
they were accused of orchestrating wars of aggression , murdering civilians and prisoners of war , deporting people , plundering , engaging in racial persecution , murdering european jews and occupying numerous european countries . however , all these accusations had little impact on the nazis in the courtroom , who did not see themselves as responsible for the listed crimes .
not a single one plead guilty . a combined international effort the judges for the trials came from the united states , the soviet union , france and great britain and were appointed by their governments for this role . the chief prosecutor was robert jackson from the united states , and his assistant chief counsel was german-jewish lawyer robert kempner , who had been stripped of his german citizenship by the nazis before world war ii and had immigrated to the united states .
" when i began to work on this matter in america in 1942 , my american colleagues asked me , ' is this all true ?
can we prove it ? " ' recalled kempner .
" and i said , ' we can prove this 100 percent . " '
the trials lasted 218 days , with 236 witnesses questioned , 5,330 documents and 200,000 statements submitted as evidence and 25,000 pages of protocol written .
the hearings shed light on the dimensions of the nazi regime 's crimes . the verdicts came out on september 30 and october 1 , 1946 : seven imprisonments , 12 death sentences and three acquittals . bildunterschrift : the 218 days of trials produced various sentences and 25,000 pages of protocol inspiration for further trials the first round of trials was followed by 12 others .
these were aimed at nazi medical doctors , lawyers , soldiers and even companies such as flick - an industrial conglomerate that supported the nazi party .
flick profited from the liquidation of jewish property , assisted hitler 's rearmament efforts and used slave laborers from concentration camps .
the german population and its attitude towards the nazi era were largely unaffected by the trials .
they were seen as an arbitrary act of the winning side and it was not long before the government of the newly-formed federal republic of germany , together with party and church representatives , pleaded for clemency on behalf of the convicted persons . some death sentences were turned into prison sentences , and there were some early releases .
some of the accused got the chance to resume their interrupted careers .
despite some of these sentences being overturned , the trials left a lasting impression on the world . the creation of the international military tribunal has served as a model for other tribunals , including the hague in the netherlands - for trying crimes committed during the balkan wars - and the international military tribunal for the far east , which tried japanese officials for crimes against peace and against humanity . the trials also significantly influenced the development of international criminal law , serving as models for conventions such as the 1948 convention on genocide . author : cornelia rabitz / ew editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , forces will remain in the most dangerous areas until 2014 , and likely stay in a supporting role beyond then . a timeline for the gradual withdrawal of foreign troops from afghanistan has been negotiated by nato nations during a meeting in lisbon .
the western allies met with afghanistan 's president hamid karzai to discuss an exit strategy for the 150,000-strong force .
according to an internal nato document , the nations approved a plan to start pulling out troops in early 2011 , with the first provinces expected to pass to afghan control by july .
however , combat forces are expected to remain in control of the most dangerous areas until 2014 , and stay in a supporting role well beyond that date .
‘ long-term partnership ' nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said they would not abandon afghanistan in its fight against the taliban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai wants the handover completed by the end of 2014 " if the enemies of afghanistan have the idea that they can just wait it out until we leave , they have the wrong idea .
we will stay as long as it takes to finish our job , " rasmussen said .
he added the idea is that the afghan government takes control of the country district by district .
this meant that not all of the 150,000 foreign troops now deployed in afghanistan would leave by the 2014 deadline .
rasmussen said the relationship between nato and afghanistan would be " a long-term partnership . "
wrangling on the eu budget meanwhile , on the sidelines of the nato lisbon summit , german chancellor angela merkel met with british prime minister david cameron and french president nicolas sarkozy to discuss the failed eu budget for 2011 .
the deadline for securing the budget for the coming year was missed due to a standoff between the european parliament and the governments of the 27 member states .
the three leaders came together on friday evening to work out a new proposal for the budget , which could be adopted at the next eu summit in mid-december .
the proposal suggests a rise in the budget of around 3 percent , to take it to 123 billion euros -lrb- $ 168.4 billion -rrb- .
under the terms of the lisbon treaty , if a new budget is not finalized , the budget is frozen at 2010 levels , which will threaten the development of new projects such as the european external action service .

chancellor merkel has said this would mark the definitive end of the cold war . nato leaders sought to entice russia into collaborating on a missile defense shield at the alliance 's annual summit in lisbon , ahead of russian president dmitry medvedev 's arrival on saturday .
" missile defense will bind the nato allies closer together , " nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen , who visited moscow earlier this month , said at the summit .
" by reaching out and inviting russia to cooperate with us , i believe we also have a real chance to build a security roof for the entire euro-atlantic area . "
initial plans for a missile defense shield in eastern europe , led by the us , were met with considerable skepticism in moscow , with the kremlin often questioning whether the new network was designed to deal with potential attacks from countries like iran , or to target russia .
however , the russian stance has softened of late , with medvedev recently calling on nato to offer more concrete details on how a cooperative program might work .
" the fact that we are talking to russia about common threats and the chance to cooperate with russia on missile defense is an extremely important step , " german chancellor angela merkel said .
" that could be proof that the cold war has finally come to an end . "
us president barack obama also hailed the progress made on the defense shield , saying the planned network would be " strong enough to cover all nato european territory and populations , and the united states . "
a suggestion to tie the missile shield to nuclear disarmament by german foreign minister guido westerwelle , who wants the remaining us nuclear warheads stationed in germany removed as quickly as possible , was rebuffed by nuclear powers like the us and france , who argued that europe still needs a nuclear deterrent for the foreseeable future .

" this summit will go down in nato history , " merkel said .
" the strategic concept is clear and open , and it shows that we are all working on the same foundation . "
the text of the new deal repeats the alliance 's core commitment for each member state to defend all the others , but is also meant to guide the 28 countries as they reform their armed forces and plan more joint operations over the next decade .
the alliance said it was trying to adapt to face more modern dangers to global security , with rasmussen mentioning threats like cyber attacks , terrorism and the political and social instability that can spill over from failing states .
" weak states halfway across the globe can have a direct impact on our security , " rasmussen said .
" they can be breeding grounds for terrorism , for drugs , for trafficking of weapons or people .

the new strategic concept also called for closer cooperation with " any nations and relevant organizations across the globe that share our interest in peaceful international relations , " a statement apparently aimed in no small part at the european union .
nato and the eu have particularly fraught ties - despite an overwhelming overlap in terms of membership - because of the long-standing impasse between turkey , a nato member , and cyprus , an eu member , who trade vetoes on any proposals for greater cooperation .

president obama is set to have private talks with his afghan counterpart hamid karzai at the lisbon summit on saturday , after a period of rather tense relations between the two administrations .

however , forces will remain in the most dangerous areas until 2014 , and likely stay in a supporting role beyond then . a timeline for the gradual withdrawal of foreign troops from afghanistan has been negotiated by nato nations during a meeting in lisbon .
the western allies met with afghanistan 's president hamid karzai to discuss an exit strategy for the 150,000-strong force .
according to an internal nato document , the nations approved a plan to start pulling out troops in early 2011 , with the first provinces expected to pass to afghan control by july .
however , combat forces are expected to remain in control of the most dangerous areas until 2014 , and stay in a supporting role well beyond that date .
‘ long-term partnership ' nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said they would not abandon afghanistan in its fight against the taliban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai wants the handover completed by the end of 2014 " if the enemies of afghanistan have the idea that they can just wait it out until we leave , they have the wrong idea .
we will stay as long as it takes to finish our job , " rasmussen said .
he added the idea is that the afghan government takes control of the country district by district .
this meant that not all of the 150,000 foreign troops now deployed in afghanistan would leave by the 2014 deadline .
rasmussen said the relationship between nato and afghanistan would be " a long-term partnership . "
wrangling on the eu budget meanwhile , on the sidelines of the nato lisbon summit , german chancellor angela merkel met with british prime minister david cameron and french president nicolas sarkozy to discuss the failed eu budget for 2011 .
the deadline for securing the budget for the coming year was missed due to a standoff between the european parliament and the governments of the 27 member states .
the three leaders came together on friday evening to work out a new proposal for the budget , which could be adopted at the next eu summit in mid-december .
the proposal suggests a rise in the budget of around 3 percent , to take it to 123 billion euros -lrb- $ 168.4 billion -rrb- .
under the terms of the lisbon treaty , if a new budget is not finalized , the budget is frozen at 2010 levels , which will threaten the development of new projects such as the european external action service .

strache 's party went on to win second place in the vienna election .
and a recent national opinion poll says 27 percent would vote for him in a national election .
that puts the freedom party just ahead of the conservative people 's party and just behind the social democrats .
austria no longer has just two major parties - it has three : one on the center-left , the other one on the center-right , and now the freedom party , which operates on the far-right . austria currently has a so-called grand coalition government made up of the social democrats and the conservative people 's party .
but their popularity is declining in the face of freedom party gains .
anti-immigrant platform the same situation existed just over a decade ago when former leader joerg haider took the party into a coalition government .
before his death in a car accident , haider campaigned on an anti-immigrant platform .
and party leader strache is tapping into the same rich vein of voters , according to political commentator herbert lackner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fpo promoted a now forbidden online game focusing on shooting minarets " if the government threw out all the people that came into austria over the past 10 or 20 years , if they would throw them all out but one , the freedom party would still campaign against this one single person , " lackner told deutsche welle .
" and a 100,000 people would still believe that there are too many foreigners . "
one of the most surprising results from the latest survey is the freedom party 's popularity among young austrians .
it 's the number one choice for people under 30 .
strache appeals most strongly to young males , as did his predecessor haider .
" he wants to scream , he wants to fight , he wants to yell .
that 's something for prostate-bearing people - not for women .
it 's just a male party .
it has always been a male party , " said lackner .
popularity based on austerity measures analysts point out that part of the recent surge by the far right is due to the coalition 's austerity measures .
their cost-cutting budget is currently working its way through parliament .
lackner believes austrians will only vote for heinz-christian strache in the next general election in three years if they are sure he wo n't become part of a government .
" if people see that strache could come into the position to become part of a government i think that would scare many people off . "

he has promised that football 's governing body will turn over a new leaf . fifa president sepp blatter has said that a " new fifa " would choose the venues for the 2018 and 2022 world cups , after corruption allegations forced world soccer 's governing body to ban two members of the executive committee that will elect the host countries on december 2 .
" it is with a large amount of optimism that i am looking forward to this decisive date , " blatter told reporters in a press conference responding to thursday 's verdict from the fifa ethics committee .
blatter also said " all doubts have been cast aside " with regard to the credibility of the vote , and that no further corruption cases would come to light in the mean time .
a total of six officials received bans and fines on thursday , after undercover reporters for the british newspaper sunday times posed as us lobbyists and secretly filmed the fifa representatives either offering to sell their influence or talking about corruption in the organization .
executive committee members amos adamu of nigeria and reynald temarii of tahiti were the most high profile casualties , as both were among the panel of 24 people scheduled to influence where the 2018 and 2022 world cups would take place .
adamu was banned from football activity for three years and fined 10,000 swiss francs -lrb- $ 10,050/7,370 euros -rrb- , while temarii was banned for one year and fined 5,000 swiss francs .
" now we have to have a look at how to act in the future to avoid such situations .
definitely this is an item which is now under scrutiny , " blatter told assembled reporters at the fifa headquarters in zurich .
fifa blasts reporters for ' entrapment ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amos adamu and reynald temarii have been given bans and fines blatter also reserved criticism , however , for the sunday times reports that led to the sanctions - following in the footsteps of fifa 's ethics committee chairman , claudio sulser , who lambasted the paper in the initial ruling on thursday - saying the reporters had not been playing fair .
" it gave us the opportunity to clean a little bit of whatever has to be cleaned , " blatter said .
" but i can not say it is very fair when you open traps , " the president added , saying the reporting amounted to " entrapment of people . "
speaking to deutsche welle , jens sejer andersen , the head of the sports ethics organization play the game - which has been campaigning for the introduction of a world body that oversees the dealings of organizations like fifa or the international olympic committee - said he was baffled by the criticisms directed at the undercover journalism from fifa 's ethics committee chairman claudio sulser .
" he expressed , almost , that he would have liked to be able to ban the sunday times too .
this is a paradox .
without the information , there would have been no process and no members would have been banned , " said andersen .
" if sulser , the chairman of the ethics committee , thinks that the sunday times did twist the facts , how can he then use the report as a basis for sanctions against six leading fifa officials ? " he asked .
if sulser is correct and the report was skewed , he argues , then the officials would surely have a good chance at appeal .
both executive committee members , adamu and temarii , say they intend to appeal the verdict , but their cases will not be heard before the world cup decision in december .
" fifa , in reality , does not like investigative journalism .
they claim they do , but i think they only like the kind of investigative journalism that does not hurt anybody , " andersen said .
the criticism of the sunday times article has prompted concerns in britain , which is considered one of the strong candidates for the 2018 world cup bid .
fears that the perceived muckraking might cost the english bid votes among other executive committee members have only been exacerbated by the bbc 's plans to air an extended 30-minute expose on fifa 's shadier side just days before the organization meets to decide the would-be hosts ' fate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many countries have invested millions in the outcome of the december 2 decision the collusion problem for fifa , this week 's positive headline was that the ethics committee did not find sufficient evidence that representatives of the 2018 spain / portugal bid and the 2022 qatar bid had colluded and agreed to vote reciprocally . however , the soccer authority has admitted that holding its first ever dual decision on world cup hosting was a mistake , and encouraged the interested parties to form alliances .
" you can not avoid collusion but if there should be something wrong in such collusion , then naturally somebody should intervene , " blatter said .
" you find collusion in politics , in elections , when two parties are enemies during the year , and then they run together . "
in reality , most major sporting decisions in organizations like fifa or the ioc are motivated , at least in part , by some kind of horse trading anyway - but placing two world cup votes side-by-side gave the parties bidding for the world cup a rather unique opportunity and motive to seal a particularly worthwhile deal .
" taking into account that several very big countries - russia , spain / portugal , england , holland / belgium , the united states , qatar - many countries have collectively invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the bidding campaign , i think that the taxpayers in these countries absolutely expect that the process of selecting the host countries is objective , transparent and fair , " play the game 's andersen said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president sepp blatter wants to move on from the corruption controversy can fifa change ?
for andersen , the problem is that sports , and especially soccer , are beginning to outgrow the old institutions established to govern them in an age when very little money was involved .
" over the past 30 years , sports has become a global entertainment industry worth billions and billions of dollars .
yet it 's still the same structures , associations , almost familial structures , that handle all these revenues , without much - or any - control , " he said .
fifa is one of many sporting authorities based in switzerland , where it enjoys a string of special exemptions from disclosure laws that would apply to most swiss businesses or charities .
andersen notes that both fifa and the swiss government have made modest improvements in recent years , but also believes the organization will not be able to truly deliver on blatter 's promise of a " new fifa " until tighter external oversight is introduced to actively discourage corruption .
" oscar wilde 's saying ' i can resist anything , except temptation ' applies to sports officials , just like the rest of us , " he said .

the party , which campaigns on an anti-immigrant platform , even ranks first among voters under 30 , a new poll found . the launch of the freedom party 's -lrb- fpo -rrb- campaign for the recent local elections in vienna may seem bizarre but has proven to be successful .
heinz-christian strache , the party 's leader , stepped into the ring at a suburban shopping center , acting the part of a fighter who will take on all comers but especially left-wingers and greens .
strache 's party went on to win second place in the vienna election .

successful in sentencing a group of key personalities of the nazi party , they inspired a series of further trials all aimed at punishing the war criminals of the third reich . the trials , which began on november 20 , 1945 , in the bavarian city of nuremberg , were a new type of event on the world stage .
it was the first time an international tribunal had sought to sentence the leaders of a regime - politicians , army officers and economic advisors - even though in some cases direct responsibility for specific criminal acts could not be attributed to them . as a group , they were seen as initiators , aides , organizers and executers of crimes against humanity .

chancellor merkel has said this would mark the definitive end of the cold war . nato leaders sought to entice russia into collaborating on a missile defense shield at the alliance 's annual summit in lisbon , ahead of russian president dmitry medvedev 's arrival on saturday .
" missile defense will bind the nato allies closer together , " nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen , who visited moscow earlier this month , said at the summit .
" by reaching out and inviting russia to cooperate with us , i believe we also have a real chance to build a security roof for the entire euro-atlantic area . "
initial plans for a missile defense shield in eastern europe , led by the us , were met with considerable skepticism in moscow , with the kremlin often questioning whether the new network was designed to deal with potential attacks from countries like iran , or to target russia .
however , the russian stance has softened of late , with medvedev recently calling on nato to offer more concrete details on how a cooperative program might work .
" the fact that we are talking to russia about common threats and the chance to cooperate with russia on missile defense is an extremely important step , " german chancellor angela merkel said .
" that could be proof that the cold war has finally come to an end . "
us president barack obama also hailed the progress made on the defense shield , saying the planned network would be " strong enough to cover all nato european territory and populations , and the united states . "
a suggestion to tie the missile shield to nuclear disarmament by german foreign minister guido westerwelle , who wants the remaining us nuclear warheads stationed in germany removed as quickly as possible , was rebuffed by nuclear powers like the us and france , who argued that europe still needs a nuclear deterrent for the foreseeable future .
strategic concept for digital age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says the lisbon summit will go down in nato history nato leaders also settled on a new 10-year strategic concept for the 21st century , updating their last deal from 1999 .
" this summit will go down in nato history , " merkel said .
" the strategic concept is clear and open , and it shows that we are all working on the same foundation . "
the text of the new deal repeats the alliance 's core commitment for each member state to defend all the others , but is also meant to guide the 28 countries as they reform their armed forces and plan more joint operations over the next decade .
the alliance said it was trying to adapt to face more modern dangers to global security , with rasmussen mentioning threats like cyber attacks , terrorism and the political and social instability that can spill over from failing states .
" weak states halfway across the globe can have a direct impact on our security , " rasmussen said .
" they can be breeding grounds for terrorism , for drugs , for trafficking of weapons or people .
and afghanistan is an obvious case in point . "
the new strategic concept also called for closer cooperation with " any nations and relevant organizations across the globe that share our interest in peaceful international relations , " a statement apparently aimed in no small part at the european union .
nato and the eu have particularly fraught ties - despite an overwhelming overlap in terms of membership - because of the long-standing impasse between turkey , a nato member , and cyprus , an eu member , who trade vetoes on any proposals for greater cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai is in lisbon for tough talks afghanistan handover still slated for 2014 as nato members suffer increasing military losses in afghanistan , the alliance reiterated its desire to hand over security responsibilities to the administration in kabul by 2014 , amid claims from some nato and pentagon officials that this target might not be attainable .
" i see a role for troops after 2014 , but with a focus on training security forces , " rasmussen said .
the nato secretary general said the transition process would begin next year , and that he considered the 2014 deadline " realistic . "
president obama is set to have private talks with his afghan counterpart hamid karzai at the lisbon summit on saturday , after a period of rather tense relations between the two administrations .
obama has also called for a move towards reconciliation with parts of the taliban in the country , as nato forces struggle to make inroads against the insurgency there .

successful in sentencing a group of key personalities of the nazi party , they inspired a series of further trials all aimed at punishing the war criminals of the third reich . the trials , which began on november 20 , 1945 , in the bavarian city of nuremberg , were a new type of event on the world stage .
it was the first time an international tribunal had sought to sentence the leaders of a regime - politicians , army officers and economic advisors - even though in some cases direct responsibility for specific criminal acts could not be attributed to them . as a group , they were seen as initiators , aides , organizers and executers of crimes against humanity .
they were accused of orchestrating wars of aggression , murdering civilians and prisoners of war , deporting people , plundering , engaging in racial persecution , murdering european jews and occupying numerous european countries . however , all these accusations had little impact on the nazis in the courtroom , who did not see themselves as responsible for the listed crimes .

the western allies met with afghanistan 's president hamid karzai to discuss an exit strategy for the 150,000-strong force .
according to an internal nato document , the nations approved a plan to start pulling out troops in early 2011 , with the first provinces expected to pass to afghan control by july .
however , combat forces are expected to remain in control of the most dangerous areas until 2014 , and stay in a supporting role well beyond that date .
‘ long-term partnership ' nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said they would not abandon afghanistan in its fight against the taliban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai wants the handover completed by the end of 2014 " if the enemies of afghanistan have the idea that they can just wait it out until we leave , they have the wrong idea .
we will stay as long as it takes to finish our job , " rasmussen said .
he added the idea is that the afghan government takes control of the country district by district .
this meant that not all of the 150,000 foreign troops now deployed in afghanistan would leave by the 2014 deadline .
rasmussen said the relationship between nato and afghanistan would be " a long-term partnership . "
wrangling on the eu budget meanwhile , on the sidelines of the nato lisbon summit , german chancellor angela merkel met with british prime minister david cameron and french president nicolas sarkozy to discuss the failed eu budget for 2011 .
the deadline for securing the budget for the coming year was missed due to a standoff between the european parliament and the governments of the 27 member states .
the three leaders came together on friday evening to work out a new proposal for the budget , which could be adopted at the next eu summit in mid-december .
the proposal suggests a rise in the budget of around 3 percent , to take it to 123 billion euros -lrb- $ 168.4 billion -rrb- .
under the terms of the lisbon treaty , if a new budget is not finalized , the budget is frozen at 2010 levels , which will threaten the development of new projects such as the european external action service .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 20.11.2010 far-right freedom party most popular among young austrians großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : party leader strache is popular among austria 's youth austria 's far-right freedom party has become the country 's second-most popular party .
the party , which campaigns on an anti-immigrant platform , even ranks first among voters under 30 , a new poll found . the launch of the freedom party 's -lrb- fpo -rrb- campaign for the recent local elections in vienna may seem bizarre but has proven to be successful .
heinz-christian strache , the party 's leader , stepped into the ring at a suburban shopping center , acting the part of a fighter who will take on all comers but especially left-wingers and greens .
strache 's party went on to win second place in the vienna election .
and a recent national opinion poll says 27 percent would vote for him in a national election .
that puts the freedom party just ahead of the conservative people 's party and just behind the social democrats .
austria no longer has just two major parties - it has three : one on the center-left , the other one on the center-right , and now the freedom party , which operates on the far-right . austria currently has a so-called grand coalition government made up of the social democrats and the conservative people 's party .
but their popularity is declining in the face of freedom party gains .
anti-immigrant platform the same situation existed just over a decade ago when former leader joerg haider took the party into a coalition government .
before his death in a car accident , haider campaigned on an anti-immigrant platform .
and party leader strache is tapping into the same rich vein of voters , according to political commentator herbert lackner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fpo promoted a now forbidden online game focusing on shooting minarets " if the government threw out all the people that came into austria over the past 10 or 20 years , if they would throw them all out but one , the freedom party would still campaign against this one single person , " lackner told deutsche welle .
" and a 100,000 people would still believe that there are too many foreigners . "
one of the most surprising results from the latest survey is the freedom party 's popularity among young austrians .
it 's the number one choice for people under 30 .
strache appeals most strongly to young males , as did his predecessor haider .
" he wants to scream , he wants to fight , he wants to yell .
that 's something for prostate-bearing people - not for women .
it 's just a male party .
it has always been a male party , " said lackner .
popularity based on austerity measures analysts point out that part of the recent surge by the far right is due to the coalition 's austerity measures .
their cost-cutting budget is currently working its way through parliament .
lackner believes austrians will only vote for heinz-christian strache in the next general election in three years if they are sure he wo n't become part of a government .
" if people see that strache could come into the position to become part of a government i think that would scare many people off . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.11.2010 german fascination with british royalty both grandiose and banal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why are germans so interested in britain 's royalty ?
the german media and public are nearly as fascinated with the wedding of prince william and kate middleton as the british press is - almost surprisingly so for a european country with no royal court of its own . it did n't take long for the news of prince william and kate middleton 's engagement to spread .
as soon as the pair announced their plans on the morning of november 16 , a flurry of reports followed in the british media .
the international press soon caught up .
so why are the modern , information-oriented masses so fixated on the marriages of royal couples ?
after all , the wedding of sweden 's crown princess victoria to daniel westling on june 19 was reportedly watched by 1 billion people .
and why , for instance , are germans so interested in britain 's royalty ?
media expert jo grobel says it 's a simple matter of compensation .
" for one thing , in germany in particular there is still a slight desire and wistfulness with regards to royalty , " he told deutsche welle .
" seeing as how we no longer have our own royal court , we need the english to let us borrow a bit of theirs .
that way at least we have a kind of secondhand royal court . "
royal weddings also provide a contrast to the continuous news coverage of events such as crises , wars and catastrophes .
people want to see something positive in between , grobel says .
the british royal family carries with it a particular intrigue because it has been a source of inspiration for dramas and soap operas over generations .
the culminating dramatic stroke , of course , was the tragic demise of princess diana in 1997 .
" there is already speculation over whether or not kate middleton will be the next diana - whether or not she 'll also meet a tragic end .
in other words , it 's good entertainment , " grobel said .
fascination beyond national boundaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swedish royal wedding was watched by 1 billion people add in the fact that for the first time in 30 years , britain has an heir apparent who will marry - and to a non-royal at that - then one could almost see the royal family as an extraordinarily well-financed vehicle for manufacturing the sights and sounds the masses dream about .
" it has something to do with forming an identity , " grobel said .
" it has to do with the upkeep of tradition - even in those countries where the royal family is barely 200 years old .
we always imagine they 've been around forever .
that 's true in britain , but not in belgium or the netherlands . "
illusory or not , traditions grow around royal families and shape national identity in ways which elected politicians ca n't .
and that form of identity crosses national boundaries , too .
germans look to great britain and feel connected to an older form of european culture , something which plays a significant role as regional traditions change drastically .
according to grobel , people look for a basic paradox in royal weddings .
" even when it comes to royalty sometimes things get confusing , and it is n't always much better than in our homes and neighborhoods , " he said .
" both elements come together : the very everyday and banal , and the grandiose largesse of world history . "

however , forces will remain in the most dangerous areas until 2014 , and likely stay in a supporting role beyond then . a timeline for the gradual withdrawal of foreign troops from afghanistan has been negotiated by nato nations during a meeting in lisbon .
the western allies met with afghanistan 's president hamid karzai to discuss an exit strategy for the 150,000-strong force .
according to an internal nato document , the nations approved a plan to start pulling out troops in early 2011 , with the first provinces expected to pass to afghan control by july .
however , combat forces are expected to remain in control of the most dangerous areas until 2014 , and stay in a supporting role well beyond that date .

he added the idea is that the afghan government takes control of the country district by district .
this meant that not all of the 150,000 foreign troops now deployed in afghanistan would leave by the 2014 deadline .
rasmussen said the relationship between nato and afghanistan would be " a long-term partnership . "

the three leaders came together on friday evening to work out a new proposal for the budget , which could be adopted at the next eu summit in mid-december .
the proposal suggests a rise in the budget of around 3 percent , to take it to 123 billion euros -lrb- $ 168.4 billion -rrb- .
under the terms of the lisbon treaty , if a new budget is not finalized , the budget is frozen at 2010 levels , which will threaten the development of new projects such as the european external action service .

he has promised that football 's governing body will turn over a new leaf . fifa president sepp blatter has said that a " new fifa " would choose the venues for the 2018 and 2022 world cups , after corruption allegations forced world soccer 's governing body to ban two members of the executive committee that will elect the host countries on december 2 .
" it is with a large amount of optimism that i am looking forward to this decisive date , " blatter told reporters in a press conference responding to thursday 's verdict from the fifa ethics committee .
blatter also said " all doubts have been cast aside " with regard to the credibility of the vote , and that no further corruption cases would come to light in the mean time .
a total of six officials received bans and fines on thursday , after undercover reporters for the british newspaper sunday times posed as us lobbyists and secretly filmed the fifa representatives either offering to sell their influence or talking about corruption in the organization .
executive committee members amos adamu of nigeria and reynald temarii of tahiti were the most high profile casualties , as both were among the panel of 24 people scheduled to influence where the 2018 and 2022 world cups would take place .
adamu was banned from football activity for three years and fined 10,000 swiss francs -lrb- $ 10,050/7,370 euros -rrb- , while temarii was banned for one year and fined 5,000 swiss francs .
" now we have to have a look at how to act in the future to avoid such situations .
definitely this is an item which is now under scrutiny , " blatter told assembled reporters at the fifa headquarters in zurich .
fifa blasts reporters for ' entrapment ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amos adamu and reynald temarii have been given bans and fines blatter also reserved criticism , however , for the sunday times reports that led to the sanctions - following in the footsteps of fifa 's ethics committee chairman , claudio sulser , who lambasted the paper in the initial ruling on thursday - saying the reporters had not been playing fair .
" it gave us the opportunity to clean a little bit of whatever has to be cleaned , " blatter said .
" but i can not say it is very fair when you open traps , " the president added , saying the reporting amounted to " entrapment of people . "
speaking to deutsche welle , jens sejer andersen , the head of the sports ethics organization play the game - which has been campaigning for the introduction of a world body that oversees the dealings of organizations like fifa or the international olympic committee - said he was baffled by the criticisms directed at the undercover journalism from fifa 's ethics committee chairman claudio sulser .
" he expressed , almost , that he would have liked to be able to ban the sunday times too .
this is a paradox .
without the information , there would have been no process and no members would have been banned , " said andersen .
" if sulser , the chairman of the ethics committee , thinks that the sunday times did twist the facts , how can he then use the report as a basis for sanctions against six leading fifa officials ? " he asked .
if sulser is correct and the report was skewed , he argues , then the officials would surely have a good chance at appeal .
both executive committee members , adamu and temarii , say they intend to appeal the verdict , but their cases will not be heard before the world cup decision in december .
" fifa , in reality , does not like investigative journalism .
they claim they do , but i think they only like the kind of investigative journalism that does not hurt anybody , " andersen said .
the criticism of the sunday times article has prompted concerns in britain , which is considered one of the strong candidates for the 2018 world cup bid .
fears that the perceived muckraking might cost the english bid votes among other executive committee members have only been exacerbated by the bbc 's plans to air an extended 30-minute expose on fifa 's shadier side just days before the organization meets to decide the would-be hosts ' fate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many countries have invested millions in the outcome of the december 2 decision the collusion problem for fifa , this week 's positive headline was that the ethics committee did not find sufficient evidence that representatives of the 2018 spain / portugal bid and the 2022 qatar bid had colluded and agreed to vote reciprocally . however , the soccer authority has admitted that holding its first ever dual decision on world cup hosting was a mistake , and encouraged the interested parties to form alliances .
" you can not avoid collusion but if there should be something wrong in such collusion , then naturally somebody should intervene , " blatter said .
" you find collusion in politics , in elections , when two parties are enemies during the year , and then they run together . "
in reality , most major sporting decisions in organizations like fifa or the ioc are motivated , at least in part , by some kind of horse trading anyway - but placing two world cup votes side-by-side gave the parties bidding for the world cup a rather unique opportunity and motive to seal a particularly worthwhile deal .
" taking into account that several very big countries - russia , spain / portugal , england , holland / belgium , the united states , qatar - many countries have collectively invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the bidding campaign , i think that the taxpayers in these countries absolutely expect that the process of selecting the host countries is objective , transparent and fair , " play the game 's andersen said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president sepp blatter wants to move on from the corruption controversy can fifa change ?
for andersen , the problem is that sports , and especially soccer , are beginning to outgrow the old institutions established to govern them in an age when very little money was involved .
" over the past 30 years , sports has become a global entertainment industry worth billions and billions of dollars .
yet it 's still the same structures , associations , almost familial structures , that handle all these revenues , without much - or any - control , " he said .
fifa is one of many sporting authorities based in switzerland , where it enjoys a string of special exemptions from disclosure laws that would apply to most swiss businesses or charities .
andersen notes that both fifa and the swiss government have made modest improvements in recent years , but also believes the organization will not be able to truly deliver on blatter 's promise of a " new fifa " until tighter external oversight is introduced to actively discourage corruption .
" oscar wilde 's saying ' i can resist anything , except temptation ' applies to sports officials , just like the rest of us , " he said .

chancellor merkel has said this would mark the definitive end of the cold war . nato leaders sought to entice russia into collaborating on a missile defense shield at the alliance 's annual summit in lisbon , ahead of russian president dmitry medvedev 's arrival on saturday .
" missile defense will bind the nato allies closer together , " nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen , who visited moscow earlier this month , said at the summit .
" by reaching out and inviting russia to cooperate with us , i believe we also have a real chance to build a security roof for the entire euro-atlantic area . "
initial plans for a missile defense shield in eastern europe , led by the us , were met with considerable skepticism in moscow , with the kremlin often questioning whether the new network was designed to deal with potential attacks from countries like iran , or to target russia .
however , the russian stance has softened of late , with medvedev recently calling on nato to offer more concrete details on how a cooperative program might work .
" the fact that we are talking to russia about common threats and the chance to cooperate with russia on missile defense is an extremely important step , " german chancellor angela merkel said .
" that could be proof that the cold war has finally come to an end . "
us president barack obama also hailed the progress made on the defense shield , saying the planned network would be " strong enough to cover all nato european territory and populations , and the united states . "
a suggestion to tie the missile shield to nuclear disarmament by german foreign minister guido westerwelle , who wants the remaining us nuclear warheads stationed in germany removed as quickly as possible , was rebuffed by nuclear powers like the us and france , who argued that europe still needs a nuclear deterrent for the foreseeable future .
strategic concept for digital age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says the lisbon summit will go down in nato history nato leaders also settled on a new 10-year strategic concept for the 21st century , updating their last deal from 1999 .
" this summit will go down in nato history , " merkel said .
" the strategic concept is clear and open , and it shows that we are all working on the same foundation . "
the text of the new deal repeats the alliance 's core commitment for each member state to defend all the others , but is also meant to guide the 28 countries as they reform their armed forces and plan more joint operations over the next decade .
the alliance said it was trying to adapt to face more modern dangers to global security , with rasmussen mentioning threats like cyber attacks , terrorism and the political and social instability that can spill over from failing states .
" weak states halfway across the globe can have a direct impact on our security , " rasmussen said .
" they can be breeding grounds for terrorism , for drugs , for trafficking of weapons or people .

" by reaching out and inviting russia to cooperate with us , i believe we also have a real chance to build a security roof for the entire euro-atlantic area . "
initial plans for a missile defense shield in eastern europe , led by the us , were met with considerable skepticism in moscow , with the kremlin often questioning whether the new network was designed to deal with potential attacks from countries like iran , or to target russia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de travel -pipe- 20.11.2010 russia introduces stricter visa requirements for eu citizens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia cited the ' principle of reciprocity ' for the changes russia has tightened visa restrictions with eu citizens , citing the " principle of reciprocity . "
the move may set back talks on visa-free travel , and germany has strongly criticized the move . from november , german citizens applying for a russian visa must now show a bank account statement , proof of earnings and the registration of a personal business or place of residence .
this is all meant to prove the applicant 's willingness to eventually leave russia and return home .
russian authorities cited the " principle of reciprocity " for the changes in requirements , as russian citizens must present similar certificates when applying for entry into the european union .
moscow has sought visa-free travel with the eu for years , and president dmitry medvedev has said russia could lift visa restrictions immediately .
" our country is ready to solve this problem - the problem is not ours , " he said .
at a russia-eu summit in rostov-on-don with european council president herman van rompuy and european commission president jose manuel barroso earlier this year , medvedev openly offered to end visa restrictions , hoping to accelerate negotiations .
now russia is hoping for a deadline on visa-free travel by the next russia-eu summit on december 12 in brussels .
little understanding germany belongs to those eu member states which support a gradual relaxation of visa restrictions with russia .
foreign minister guido westerwelle made that clear at a meeting with his russian counterpart sergei lavrov on november 1 , stipulating that there were still many details the eu had to clear up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev has told eu leaders russia is ready to drop visa requirements thus berlin has shown little understanding for the most recent tightening of visa restrictions , and the foreign ministry stated it would not accept the restrictions without protest .
the bundestag also criticized russia 's move , with parliamentarian marina schuster of the foreign affairs committee saying she was " surprised that russia has taken this step , " which moved the process backwards .
" the goal should be for both sides to make advances toward visa freedom - and lavrov and westerwelle also discussed this , " she told deutsche welle .
quid pro quo however , hans-henning schroeder from the german institute for international and security affairs said russia 's tightening of visa restrictions was a completely normal diplomatic step .
" the schengen zone makes certain demands of russian applicants for visas , and now russia is simply making the same demands , " he said , referring to europe 's border-free travel area .
this may be bothersome , he added , but it is not unusual .
schroeder said one should not assume that the tighter visa requirements would have consequences for negotiations on visa-free travel .
" there wo n't be visa-free travel without compromises , " he said .
" rather it 's a negotiation process , and the russian side has to bring bargaining power to the table . "
a host of questions must still be resolved , on issues like border security or readmission agreements .
schroeder said ultimately the schengen states will hope to ensure that any ending of visa restrictions will not turn into a liability .

the german media and public are nearly as fascinated with the wedding of prince william and kate middleton as the british press is - almost surprisingly so for a european country with no royal court of its own . it did n't take long for the news of prince william and kate middleton 's engagement to spread .
as soon as the pair announced their plans on the morning of november 16 , a flurry of reports followed in the british media .
the international press soon caught up .
so why are the modern , information-oriented masses so fixated on the marriages of royal couples ?
after all , the wedding of sweden 's crown princess victoria to daniel westling on june 19 was reportedly watched by 1 billion people .
and why , for instance , are germans so interested in britain 's royalty ?
media expert jo grobel says it 's a simple matter of compensation .
" for one thing , in germany in particular there is still a slight desire and wistfulness with regards to royalty , " he told deutsche welle .
" seeing as how we no longer have our own royal court , we need the english to let us borrow a bit of theirs .
that way at least we have a kind of secondhand royal court . "
royal weddings also provide a contrast to the continuous news coverage of events such as crises , wars and catastrophes .
people want to see something positive in between , grobel says .
the british royal family carries with it a particular intrigue because it has been a source of inspiration for dramas and soap operas over generations .
the culminating dramatic stroke , of course , was the tragic demise of princess diana in 1997 .
" there is already speculation over whether or not kate middleton will be the next diana - whether or not she 'll also meet a tragic end .
in other words , it 's good entertainment , " grobel said .
fascination beyond national boundaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swedish royal wedding was watched by 1 billion people add in the fact that for the first time in 30 years , britain has an heir apparent who will marry - and to a non-royal at that - then one could almost see the royal family as an extraordinarily well-financed vehicle for manufacturing the sights and sounds the masses dream about .
" it has something to do with forming an identity , " grobel said .
" it has to do with the upkeep of tradition - even in those countries where the royal family is barely 200 years old .
we always imagine they 've been around forever .
that 's true in britain , but not in belgium or the netherlands . "
illusory or not , traditions grow around royal families and shape national identity in ways which elected politicians ca n't .
and that form of identity crosses national boundaries , too .
germans look to great britain and feel connected to an older form of european culture , something which plays a significant role as regional traditions change drastically .
according to grobel , people look for a basic paradox in royal weddings .
" even when it comes to royalty sometimes things get confusing , and it is n't always much better than in our homes and neighborhoods , " he said .
" both elements come together : the very everyday and banal , and the grandiose largesse of world history . "

illusory or not , traditions grow around royal families and shape national identity in ways which elected politicians ca n't .
and that form of identity crosses national boundaries , too .
germans look to great britain and feel connected to an older form of european culture , something which plays a significant role as regional traditions change drastically .
according to grobel , people look for a basic paradox in royal weddings .
" even when it comes to royalty sometimes things get confusing , and it is n't always much better than in our homes and neighborhoods , " he said .
" both elements come together : the very everyday and banal , and the grandiose largesse of world history . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 20.11.2010 far-right freedom party most popular among young austrians großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : party leader strache is popular among austria 's youth austria 's far-right freedom party has become the country 's second-most popular party .
the party , which campaigns on an anti-immigrant platform , even ranks first among voters under 30 , a new poll found . the launch of the freedom party 's -lrb- fpo -rrb- campaign for the recent local elections in vienna may seem bizarre but has proven to be successful .
heinz-christian strache , the party 's leader , stepped into the ring at a suburban shopping center , acting the part of a fighter who will take on all comers but especially left-wingers and greens .
strache 's party went on to win second place in the vienna election .
and a recent national opinion poll says 27 percent would vote for him in a national election .
that puts the freedom party just ahead of the conservative people 's party and just behind the social democrats .
austria no longer has just two major parties - it has three : one on the center-left , the other one on the center-right , and now the freedom party , which operates on the far-right . austria currently has a so-called grand coalition government made up of the social democrats and the conservative people 's party .
but their popularity is declining in the face of freedom party gains .
anti-immigrant platform the same situation existed just over a decade ago when former leader joerg haider took the party into a coalition government .
before his death in a car accident , haider campaigned on an anti-immigrant platform .
and party leader strache is tapping into the same rich vein of voters , according to political commentator herbert lackner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fpo promoted a now forbidden online game focusing on shooting minarets " if the government threw out all the people that came into austria over the past 10 or 20 years , if they would throw them all out but one , the freedom party would still campaign against this one single person , " lackner told deutsche welle .
" and a 100,000 people would still believe that there are too many foreigners . "
one of the most surprising results from the latest survey is the freedom party 's popularity among young austrians .
it 's the number one choice for people under 30 .
strache appeals most strongly to young males , as did his predecessor haider .
" he wants to scream , he wants to fight , he wants to yell .
that 's something for prostate-bearing people - not for women .
it 's just a male party .
it has always been a male party , " said lackner .
popularity based on austerity measures analysts point out that part of the recent surge by the far right is due to the coalition 's austerity measures .
their cost-cutting budget is currently working its way through parliament .
lackner believes austrians will only vote for heinz-christian strache in the next general election in three years if they are sure he wo n't become part of a government .
" if people see that strache could come into the position to become part of a government i think that would scare many people off . "

however , forces will remain in the most dangerous areas until 2014 , and likely stay in a supporting role beyond then . a timeline for the gradual withdrawal of foreign troops from afghanistan has been negotiated by nato nations during a meeting in lisbon .
the western allies met with afghanistan 's president hamid karzai to discuss an exit strategy for the 150,000-strong force .
according to an internal nato document , the nations approved a plan to start pulling out troops in early 2011 , with the first provinces expected to pass to afghan control by july .
however , combat forces are expected to remain in control of the most dangerous areas until 2014 , and stay in a supporting role well beyond that date .
‘ long-term partnership ' nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said they would not abandon afghanistan in its fight against the taliban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai wants the handover completed by the end of 2014 " if the enemies of afghanistan have the idea that they can just wait it out until we leave , they have the wrong idea .
we will stay as long as it takes to finish our job , " rasmussen said .
he added the idea is that the afghan government takes control of the country district by district .
this meant that not all of the 150,000 foreign troops now deployed in afghanistan would leave by the 2014 deadline .
rasmussen said the relationship between nato and afghanistan would be " a long-term partnership . "
wrangling on the eu budget meanwhile , on the sidelines of the nato lisbon summit , german chancellor angela merkel met with british prime minister david cameron and french president nicolas sarkozy to discuss the failed eu budget for 2011 .
the deadline for securing the budget for the coming year was missed due to a standoff between the european parliament and the governments of the 27 member states .
the three leaders came together on friday evening to work out a new proposal for the budget , which could be adopted at the next eu summit in mid-december .
the proposal suggests a rise in the budget of around 3 percent , to take it to 123 billion euros -lrb- $ 168.4 billion -rrb- .
under the terms of the lisbon treaty , if a new budget is not finalized , the budget is frozen at 2010 levels , which will threaten the development of new projects such as the european external action service .

nato plans to invite moscow to take part in its missile defense shield . russian president dmitry medvedev said on saturday that differences between nato and russia over the war in georgia now belonged to the past .
" we have overcome the difficulties of the past , " said medvedev following consultations of the nato-russia council in lisbon .
the russian president said the main priority was to work together to combat terrorism , drug trafficking , piracy and the proliferation of nuclear weapons .
medvedev accepted nato 's offer to open negotiations on moscow joining a joint missile shield in europe . the russian president said , however , that his country would only participate if it is treated as an equal partner .

nato has invited moscow to take part in the defense system , linking russia to the planned european anti-missile umbrella .
in principle , russia has accepted the proposition .
however , medvedev had one condition .
" our participation must be on completely equal terms , " medvedev said .
" we will only take part if we are partners .
we wo n't accept any other form of participation . "

" unprompted , i 've received overwhelming support from our allies here that the new start treaty is a critical component to us and european security , " obama said .
" they have urged both privately and publicly that this gets done . "
even when a number of issues are a long way from being solved , and many details on the planned cooperation projects still need to be hammered out , the positive atmosphere at the summit was striking .
german chancellor angela merkel said ratification of the start treaty would be " a giant step forwards and the final end to the chapter of the cold war . "

however , forces will remain in the most dangerous areas until 2014 , and likely stay in a supporting role beyond then . a timeline for the gradual withdrawal of foreign troops from afghanistan has been negotiated by nato nations during a meeting in lisbon .
the western allies met with afghanistan 's president hamid karzai to discuss an exit strategy for the 150,000-strong force .
according to an internal nato document , the nations approved a plan to start pulling out troops in early 2011 , with the first provinces expected to pass to afghan control by july .
however , combat forces are expected to remain in control of the most dangerous areas until 2014 , and stay in a supporting role well beyond that date .
‘ long-term partnership ' nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said they would not abandon afghanistan in its fight against the taliban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai wants the handover completed by the end of 2014 " if the enemies of afghanistan have the idea that they can just wait it out until we leave , they have the wrong idea .
we will stay as long as it takes to finish our job , " rasmussen said .
he added the idea is that the afghan government takes control of the country district by district .
this meant that not all of the 150,000 foreign troops now deployed in afghanistan would leave by the 2014 deadline .
rasmussen said the relationship between nato and afghanistan would be " a long-term partnership . "
wrangling on the eu budget meanwhile , on the sidelines of the nato lisbon summit , german chancellor angela merkel met with british prime minister david cameron and french president nicolas sarkozy to discuss the failed eu budget for 2011 .
the deadline for securing the budget for the coming year was missed due to a standoff between the european parliament and the governments of the 27 member states .
the three leaders came together on friday evening to work out a new proposal for the budget , which could be adopted at the next eu summit in mid-december .
the proposal suggests a rise in the budget of around 3 percent , to take it to 123 billion euros -lrb- $ 168.4 billion -rrb- .
under the terms of the lisbon treaty , if a new budget is not finalized , the budget is frozen at 2010 levels , which will threaten the development of new projects such as the european external action service .

" for the first time in history , nato countries and russia will be cooperating to defend themselves . "
perhaps the most visible sign of cooperation will be the joint development of a common missile defense shield .
nato has invited moscow to take part in the defense system , linking russia to the planned european anti-missile umbrella .
in principle , russia has accepted the proposition .
however , medvedev had one condition .
" our participation must be on completely equal terms , " medvedev said .
" we will only take part if we are partners .
we wo n't accept any other form of participation . "

" they have urged both privately and publicly that this gets done . "
even when a number of issues are a long way from being solved , and many details on the planned cooperation projects still need to be hammered out , the positive atmosphere at the summit was striking .
german chancellor angela merkel said ratification of the start treaty would be " a giant step forwards and the final end to the chapter of the cold war . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de travel -pipe- 20.11.2010 russia introduces stricter visa requirements for eu citizens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia cited the ' principle of reciprocity ' for the changes russia has tightened visa restrictions with eu citizens , citing the " principle of reciprocity . "
the move may set back talks on visa-free travel , and germany has strongly criticized the move . from november , german citizens applying for a russian visa must now show a bank account statement , proof of earnings and the registration of a personal business or place of residence .
this is all meant to prove the applicant 's willingness to eventually leave russia and return home .
russian authorities cited the " principle of reciprocity " for the changes in requirements , as russian citizens must present similar certificates when applying for entry into the european union .
moscow has sought visa-free travel with the eu for years , and president dmitry medvedev has said russia could lift visa restrictions immediately .
" our country is ready to solve this problem - the problem is not ours , " he said .
at a russia-eu summit in rostov-on-don with european council president herman van rompuy and european commission president jose manuel barroso earlier this year , medvedev openly offered to end visa restrictions , hoping to accelerate negotiations .
now russia is hoping for a deadline on visa-free travel by the next russia-eu summit on december 12 in brussels .
little understanding germany belongs to those eu member states which support a gradual relaxation of visa restrictions with russia .
foreign minister guido westerwelle made that clear at a meeting with his russian counterpart sergei lavrov on november 1 , stipulating that there were still many details the eu had to clear up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev has told eu leaders russia is ready to drop visa requirements thus berlin has shown little understanding for the most recent tightening of visa restrictions , and the foreign ministry stated it would not accept the restrictions without protest .
the bundestag also criticized russia 's move , with parliamentarian marina schuster of the foreign affairs committee saying she was " surprised that russia has taken this step , " which moved the process backwards .
" the goal should be for both sides to make advances toward visa freedom - and lavrov and westerwelle also discussed this , " she told deutsche welle .
quid pro quo however , hans-henning schroeder from the german institute for international and security affairs said russia 's tightening of visa restrictions was a completely normal diplomatic step .
" the schengen zone makes certain demands of russian applicants for visas , and now russia is simply making the same demands , " he said , referring to europe 's border-free travel area .
this may be bothersome , he added , but it is not unusual .
schroeder said one should not assume that the tighter visa requirements would have consequences for negotiations on visa-free travel .
" there wo n't be visa-free travel without compromises , " he said .
" rather it 's a negotiation process , and the russian side has to bring bargaining power to the table . "
a host of questions must still be resolved , on issues like border security or readmission agreements .
schroeder said ultimately the schengen states will hope to ensure that any ending of visa restrictions will not turn into a liability .

the german media and public are nearly as fascinated with the wedding of prince william and kate middleton as the british press is - almost surprisingly so for a european country with no royal court of its own . it did n't take long for the news of prince william and kate middleton 's engagement to spread .
as soon as the pair announced their plans on the morning of november 16 , a flurry of reports followed in the british media .
the international press soon caught up .
so why are the modern , information-oriented masses so fixated on the marriages of royal couples ?
after all , the wedding of sweden 's crown princess victoria to daniel westling on june 19 was reportedly watched by 1 billion people .
and why , for instance , are germans so interested in britain 's royalty ?
media expert jo grobel says it 's a simple matter of compensation .
" for one thing , in germany in particular there is still a slight desire and wistfulness with regards to royalty , " he told deutsche welle .
" seeing as how we no longer have our own royal court , we need the english to let us borrow a bit of theirs .
that way at least we have a kind of secondhand royal court . "
royal weddings also provide a contrast to the continuous news coverage of events such as crises , wars and catastrophes .
people want to see something positive in between , grobel says .
the british royal family carries with it a particular intrigue because it has been a source of inspiration for dramas and soap operas over generations .
the culminating dramatic stroke , of course , was the tragic demise of princess diana in 1997 .
" there is already speculation over whether or not kate middleton will be the next diana - whether or not she 'll also meet a tragic end .
in other words , it 's good entertainment , " grobel said .
fascination beyond national boundaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swedish royal wedding was watched by 1 billion people add in the fact that for the first time in 30 years , britain has an heir apparent who will marry - and to a non-royal at that - then one could almost see the royal family as an extraordinarily well-financed vehicle for manufacturing the sights and sounds the masses dream about .
" it has something to do with forming an identity , " grobel said .
" it has to do with the upkeep of tradition - even in those countries where the royal family is barely 200 years old .
we always imagine they 've been around forever .
that 's true in britain , but not in belgium or the netherlands . "
illusory or not , traditions grow around royal families and shape national identity in ways which elected politicians ca n't .
and that form of identity crosses national boundaries , too .
germans look to great britain and feel connected to an older form of european culture , something which plays a significant role as regional traditions change drastically .
according to grobel , people look for a basic paradox in royal weddings .
" even when it comes to royalty sometimes things get confusing , and it is n't always much better than in our homes and neighborhoods , " he said .
" both elements come together : the very everyday and banal , and the grandiose largesse of world history . "

" by reaching out and inviting russia to cooperate with us , i believe we also have a real chance to build a security roof for the entire euro-atlantic area . "
initial plans for a missile defense shield in eastern europe , led by the us , were met with considerable skepticism in moscow , with the kremlin often questioning whether the new network was designed to deal with potential attacks from countries like iran , or to target russia .
however , the russian stance has softened of late , with medvedev recently calling on nato to offer more concrete details on how a cooperative program might work .
" the fact that we are talking to russia about common threats and the chance to cooperate with russia on missile defense is an extremely important step , " german chancellor angela merkel said .
" that could be proof that the cold war has finally come to an end . "
us president barack obama also hailed the progress made on the defense shield , saying the planned network would be " strong enough to cover all nato european territory and populations , and the united states . "
a suggestion to tie the missile shield to nuclear disarmament by german foreign minister guido westerwelle , who wants the remaining us nuclear warheads stationed in germany removed as quickly as possible , was rebuffed by nuclear powers like the us and france , who argued that europe still needs a nuclear deterrent for the foreseeable future .
strategic concept for digital age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says the lisbon summit will go down in nato history nato leaders also settled on a new 10-year strategic concept for the 21st century , updating their last deal from 1999 .
" this summit will go down in nato history , " merkel said .
" the strategic concept is clear and open , and it shows that we are all working on the same foundation . "
the text of the new deal repeats the alliance 's core commitment for each member state to defend all the others , but is also meant to guide the 28 countries as they reform their armed forces and plan more joint operations over the next decade .
the alliance said it was trying to adapt to face more modern dangers to global security , with rasmussen mentioning threats like cyber attacks , terrorism and the political and social instability that can spill over from failing states .
" weak states halfway across the globe can have a direct impact on our security , " rasmussen said .
" they can be breeding grounds for terrorism , for drugs , for trafficking of weapons or people .
and afghanistan is an obvious case in point . "
the new strategic concept also called for closer cooperation with " any nations and relevant organizations across the globe that share our interest in peaceful international relations , " a statement apparently aimed in no small part at the european union .
nato and the eu have particularly fraught ties - despite an overwhelming overlap in terms of membership - because of the long-standing impasse between turkey , a nato member , and cyprus , an eu member , who trade vetoes on any proposals for greater cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai is in lisbon for tough talks afghanistan handover still slated for 2014 as nato members suffer increasing military losses in afghanistan , the alliance reiterated its desire to hand over security responsibilities to the administration in kabul by 2014 , amid claims from some nato and pentagon officials that this target might not be attainable .
" i see a role for troops after 2014 , but with a focus on training security forces , " rasmussen said .
the nato secretary general said the transition process would begin next year , and that he considered the 2014 deadline " realistic . "
president obama is set to have private talks with his afghan counterpart hamid karzai at the lisbon summit on saturday , after a period of rather tense relations between the two administrations .
obama has also called for a move towards reconciliation with parts of the taliban in the country , as nato forces struggle to make inroads against the insurgency there .
germany is the third largest contributor to the mission in afghanistan , although most polls show the engagement is unpopular among the german public .
the two-day summit in lisbon is set to close on saturday evening .
local security forces in the portuguese capital have been on high alert over fears of protests or demonstrations , but the atmosphere so far in the city has been largely calm .

cooperation with civilian authorities is said to be a core principle . the roman catholic church has announced that it 's working on a new set of guidelines for bishops on preventing and responding to cases of abuse by clerics .
about three quarters of the world 's catholic cardinals converged at the vatican friday to hold a rare gathering discussing this issue , as well as religious freedom and accepting converts from the anglican church .
cardinal william levada , the head of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith - the body in charge of church dogma - led the closed-door discussions , and later issued a statement promising a " coordinated and effective program " of response and prevention that would involve " greater responsibility of bishops for the protection of faithful entrusted to them . "
levada also spoke to the participants about " cooperation with civilian authorities , the need for an effective protection of children and young people , and a careful selection of future priests . "
the vatican described the meeting as " a day of prayer and reflection " on a number of challenges facing the catholic church .
the church has been struggling to deal with repeated scandals across much of europe - including germany - and the us , over hundreds of cases of sexual abuse of children and young people by priests that were subsequently covered up by higher ranking members of the clergy .
critics not satisfied with ' symbolic gestures ' victims of sexual abuse staged protests in rome to coincide with the meeting , and have said the vatican is not doing enough to protect children from future abuse , or to investigate past cases .
" we did n't have high hopes for this meeting , because these church officials are the same men who ignored and concealed , " a us-based victims abuse group , survivors network of those abused by priests -lrb- snap -rrb- , said in a statement after the meeting .
" we want the bishops to turn over to police and prosecutors the personnel files of proven , admitted and credibly accused child-molesting clerics , " snap 's barbara blaine said , describing the vatican 's proposals as " symbolic gestures . "
german cardinal walter kasper , however , praised the meeting , saying it had encouraged catholic bishops around the world " to continue to fight this evil . "

he has promised that football 's governing body will turn over a new leaf . fifa president sepp blatter has said that a " new fifa " would choose the venues for the 2018 and 2022 world cups , after corruption allegations forced world soccer 's governing body to ban two members of the executive committee that will elect the host countries on december 2 .
" it is with a large amount of optimism that i am looking forward to this decisive date , " blatter told reporters in a press conference responding to thursday 's verdict from the fifa ethics committee .
blatter also said " all doubts have been cast aside " with regard to the credibility of the vote , and that no further corruption cases would come to light in the mean time .
a total of six officials received bans and fines on thursday , after undercover reporters for the british newspaper sunday times posed as us lobbyists and secretly filmed the fifa representatives either offering to sell their influence or talking about corruption in the organization .
executive committee members amos adamu of nigeria and reynald temarii of tahiti were the most high profile casualties , as both were among the panel of 24 people scheduled to influence where the 2018 and 2022 world cups would take place .
adamu was banned from football activity for three years and fined 10,000 swiss francs -lrb- $ 10,050/7,370 euros -rrb- , while temarii was banned for one year and fined 5,000 swiss francs .
" now we have to have a look at how to act in the future to avoid such situations .
definitely this is an item which is now under scrutiny , " blatter told assembled reporters at the fifa headquarters in zurich .
fifa blasts reporters for ' entrapment ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amos adamu and reynald temarii have been given bans and fines blatter also reserved criticism , however , for the sunday times reports that led to the sanctions - following in the footsteps of fifa 's ethics committee chairman , claudio sulser , who lambasted the paper in the initial ruling on thursday - saying the reporters had not been playing fair .
" it gave us the opportunity to clean a little bit of whatever has to be cleaned , " blatter said .
" but i can not say it is very fair when you open traps , " the president added , saying the reporting amounted to " entrapment of people . "
speaking to deutsche welle , jens sejer andersen , the head of the sports ethics organization play the game - which has been campaigning for the introduction of a world body that oversees the dealings of organizations like fifa or the international olympic committee - said he was baffled by the criticisms directed at the undercover journalism from fifa 's ethics committee chairman claudio sulser .
" he expressed , almost , that he would have liked to be able to ban the sunday times too .
this is a paradox .
without the information , there would have been no process and no members would have been banned , " said andersen .
" if sulser , the chairman of the ethics committee , thinks that the sunday times did twist the facts , how can he then use the report as a basis for sanctions against six leading fifa officials ? " he asked .
if sulser is correct and the report was skewed , he argues , then the officials would surely have a good chance at appeal .
both executive committee members , adamu and temarii , say they intend to appeal the verdict , but their cases will not be heard before the world cup decision in december .
" fifa , in reality , does not like investigative journalism .
they claim they do , but i think they only like the kind of investigative journalism that does not hurt anybody , " andersen said .
the criticism of the sunday times article has prompted concerns in britain , which is considered one of the strong candidates for the 2018 world cup bid .
fears that the perceived muckraking might cost the english bid votes among other executive committee members have only been exacerbated by the bbc 's plans to air an extended 30-minute expose on fifa 's shadier side just days before the organization meets to decide the would-be hosts ' fate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many countries have invested millions in the outcome of the december 2 decision the collusion problem for fifa , this week 's positive headline was that the ethics committee did not find sufficient evidence that representatives of the 2018 spain / portugal bid and the 2022 qatar bid had colluded and agreed to vote reciprocally . however , the soccer authority has admitted that holding its first ever dual decision on world cup hosting was a mistake , and encouraged the interested parties to form alliances .
" you can not avoid collusion but if there should be something wrong in such collusion , then naturally somebody should intervene , " blatter said .
" you find collusion in politics , in elections , when two parties are enemies during the year , and then they run together . "
in reality , most major sporting decisions in organizations like fifa or the ioc are motivated , at least in part , by some kind of horse trading anyway - but placing two world cup votes side-by-side gave the parties bidding for the world cup a rather unique opportunity and motive to seal a particularly worthwhile deal .
" taking into account that several very big countries - russia , spain / portugal , england , holland / belgium , the united states , qatar - many countries have collectively invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the bidding campaign , i think that the taxpayers in these countries absolutely expect that the process of selecting the host countries is objective , transparent and fair , " play the game 's andersen said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president sepp blatter wants to move on from the corruption controversy can fifa change ?
for andersen , the problem is that sports , and especially soccer , are beginning to outgrow the old institutions established to govern them in an age when very little money was involved .
" over the past 30 years , sports has become a global entertainment industry worth billions and billions of dollars .
yet it 's still the same structures , associations , almost familial structures , that handle all these revenues , without much - or any - control , " he said .
fifa is one of many sporting authorities based in switzerland , where it enjoys a string of special exemptions from disclosure laws that would apply to most swiss businesses or charities .
andersen notes that both fifa and the swiss government have made modest improvements in recent years , but also believes the organization will not be able to truly deliver on blatter 's promise of a " new fifa " until tighter external oversight is introduced to actively discourage corruption .
" oscar wilde 's saying ' i can resist anything , except temptation ' applies to sports officials , just like the rest of us , " he said .

chancellor merkel has said this would mark the definitive end of the cold war . nato leaders sought to entice russia into collaborating on a missile defense shield at the alliance 's annual summit in lisbon , ahead of russian president dmitry medvedev 's arrival on saturday .
" missile defense will bind the nato allies closer together , " nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen , who visited moscow earlier this month , said at the summit .
" by reaching out and inviting russia to cooperate with us , i believe we also have a real chance to build a security roof for the entire euro-atlantic area . "
initial plans for a missile defense shield in eastern europe , led by the us , were met with considerable skepticism in moscow , with the kremlin often questioning whether the new network was designed to deal with potential attacks from countries like iran , or to target russia .
however , the russian stance has softened of late , with medvedev recently calling on nato to offer more concrete details on how a cooperative program might work .
" the fact that we are talking to russia about common threats and the chance to cooperate with russia on missile defense is an extremely important step , " german chancellor angela merkel said .
" that could be proof that the cold war has finally come to an end . "
us president barack obama also hailed the progress made on the defense shield , saying the planned network would be " strong enough to cover all nato european territory and populations , and the united states . "
a suggestion to tie the missile shield to nuclear disarmament by german foreign minister guido westerwelle , who wants the remaining us nuclear warheads stationed in germany removed as quickly as possible , was rebuffed by nuclear powers like the us and france , who argued that europe still needs a nuclear deterrent for the foreseeable future .
strategic concept for digital age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says the lisbon summit will go down in nato history nato leaders also settled on a new 10-year strategic concept for the 21st century , updating their last deal from 1999 .
" this summit will go down in nato history , " merkel said .
" the strategic concept is clear and open , and it shows that we are all working on the same foundation . "
the text of the new deal repeats the alliance 's core commitment for each member state to defend all the others , but is also meant to guide the 28 countries as they reform their armed forces and plan more joint operations over the next decade .
the alliance said it was trying to adapt to face more modern dangers to global security , with rasmussen mentioning threats like cyber attacks , terrorism and the political and social instability that can spill over from failing states .
" weak states halfway across the globe can have a direct impact on our security , " rasmussen said .
" they can be breeding grounds for terrorism , for drugs , for trafficking of weapons or people .
and afghanistan is an obvious case in point . "
the new strategic concept also called for closer cooperation with " any nations and relevant organizations across the globe that share our interest in peaceful international relations , " a statement apparently aimed in no small part at the european union .
nato and the eu have particularly fraught ties - despite an overwhelming overlap in terms of membership - because of the long-standing impasse between turkey , a nato member , and cyprus , an eu member , who trade vetoes on any proposals for greater cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai is in lisbon for tough talks afghanistan handover still slated for 2014 as nato members suffer increasing military losses in afghanistan , the alliance reiterated its desire to hand over security responsibilities to the administration in kabul by 2014 , amid claims from some nato and pentagon officials that this target might not be attainable .
" i see a role for troops after 2014 , but with a focus on training security forces , " rasmussen said .
the nato secretary general said the transition process would begin next year , and that he considered the 2014 deadline " realistic . "
president obama is set to have private talks with his afghan counterpart hamid karzai at the lisbon summit on saturday , after a period of rather tense relations between the two administrations .
obama has also called for a move towards reconciliation with parts of the taliban in the country , as nato forces struggle to make inroads against the insurgency there .
germany is the third largest contributor to the mission in afghanistan , although most polls show the engagement is unpopular among the german public .
the two-day summit in lisbon is set to close on saturday evening .
local security forces in the portuguese capital have been on high alert over fears of protests or demonstrations , but the atmosphere so far in the city has been largely calm .

the german media and public are nearly as fascinated with the wedding of prince william and kate middleton as the british press is - almost surprisingly so for a european country with no royal court of its own . it did n't take long for the news of prince william and kate middleton 's engagement to spread .
as soon as the pair announced their plans on the morning of november 16 , a flurry of reports followed in the british media .
the international press soon caught up .
so why are the modern , information-oriented masses so fixated on the marriages of royal couples ?
after all , the wedding of sweden 's crown princess victoria to daniel westling on june 19 was reportedly watched by 1 billion people .
and why , for instance , are germans so interested in britain 's royalty ?
media expert jo grobel says it 's a simple matter of compensation .
" for one thing , in germany in particular there is still a slight desire and wistfulness with regards to royalty , " he told deutsche welle .
" seeing as how we no longer have our own royal court , we need the english to let us borrow a bit of theirs .
that way at least we have a kind of secondhand royal court . "
royal weddings also provide a contrast to the continuous news coverage of events such as crises , wars and catastrophes .
people want to see something positive in between , grobel says .
the british royal family carries with it a particular intrigue because it has been a source of inspiration for dramas and soap operas over generations .
the culminating dramatic stroke , of course , was the tragic demise of princess diana in 1997 .
" there is already speculation over whether or not kate middleton will be the next diana - whether or not she 'll also meet a tragic end .
in other words , it 's good entertainment , " grobel said .
fascination beyond national boundaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swedish royal wedding was watched by 1 billion people add in the fact that for the first time in 30 years , britain has an heir apparent who will marry - and to a non-royal at that - then one could almost see the royal family as an extraordinarily well-financed vehicle for manufacturing the sights and sounds the masses dream about .
" it has something to do with forming an identity , " grobel said .
" it has to do with the upkeep of tradition - even in those countries where the royal family is barely 200 years old .
we always imagine they 've been around forever .
that 's true in britain , but not in belgium or the netherlands . "
illusory or not , traditions grow around royal families and shape national identity in ways which elected politicians ca n't .
and that form of identity crosses national boundaries , too .
germans look to great britain and feel connected to an older form of european culture , something which plays a significant role as regional traditions change drastically .
according to grobel , people look for a basic paradox in royal weddings .
" even when it comes to royalty sometimes things get confusing , and it is n't always much better than in our homes and neighborhoods , " he said .
" both elements come together : the very everyday and banal , and the grandiose largesse of world history . "

successful in sentencing a group of key personalities of the nazi party , they inspired a series of further trials all aimed at punishing the war criminals of the third reich . the trials , which began on november 20 , 1945 , in the bavarian city of nuremberg , were a new type of event on the world stage .
it was the first time an international tribunal had sought to sentence the leaders of a regime - politicians , army officers and economic advisors - even though in some cases direct responsibility for specific criminal acts could not be attributed to them . as a group , they were seen as initiators , aides , organizers and executers of crimes against humanity .
they were accused of orchestrating wars of aggression , murdering civilians and prisoners of war , deporting people , plundering , engaging in racial persecution , murdering european jews and occupying numerous european countries . however , all these accusations had little impact on the nazis in the courtroom , who did not see themselves as responsible for the listed crimes .
not a single one plead guilty . a combined international effort the judges for the trials came from the united states , the soviet union , france and great britain and were appointed by their governments for this role . the chief prosecutor was robert jackson from the united states , and his assistant chief counsel was german-jewish lawyer robert kempner , who had been stripped of his german citizenship by the nazis before world war ii and had immigrated to the united states .
" when i began to work on this matter in america in 1942 , my american colleagues asked me , ' is this all true ?
can we prove it ? " ' recalled kempner .
" and i said , ' we can prove this 100 percent . " '
the trials lasted 218 days , with 236 witnesses questioned , 5,330 documents and 200,000 statements submitted as evidence and 25,000 pages of protocol written .
the hearings shed light on the dimensions of the nazi regime 's crimes . the verdicts came out on september 30 and october 1 , 1946 : seven imprisonments , 12 death sentences and three acquittals . bildunterschrift : the 218 days of trials produced various sentences and 25,000 pages of protocol inspiration for further trials the first round of trials was followed by 12 others .
these were aimed at nazi medical doctors , lawyers , soldiers and even companies such as flick - an industrial conglomerate that supported the nazi party .
flick profited from the liquidation of jewish property , assisted hitler 's rearmament efforts and used slave laborers from concentration camps .
the german population and its attitude towards the nazi era were largely unaffected by the trials .
they were seen as an arbitrary act of the winning side and it was not long before the government of the newly-formed federal republic of germany , together with party and church representatives , pleaded for clemency on behalf of the convicted persons . some death sentences were turned into prison sentences , and there were some early releases .
some of the accused got the chance to resume their interrupted careers .
despite some of these sentences being overturned , the trials left a lasting impression on the world . the creation of the international military tribunal has served as a model for other tribunals , including the hague in the netherlands - for trying crimes committed during the balkan wars - and the international military tribunal for the far east , which tried japanese officials for crimes against peace and against humanity . the trials also significantly influenced the development of international criminal law , serving as models for conventions such as the 1948 convention on genocide . author : cornelia rabitz / ew editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

successful in sentencing a group of key personalities of the nazi party , they inspired a series of further trials all aimed at punishing the war criminals of the third reich . the trials , which began on november 20 , 1945 , in the bavarian city of nuremberg , were a new type of event on the world stage .
it was the first time an international tribunal had sought to sentence the leaders of a regime - politicians , army officers and economic advisors - even though in some cases direct responsibility for specific criminal acts could not be attributed to them . as a group , they were seen as initiators , aides , organizers and executers of crimes against humanity .
they were accused of orchestrating wars of aggression , murdering civilians and prisoners of war , deporting people , plundering , engaging in racial persecution , murdering european jews and occupying numerous european countries . however , all these accusations had little impact on the nazis in the courtroom , who did not see themselves as responsible for the listed crimes .
not a single one plead guilty . a combined international effort the judges for the trials came from the united states , the soviet union , france and great britain and were appointed by their governments for this role . the chief prosecutor was robert jackson from the united states , and his assistant chief counsel was german-jewish lawyer robert kempner , who had been stripped of his german citizenship by the nazis before world war ii and had immigrated to the united states .
" when i began to work on this matter in america in 1942 , my american colleagues asked me , ' is this all true ?
can we prove it ? " ' recalled kempner .
" and i said , ' we can prove this 100 percent . " '
the trials lasted 218 days , with 236 witnesses questioned , 5,330 documents and 200,000 statements submitted as evidence and 25,000 pages of protocol written .
the hearings shed light on the dimensions of the nazi regime 's crimes . the verdicts came out on september 30 and october 1 , 1946 : seven imprisonments , 12 death sentences and three acquittals . bildunterschrift : the 218 days of trials produced various sentences and 25,000 pages of protocol inspiration for further trials the first round of trials was followed by 12 others .
these were aimed at nazi medical doctors , lawyers , soldiers and even companies such as flick - an industrial conglomerate that supported the nazi party .
flick profited from the liquidation of jewish property , assisted hitler 's rearmament efforts and used slave laborers from concentration camps .
the german population and its attitude towards the nazi era were largely unaffected by the trials .
they were seen as an arbitrary act of the winning side and it was not long before the government of the newly-formed federal republic of germany , together with party and church representatives , pleaded for clemency on behalf of the convicted persons . some death sentences were turned into prison sentences , and there were some early releases .
some of the accused got the chance to resume their interrupted careers .
despite some of these sentences being overturned , the trials left a lasting impression on the world . the creation of the international military tribunal has served as a model for other tribunals , including the hague in the netherlands - for trying crimes committed during the balkan wars - and the international military tribunal for the far east , which tried japanese officials for crimes against peace and against humanity . the trials also significantly influenced the development of international criminal law , serving as models for conventions such as the 1948 convention on genocide . author : cornelia rabitz / ew editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
